5|$|A {{museum was}} opened inside the {{preserved}} building {{to mark the}} 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15, 1991. The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects, and the lower floor contains thematic exhibitions. The house, built in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was thoroughly renovated before {{the opening of the}} museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait is now <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the building.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cluyme gave a {{perceptible}} start. He {{glanced at}} <b>the</b> heavy <b>hangings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windows {{and then out}} of the open door into the hall. For a space his wife's chatter to Mrs. Brace, on Boston fashions, filled the room.|$|R

5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely <b>hanging</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The I&R platoon {{members who}} were able to walk were sent to Germany. James was so seriously wounded he couldn't speak. He and Kalil, who was also seriously wounded, were loaded onto trucks and {{eventually}} put aboard trains. Bouck was jammed into a single railroad cattle car with 71 others POWs and traveled for days without food or water. By Christmas Day, seven men in Bouck's car had died and the rest were barely <b>hanging</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> prisoners were transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover. McConnell, also wounded, ended up like James in Stalag XI-B near Bad Fallingbostel, the most primitive POW camp in Germany. Bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in Stalag XIII-D in Nuremberg and later in Stalag XIII-C in Hammelberg, where the non-commissioned and enlisted men were split, with the officers sent to Oflag XIII-B. Hammelberg was designed for 300 prisoners, but it soon housed more than 1500 POWs.|$|E

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in an Ultimate X match, which {{involved}} A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin, and the champion, Petey Williams, who {{was accompanied by}} Coach D'Amore. D'Amore was banned from ringside in the opening minutes of the contest. Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes, each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cell wall, {{revealing}} a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.|$|E

The restrooms are also located here, as well as storage for some concession supplies.|$|R
25|$|The last public <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island {{happened}} in its courtyard. It has been visited by four U.S. presidents, {{and three of}} them actually gave a speech from the City Hall's front balcony: Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt. George H. W. Bush visited, as well.|$|E
25|$|After {{its three}} months <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hjell, {{the fish is}} then matured for another {{two to three months}} indoors in a dry and airy environment. During the drying, about 80% of the water in the fish evaporates. The {{stockfish}} retains all the nutrients from the fresh fish, only concentrated: it is therefore rich in proteins, vitamins, iron, and calcium.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{cause of the}} species decline is climate change. In December 2006, over three hundred dead or dying bats were {{on the floor of}} Bat Cave, with other emaciated individuals still <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. The cause of this mortality was attributed to lack of insects due to drought, in addition to a record number of cold nights that further suppressed insect activity.|$|E

25|$|He did, and the hobgoblin left. The next morning, its cap was {{discovered}} <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> church's bell tower. In attempting {{to get it}} back, the hobgoblin became imprisoned in the tower, and all succeeding spires. He will remain so, the legend says, {{as long as the}} church remains on consecrated ground. Stories claim that a small painter has been seen at work on the steeple during lightning flashes. His moans during Sunday services were mistaken for worshippers snoring.|$|E
25|$|Through their {{performance}} {{they try to}} attract attention to themselves, and more importantly, to the advertising signs and banners they are carrying. These may be boards <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the performers or banners and flags hanging from large poles {{on the back of}} the performers. Some even carried umbrellas with advertising messages. They advertise for new shops, special sales in shops, the opening of a gaming parlor or pachinko parlors, or for cabarets. They may also distribute flyers.|$|E
5000|$|Gibbet Island is {{an island}} of Bermuda. It {{is located at the}} mouth of Flatt's Inlet which leads to Harrington Sound. Its name arises from the fact that runaway slaves were gibbetted, or hung here as punishment. Flatt's inlet was not a major {{shipping}} route so the reason for hanging the slaves here was not for the benefit of incoming vessels but instead because locals didn't want to have <b>hangings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mainland due to superstition.|$|R
5000|$|The legendary Bean {{would have}} hanged {{a man for}} the {{slightest}} infraction of [...] "his laws", {{but there are no}} <b>hangings</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> family-oriented series. The storekeeper role is stressed more than that of the bartender. Bean's Langtry is not named for the English actress Lillie Langtry, who visited there after Bean's death. Instead, Langtry is named for George Langtry, an engineer and foreman of the Southern Pacific Railroad who had supervised a Chinese work crew there.|$|R
50|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was directed by Brian Lazzaro and has Nichols <b>hanging</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach with his love interest.|$|R
25|$|During this period, Stieglitz met Marius de Zayas, an {{energetic}} and charismatic artist from Mexico, who {{became one of}} his closest colleagues, assisting both with shows at the gallery and with introducing Stieglitz to new artists in Europe. As Stieglitz’s reputation as a promoter of European modern art increased, he soon was approached by several new American artists hoping to have their works shown. Stieglitz was intrigued by their modern vision, within months Alfred Maurer, John Marin and Marsden Hartley all had their works <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls of 291.|$|E
25|$|A {{photograph}} taken in 1988, also depicting British Prime Minister David Cameron, {{this time in}} the centre of the group, later emerged. It was found by the student newspaper, VERSA, amongst over a dozen other photographs of the club dated between 1950 and 2010 <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall of the tailor that is believed to have made the members’ suits, and led to a number of other past members being identified. Gillman and Soame, the photographers who own the copyright to the image, withdrew permission for it to be reproduced. VERSA, which discovered the photographs, commissioned sketches to reproduce the scenes depicted in them.|$|E
25|$|Banda was {{the subject}} of an {{extensive}} cult of personality. Every business building was required to have an official picture of him <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, and no poster, clock or picture could be higher than his portrait. Before every film, a video of Banda waving to the people was shown while the anthem played. When Banda visited a city, a contingent of women were expected to greet him at the airport and dance for him. A special cloth, bearing the president's picture, was the required attire for these performances. Houses of worship required government approval to operate, and some faiths such as Jehovah's Witnesses were banned entirely.|$|E
