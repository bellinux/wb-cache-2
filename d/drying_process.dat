5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a <b>drying</b> <b>process</b> which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the <b>drying</b> <b>process.</b> After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E

As a result, xerogels cannot achieve the high porosities and instead peak at lower porosities and exhibit large amounts of shrinkage after drying.|$|E

Four PEM mixtures were used: rubberized PEM in <b>dry</b> <b>process,</b> rubberized PEM in wet process, rubberized PEM with terminal blend binder, and control styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) modified PEM. Dynamic modulus and direct tension fatigue tests were performed with an asphalt mixture performance tester system.

However, the 10 % CRM or 4. 5 % TOR used in the study could not make rubberized PEMs produce longer fatigue life like the control SBS modified PEM.

25|$|Adding {{as little}} as 10-15% shell temper created an {{excellent}} pottery paste that was lighter, stronger and more able to withstand the <b>drying</b> <b>process,</b> and the clay's originally high plasticity was subdued. The calcium carbonate of the freshwater mussels also acts as a binding agent and created a stronger vessel. Thinner coils to make thinner walled vessel were a natural consequence. As the potter was probably also the cook, she was now able to construct a more effective cooking pot. Thinner walls allowed heat to transfer to the food more effectively. A round vessel bottom allows easy stirring of the contents, a more even dissipation of the cooking heat and also permits a more even dispersion of the shock of impacts reducing breakage.|$|E
25|$|When {{the pasta}} leaves the dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12% which helps the pasta to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. <b>Drying</b> <b>process</b> is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to lose the excess moisture in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and {{one third of the}} excess moisture is lost in this stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>process</b> method This paper {{provides}} an overview of crumb rubber modified asphalt mixtures with particular reference to the <b>dry</b> <b>process.</b> The <b>dry</b> <b>process</b> involves the blending of crumb rubber with hot aggregates prior to mixing with bitumen. In comparison to the wet process (process of incorporating crumb rubber into bitumen prior to mixing with aggregates), this mixture type has a number technical issues. The lack of standards and inconsistent performance have resulted in scepticism among practitioners and researchers in accepting the <b>dry</b> <b>process</b> for rubber modification even though {{it has the potential to}} recycle more crumb rubber compared to the wet process. This has resulted in the overwhelming majority of asphalt paving projects involving crumb rubber using the wet process. Therefore, to better understand the mixture, details pertaining to dry mixed rubberised asphalt are discussed in this paper with sufficient information from previous research. The discussions highlight several critical issues regarding its modification concept (the function and behaviour of rubber particles within the mixture), mixture design criteria and mechanical performance of this mixture type. This is necessary in order to identify the factors that play a significant role in improving the mixtures properties for future studies. Additionally, the review will be...|$|R

In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard.

[...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, {{particularly when it comes}} to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of [...] "curly" [...] (aka [...] "flame"/"fiddleback") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry.
