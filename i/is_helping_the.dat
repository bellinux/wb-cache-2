She confides in Dean that, unlike other demons, she still remembers {{what it is like to}} be human, citing this trait as the reason she <b>is</b> <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> brothers against other demons. She returns in [...] "Jus in Bello" [...] to save the brothers from an attacking horde of demons. Upon learning that they have lost the Colt, she decides to perform a spell that will destroy all the demons in the area, including herself. However, because the spell requires a human virgin's heart, Dean does not allow her to perform it.

500|$|Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{is trying}} to get the Doctor's (Matt Smith) {{attention}} while he fixes the TARDIS. She discovers that her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) <b>is</b> <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through [...] "emergency materialisation" [...] which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The lights come on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room— the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks through the door of the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly walks back into the control room through the door of the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a [...] "space loop" [...] and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, [...] "Okay, kids, this is where it gets complicated." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{this episode}} was to feature the {{recurring}} character Shannon McMahon. However, actress Lucy Lawless became pregnant shortly after filming the two-part episode, [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today" [...] {{and was not}} available for subsequent episodes. Actress Julia Vera {{was called in to}} play the role of the woman who <b>is</b> <b>helping</b> <b>the</b> Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins. Vera had previously appeared in the sixth season two-part episode [...] "Dreamland". She later called the opportunity [...] "amazing" [...] and declared that [...] "my greatest experience was The X-Files". The final scene of the episode was originally going to feature the Toothpick Man, the alien leader of the New Syndicate played by Alan Dale, informing U.S. President George W. Bush, played by actor Gary Newton, of Mulder's escape. The scene was filmed, but was not included in the broadcast version; executive producer Frank Spotnitz later said that he was [...] "so happy" [...] that the producers cut the scene, noting that—despite [...] "a lot of debate about it, on both sides"—the scene was unable to top the final scene with Mulder and Scully. On the DVD's audio commentary, the producers mentioned that they had considered filming the shot on the Oval Office set created by The West Wing, a serial drama created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC. In addition, they originally wanted to have Martin Sheen appear as his character on The West Wing, Josiah Bartlet, instead of Bush, noting that the cameo would have been [...] "a nice, sort of wink" [...] to the television audience. Despite being cut from the final episode, the shot was featured as a deleted scene on the season nine video release.|$|E
