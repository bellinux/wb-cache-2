40|$|The African Initiated Churches (AICs) are the {{custodians}} of the African Traditional Religion (ATR). In the South African census, the AICs {{are classified}} as Christian. Africans claim that long before the Christian faith came through missionaries there was some form of worship of God by Africans. This means Africans practiced ATR outside Christianity and after Christianity came through missionaries, they started practising it as Christians One of the reasons given for the Africans {{moving out of the}} missionary churches to start their own was a search for an African identity. There was a hunger for a place where the African culture could be accommodated. One of the features of African culture is the worship of ancestors. The question of monotheism encountering polytheism does arise in this kind of discussion. The doctrine of the Trinity is uniquely Christian. There is a historical background concerning the teaching and the foundation thereof. As the AICs responded to a situation, so did the Early Church Fathers who faced question of monotheism encountering polytheism. There was a need to <b>redefine</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism</b> within the Christian faith in reference to the event of Jesus Christ. The Church Fathers struggled to defend and grappled with the Christian faith with reference to the scriptures in the light of Jesus Christ. They took the gospel from the Jewish setting into the Greek setting. Their efforts benefited the church throughout history. One may say the writings and the teachings of the early church stood the test of time. One may also say the writings and the teachings were based on the solid foundation being of Jesus Christ and the authority of the scriptures. Juxtaposition is the approach employed in this thesis. Two traditions are being critically assessed based on the notion of Perichoresis by the Cappadocian Church Fathers and the notion of Ubuntu in the ATR. Chapter one deals with the theological background with specific focus on the African church and contextualisation. Chapter two, deals with the debate concerning the position and nature of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. It also investigates the origin of the Nicene Creed. Chapter three investigates the terminology within the doctrine of the Trinity, while Chapter four explores the term ecumenical and communion with reference to Ubuntu. Chapter five analyses the work of Zizioulas, and the conclusion attempts to find an appropriate approach for the African church. Therefore the study concludes that the reference for Ubuntu should be found in the relationship with God through Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit and not in the veneration and worship of the ancestors. The benefits of the relationship with God through Jesus supersede all other relationship with any deity in the now and the future. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

5000|$|The stern {{character}} of <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism</b> prevented {{the rise of}} hero-worship, without which real epic poetry is impossible. Spanish crypto-Jew, Antonio Enríquez Gómez {{is probably one of}} the first Jewish authors of whom an epic is known (Sansón Nazareno: Poema heróico, a Spanish-language heroic epic version of the Samson story), followed closely by Solomon de Oliveira's epic ("Elat Ahabim," [...] Amsterdam, 1665). The first to produce an epic poem was N. H. Wessely with his Mosaide [...] "Shire Tif'eret" [...] (Berlin, 1789-1802), an epic on the Exodus from Egypt. The influence of a similar work by the German poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock is evident. Next to him stands Shalom Kohn with his [...] "Ner David", an epic poem on King David (Vienna, 1834). The influence of these two epics on the readers and poets of that time was considerable.|$|R
2500|$|In {{its early}} 12th-century dissemination, Kabbalah {{received}} criticism from some rabbis, who adhered to chakirah, for its alleged introduction of multiplicity into <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism.</b> The seeming plurality of the One God {{is a result}} of the spiritual evolution of God's light, which introduced a multiplicity of emanations from the one infinite Divine essence. This was necessary due to the inability of mankind to exist in God's infinite presence. [...] God does not change; rather, it is our ability to perceive His emanations that is modified. This is stressed in Kabbalah in order to avoid heretical notions of any plurality in the Godhead. One parable to explain this is the difference between the [...] "Ma'Ohr" [...] ("Luminary"-Divine essence) and the [...] "Ohr" [...] ("Light") He emanates, like the difference between the single body of the sun and the multiple rays of sunlight that illuminate a room.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Hadrian {{intended}} to assimilate the Jewish Temple into the civic-religious basis of support to his reign, {{as he had done}} with Greek and other traditional places of worship. It has also been ventured that Hadrian attempted to unify all belief systems in his empire as a coherent whole that would serve as a basis of support for his autocratic legitimacy - a project that had already been devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo. The neighbouring Samaritans had already undergone such a process of Hellenisation and religious syncretism, integrating their religious rites with Hellenistic ones. Hadrian probably sanctioned this Hellenised Samaritan worship when, after the suppression of the Jewish revolt, he built a temple to the Hellenistic (and probably syncretic) god Zeus Hypsistos ("Highest") on Mount Gerizim. This attempt at conciliation between Judaism and Hellenism foundered when faced with strict <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism.</b> Therefore, the Romans appear to have been surprised by the outbreak of the uprising.|$|R

He is perhaps most well known for his studies on the early emergence of a devotion to Jesus expressed in beliefs about Jesus sharing God's glory, and in a [...] "devotional pattern" [...] in which Jesus features prominently. Hurtado has argued that this Jesus-devotion comprises a novel [...] "mutation" [...] in ancient Jewish monotheistic practice. In his most recent publications, he has also urged greater awareness of the historical value of earliest Christian manuscripts as key physical artifacts of early Christianity, drawing attention to such phenomena as the nomina sacra (distinctive abbreviated forms of certain Greek words, e.g., Theos, Iesous, Kyrios, Christos), the Christian preference for the codex bookform, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|R

The governor of Roman Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year. Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order. However, only Caligula's death at the hands of Roman conspirators in 41 CE prevented a full-scale war in Judaea, that might have well spread to the entire Eastern Roman Empire.|$|R
