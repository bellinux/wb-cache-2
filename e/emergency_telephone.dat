25|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> {{number is}} a special case in the country's telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone</b> number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though {{with the advent of}} electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone</b> number, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.|$|E
