2500|$|Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, {{has been}} {{classified}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The {{findings of the}} IARC {{are based on the}} discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation. The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations <b>during</b> <b>packing,</b> milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer. The safety of the use of nano-particle sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized. Studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice. The mechanism by which [...] may cause cancer is unclear. Molecular research suggests that cell cytotoxicity due to [...] results from the interaction between [...] nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment, independently of the known apoptotic signalling pathways.|$|E

The discrepancy in microstructural development between the metal/metal contact interface and the metal/roll contact interface was of particular concern. The {{results showed that the}} microstructures of the two interfaces underwent different evolution routes due to different imposed strains. From the statistical microstructural information such as crystal defect density and grain size, it can be concluded that the microstructure of the metal/metal contact interface exhibited more stable <b>during</b> <b>pack</b> rolling than that of the metal/roll interface.|$|R

30|$|Microstructural {{stability}} {{is an important}} issue for nanocrystalline materials to be practically used in many fields. The present work shows how microstructure evolves with rolling strain in pre-annealed electrodeposited nanocrystalline nickel containing an initial strong fiber texture, on the basis of X-ray diffraction line profile analysis as well as transmission electron microscopy observation. The influence of shear strain on microstructural stability of the metal/roll contact interface is compared with that of the metal/metal contact interface; the latter would be closer to deformation in plane strain compression. From the statistical microstructural information, together with experimentally observed microstructure of deformed grains after the final rolling pass, it seems fair to conclude that the microstructure of the metal/metal contact interface is more stable <b>during</b> <b>pack</b> rolling than that of the metal/roll interface.|$|R

50|$|This {{happens with}} the popular {{throw-out}} deployment system where the pilot chute does not pull the pin and open the container or once opened does not exert enough force to extract the deployment bag from the container. It {{can be caused by}} pilot chutes with kill lines that have not been cocked <b>during</b> <b>packing</b> or where the kill line has shrunk through use and reduces the drag of the pilot chute. It can be caused by a mis-routed pilot chute bridle. It can also be caused by too large a deployment bag and canopy for the container, although deployment bags should be matched to the containers. The correct procedure with this malfunction is to deploy the reserve from a stable belly down position. If time permits, the skydiver might first attempt to bump their container to dislodge a trapped deployment bag. If this malfunction is temporary and clears, it is called a pilot chute hesitation.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{one or more}} BASIC09 {{procedures}} are debugged to the programmer's satisfaction, they can be [...] "packed" [...] (or converted permanently to the I-code (i.e., bytecode) form) into a file. Among other things, line numbers, comments and names of local variables are discarded <b>during</b> <b>packing,</b> so that, unlike the typical interpreted BASICs of the time, comments and intelligible variable names incur no runtime cost and were therefore not a 'burden' programmers learned to avoid to maximize runtime execution time or memory efficiency. For the BASIC09 releases intended for the OS-9 operating systems, [...] "packed" [...] {{procedures are}} in fact OS-9 modules; the OS-9 shell recognizes them as I-code and automatically calls the RunB interpreter to execute them. RunB avoids much of the runtime overhead found in typical interpreted BASICs of the day—not to mention that one can do integer calculations where appropriate rather than doing everything in floating point—so that BASIC09 programs run extremely quickly in comparison with equivalent programs in the interpreted BASICs of the time. RunB was also smaller than nearly every other BASIC interpreter package of even remotely comparable capabilities.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The processing technique described the incorporation of the preshaped “wax-bolus” <b>during</b> <b>packing</b> procedure of the Obturtor prosthesis and eliminated later by melting it once the curing procedure is completed. Results: This article is a single step procedure resulting into the closed-hollow obturator as single unit with uniform wall thickness around the hollow space ensuring the least possible weight of the hollow obturator. Conclusion: This processing technique achieves predictable internal dimension of the hollow space providing uniform wall thickness of the obturator...|$|E
