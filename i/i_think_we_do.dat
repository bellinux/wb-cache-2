6000|$|Either America is {{healthier}} than Europe, notwithstanding her [...] "deadly" [...] indulgence in ice-water, {{or she does}} not keep the run of her death-rate as sharply as Europe does. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> keep up the death statistics accurately; and if we do, our cities are {{healthier than}} the cities of Europe. Every month the German government tabulates the death-rate {{of the world and}} publishes it. I scrap-booked these reports during several months, and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same death-rate month after month. The tables {{might as well have been}} stereotyped, they varied so little. These tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000 population for a year. Munich was always present with her 33 deaths in each 1,000 of her population (yearly average), Chicago was as constant with her 15 or 17, Dublin with her 48--and so on.|$|E
6000|$|... (2) <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{know why}} the people of Mangaia 'believe in the change of human beings into trees.' It is one among many {{examples}} of the savage sense of the intercommunity of all nature. 'Antiquity made its division between man and {{the world in a}} very different sort than do the moderns.' {15a} I illustrate this mental condition fully in M. R. R. i. 46-56. Why savages adopt the major premise, 'Human life is on a level with the life of all nature,' philosophers explain in various ways. Hume regards it as an extension to the universe of early man's own consciousness of life and personality. Dr. Tylor thinks that the opinion rests upon 'a broad philosophy of nature.' {15b} M. Lefebure appeals to psychical phenomena as I show later (see 'Fetishism'). At all events, the existence of these savage metaphysics is a demonstrated fact. I established it {15c} before invoking it as an explanation of savage belief in metamorphosis.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{controversy}} between Keynes and Pigou, {{the main issue}} in macroeconomics has been whether and why economies mal-function in periods causing variation in growth rates and unemployment (possibly persistent). Related {{is the question of}} whether there is a role for economic policy to stabilize the economy, and if so by what means? Do we understand these questions better today than we did say 25 or 50 years ago? Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> Advances in macroeconomics have brought forward important insights on the effects of various types of shocks as well as the role of adjustment failures in price and/or wage formation. The role of other forms of market failures (imperfect competition, imperfect information and incomplete market structures) as well as institutions for macro-economic issues is also much better under-stood today. Hence, even though the basic issues are the same, I think our understanding of these issues has improved. This implies neither that our understanding is complete nor that there is consensus in the profession on key questions like the role of stabilization policy. Neither does the progress made imply that we are approaching a situation where the business cycle can be “controlled”; rather it implies that we better understand why this would be very difficult if not impossible. In the following I would like to outline some of the progress I think has been made in macroeconomics over the last decades. Then I turn to a discussion of the current state of th...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{both within}} and outside philosophy, the idea has taken hold that {{generics}} play a special role in perpetuating social injustice. Sarah-Jane Leslie’s work, and Sally Haslanger’s building on it, have led to an increasingly widespread belief that the use of generic expressions plays a crucial role in passing on and shoring up racist and sexist beliefs and ideologies. I have started to hear feminists catching themselves using generic terms to describe social groups, and trying to rephrase their utterances at conferences, citing Haslanger’s and Leslie’s work as the reason. But, as I will explain here, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not yet have good reason to think that we should single out generics about social groups out as peculiarly destructive, or that we should strive to eradicate them from our usage. Indeed, I think they continue to serve a very valuable purpose and we should not rush to condemn them. I view the current attention to generics as a mistake in the battle against prejudice. This is not because they pose no problems − they do pose problems (though I am not yet convinced about many of the problems claimed by Leslie and Haslanger). But so do many other closely related constructions. If we focus our energies on avoiding generics, substituting other phrases that we (wrongly) take to be innocuous, we will be making a serious error. Instead, we need to think much harder about how to confront many sorts of utterances which make reference to social groups. ...|$|E
