5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form {{flocks of}} as many as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls that include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail <b>flicking</b> motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail <b>flicking</b> movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail <b>flicking</b> in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{retracting}} {{the body}} into the tube, phoronids have limited and slow movement: partial emerging from the tube; bending the body when extended; and the lophophore's <b>flicking</b> of food into the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often <b>flicking</b> its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.|$|E

5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been swallowed, the Gila monster immediately resumes tongue <b>flicking</b> and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|When perched {{or between}} bouts of {{foraging}} on the ground, the flame robin holds {{itself in a}} relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45° or less from the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, <b>flicking</b> its wings alternately when still. The flame robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by <b>flicking</b> his tongue over her entire body. As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E
5000|$|A German {{high school}} in Friedrich <b>Flick's</b> {{hometown}} was called the [...] "Friedrich-Flick-Gymnasium" [...] until September 2008. The contribution from <b>Flick</b> had {{made it possible to}} build this school in 1969. The Donatella <b>Flick</b> Conducting Competition is named for Princess Donatella Missikoff <b>Flick,</b> the wife of Gert Rudolph <b>Flick.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hutton then edged a {{ball from}} left-arm medium pacer Ernie Toshack through the slips, and was dropped by Lindsay Hassett on 25 after <b>flicking</b> the ball behind square leg from the medium pace of Sam Loxton. Hutton then hit a square drive past point and Washbrook pulled a ball {{along the ground}} past Harvey, who was patrolling the midwicket boundary. England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively. After a slow start, they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50, and five {{boundaries}} were hit from a spell of six overs by Lindwall.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by <b>flicking</b> their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again {{polymorphic}} with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and <b>flicking</b> its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E

500|$|In 1896, {{the manager}} of the Youngstown Puddlers of the Interstate League signed <b>Flick.</b> Because the team had an {{established}} catcher, <b>Flick</b> played in the outfield, where he struggled to learn the position. In 31 games, <b>Flick</b> had a [...]826 fielding percentage. However, <b>Flick</b> had a strong performance offensively. Using his father's lathe, <b>Flick</b> crafted his own baseball bat, which he used to hit for a [...]438 batting average.|$|R
5|$|When feeding, this flycatcher makes many short {{flights from}} perch to perch, preferring to hunt in shrubs with small leaves, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} genera Adesmia, Baccharis, and Porlieria. A tit-tyrant tends to land near {{the base of the}} shrub and make its way upwards while frequently <b>flicking</b> its tail upwards and shuddering its wings. It has also been observed pivoting on its perch throughout this process. While foraging, the tufted tit-tyrant averages three attacks on prey items per minute. Its feeding style has been compared to that of a kinglet.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, <b>flicking</b> it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by <b>flicking</b> out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent to his induction, {{writers have}} {{questioned}} the validity of <b>Flick's</b> Hall of Fame membership. James Vail characterized <b>Flick</b> and three other Hall of Famers as [...] "some of the most dubious VC choices ever". David Fleitz wrote that Rickey's influence on the Veterans Committee led to <b>Flick's</b> election, as Rickey was the only committee member who had seen <b>Flick</b> play. Author Robert E. Kelly pointed out that <b>Flick's</b> career was relatively short and that stronger candidates from <b>Flick's</b> era (such as Sherry Magee) had not been inducted.|$|R

5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players can play an {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by <b>flicking</b> up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by swapping them out with another Spirit. The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by <b>flicking</b> its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E
5|$|The front five of Jairzinho, Pelé, Gerson, Tostão and Rivelino {{together}} {{created an}} attacking momentum, with Pelé having {{a central role}} in Brazil's way to the final. All of Brazil's matches in the tournament (except the final) were played in Guadalajara, and in the first match against Czechoslovakia, Pelé gave Brazil a 2–1 lead, by controlling Gerson's long pass with his chest and then scoring. In this match Pelé attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Viktor from the half-way line, only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak goal. Brazil {{went on to win the}} match, 4–1. In the first half of the match against England, Pelé nearly scored with a header that was saved by the England goalkeeper Gordon Banks. In the second half, he controlled a cross from Tostão before <b>flicking</b> the ball to Jairzinho who scored the only goal.|$|E

5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before <b>flicking</b> a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, <b>flicking</b> the light switch on and off.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 2010, Carrick {{scored the}} first-ever League Cup goal {{of his career}} in a 4–3 {{aggregate}} win over rivals Manchester City in the second leg of their semi-final tie. On 6 February, Carrick scored in a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth but it was credited as a Richard Hughes own goal following the game. However, the Dubious Goals Panel officially awarded Carrick the goal on 25 May following a review. On 16 February 2010, he was sent off {{for the first time in}} his career after seeing two yellow cards in United's 3–2 win over A.C. Milan at the San Siro. The midfielder was shown a second yellow card in injury-time after <b>flicking</b> the ball away following Patrice Evra's foul on Alexandre Pato. Carrick played the entire game of the 2010 League Cup Final against Aston Villa, which United won 2–1 resulting in his first League Cup medal. This was the first season of his United career that would end without winning the league title as Chelsea claimed the crown by a single point on the final day of the season.|$|E
