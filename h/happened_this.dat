This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never <b>happened.</b> <b>This</b> was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning <b>happened</b> <b>this</b> way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{candidates}} {{are allowed to}} contest elections simultaneously from two seats. If a candidate wins from both the seats, a by-election <b>happens.</b> <b>This</b> requires additional expenditure, resources and participation of many.

25|$|In 1964, the {{worsening}} {{situation in}} South Vietnam led the United States to introduce B-57B Canberra tactical bombers to perform tactical bombing strikes against the Viet Cong. In early 1964 orders were issued to the PACAF 41st Air Division B-57B Canberra 8th and 13th Bombardment Squadrons for reassignment from rotational South Korean alert duty at Yokota AB Japan for movement to Clark AB, Phiippines for possible action in South Vietnam.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the Chinese {{government}} began a crackdown on dissent, and Hua Hao Yue Yuan documents the stories of Liu Dejun and Liu Shasha, whose activism and outspoken attitude led them to violent abuse from the authorities.

The granting of such permission is rare.|$|E
25|$|With {{the weather}} deteriorating, Haakon's fleet sailed to Orkney to overwinter. Whilst {{the battle of}} Largs has been romanticised by later historians as a great Scottish victory, in fact, it only {{involved}} {{a small part of}} the Norwegian fleet. With his fleet and forces intact, Haakon planned to continue to campaign after spending the winter in Orkney, had he not unexpectedly taken ill and died there. With Haakon's death, his successor, Magnus Haakonarson, King of Norway, signed the Treaty of Perth three years after the battle, leasing Scotland's western seaboard to Alexander III in return for a yearly payment. As it <b>happened,</b> <b>this</b> lease became permanent, with the Kingdom of Scotland eventually ceasing to pay the Norwegian crown for the islands when Norway became distracted by civil wars.|$|E
25|$|St. Brendan is chiefly {{renowned for}} his legendary {{journey to the}} Isle of the Blessed as {{described}} in the ninth century Voyage of St Brendan the Navigator. Many versions exist that tell of how he set out onto the Atlantic Ocean with sixteen ]s (other versions have fourteen, plus three unbelievers who join at the last minute) searching for the Garden of Eden. One of these companions {{is said to have been}} Saint Malo, the namesake of Saint-Malo. If it <b>happened,</b> <b>this</b> would have occurred sometime between AD 512–530, before his travel to the island of Great Britain. On his trip, Brendan is supposed to have seen Saint Brendan's Island, a blessed island covered with vegetation. He also encountered a sea monster, an adventure he shared with his contemporary Saint Columba. The most commonly illustrated adventure is his landing on an island which turns out to be a giant sea monster called Jasconius or Jascon. This too, has its parallels in other stories, not only in Irish mythology but in other traditions, from Sinbad the Sailor to Pinocchio.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January 2014, Maariv {{reported}} that Israeli and American leaders had been discussing, and seriously considering, {{the possibility of}} ceding parts of the Arab Triangle to the Palestinians in exchange for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The residents of the Triangle would automatically become Palestinian citizens if this <b>happened.</b> <b>This</b> idea {{is similar to the}} Lieberman Plan. Rami Hamdallah also said that despite Erekat's insistence that the talks had failed, the Palestinians would continue participating in the talks until the April deadline. On 5 January, hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition threatened to withdraw from the government if he accepted the 1967 borders as a baseline for talks. Dovish opposition parties, such as Labor, have said they would join if this occurs, in order to prevent the coalition from breaking up completely. On 9 January, according to insiders, support for a two-state agreement within the Knesset stood at 85 in favor to 35 opposed. In addition to the Labor Party, American negotiators were also attempting to persuade Haredi parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, both of which are generally supportive of the peace process, to join the government to keep negotiations alive.|$|E

500|$|The RAAF's {{order of}} 75 Hornets {{comprised}} 57 single-seat [...] "A" [...] variant fighters and 18 two-seat [...] "B" [...] variant operational training aircraft.

The total cost of the F/A-18 program, including the aircraft, spare parts, other equipment and modifications to the RAAF's fighter bases, was calculated as A$2.427 billion in August 1981, but was rapidly revised upwards due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar at this time.|$|E

500|$|The Secret River is Rawlings' only book {{intended}} for children. According to Murray Laurie, {{the idea for}} the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek: “some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child.” She discussed the idea with her Scribner's editor, Maxwell Perkins, who encouraged her to follow it up. While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she [...] "deliberately avoided Negro dialect. 'No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo sort of stuff. At one point she thought about making the story into a full-length novel. Helen Masten, writing for The Saturday Review, commented [...] "Had this <b>happened</b> <b>this</b> little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children, to whom it rightly belongs." [...] Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp, an illustrator and friend. From that conversation, Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea. In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret Rivers manuscript to Perkins, and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings. When Perkins responded with suggestions, Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp's illustrations. By June of that year, Perkins' death from pneumonia and Rawlings' own personal problems had derailed the project. After Rawlings' death in 1953, the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers.|$|E
