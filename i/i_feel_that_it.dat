500|$|On September 16, 1999, Epic Games {{released}} a playable demo. This {{version of the}} demo was only compatible with Glide-based accelerators. An updated demo version, with support for OpenGL and Direct3D cards, was released on September 28, 1999. Unreal Tournament went gold (became ready for release) on November 16, 1999. The Mac version went gold on December 15, 1999. The Dreamcast version was developed by Secret Level, who had to drop Assault mode, along with many larger maps, due to the Dreamcast having insufficient memory. On December 28, 1999, Brandon Reinhart announced he would release Linux libraries of Unreal Tournament through SourceForge. [...] "I've chosen the Artistic License. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> allows mod developers a lot of freedom with the open code, while not putting Epic into any weird positions with the undisclosed part of the engine," [...] he commented. The goal {{of the project was}} {{to improve the quality of}} the Linux port of the game as well as strengthen the mod authoring community and teach Epic about open source projects. On August 1, 2000, Loki Software announced an exclusive agreement with Epic Games to maintain and support the Linux version of Unreal Tournament, offering new features, addressing any technical issues and achieving revision parity with the Windows version. Bonus pack 1 was released on February 25, 2000. Unreal Tournament was re-released in fall (autumn) 2000 as Unreal Tournament Game of the Year Edition, which includes the first three bonus packs and mods such as Rocket Arena, a one-on-one combat mode.|$|E

2500|$|The Roman writer Livy (59 BC–AD 17) in {{his history}} of Rome, Ab urbe condita, devotes a half-dozen pages to Masinissa's {{character}} and career, both turbulent and admired, eventful and long in duration. Livy writes: [...] "Since Masinissa {{was by far the}} greatest of all the kings of his time and rendered much the most valuable service to Rome, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is worthwhile to digress a little in order to tell [...] story...." [...] Livy informs us of Masinissa's early military services to Carthage and of his and Carthage's victory over the Masaesyli led by Syphax. Next in Hispania, Masinissa led cavalry units for Carthage against Rome. Here he switched sides to ally with Rome, after meeting with Scipio Africanus, the celebrated Roman general. There followed {{the death of his father}} Gala, King of the Massyli, upon which he returned home to find an usurper taking over his father's kingdom. Masinissa then became a guerilla chief in the mountains of Africa, regaining his kingdom after a persistent struggle. Sooner after, Syphax staged an invasion, defeating Masinissa and seizing the Massyli kingdom with Masinissa escaping into the bush. Later, his forces came upon the army of Scipio, recently landed in Africa. The Romans defeated Carthaginian forces in battle and Syphax was captured. Masinissa sends envoys to Rome who meet with the Senate. Carthage was forced to recall Hannibal from Italy to defend the African capital. Nearby, Hannibal fought the Battle of Zama (202 BC) against Scipio's Roman army, with Masinissa at the head of cavalry on Scipio's right flank. Following victory over Hannibal, Masinissa was restored to his kingdom, Massyli along with surrounding Numidia, where he ends up ruling for fifty years.|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Susan Morgan called Mansfield Park {{the most}} {{difficult}} of all Austen’s novels as it features the weakest of all of Austen’s heroines who ends up the most beloved member of the Bertram family. Morgan argued that to understand the novel properly requires understanding of the capacity for characters to change or not to change. Mary Crawford, while possessing some good qualities and having much charm and vivacity is ultimately doomed by her superficiality, materialism and an inability to change. A telling example of Mary’s character occurs when says [...] "Look, where I will, I see that it is so; and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must be", as she assumes that what she sees before her is all that will ever be, and the possibility of anything else existing does not occur to her. Through not devoid of kindness, Mary has a strong competitive streak that leads her to see love as a game where one party conquers and controls the other, which coupled with her cynicism and narcissism makes her insensitive towards the feelings of others, as she insists that Edmund abandons his clerical career merely it is not prestigious enough for her and her inability to appreciate improvements, as she likes things whole and lacks the discernment to value change in one's moral character and the hard work necessary to bring it about. Price by contrast is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is 10 and traces her story up to the age 17. When Price is sent to Mansfield Park, her tears at leaving the only home she has ever known, shows her awareness of the past, of who she is and was, and her wish to maintain her identity. Morgan wrote though Price is a flawed heroine, she possesses [...] "…the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge, and that generosity of mind which should illuminate our view of the people around us.". Austen also suggests change can be either for the worse or the better as Price almost succumbs to Henry Crawford’s charm and apparent reformation of character, even though she knows deep down that he is by nature malleable and undependable because he does not feel very much, and therefore whatever his passions are now will be easily replaced. Morgan argued that Price’s principle virtue is that of" [...] growing worth", her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.|$|E
