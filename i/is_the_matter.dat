5|$|Dark matter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in {{the universe}} is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter {{in the universe}} is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
25|$|Change is {{analyzed}} as {{a material}} transformation: matter is what undergoes {{a change of}} form. For example, consider a lump of bronze that's shaped into a statue. Bronze <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> and this matter loses one form (that of a lump) and gains a new form (that of a statue).|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, the {{interstellar}} medium (ISM) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> and radiation {{that exists in the}} space between the star systems in a galaxy. This matter includes gas in ionic, atomic, and molecular form, as well as dust and cosmic rays. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic space. The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of electromagnetic radiation, is {{the interstellar}} radiation field.|$|E

25|$|Reincarnation {{also appears}} in Norse mythology, in the Poetic Edda. The {{editor of the}} Poetic Edda says that Helgi Hjörvarðsson and his mistress, the valkyrie Sváfa, whose love story is told in the poem Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar, were reborn as Helgi Hundingsbane and the valkyrie Sigrún. Helgi and Sigrún's love story <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of {{a part of the}} Völsunga saga and the lays Helgakviða Hundingsbana I and II. They were reborn a second time as Helgi Haddingjaskati and the valkyrie Kára, but {{unfortunately}} their story, Káruljóð, only survives in a probably modified form in the Hrómundar saga Gripssonar.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (QLTR), {{an office}} {{held by the}} Crown Agent who is the senior officer of the Crown Office in Scotland, is {{responsible}} for claiming bona vacantia {{on behalf of the}} Crown in Scotland. Finders of items are required to report such finds to the Crown Office or to the Treasure Trove Unit (TTU) at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh. Each find is assessed by the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel, which decides if the find is of national importance. If it <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is referred by the TTU to the QLTR department at the Crown Office, which will inform the finder that it has accepted the Panel's recommendation to claim the objects in the find as treasure trove or bona vacantia.|$|E

500|$|Though the {{interceptor}} pilot {{reported to}} ground control, [...] "Target destroyed", the Soviet command, from general on down, indicated surprise and consternation at KAL007's continued flight, {{and ability to}} regain its altitude and maneuver. This consternation continued through to KAL007's subsequent level flight at altitude , and then, after almost five minutes, through its spiral descent over Moneron Island. (See [...] from 18:26 UTC onwards: [...] "Lt. Col.

500|$|By early 1862, however, Greeley {{was again}} {{sometimes}} {{critical of the}} administration, frustrated by the failure to win decisive military victories, and perturbed at the president's slowness to commit to the emancipation of the slaves once the Confederacy was defeated, something the Tribune was urging in its editorials. [...] This was a change in Greeley's thinking which began after First Manassas, a shift from preservation of the Union being the primary war purpose to wanting the war to end slavery. [...] By March, the only action against slavery that Lincoln had backed was a proposal for compensated emancipation in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union, though he signed legislation abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. Lincoln supposedly asked a Tribune correspondent, [...] "What in the world <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> with Uncle Horace? Why can't he restrain himself and wait a little while?" ...|$|E

500|$|The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The {{following}} year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends {{not in a}} blaze of orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, who played at the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, [...] "but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin Concerto or the First Symphony." [...] Elgar asked Reed, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> with them, Billy? They sit there like a lot of stuffed pigs." [...] The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First Symphony.|$|E
500|$|As the {{psychologist}} and computer scientist Christopher Evans has noted, [...] "One aspect of [...] war record {{that is particularly}} confused, and again typical {{of the mixture of}} glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of wounds or injuries suffered on active service." [...] Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been [...] "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I worked my way back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what I knew about Man and his relationship to the universe." [...] Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been [...] "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E
500|$|What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> {{with you}} that, {{that even after}} the unending admissions of guilt in [...] you cannot stop {{representing}} yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was [...] "too little"?... {{there appears to be}} a vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life. [...] For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in sackcloth and ashes; I, however, know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes... our accusations against your former colleagues (Göring, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) who, being dead, cannot defend themselves are agony to me... I hope and think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue.|$|E

500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> with you? You know Hillary. You have seen my involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, a {{substance}}'s matter will {{itself be}} a substance. If substance A {{is made out}} of substance B, then substance B <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of substance A.

2500|$|At least 7 factors drive overuse, 4 {{related to}} {{physicians}} and 3 related to patients. First, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of physician culture. Medical school education and postgraduate training emphasize thoroughness. When evaluating a patient, students, interns, and residents {{are trained to}} identify and praised for and graded on enumerating all possible diagnoses and tests that would confirm or exclude them. The thought {{is that the more}} thorough the evaluation, the more intelligent the student or house officer. Trainees who ignore the improbable [...] "zebra" [...] diagnoses are not deemed insightful. In medical training, meticulousness, not effectiveness, is rewarded.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the backing}} of FIFA, AFC {{president}} Mohammed Bin Hammam stated that due to AFC criteria the Wellington team must move to Australia or disband by 2011.

If Wellington will go on play on in Australian League, then as long as Australian league wants to have them and Wellington wants to stay (and) Both association in this case, New Zealand Soccer and Australian Football are happy with that then we will give them the blessing.

[...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes.
