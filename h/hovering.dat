40|$|A non-continuous thrust {{method for}} <b>hover</b> type {{formation}} flying has been developed. This method differs from a true <b>hover</b> which requires constant range and bearing from a reference vehicle. The new method uses a pulsed loop, or pogo, maneuver sequence {{that keeps the}} follower spacecraft within a defined box in a near <b>hover</b> situation. Equations are developed for the <b>hover</b> maintenance maneuvers. The constraints on the <b>hover</b> location, pulse interval, and maximum/minimum ranges are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as <b>hovering</b> in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be <b>hovering</b> five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hover</b> UAV is a VTOL jointly {{developed}} by Sheng Shi and CASIC. Externally, <b>Hover</b> visually resembles Allied Aerospace iSTAR UAV, and both UAVs are powered by pertro engine. [...] <b>Hover</b> differs from ISTAR in {{that instead of}} putting the engine and payload together in a single section above the propeller like in iSTAR, the payload and engine of <b>Hover</b> is separately located, with payload above the propeller, and the engine below the propeller. Although the developer has given the English name <b>Hover</b> to this UAV, the actual meaning of the original Chinese name is Chinese checkers (Tiao-Qi or Tiaoqi, 跳棋).|$|R
