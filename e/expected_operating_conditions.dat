The actual operating conditions of aircraft gas temperature sensors significantly differ from those at airflow equipment. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop methods of recalculation of a test results of a limited number of gas temperature sensors that were received at certified airflow equipment and to get nominal dynamic characteristics of a particular type of gas temperature sensors in the anticipated operating conditions. This study offers the algorithm for the identification of the nominal dynamic characteristics of gas temperature sensors that are used to measure the temperature of gases in aircraft gas turbine engines. The algorithm makes it possible to 1) register the transient characteristics of gas temperature sensors of a particular type at a predetermined rate of air flow, 2) calculate the heat transfer coefficient between the gas temperature sensors and the air flow at each airflow rate, 3) measure the average transient characteristics of the gas temperature sensors at each airflow rate, 4) set the parameters of the hyperbolic function of the nominal variables of the time constants of selected gas temperature sensors from the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated based on the <b>expected</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of the gas temperature sensors.

By being able to determine when a product will fail, procedures can be developed to provide advanced warning of failures, optimize maintenance, reduce life cycle costs, and improve the design, qualification and logistical support of fielded and future systems. In the case of electronics, the reliability is often influenced by thermal loads, in the form of steady-state temperatures, power cycles, temperature gradients, ramp rates, and dwell times. If one can continuously monitor the thermal loads, in-situ, this data can be used in conjunction with precursor reasoning algorithms and stress-and-damage models to enable prognostics.

40|$|Abstract: Estimation of {{the mean}} {{lifetime}} and reliability of sophisticated systems is a challenging problem in many engineering applications. This is especially important when the study is concerned with both burn in and field operation periods since the hazard rate is no longer constant and the underlying processes are non-homogenous. In such cases, theoretical development of the solution is very tedious and obtaining results for the expected lifetime and reliability of complex systems is almost impossible. Monte Carlo simulations provide a viable alternative for estimation of the expected lifetime and reliability in such situations. Predictive calculations for the mean time to failures may be carried out using MIL-HDBK- 217 F for <b>expected</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of the system.
