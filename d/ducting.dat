5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant <b>ducting</b> and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore <b>ducting</b> and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E

Common bile <b>duct</b> pressure was significantly raised after cholecystectomy, with common bile <b>duct</b> stones and papillary stenosis but pancreatic <b>duct</b> pressure only in papillary stenosis. After endoscopic sphincterotomy mean common bile <b>duct</b> pressure fell from 11. 2 to 1. 1 mmHg and pancreatic <b>duct</b> pressure from 18. 0 to 11. 2 mmHg. Distinct pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter and bile <b>duct</b> sphincter zones were identified as phasic pressures of 3 - 12 waves/minute on pull-through from pancreatic <b>duct</b> and common bile <b>duct</b> to duodenum. Pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures were higher with common bile <b>duct</b> stones and stenosis whereas bile <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures were higher in pancreatitis and stenosis. Bile <b>duct</b> sphincter activity was present in 60 % of patients after surgical sphincteroplasty but 21 % of patients after endoscopic sphincterotomy.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} anatomy of the {{pancreatic}} <b>duct</b> system and to investigate its embryology, we reviewed 256 pancreatograms with normal pancreatic head, 81 with pancreas divisum and 74 with pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Accessory pancreatograms {{were divided into two}} patterns. The long-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> forms a straight line and joins the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> at the neck portion of the pancreas. The short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> joins the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> near its first inferior branch. The short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> is less likely to have a long inferior branch arising from the accessory pancreatic <b>duct.</b> The length of the accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> from the orifice to the first long inferior branch was similar in the short- and long-type accessory pancreatic <b>ducts.</b> The first long inferior branch from the long-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> passes though the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> near the origin of the inferior branch from the main pancreatic <b>duct.</b> Immunohistochemically, in the short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct,</b> the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> between the junction with the short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> and the neck portion was located in the ventral pancreas. The long-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> represents a continuation of the main <b>duct</b> of the dorsal pancreatic bud.

50|$|The {{pancreatic}} <b>duct,</b> or <b>duct</b> of Wirsung (also, {{the major}} pancreatic <b>duct</b> {{due to the}} existence of an accessory pancreatic <b>duct),</b> is a <b>duct</b> joining the pancreas to the common bile <b>duct</b> to supply pancreatic juice provided from the exocrine pancreas which aids in digestion. The pancreatic <b>duct</b> joins the common bile <b>duct</b> just prior to the ampulla of Vater, after which both <b>ducts</b> perforate the medial side of the second portion of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla.

25|$|Sudden {{changes in}} the atmosphere's {{vertical}} moisture content and temperature profiles can on random occasions make UHF, VHF and microwave signals propagate hundreds of kilometers up to about 2,000 kilometers (1,300mi)and for <b>ducting</b> mode even fartherbeyond the normal radio-horizon. The inversion layer is mostly observed over high pressure regions, but there are several tropospheric weather conditions which create these randomly occurring propagation modes. Inversion layer's altitude for non-ducting is typically found between 100 meters (300ft) to about 1 kilometer (3,000ft) and for <b>ducting</b> about 500 meters to 3 kilometers (1,600 to 10,000ft), and {{the duration of the}} events are typically from several hours up to several days. Higher frequencies experience the most dramatic increase of signal strengths, while on low-VHF and HF the effect is negligible. Propagation path attenuation may be below free-space loss. Some of the lesser inversion types related to warm ground and cooler air moisture content occur regularly at certain times of the year and time of day. A typical example could be the late summer, early morning tropospheric enhancements that bring in signals from distances up to few hundred kilometers for a couple of hours, until undone by the Sun's warming effect.|$|E

40|$|The local heat {{transfer}} and pressure drop characteristics of developing turbulent flows of air in three stationary ribbed square <b>ducts</b> {{have been investigated}} experimentally.

25|$|The {{microphone}} design {{differs from}} that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of infrasound are taken into account. First, infrasound propagates over vast distances through the Earth's atmosphere as a result of very low atmospheric absorption and of refractive <b>ducting</b> that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. A second property that has received little attention is the great penetration capability of infrasound through solid matter – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges. The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary <b>ducting</b> to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E
25|$|Originally air {{turbulence}} {{was kept}} to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above head height is crowded with <b>ducting,</b> conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.|$|E

25|$|Two kit {{versions}} of the Chrysler Turbine Car were significant - a standard bronze colored promotional authentic to the cars used by the public, and a white version that {{was the color of}} one of the test mules, which was also lent for the making of the movie The Lively Set. This model had a friction motor and fewer than 500 were produced. Some of the Turbine models were nearly as incredible as the real car, with such details as folding seats, opening doors, hood, deck lid, and steerable front wheels.

25|$|In late 1938, the Bf 109E entered production. To {{improve on}} the {{performance}} afforded by the 441–515kW (600–700PS) Jumo 210, the larger, longer Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 223kW (300PS) {{at the cost of}} an additional 181kg (400lb). A much bigger cooling area was needed to disperse the extra heat generated by the DB 601 and this led to the first major redesign of the basic airframe. Enlarging the existing nose mounted radiator sufficiently to cool the engine would have created extra weight and drag, negating some of the performance gains afforded by the increased power, so it was decided to move the main radiators to beneath the wings' undersurfaces immediately outboard of the juncture between the wing root and wing panel, just forward of the trailing edges' inner ends, leaving the oil cooler under the nose in a small, streamlined duct. The new radiator position also had the effect of counterbalancing the extra weight and length of the DB 601, which drove a heavier three-bladed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM)-made propeller. To incorporate the new radiators, the wings were almost completely redesigned and reinforced, with several inboard ribs behind the spar being cut down {{to make room for the}} radiator <b>ducting.</b> Because the radiators were now mounted near the trailing edge of the wing, coinciding with the increased speed of the airflow accelerating around the wing's camber, the overall cooling installation was more efficient than that of the Jumo engined 109s, albeit at the cost of extra <b>ducting</b> and piping, which could be vulnerable to battle damage. In addition, the lowered undercarriage could throw up mud and debris on wet airfields, potentially clogging the radiators.|$|E
25|$|Although the un-installed Nene had {{a higher}} thrust than the Goblin, the level flight speed was no greater. To reduce the installed-engine intake losses caused by having to feed air to the rear face of the impeller, two {{additional}} intakes were added behind the cockpit; these had the negative side-effect of causing elevator reversal and buffeting tendencies, which in turn reduced the Vampire's Mach limitation. The Vampires of the RAAF were powered by the Nene engine; these were initially outfitted with dorsal intakes, but the intakes were subsequently repositioned underneath the fuselage instead. In 1949, Boulton Paul Aircraft (BPA) redesigned the wing-root intakes and internal <b>ducting</b> based on {{the installation of the}} Nene in the prototype Hawker Sea Hawk. The Mistral, the French name for their models of the Vampire, also used the Nene engine with BPA intakes.|$|E
