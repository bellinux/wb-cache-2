40|$|AbstractIt {{is a key}} step of {{quantitative}} risk analysis (QRA) to estimate ignition probability of flammable materials after leakage accidents. This paper reviews the available literature and expert opinion on how to evaluate and determine ignition probability value, and it was detailedly discussed on the main influencing factors of ignition probability, including flammable material properties, mass flow rate of flammable materials spillage, ignition resources and <b>ignition</b> <b>controls.</b> Moreover, the operational and practical ignition probability value could be estimated from the all way of classifications of flammable material, mass flow rate, ignition resources, hazardous areas and <b>ignition</b> prevention and <b>control</b> measure. Furthermore, the more practical ignition probability model was put forward that the ignition probability was the maximum value of the probability decided by material properties (PMP), mass flow rate(PQ) and ignition resources(PIS) with the factor of preventing and <b>controlling</b> <b>ignition</b> (KIC). Finally, the further research was proposed to assign some feasible weigh factors of the ignition probability for flammable materials after leakage accidents...|$|R

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} Closed access. <b>Controlled</b> Auto <b>Ignition</b> (CAI) uses the {{internal}} {{energy of the}} compressed charge to auto-ignite the mixture. Using internal exhaust gas re-circulation (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next. Although the emission and fuel economy can be largely improved, the engine power output is limited to part-load conditions only. At high-load, conventional Spark Ignition (SI) is required. In this research, both SI and CAI and the transition between the two were investigated on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with Lotus’ Research Active Valve Train (AVT) System. It {{was found that the}} potential hybrid combustion concept is consisted of four regions: conventional spark ignition combustion, spark <b>ignition</b> <b>controlled</b> auto <b>ignition,</b> spark ignition assisted auto ignition, spark <b>ignition</b> free <b>controlled</b> auto <b>ignition...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Ignition</b> <b>Control</b> rev {{limiting}} systems work by interrupting the powerthat {{is distributed}} to the sparkplugs.Once the car reaches the redline, the engine stops the spark. This is notvery common in production cars because it is bad for emissions,as the system still injects fuel into the cylinder and consequently releasesunburnt fuel out the exhaust pipe. This type of limiting can also affect thetemperatures in the exhaust, causing premature wear on the catalyticconverter.|$|E
5000|$|The EDIS system's {{relative}} simplicity, {{in particular}} {{the fact that it}} does not require a cam sensor, makes it a popular choice for custom car builders and classic car owners looking to retrofit a modern ignition system to their vehicle.

50|$|<b>Ignition</b> system <b>control</b> is also digital electronic.

50|$|Exhaust gas is {{very hot}} if {{retained}} or re-inducted {{from the previous}} combustion cycle or cool if recirculated through the intake as in conventional EGR systems. The exhaust has dual effects on HCCI combustion. It dilutes the fresh charge, delaying ignition and reducing the chemical energy and engine output. Hot combustion products conversely increase gas temperature in the cylinder and advance <b>ignition.</b> <b>Control</b> of combustion timing HCCI engines using EGR has been shown experimentally.|$|E
50|$|Both {{direct and}} remote distributorless systems also allow finer levels of <b>ignition</b> <b>control</b> by the engine computer, which helps to {{increase}} power output, decrease fuel consumption and emissions, and implement {{features such as}} cylinder deactivation. Spark plug wires, which need routine replacement due to wear, are also eliminated when the individual coils are mounted directly {{on top of each}} plug, since the power is transported a very short distance from the coil to the plug.|$|E
