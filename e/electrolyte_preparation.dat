40|$|Successful {{commercial}} electrowinning {{and refining}} of metals typically requires the optimization of the electrolyte composition and operating parameters to produce high quality compact electroplated metal. The prediction {{of the structure}} and morphology of the plated metal from the operating parameters remains a challenge. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} reliable galvanodynamic technique to measure nucleation and plating potentials that was specifically applicable to the plating of zinc from sulphate electrolytes, with which plant operation may be controlled and optimized. The work was focussed on determining whether there would exist a definite unique or range of values for both the nucleation and plating potentials for which {{it would be possible to}} obtain high quality zinc electrodeposits repeatably. Such a tool could be modelled and be particularly useful in plant situations to suggest remedies for process upsets and development. In the current study a repeatable and reliable galvanodynamic polarization technique using two scan rates was developed to perform the polarization measurements. The values were used to predict the nature and morphological characteristics of the metal plated from the respective acidic aqueous zinc sulphate electrolytes The developed galvanodynamic technique was found to be an effective and reliable technique to measure nucleation and plating potentials systematically and repeatably. The results indicated that nucleation and plating potentials could be obtained with reasonable repeatability of ± 3 mV. These potentials provided useful data and information on the electrowinning processes and the effect of changes in parameters and conditions of zinc deposition on the morphology. The repeatability and relevance of the potential measurements were strongly dependent on strict adherence to consistency in electrode preparation procedures, <b>electrolyte</b> <b>preparation</b> and control of experimental conditions.. The relationship between initial nucleation of zinc on an inert aluminium substrate and further growth provided a useful framework for relating the physical changes in the structure of electrodeposits. The difference between the nucleation and plating potentials was observed to be an indicator of the type, quality and characteristics of the deposits formed, and could be used to identify a unique region which is considered to be the region in which the most desirable quality deposit will be obtained. However the idea suggested by Adcock et al. (2002), that nucleation is favoured over growth if the plating potential is more negative than the nucleation potential ΔE, and should therefore result in unoriented dispersion (UD) type deposits turned out to be only partly so with such deposits rather obtained for ΔE values around zero and with field oriented texture (FT) and basis reproduction (BR) type deposits obtained at more positive as well as negative values. The effect of temperature on the plating characteristics was not significant. This may have been attributed to the influence of hydrogen ion reduction on the potential whereby a substantial current flow and a shift of potentials to positive values is observed, but not necessarily due to zinc plating. Higher temperatures showed a considerable reduction in current efficiency which is a consequence of high rates of hydrogen reduction. This indicated that the approach to characterise zinc plating by polarization characteristics would probably not be valid for conditions where significant rates of hydrogen ion reduction occur. The study indicated that grain refiners influence the nucleation process while levellers change the growth process. The difference between the plating and nucleation potentials ΔE was found to be an indicator for identifying and predicting grain refinement but not as much as in the case with levelling. This limits the usefulness of the two dimensional representation of the polarization parameters, such as suggested by Adcock, for the evaluation of additives for zinc electrowinning from sulphate electrolytes.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} for low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) is based mostly on measurements of excess amounts of thermal energy that are generated during the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium cathodes. These excess thermal energy events, however, cannot {{be explained by}} established electrochemical energy balance considerations. This experimental investigation focusses on finding rootcauses for such thermal events rather than measuring the events. In order to gain insight of macroscopic physical electrode behavior, cathodes of nickel in light water electrolytes are used as practical models for metal-hydrogen systems to investigate the mechanics of gas evolution. The surface microstructure of electroplated nickel cathodes was the initial object for the investigation of hydrogen gas bubble formation. During these studies a surprising physical cathode-surface-effect was observed {{at the onset of}} gas evolution periods. The observation of this effect has not been found -and reported on-in the scientific literature for the nickel-hydrogen binary system, even though this system has been investigated intensely for nearly a century. The readily produced physical effect, observed at the surface of nickel cathodes, leads to the conclusion that during hydrogen gas evolution metastable surface-lattice conditions are created, which lead to, and explain, the initiation of surface phonons that are part of possible causes for LENR thermal events. In the description of the experimental investigation, cell configurations, <b>electrolytes,</b> <b>preparation</b> methods, cathode surface structures, and physical behavior of cathode surfaces are given. The methods for producing the electrochemical-physical cathode activation effect, detailed observation of the effect, and its potential relationship with other metal-hydrogen systems, are described.

40|$|In isotachophoretic {{analyses}} of anions, performed in operational systems at high pH (pH 2 ̆ 6 gt; 7) disturbances due to carbon dioxide {{from the air}} can be expected. Even at neutral pH the isotachophoretic features can be obscured by this disturbance, because the pH of the sample zones {{has a tendency to}} increase from the leading zone towards the terminating zone in anion analysis 1, 2. This disturbance, according to the principles of zone electrophoresis, can be caused by carbon dioxide dissolved in the terminating electrolyte. A minor disturbance can be expected from carbon dioxide dissolved in the leading electrolyte. It was found very convenient to prepare both the leading and terminating electrolytes under nitrogen. Barium hydroxide (analytical-reagent grade) was added to the terminating electrolyte to prevent carbonate from entering the separation compartment. The terminator compartment still needed to be refreshed completeley after each analysis. Complex formation between Ba 2 + with sample anions was minimized by careful injection. Addition of barium hydroxide to the leading electrolyte is not recommended. Unwanted complex formation often occurs and precipitation of barium carbonate can block the capillary column. In this paper it is shown that isotachophoretic {{analyses of}} anions at pH 2 ̆ 6 gt; 7 can be carried out by closing the separation compartment with semi-permeable membranes of cellulose polyacetate (0. 1 mm thick) and having solely doubly distilled water in the electrode compartments.

40|$|Methods of {{modifying the}} surface of the {{particles}} of colloidal silica were developed and the effects of surface modification on the properties of colloidal silica were studied. Gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) readily reacts with water to yield a hydrolysed silane that reacts readily with the silica surface. The epoxy functional groups were not affected during the hydrolysis but subsequent reaction with the silica surface opened the epoxy rings. The presence of silane groups on the particle surface was established by Si-NMR. About 1. 5 GPTMS groups per nm 2 silica surface were needed to affect significantly the properties of colloidal silica. Modification of conventional silica sols improves the stability toward gelling by <b>electrolytes,</b> allows the <b>preparation</b> of mixtures of various lattices with silica sols that are stable toward gelling, increases the hardness of latex coatings, and improves the properties of pigmented coatings. Methods were developed for making white composite pigments consisting of a silica core with a titania shell. A necessary step was the aluminate modification of the silica particles. With 1. 5 aluminosilicate sites per nm 2 of core surface, well-dispersed composite particles having cores of uniform size in the range of 300 to 500 nm with a titania coating, the thickness of which corresponded to from 150 to 400 wt-% of titania based on the weight of the core, were prepared. In a third type of modification colloidal silica was prepared {{with a high degree of}} structure, i. e. the silica particles having linear dimensions rather than being perfect spheres and being stabilised with amines. Such sols are very effective anionic components in dual retention aids in papermaking. Highly structured silica sols but being stabilised with sodium can be used to make solid electrolytes in lead-acid batteries with improved properties compared with conventional electrolytes. Colloidal silica of different sizes can be used to improve the properties of concrete mixtures. Modifying colloidal silica to yield sols of wide particle size distributions provides a means to make concrete with improved properties. The small particle fraction of the sol will increase of the early strength while the large particle fraction will increase the ultimate mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 s KERAFOL - Keramische Folien GmbH is {{developing}} zirconia based ceramic tapes and sintered substrates for Electrolyte Supported Cells (ESC). Together with Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (IKTS) in Dresden investigations and developments {{had taken place}} to improve {{the properties of the}} ESC. The result of this cooperation is the possibility to produce ESCs at KERAFOL which meet all requirements for an application in stacks and systems like mechanical strength, long-term stability during operation at temperatures of 750 deg C to 950 deg C, thermal cycling, very low degradation during repeated anode reduction/oxidation cycles and an enhanced power density that is comparable to ASCs (Anode Supported Cells). The cells are based on scandia doped zirconia electrolytes (ScSZ) and are completely manufactured at KERAFOL including <b>electrolyte</b> production, paste <b>preparation,</b> screen printing, firing and quality assurance. With improving the electrolytes at KERAFOL and the electrodes at IKTS and combining both technologies it was possible to make high performance ESCs commercially available. The ESCs show an excellent long term operation at high power densities (> 400 mW/cm(exp 2)). The values for the degradation of the ionic conductivity and the activation energy measured on 10 mol% stabilized ScSZ electrolytes during 1000 h were significantly lower than those of 8 mol% stabilized YSZ electrolytes. Even though KERAFOL uses hard conditions for reduction/oxidation cycles, the degradation rate is very low. By optimizing the functional layers low polarization resistances < 0. 25 Wcm(exp 2) could be realized as well as low electrolyte resistances (0. 06 Ohm cm(exp 2)) due to the facts of using highly ionic conducting materials and decreasing the electrolyte thicknesses. The electrolyte part of the total cell resistance at 850 deg C is only 27 %. So there is potential to increase power density by improving the electrodes especially for intermediate temperatures. The possibilities at KERAFOL and the results of the measurements are shown in the paper. With showing a high power density, long-term and redox stability the decision was made at KERAFOL to install a fuel cell production line to extend its product portfolio of SOFC kiln furniture, different electrolytes, tape development and production with inhouse manufactured electrolyte supported cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands on}} energy {{have led to}} environmental issues and the depletion of fossil fuels. The intense research on energy storage and conversion has attracted much attention for future technology development. Batteries have become a choice for energy storage devices in many applications. However, expanding markets are pushing for alternative pulse batteries that offer high power and long cycle life. Inspired by this, supercapacitors have attracted growing interest due to their high power density, long cycle life, and fast charging rate, which display great potential in complimenting or even replacing batteries in many applications. The research work in this project concentrates on improving the specific capacitance or energy density of nanostructure composite metal oxides electrodes, namely oxides of manganese, nickel and cobalt (MnO 2, MnO 2 /NiO and Mn 3 O 4 /NiO/Co 3 O 4) with porous texture morphology. First, MnO 2 was deposited on top of stainless steel by simple chronopotentiometry electrodeposition method with various manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O) concentrations in deposition solution. The optimum performance was obtained using 0. 01 M Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O. In order to enhance the specific capacitance of MnO 2 electrode, the NiO was incorporated into the MnO 2 electrode by adding different concentrations of nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O) mixed with 0. 01 M Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O. The optimum performance of MnO 2 -NiO electrode was obtained using the deposition solution containing 0. 25 M Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O mixed with 0. 01 M Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O. The optimum MnO 2 -NiO electrode was further studied in different electrodeposition modes and different CV’s cycles. The work proceeded by adding different concentrations of cobalt ion into 0. 01 M Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O mixed with 0. 25 M Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 · 4 H 2 O concentration. The iv effect of the addition of different cobalt ion concentrations was explored and the obtained Mn 3 O 4 -NiO-Co 3 O 4 ternary electrode exhibited optimum specific capacitance of 7404 F g- 1 with high energy and power density of 1028 Wh kg- 1 and 99 kW kg- 1 respectively at current density of 20 A g- 1 in 0. 5 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) / 0. 04 M potassium ferrocyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6) mixture electrolyte. Lastly, the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors were enhanced by incorporating MnO 2 electrode with carbon based composite (reduce graphene oxide (RGO) /glucose carbon). The incorporation of RGO/glucose carbon into MnO 2 electrode increased the electrical conductivity of the electrode. The introduction of D (+) glucose into the deposition solution slowed down the nucleation process of MnO 2 particles and led to uniform and ultrathin nanoflakes structure. The optimized electrode exhibited low transfer resistance and resulted in excellent electrochemical performance in three electrolyte systems viz. sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4), KOH and KOH/K 3 Fe(CN) 6 electrolytes. The optimum specific capacitance obtained was 13, 333 F g- 1 with energy density and power density of 1851 Wh kg- 1 and 68 kW kg- 1 respectively at current density of 20 A g- 1 in mixed 0. 5 M KOH/ 0. 04 M K 3 Fe(CN) 6 <b>electrolyte.</b> The <b>preparation</b> of electrodes in this work using electrodeposition method is simple, low-cost, and environmental-friendly.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} the study of a new {{eutectic}} melts based on acetamide and dimethyl sulfone for the electrodeposition of metals, alloys and composites. Mixtures of acetamide and dimethylsulfone (DMSO 2) with dissolved anhydrous transition metal chlorides are introduced as new non-aqueous <b>electrolytes</b> for the <b>preparation</b> of luminescent composite metal coatings. Red-emitting (Eu 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3 +), yellow-emitting (Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3 +), green-emitting (Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb 3 +) and blue-emitting (BaMg 2 Al 16 O 27 :Eu 2 +) rare-earth phosphor particles and yttrium oxide particles have been embedded into nickel and cobalt coatings. The metal coatings with the rare-earth phosphor particles have a metallic luster, but show at the same time photoluminescence upon irradiation with UV light. The spectroscopic and photophysical properties of the rare-earth phosphors are not modified by embedding them in the metallic host matrix. Different electrodeposition parameters were optimized in order to obtain well-adherent coatings with a uniform particle distribution. By preparing mixtures of the Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3 + and Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb 3 + phosphors, the emission color could be varied from red over orange and yellow to green, depending on the mixing ratios. Embedding mixtures of yellow and blue phosphors in the metal layer made it possible to produce coatings with white photoemission. Acetamide-dimethyl sulfone eutectic melts containing metal chlorides were used as non-aqueous electrolytes for the codeposition of oxide particles (ceria, silica and alumina) with nickel, cobalt, nickel-cobalt and zinc-nickel alloys. For all types of particles, very high particle incorporation was observed. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that the particles are uniformly distributed inside the coating. The influence of current density, stirring speed and particle concentration on particle incorporation was examined for nickel-ceria coatings. X-ray diffraction patterns of ceria particles and nickel-ceria or cobalt-ceria composites indicated that the particles in the coatings remained unchanged. Agglomerate-free, homogeneously well dispersed silica composites were obtained from surfactant-free melt with suspended unmodified hydrophilic silica particles. Alloy codeposition of nickel-cobalt-ceria and zinc-nickel-ceria was also demonstrated from acetamide-dimethyl sulfone eutectic melts containing dissolved metal chlorides. Gauze-supported skeletal nickel catalysts were successfully prepared by electrodeposition of nickel-zinc alloys on copper gauzes from an acetamide-DMSO 2 -ZnCl 2 -NiCl 2 quaternary melt, followed by chemical and electrochemical leaching of zinc from the deposited alloys. The nickel content of the alloys was varied with deposition potential and deposition temperature during the electrolysis. The nickel content in the alloys increases from 17 wt. % to 89 wt. % when the temperature was increased from 70 &# 176;C to 150 &# 176;C. The surface morphology and BET surface area of the activated zinc-nickel alloy varied markedly for the chemical and electrochemically leached alloys. The activity and selectivity of the structured Raney nickel catalysts surpass those of commercially available porous nickel in the hydrogenation of acetophenone. Characterization by XRD and SEM revealed that the electrodeposited zinc-nickel alloys have very fine grain size, combined with excellent adhesion to the supporting gauze. Zinc-cobalt precursor alloys were electrodeposited from an acetamide-DMSO 2 -ZnCl 2 -CoCl 2 quaternary <b>electrolyte</b> for the <b>preparation</b> of gauze-supported skeletal cobalt. Alloys with various compositions were obtained by changing the experimental parameters. In comparison to the aqueous plating bath, non-anomalous zinc-cobalt alloy deposition was found in this melt. The deposited zinc-cobalt alloys were used for the preparation of Raney cobalt after the preferential dissolution of zinc either chemically and/or electrochemically. The chemical leaching of the zinc-cobalt alloys was carried out in concentrated or diluted sodium hydroxide solutions, whereas the electrochemical leaching of the alloys was carried out in the same electrolyte as used for the electrodeposition. The activated alloy was used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of acetophenone. The activity of the catalyst prepared by the dealloying method was higher than that of the commercially available chromium-promoted Raney cobalt catalyst. The catalytic activities of chemically and electrochemically leached alloy were 0. 47 h- 1 and 0. 95 h- 1, respectively, whereas the activity of commercial catalyst was only 0. 37 h- 1. The surface area of electrochemically leached sample was higher than the one of the chemically leached and the commercial sample. From this study, {{it was found that the}} activities and surface morphologies of the catalysts depend on the initial composition of the alloys and on the leaching conditions. nrpages: 163 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Electrolyte {{transport}} {{across two}} preparations of mucosa from rat colon descendens {{was compared to}} determine what influence the submucosal plexus has on <b>electrolyte</b> transport. One <b>preparation</b> consisted of the mucosa, muscularis mucosae, and the submucosal tissue and {{is referred to as}} the mucosa-submucosa preparation. The second preparation obtained by further blunt dissection of the mucosa-submucosa preparation consisted of only the mucosa and the circular muscle layer of muscularis mucosae and {{is referred to as the}} mucosa preparation. Histological studies showed that the submucosal tissue and the longitudinal layer of muscularis mucosae could be removed leaving only the mucosa and the circular layer of muscularis mucosae. The extensive neuronal network of the submucosa was shown when the submucosal tissue and longitudinal muscle layer of muscularis mucosae, which were removed, were stained histochemically for acetylcholinesterase activity. Both the mucosa-submucosa and mucosa preparations absorbed Na+ and Cl- when short-circuited. However, Na+ and Cl- absorption were significantly higher in the mucosa preparation. The increase in Na+ and Cl- transport in the mucosa preparation was accompanied with a decrease in the short-circuit current (Isc), the open-circuit potential difference (p. d.) and the transmural tissue conductance (Gt) when compared to the mucosa-submucosa preparation. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin which blocks specifically the propagation of action potentials in excitable tissues, dose-dependently decreased Isc and p. d. in the mucosa-submucosa preparation when added to the serosal solution. The half-maximal effective concentration of TTX was 5 nM and maximal effective concentration 100 nM. TTX (1 microM) had no effect on Isc or p. d. when added to the mucosal solution. The decrease in Isc and p. d. caused by TTX in the mucosa-submucosa preparation was accompanied with an increase in Na+ and Cl- absorption. TTX caused only a small decrease in Isc and p. d. in the mucosa preparation. However, there was no measurable change in Na+ and Cl- transport in the mucosa preparation. The results suggest that spontaneously active neurones from the submucosal plexus have an inhibitory influence on the mucosa. Physical removal of the submucosal plexus or pharmacological blockade of the neurones within the mucosa-submucosa preparation by TTX led to enhanced absorption, suggesting that the set point of the mucosa for electrolyte transport is at or near a maximal absorptive state. Regulation or modulation of the mucosa may therefore occur by mechanisms that lower this set point, causing an inhibition of absorption of electrolytes...|$|R
