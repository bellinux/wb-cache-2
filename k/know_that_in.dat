5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing}} to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|Orazio died {{suddenly}} in 1639. Artemisia {{had her own}} commissions to fulfill after her father's death, {{although there are no}} known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had already left England by 1642, when the civil war was just starting. Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of Sicily, who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period.

25|$|But {{the alleged}} {{right to a}} new trial is not a {{sufficient}} guarantee for the defendant, as clearly ruled the ECtHR {{in the case of}} Krombach v. France, application no. 29731/96, and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti's claim against extradition, doesn't prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that there is not an absolute right to a new trial, after a trial in absentia. Battisti's claim concerned the defendant's knowledge of the trial, and Battisti's lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Italy there was a trial against him and so his rights had been violated.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Clarence Gamble, an American physician, {{established}} {{a network of}} birth control clinics in Puerto Rico {{during the period of}} 1936 to 1939. He believed that Puerto Rican women and the women from other American colonies, did not have the mental capacity and were too poor to understand and use diaphragms for birth control as the women in the United States mainland. He inaugurated a program funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, which would replace the use of diaphragms with foam powders, cremes and spermicidal jellies. He did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the past Rosa Gonzalez had publicly battled with prominent physicians and named her and Carmen Rivera de Alvarez, another nurse who was a Puerto Rican independence advocate, to take charge of the insular birth control program. However, the insular program lacked funding and failed.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that, {{although}} brats move on average every 3 years, {{they do not}} grow accustomed to moving. The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price. Rather than develop problem-solving skills, there is a temptation to simply leave a problem without resolving it. If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a few years somebody will move and the problem will disappear. On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse. Studies show that many brats become very adaptable {{as a result of}} the mobile lifestyle, But there is also a higher than average incidence, among a minority of military brats, of Avoidant Personality Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder.|$|E

How do I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?"

500|$|With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin {{has been}} {{credited}} with introducing to music {{a new sense of}} nationalism.

If the mighty autocrat in the north [...] could <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music.

500|$|The {{intervention}} of the Rothschilds bore the quickest fruit in Austria. The head of the Rothschild family bank in Vienna, Salomon Mayer von Rothschild, played the key role in raising financing for the Austrian Empire, {{and he had a}} very close relationship with the Austrian chancellor von Metternich. On April 10, Metternich dispatched instruction regarding both the Damascus and Rhodes affairs to Bartholomäus von Stürmer, ambassador in Constantinople, and Anton von Laurin, consul in Alexandria. In his dispatch, Metternich wrote: [...] "The accusation that Christians are deliberately murdered for some blood-thirsty Passover festival is by its nature absurd…" [...] Regarding the Rhodes case, the chancellor instructed von Stürmer [...] "to tip the wink to the Turkish regime, so that they instruct pasha of Rhodes accordingly and that you let [...] vice-consul in Rhodes <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> such cases he should work in the spirit of sensible mediation." [...] Von Stürmer, responded, [...] "here have been no persecutions against the Jewish population, at least not by the authorities." ...|$|E

500|$|The team {{wanted to}} avoid {{punishing}} the player for applying everyday logic in Maniac Mansion. Fox noted that one Sierra game features {{a scene in which}} the player, without prior warning, may encounter a game over screen simply by picking up a shard of glass. He characterized such game design as [...] "sadistic", and he commented, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying". Because of the project's nonlinear puzzle design, the team struggled to prevent no-win scenarios, in which the player unexpectedly became unable to complete the game. As a result of this problem, Gilbert later explained, [...] "We were constantly fighting against the desire just to rip out all the endings and just go with three characters, or even sometimes just one character". Lucasfilm Games had only one playtester, and many dead-ends went undetected as a result. Further playtesting was provided by Gilbert's uncle, to whom Gilbert mailed a floppy disk of the game's latest version each week.|$|E
