We've raised our {{kids in a}} {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.|$|E

I think it's enough for me... My energies are going in different directions—over the last few years I've made a number of political speeches at various locations and ceremonies... I'm using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> very, very worrying as things stand." [...] Some of this later poetry included [...] "The 'Special Relationship'", [...] "Laughter", and [...] "The Watcher".|$|E

He shot {{a commercial for}} Rock the Vote and, along with his sister, visited the University of Southern California {{to encourage students to}} vote during the 2004 U.S. election. He also campaigned for Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. He has said, however, that [...] "it frustrates me when actors talk politics; I'm political and I make choices in my movies that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> political. I try and say things with what I do. Rightly or wrongly, young actors have all the power." [...] In an interview for Rendition, he remarked that [...] "it's a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors".|$|E
500|$|Chandler upset many in {{the black}} {{community}} by voting against an anti-lynching bill soon after taking office. The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties where illegal lynchings occurred. Of his vote against the bill, Chandler remarked, [...] "I am against lynching by anybody and of anybody, black or white, but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> too severe." [...] The bill passed in the House of Representatives, but died in the Senate. Later, Chandler joined with senators from other southern states in opposing the repeal of poll taxes, long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting.|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E

500|$|During season two, Perrineau stated [...] "'s nicer than I {{expected}} him to be. Or, he is nicer so far than I {{expected him}} to be ... I try to take characters that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate. I think Michael is all those things. He seems {{to have a lot of}} bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E
500|$|In a quote used by Columbia University Press, Garner praised Animal Rights Without Liberation {{for being}} the first {{sustained}} attempt to use an interest-based theory of rights for animals, {{and the first to}} use such a theory to challenge animals' right to liberty. In his 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals, Garner challenges Cochrane on his use of the argument from marginal cases. If animals are assumed to have an equal interest in life as typical humans because marginal humans are, then one could also assume animals to have an equal interest in liberty, because of the assumption of marginal humans' interest in liberty. Cochrane, however, denies that marginal humans are assumed to have a strong interest in liberty. The first part of the argument, Garner observes, assumes that marginal humans are considered to have an equal interest in (or an equal right to) life; this is a claim which Garner challenges, reaching what he considers a more nuanced position than Cochrane's. Nonetheless, the ideal theory which Garner endorses—the enhanced sentience position—is close to Cochrane's interest-based rights position. Garner himself identifies differences between his thought and Cochrane's in their respective use of the argument from marginal cases and the fact that Garner offers a nonideal theory, while Cochrane does not. Garner also questions the extent to which Cochrane is right that his reliance on interest rights is new, suggesting that Feinberg, James Rachels and Steve Sapontzis all used the language of interest rights. Garner adds that [...] "what Cochrane does, unlike Sapontzis, is to draw what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> the correct conclusions from the adoption of an interest-based theory of animal rights".|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|About {{political}} partisanship, C.K. states, [...] "Some things <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> very conservative, or very liberal.

[...] Although the general custom among Jews was to pray towards the temple in Jerusalem, Clement of Alexandria, Origen's older contemporary, says that the custom of praying eastward was general even among non-Christians: [...] "In correspondence with the manner of the sun's rising, prayers are made looking towards the sunrise in the east. Whence also the most ancient temples looked towards the west, that people might be taught to turn to the east when facing the images." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolo's slogan-daubed car was {{a regular}} sight {{in the streets of}} Sydney, with protests of {{everything}} from smoking to royalty to religion. Until this time, there had been no anti-police slogans on the vehicle. However, never one to back down, Rolo then added the ambiguous [...] "Pigs are definitely not Kosher" [...] and the less ambiguous [...] "Support honest police, they both need you". He stated the Police harassment made him more determined to continue his antics. [...] "I left Argentina because it is run by a police-military fascist regime.

2500|$|Because of a {{contract}} he signed with Bang Records without legal advice, Morrison states {{that he has never}} received any royalties for writing or recording this song. The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid, and after those expenses were recouped, the revenue would become the [...] "subject of some highly creative accounting." [...] Morrison vented frustration about this unjust contract in his sarcastic nonsense song [...] "The Big Royalty Check."
