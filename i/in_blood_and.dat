5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept in normal sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a malaria vaccine. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E
40|$|The key {{question}} {{addressed in this}} paper is whether geographical differences <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy reflect differences in social capital. We do find considerable spatial variation <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy between municipalities in the Netherlands. But we do not find that <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy have strong or even moderately positive relations with each other or with indicators of prosocial norms and engagement in voluntary associations. However, voter turnout is strongly related to both <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy. We conclude that the spatial variation <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> donation <b>and</b> philanthropy is not {{due to differences in}} social capital. ...|$|R

5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
