Present day {{threats to the}} species are collisions with vessels, entanglement in ﬁshing gear, and environmental variability. In this body of work we quantify the relationship between right whales and their prey, ricegrain sized crustaceans called copepods, and employ a spatial model to predict the potential distribution of right whales on a weekly basis. Time series datasets of right whale abundance and copepod concentration were analyzed to quantify the relationship between right whales and their prey. We found signiﬁcant relationships between right whales and copepods in Cape Cod Bay and the Great South Channel. These results tell us that accurate regional-scale models of copepod concentration {{can be used to}} infer the time and location of good right whale feeding conditions. The environmental niche of right whales was characterized using modeled prey abundance, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and bathymetry. With environmental data for the time and location of each right whale occurrence between 2002 and 2006, we trained and tested a model to predict right whale habitat suitability on a weekly basis. The accuracy of predictions was good, and the feasibility of our approach was veriﬁed. Results suggest that right whale habitat preferences are dynamic and that the distribution of prey is an important to the distribution of whales. We built an operational forecasting model of right whale habitat suitability in Cape Cod Bay, and used it to make weekly predictions for the year 2009. Modeled concentration of two right whale prey taxa (C. ﬁnmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp.) sea surface temperature, chlorophyll and bathymetry were used as predictor variables. Predictions were veriﬁed with occurrences of right whales in Cape Cod Bay from 2009. Model output was used to assess the utility of moving shipping routes in Cape Cod Bay. The model was then projected, beyond the model-training region, into Massachusetts Bay. Results suggested that altering of shipping lanes in Cape Cod Bay is unlikely {{to reduce the risk of}} ship-strikes. A signiﬁcant positive relationship was found between predicted habitat suitability and the number of acoustic detections of right whales in Massachusetts Bay. We conclude that our modeling approach could be used to: 1) issue weekly forecasts of right whale habitat quality, 2) assess conservation actions, 3) guide survey effort in other regions, and ultimately to reduce <b>human-caused</b> <b>risk</b> to the right whales...|$|E
40|$|In ocean ecosystems, many of {{the changes}} in {{predation}} risk - both increases and decreases - are human-induced. These changes are occurring at scales ranging from global to local and across variable temporal scales. Indirect, risk-based effects of human activity are known to be important in structuring some terrestrial ecosystems, but these impacts have largely been neglected in oceans. Here, we synthesize existing literature and data to explore multiple lines of evidence that collectively suggest diverse human activities are changing marine ecosystems, including carbon storage capacity, in myriad ways by altering predation risk. We provide novel, compelling evidence that at least one key human activity, overfishing, can lead to distinct, cascading risk effects in natural ecosystems whose magnitude exceeds that of presumed lethal effects and may account for previously unexplained findings. We further discuss the conservation implications of <b>human-caused</b> indirect <b>risk</b> effects. Finally, we provide a predictive framework for when human alterations of risk in oceans should lead to cascading effects and outline a prospectus for future research. Given the speed and extent with which human activities are altering marine risk landscapes, it is crucial that conservation and management policy considers the indirect effects of these activities in order to increase the likelihood of success and avoid unfortunate surprises. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{disturbance}} were explored for red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Scottish Highlands, {{by studying the}} distribution, behaviour and diet composition of deer in areas that were disturbed or less disturbed by human recreation, in different habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) and {{at different times of}} year.   The <b>human-caused</b> predation <b>risk</b> hypothesis states that there are similarities between the responses elicited by wild animals towards human recreational disturbance and predation.   This hypothesis was tested by comparing behaviour during the recreation season (spring and summer) and the hunting season (autumn and winter). Deer densities were lower in disturbed areas than less disturbed areas throughout the year, although {{there was no difference in}} relative habitat use as a result of disturbance. Habitat selection was primarily influenced by season, with grasslands having higher deer densities during the spring and summer and heather moorlands having higher densities during the winter. Behaviour was monitored using scan sampling of groups.   The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher, resulting in a smaller number of deer feeding in disturbed than less disturbed areas during the recreational season.   Vigilance was higher in disturbed grassland and heather moorland than undisturbed woodland, while behaviour was similar in disturbed woodland and the less disturbed habitats.   In disturbed heather and woodland and in all less disturbed habitats, the majority of animals were standing while vigilant, whilst in disturbed grassland, lying was the main mode of vigilance.   Deer were more likely to be close together when vigilance levels were high.

40|$|Fear of {{predation}} {{can have}} a major impact on the behaviour of prey species. Despite recent codifying of the concept of the ecology of fear, there has been relatively little focus on how these ideas apply to large carnivore species which, although not prey sensu stricto, may experience fear as a result of threats from humans. This thesis argues that large mammalian carnivores are subject to a Landscape of Fear similar to that described for prey species, and will respond behaviourally to fear of human-caused mortality. The idea of a "Landscape of Coexistence" is introduced to denote the perceived risk from humans and associated behavioural responses that can be overlain on spatio-temporally heterogeneous landscapes. Literature on the ecology of fear for large mammalian carnivores and, as there is a dearth of such literature, the current theory on the ecology of fear for other guilds is reviewed, and how this might inform large carnivore behaviour in a Landscape of Coexistence is explored. Behavioural effects of <b>human-caused</b> mortality <b>risk</b> are revealed for lions living in a human dominated landscape (Laikipia County, Kenya), specifically how lions adjust their movement patterns, habitat use and foraging tactics when in proximity to humans. It is argued that these behavioural adjustments represent a trade-off between maximising fitness enhancing activities and minimising the <b>risk</b> of <b>human-caused</b> mortality, thus need to be taken into consideration along with the lethal effects of humans when explaining the density, distribution and behaviour of lions throughout much of their remaining range. Although fear is generic, 'human-caused mortality risk' represents a distinct and very important sub-set of the ecology of fear for the carnivore guild. The existence of a Landscape of Coexistence has implications for understanding their foraging ecology, and ultimately their population dynamics and role in the ecosystem, and is therefore, important for the conservation of large carnivores throughout large parts of their remaining ranges. </p...|$|R
