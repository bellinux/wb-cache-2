40|$|The main {{research}} {{objective was to}} analyze and evaluate different systems of table egg production by using the multiple criteria analysis, the method of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in decision making within strategic planning of production. The survey involved 79 producers of table eggs registered in the Records on laying hens’ farms in the Republic of Croatia. In the first stage, the research defined the criteria and sub-criteria for system evaluation which were compared in pairs {{in order to determine}} the weight or importance for each of them. Alternatives were evaluation based on definition of priorities of examinees and the extent to which they meet each of the defined criteria and sub-criteria. Intensity of examinees’ preferences were entered into the Expert Choice software in order to evaluate ranking results of egg production systems. Defined model consisted of a quantitative criterion of economic indicators, and the other two referred to qualitative criteria, market indicators and technical-technological factors. Each criterion had its corresponding sub-criteria that were evenly distributed in numerical order. Based on individual assessments of the examinees, overall cumulative evaluation was obtained for the table egg production systems. Accordingly, the most acceptable alternative to egg production is the <b>indoor</b> <b>keeping</b> system (priority 0. 301). It is followed by the free-range system of keeping laying hens (priority 0. 253). The third-ranked alternative is egg production by hens kept in conventional cages (priority 0. 226), while the fourth-ranked least acceptable alternative, as of the total evaluation, is the ecological system of egg production (priority 0. 220). Taking into account the obtained results of multiple criteria evaluation as well as EU and world trends in changing consumers’ habits including food safety and quality as well as customers’ preferences towards local market and local products, it is recommended that eggs should be produced by laying hens kept in an <b>indoor</b> <b>keeping</b> system. In this sense, organized egg production on small farms in an <b>indoor</b> <b>keeping</b> system offers a possibility for self-employment serving as a source of additional income certainly has great potentials for development...|$|E
40|$|The {{ornamental}} aquaculture comprises both outdoor and <b>indoor</b> <b>keeping</b> {{of aquatic}} {{animals and plants}} for ornamental purpose {{which is a very}} popular hobby with many followers worldwide. It is also commercially profitable for specialized producers and vendors. Associated environmental risks include particularly introduction of non-native species, biological invasions and intensive field capture of exploited and marketed species. Since subsequent regulation, mitigation and eradication of naturalised alien species is very difficult and ineffective in many cases, the most important above all is to prevent new introductions. This trend is accented with a short delay in European legislature. The European Union (EU) currently initiates formation of list of the most invasive alien species. Although invasive potential of certain ornamental species such as red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is well known, the vast majority of traded species has never been tested and analysed from this point of view. Publications attached to this thesis are focused on monitoring and survey of market with ornamental animals, such as fishes and crayfishes, with special emphasis on list of advertised species, size classes, prices, origin and availability on market. With use of predictive models the probability of naturalisation and potential invasiveness of mentioned ornamental species were estimated. These information are supported by analysis of hobbyist behaviour. Results in present thesis highlight known environmental risks associated with ornamental aquaculture and also show detailed information about overlooked risks from the Czech Republic's as well as from EU perspective. Therefore this thesis should to help formation of aforementioned list of the undesirable species...|$|E
40|$|With {{progressively}} faster global change, {{shifts in}} phenology, and distributional ranges are reported for {{an increasing number}} of species. The success of organisms at coping with novel seasonal conditions depends on the mechanisms that determine their schedules. Species that rely on fixed schedules and those that time their activities by predictive cues may be particularly constrained in their ability to accommodate changes. The present study examines rigid scheduling and its implications for breeding in captivity in an avian model taxon, the Stonechat (Saxicola torquata). Within their extensive breeding range, Stonechats differ geographically in migratory behavior and reproduce and molt under a wide range of daylengths (10 – 17 h). Stonechats time their activities by programs that involve circannual rhythms and photoperiodism. The study reports reproductive timing of four taxa (central European, Irish, Siberian, and Kenyan), relates it to laydates in the field, and investigates modifying influences of housing conditions and of social context. Reproductive consequences of timing programs were then tested by crossbreeding of taxa with different schedules. The study revealed persistent, population-specific breeding windows in captivity. Resident Stonechats from equatorial Kenya synchronized their reproductive cycles with the European summer, presumably in response to local photoperiod, and bred at similar times as northern migrants. In all other taxa schedules matched those in the field, but were timed slightly earlier in captivity and advanced by <b>indoor</b> <b>keeping</b> conditions. Influences of social context were negligible. In pairs with clutches, testes regressed slightly later than in pairs without clutches, but presence of a mate per se had no influence on breeding cycles. Accordingly, crossbreeding Stonechats were predicted to have limited capacity to adjust schedules to those of their mates. This prediction was tested by crossbreeding of single-clutched Siberian long-distance migrants with multiple-clutched European short-distance migrants. Males and females of both taxa retained their characteristic breeding schedules, regardless of their mate's activities. This led to dramatic loss of reproductive success in the population with the longer breeding season, European Stonechats. Siberian Stonechats were unable to profit from the presence of a sexually active mate, but they suffered no disadvantage from crossbreeding. In a changing world, inherited timing programs may severely constrain responses to novel conditions, impose schedule-dependent, asymmetric costs of hybridization, and contribute to directional gene flow or to reproductive isolation...|$|E

Detailed instructions for experiments and observations {{as well as}} for capturing invertebrates can be found in this diploma thesis. There are described also long-term projects in the form of inquiry-based teaching tasks, construction of man-made outdoor insect nests (so-called "insect hostels") and also the <b>indoor</b> invertebrate <b>keepings.</b> The vast majority of tasks were tested in practice in two science hobby groups, attended by a total of 30 participants. The aim of these tasks is to increase the attractiveness and accessibility of natural science to a wider audience and improving its presentation, but also to arouse positive attitude to nature and all living creatures. Inspiration will be found there not only by leaders of natural science clubs, but also by teachers, who want to incorporate practical work with animals into teaching.

3000|$|The {{practice}} of <b>keeping</b> <b>indoor</b> plants {{has been studied}} as an important expression of organic decoration i.e. “biophilia” [28], which psychologically brings inhabitants closer to nature. Interior plants have been studied for their health and workplace benefits. The presence of indoor plants has been said {{to create an environment}} that promotes wellness and holistic health [29], and indoor foliage has been shown to improve health and reduce stress in hospital patients [30]. In another study, after the introduction of office flora, worker participants were more productive and less stressed [31]. It has also been shown that windows overlooking greenery produce the same stress-reducing effects as having indoor plants [32]. However, it is unclear specifically where, geographically, plant-rearing is a common practice [...]...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{positioning}} algorithms {{have been}} recently introduced {{to overcome the}} limitations of traditional methods, relying on GNSS or other terrestrial infrastructure. In particular, SPAWN (Sum-Product Algorithm over a Wireless Network) was shown to provide accurate position estimate even in challenged indoor environments, thanks to exchange of local information among peers based on terrestrial ranging. In this paper we extend the SPAWN framework by considering a hybrid scenario, where agents combine satellite and peer-to-peer terrestrial measurements. The novel hybrid SPAWN (H-SPAWN) approach allows increased availability and robustness compared to GNSS-only positioning in light and deep <b>indoor</b> scenarios, while <b>keeping</b> the advantages of a distributed implementation of the original SPAWN. A parametric message representation is proposed to reduce the communication overhead, and to improve the estimation accuracy.

40|$|Competitiveness {{of table}} egg {{production}} in the Republic of Croatia {{is closely related to}} the process of adjustment to EU standards. Following the EU legislative, laying hens will be kept in improved cages and within alternative keeping systems (outdoor keeping, deep litter <b>keeping</b> and <b>indoor</b> caged layer <b>keeping).</b> In order to determine prerequisites for table egg production development, the present research aimed at evaluating investment requirements table egg producers were faced with. Obtained research results proved that production infrastructure and equipment at about 80 % of analyzed farms did not meet required standards, and only 20 % of producers could assure technical and technological conditions as required by the legal regulations. While being in the process of EU standards adjustment, producers indicated that the greatest threat was primarily found in the increase of production costs, and secondly in the lowering production capacities. Sustainability of production and competitiveness of table egg producers would be possibly assured by efficient production organization which would involve horizontal relations between producers...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of autonomous airborne platforms {{have long been}} considered for applications in surveillance, exploration and search and rescue. For example, an autonomous blimp or airship, able to navigate through complex unstructured environments, {{could be used to}} survey the aftermath of dangerous earthquake zones, or be employed to provide unique replay angles in sporting events. Therefore autonomous airships fill an important gap in the spectrum of aerial observations, supplying images with better resolution and much more acquisition flexibility than those acquired through satellite or airplanes. This paper proposes to configure a semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for research into navigation and tracking through visual servoing using an airborne robotic platform. The architecture incorporates an object detection/tracking algorithm, which aims to provide robust performance under practical <b>indoor</b> environments. Station <b>keeping</b> techniques are also integrated to allow the airborne platform to hover in a static position above a desired target. Through combining the Circular Hough Transform with a number of image processing techniques, a resilient landmark segmentation algorithm is produced. ‘Path Prediction’, ‘Velocity Prediction’ and a ‘Dynamic Radius’ algorithm are developed to improve the speed and reliability of visual tracking. In addition, a ‘Heuristic Grid’ approach is examined as a means of performing station holding with the autonomous platform. The system is capable of segmenting and tracking the desired landmark from an image scene. A series of control commands are then sent to the autonomous vehicle to successfully keep the target within the image window...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{identified}} that the incorporation of vegetation in built-environments is a sustainable solution for reducing the energy demand for thermal comfort and air quality in tropical climate and reducing building related stress to improve the human condition. Even though {{a considerable amount of}} research has been carried out in order to identify the effect of vegetation on built-environment, hardly any guideline can be found in such incorporation. This study is aimed at the development of guidelines for incorporation of vegetation in built-environments in national scale. In order to achieve this objective incorporation of vegetation in both indoor and outdoor was studied separately. Initially the effect of the indoor plant on indoor environment was studied in order to quantify the amount of plants to be kept inside a room. This quantification was carried out based on the CO 2 absorption capacity. An equation was developed to determine the amount of leaf area per space, using absorption rate and ventilation rate as parameters. The need for a database of CO 2 absorption rates for varying species was identified consequently. Framework criteria to develop such database were also identified based on theory, literature review, and experiments. Experiments were carried out in a large-scale chamber with and without plants, and varying several conditions. The identified framework criteria are indoor temperature and relative humidity, lighting source and combinations, orientation of windows, leaf area density per window length, existing CO 2 concentration and night time CO 2 emission. The opinion survey was carried out to identify the public preference towards <b>keeping</b> <b>indoor</b> plants. Majority of the respondents preferred to have indoor plants majorly due to the visual comfort provided by the plants. Subsequently, incorporation of vegetation in outdoor micro-climates was studied. An experimental study was carried out to measure temperature, relative humidity, CO 2, NO 2, and PM 2. 5 concentrations in five residential buildings selected based on their micro-climatic features. A parametric study was also carried out using CFD based software, ‗ENVI-met‘ in order to identify strategies to design and plan garden vegetation for residential buildings. The computer models were validated for win...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of Review: Sensitization to {{pets and}} animal dander {{is a risk}} factor for atopic eczema, {{allergic}} rhinitis, and asthma, and it has been assumed that pet ownership was a risk for sensitization. Several studies in the past decade have attempted to address this question, but it is still not clear if this is true and how we should advise our patients on the issue of pet ownership. Background: Many children around the United States suffer from allergies including allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma. The most common indoor allergens were generated from molds, house dust mites, and household pets. Repeated trips to the emergency room and doctor 2 ̆ 7 s office for allergy related conditions are strenuous on the medical community as well as the patient 2 ̆ 7 s and their families. It has been common practice to advise families who suffer from allergies to avoid <b>keeping</b> <b>indoor</b> pets. Results from recent studies have challenged this practice, as they show negative associations between early-life exposure to domestic pets and occurrence of atopy-related conditions. Atopic eczema is a common condition that affects more than one in ten children, and the incidence is only rising. It is defined as an itchy inflammation of the skin which causes a dry, red, flaky or scaly rash, also known as atopic dermatitis. Affected individuals must cope with a significant psychosocial burden, in addition to dealing with the medical aspects of the disease. Asthma is a disease caused by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli, which results in episodic narrowing and inflammation of the airways. Asthma can be a debilitating disease as well as a deadly disease if not taken seriously. According to the Center of Disease Control (CDC), in 2004 alone, there were a total of 198, 000 hospitalizations for asthma in children, and a total of 186 children died from asthma. Allergic rhinitis is defined as inflammation of the nasal passages that causes symptoms including sneezing, itching, nasal congestion, runny nose, and post-nasal drip. The most recent data from the CDC is a 1993 census that suggests at least 35. 9 million people have symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, and up to 79. 5 million people experience greater than 7 days of nasal and ocular symptoms yearly. Objective: To find a correlation between indoor pets and childhood allergies including atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. As well as compile the latest recommendations for our patients and their families who suffer from these diseases. Methods: An extensive literature review and search was completed via Ovid and PubMed. Three main articles were used to compile this data 2 ̆ 2 Early Pet Exposure: Friend or Foe 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Exposure to Dogs and Cats in the First Year of Life and Risk Allergic Sensitization at 6 to 7 Years of Age 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 Exposure to Pets and Atopy-related Diseases in the First 4 Years of Life. 2 ̆ 2 These articles were published from 2001 - 2003. For the latest data and up to date literature a more complete literature review was complied from research as current as this year, 2007. Results: The majority of studies reviewed found either no association or a decrease in risk of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma amongst pet owners. While there were a few articles that support the findings of an increased risk of asthma with an increased amount of animal dander. In the case of atopic eczema, the correlation between the presence of house dust mites and an increase in symptoms was stronger than animal dander and an increase in symptoms. The results of this literature review indicate that early-life exposure to pets or a lifestyle associated with pets might reduce the risk of developing atopy-related diseases, specifically asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Specific recommendations on whether patients who suffer from atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, or asthma, should or should not avoid pets were not conclusive through this literature review. Even with multiple articles in support of both sides, a general consensus has not been reached in the medical community. Although recommendations can be made to help decrease the amount of allergens in the home to hopefully decrease the symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema...|$|R
