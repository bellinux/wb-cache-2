5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E
2500|$|The Bell 212 {{registered}} as G-BDIL was a twin-engine two-bladed medium helicopter manufactured on 18 July 1975. For the flight the rear bench seats were removed to allow fitting a rescue winch, leaving only two rear seats available {{and the remaining}} two cabin crew using safety harnesses. The aircraft had an Certificate of Airworthiness that was valid until 30 January 1983 and a Certificate of Maintenance that was valid until 27 October 1982 or 7,567.5 airframe hours. The airframe had a total of 7,532.25 hours {{at the time of}} the accident. [...] The gross weight of the aircraft and the estimated center of gravity were both within authorized limits. [...] The aircraft had two liferafts installed and all six personnel were wearing immersion survival suits and life vests with personal locator beacons. The aircraft was also equipped with a SARBE beacon and an underwater locator beacon, both activated by immersion in salt water. [...] Available navigation equipment installed included a <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System,</b> VOR, and ADF receivers. During the flight, the co-pilot had asked for the non-directional beacon located on the Murchison platform to be turned on to assist in finding the Baffin Seal but the beacon remained off until after the accident because the platform's radio operator was fixing an equipment issue.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> was a {{hyperbolic}} {{radio navigation}} system which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons. The system used phase comparison of low frequencies from 70 to 129 kHz, as opposed to pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN. This made {{it much easier to}} implement the receivers using 1940s electronics.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> {{consisted}} {{of a number of}} land-based radio beacons organised into chains. Each chain {{consisted of}} a master station and three (occasionally two) secondary stations, termed Red, Green and Purple. Ideally, the secondaries would be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the master at the centre. The baseline length, that is, the master-secondary distance, was typically 60-120 nmi km.|$|E
50|$|Accurate heading {{information}} was {{supplied by the}} Azimuth Datum Instrument (ADI), a star tracker mounted on a periscope so that it projected its display on a plate {{in front of the}} navigator. Using angle measurements similar to those taken with a sextant, the aircraft heading could be accurately determined. For initial position fixes, Gee was replaced with the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> (Mark 6), which directly output measurements on three dials.|$|E

50|$|The {{gyrocompass}} {{was introduced}} in 1908 while ship's radar came in after the 1930s. Radar is also used on land for monitoring the position of shipping, for example in the Strait of Dover which is the busiest area of sea in the world. The <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> was a hyperbolic radio navigation system that was installed around the coasts of Britain in the 1940s. It was phased out after the introduction of satellite-based navigation from the 1960s. The echo sounding {{was introduced in}} the 1930s to determine water depth.|$|E
50|$|The {{first such}} {{system to be}} used was the World War II-era Gee, {{introduced}} by the Royal Air Force for use by RAF Bomber Command. This {{was followed by the}} <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> in 1944 by the Royal Navy, along with LORAN by the US Navy for long-range navigation at sea. Post war examples including the well-known US Coast Guard LORAN-C, the international Omega system, and the Soviet Alpha and CHAYKA. All of these systems saw use until their wholesale replacement by satellite navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Delrac system, Dectra was {{essentially}} the normal <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>system</b> with the modification of several existing transmitter sites. These were {{located at the}} East Newfoundland and Scottish chains, which were equipped with larger antennas and high-power transmitters, broadcasting 20 times {{as much energy as}} normal chain stations. Given that the length of the chain baselines did not change, and were relatively short, at long distance the signal offered almost no accuracy. Instead, Dectra operated as a track system; aircraft would navigate by keeping themselves within the signal defined by a particular Decca lane.|$|E

He then became Director-General of Civil Aviation Navigational Services until his second retirement in 1959. He would spend the next two years representing the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Company before returning to England.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1960s, ICAO {{began the}} process of {{introducing}} a standardized radio navigation system for medium-area coverage {{on the order of}} a few hundred kilometres. This system would replace the older Low-frequency radio range and similar systems used to navigate over national ranges. A number of proposals were submitted, including ones based solely on angle measurements like VOR, solely on distance measures like DME, combinations, or systems that output a location directly, like <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> and Loran-C.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} World War II the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Co. Ltd. {{was formed}} (1945) and the system {{expanded}} rapidly, particularly in areas of British influence; at its peak it was deployed {{in many of the}} world's major shipping areas. More than 15,000 receiving sets were in use aboard ships in 1970. There were 4 chains around England, 1 in Ireland and 2 in Scotland, 12 in Scandinavia (5 each in Norway and Sweden and 1 each in Denmark and Finland), a further 4 elsewhere in northern Europe and 2 in Spain.|$|R
50|$|In the UK and Ireland, {{the system}} was {{implemented}} as a maritime navigation aid {{to fill the gap}} left by the demise of the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System</b> in 2000. With a network of 12 transmitters sited around the coastline and three control stations, it was set up in 1998 by the countries' respective General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA) — Trinity House covering England, Wales and the Channel Islands, the Northern Lighthouse Board covering Scotland and the Isle of Man and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, covering the whole of Ireland. Transmitting on the 300-kHz band, the system underwent testing and two additional transmitters were added before {{the system was}} declared operational in 2002.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} its many advantages, {{the high cost of}} {{implementing}} a Loran-C receiver made it uneconomical for many users. Additionally, as military users upgraded from Loran-A to Loran-C, large numbers of surplus Loran-A receivers were dumped on the market. This made Loran-A popular in spite of being less accurate and fairly difficult to operate. By the early 1970s the introduction of integrated circuits combining a complete radio receiver began to greatly reduce the complexity of Loran-A measurements, and fully automated units the size of a stereo receiver became common. For those users requiring higher accuracy, Decca had considerable success with their <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>system,</b> and produced units that combined both receivers, using Loran to eliminate the ambiguities in Decca.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{implement}} the timing measurements needed for a hyperbolic navigation system, pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN, and phase-timing systems like the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> <b>System.</b> The former requires sharp pulses of signal, and their accuracy is generally limited to how rapidly the pulses can be turned on and off, which is, in turn, a function of the carrier frequency. There is an ambiguity in the signal, the same measurements can be valid at two locations relative to the broadcasters, but in normal operation these are hundreds of kilometers apart so one possibility can be eliminated. The second system requires constant signals ("continuous wave") and is easy to use even at low frequencies. However, its signal is ambiguous over the distance of a wavelength, meaning there are hundreds of locations that will return the same signal, referred to as cells in Decca. This demands some other navigation method to be used in conjunction to pick which cell the receiver is within.|$|E
50|$|Another British {{system from}} the same era was <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator.</b> This {{differed}} from Gee primarily in that the signals were not pulses delayed in time, but continuous signals delayed in phase. By comparing the phase of the two signals, the time difference information as Gee was returned. However, this was far easier to display; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation. As the circuitry for driving this display was quite small, Decca systems normally used three such displays, allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes. Decca found its greatest use post-war on ships, and remained in use into the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Company of London {{sued the}} United States {{government}} over patent infringements, {{claiming that the}} Omega system {{was based on a}} proposed earlier Decca system known as DERLAC, Decca Long Range Area Coverage, that had been disclosed to the US in 1954. Decca cited original US documents showing the Omega system was originally referred to as DERLAC/Omega. Decca won the case and was awarded $44,000,000 in damages. Decca had previously sued the US government for alleged patent infringements over the LORAN C system in 1967. Decca won its case, but as the navigation system was judged to be a military one, no damages were paid by the US.|$|R
50|$|The tanker did {{not have}} a {{scheduled}} route and as such lacked a complement of full scale charts of the Scilly Islands. To navigate the region, the vessel used LORAN, but not the more accurate <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator.</b> When a collision with a fishing fleet became imminent, there was some confusion between the Master and the helmsman as to their exact position. Significant further delay arose due to uncertainty as to whether the vessel was in manual or automatic steering mode. By the time the problem was corrected, a grounding was unavoidable. In the hours and days to follow, extensive attempts to float the vessel off the reef proved unsuccessful, and even resulted in the death of a member of the Dutch salvage team, Captain Stal.|$|R
