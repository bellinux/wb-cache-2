5|$|Some sources, {{including}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the F {{version of that}} work, state that Æthelred was transferred in 870 from the Bishopric of Wiltshire to the see of Canterbury. However, the transfer has now been proven to be taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Ælfric of Abingdon, who was archbishop from 995 to 1005. Although {{the story of his}} transfer is false, Æthelred was consecrated as archbishop in 870. Why he was selected for Canterbury is unknown, as there is no contemporary information on his election.|$|E
5|$|Son of God {{consists}} of a single series of three episodes. Each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of Jesus's life. The episodes take the format of Bowen visiting significant locations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, talking head interviews with 21 historians and Biblical experts, and reenactments of Jesus's life featuring Israeli actor Liron Levo. Locations from Jesus's time—such as Caesarea, Yatta and Sepphoris—were recreated by archaeologists using evidence from buildings and street plans, and were then digitised into computer graphics by Red Vision.|$|E
5|$|The Brancacci Chapel, in the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del Carmine, was founded around 1366/7 by Piero di Piuvichese Brancacci. The chapel passed to Piero's nephew, Felice Brancacci, who some time between 1423 and 1425 commissioned the painter Masolino {{to decorate the}} walls {{with a series of}} frescoes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Saint Peter. Peter was the name-saint of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice also reflected support for the Roman papacy during the Great Schism.|$|E

5|$|The current church building, {{erected in}} 1868–1869, {{is the second}} {{structure}} built at the site, and {{is an example of}} the Broken Ashlar or Rustic mode of Gothic Revival architecture patterned after medieval English parish churches. The interior nave features several stained-glass windows depicting scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Jesus of Nazareth fabricated by J Lamb Studios. On 24 September 1992, Christ Church, Newton was included on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places as part of the Newton Town Plot Historic District which was approved and entered on the National Register of Historic Places on 12 November 1992.|$|E
5|$|Much {{the most}} {{prominent}} decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King CharlesV of France, Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. CharlesV was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' feast day, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, {{to be ready for}} his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to CharlesVI.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (talas) ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) are {{used at the}} top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 {{are the most important}} monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.|$|E

5|$|The Entombment is a glue-size {{painting}} on linen {{attributed to the}} Early Netherlandish painter Dieric Bouts. It shows {{a scene from the}} biblical entombment of Christ, and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a wing panel for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece. The now-lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height – two on either side – depicting scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> Christ. The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of the Holy Sacrament. The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a Venetian patron whose identity is lost. The Entombment was first recorded in a mid-19th century Milan inventory and has been in the National Gallery, London since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1861.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed {{to give the impression}} of ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels of which have been recovered. They show scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on {{the palms of}} his hands and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the west window dates from 1875; it was made by Clayton and Bell and depicts the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Also by Clayton and Bell is a window at {{the west end of}} the north wall of the nave {{depicting}} Enoch, Noah, Job and Abel. To the east of this is a window designed by Michael Farrar-Bell dated 1985, to the memory of a local farmer, depicting the Creation. Beyond this is a window from 1901 made by Reuben Bennett which depicts the Good Shepherd with David and Miriam. On the south wall of the nave is a window from 1919 by Harry Clarke depicting Richard Coeur-de-Lion, saints and military emblems. In other windows on the south wall there are fragments of old glass. The north wall of the north transept contains a window with stained glass by Kempe which incorporates some pieces of medieval glass and depicts the Tree of Jesse. On the east wall of the transept are two windows by John Hardman which date from 1862 and 1864. The south transept contains a window dating from 1855 with stained glass by William Wailes. The east window was reglazed in 1876 by Clayton and Bell; it shows episodes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Christ with figures of apostles and prophets. In the porch is more stained glass by Kempe, dating from 1878.|$|E

5|$|Tulsidas {{himself has}} given {{only a few}} facts and hints about events {{of his life in}} various works. Till late nineteenth century, the two widely known ancient sources on Tulsidas' life were the Bhaktamal {{composed}} by Nabhadas between 1583 and 1639, and a commentary on Bhaktamal titled Bhaktirasbodhini composed by Priyadas in 1712. Nabhadas was a contemporary of Tulsidas and wrote a six-line stanza on Tulsidas describing him as an incarnation of Valmiki. Priyadas' work was composed around a hundred years after the death of Tulsidas and had eleven additional stanzas, describing seven miracles or spiritual experiences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Tulsidas. During the 1920s, two more ancient biographies of Tulsidas were published based on old manuscripts – the Mula Gosain Charit composed by Veni Madhav Das in 1630 and the Gosain Charit composed by Dasanidas (also known as Bhavanidas) around 1770. Veni Madhav Das was a disciple and contemporary of Tulsidas and his work gave a new date for Tulsidas' birth. The work by Bhavanidas presented more narratives in greater detail as compared to the work by Priyadas. In the 1950s a fifth ancient account was published based on an old manuscript, the Gautam Chandrika composed by Krishnadatta Misra of Varanasi in 1624. Krishnadatta Misra's father was a close companion of Tulsidas. The accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars, whereas some other scholars have been unwilling to dismiss them. Together, these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of Tulsidas are based.|$|E
