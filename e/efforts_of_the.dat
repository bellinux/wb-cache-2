The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E

As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1861, a {{sequence}} of events led to the independence and unification of Italy (except for Venetia, Rome, Trento and Trieste, known as Italia irredenta, which were united {{with the rest of}} Italy in 1866, 1870, and 1918 respectively); this period of Italian history is known as the Risorgimento, or resurgence.

Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming {{to the idea}} of merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management.

5|$|Episcopalianism had {{retained}} supporters {{through the}} civil wars and changes of {{regime in the}} seventeenth century. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions {{in the first half}} of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of the Highlands and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement benefited the secessionist churches who gained recruits.|$|E
