5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the <b>flatback</b> turtle and the green turtle.|$|E

25|$|The {{tone of the}} <b>flatback</b> is {{described}} as warm or mellow, suitable for folk music and smaller audiences. The instrument sound does not punch through the other players' sound like a carved top does.|$|E
40|$|Six {{species of}} sea turtles {{occur in the}} Pacific Ocean (green turtles, loggerheads, leatherbacks, hawksbills, olive ridleys and <b>flatbacks).</b> All species, except <b>flatbacks,</b> have transboundary distributions. The status of most sea turtle stocks in the Pacific Ocean is poorly understood. Some stocks are increasing, such as in eastern Australia and Hawaii. However, there is {{evidence}} that many stocks have been reduced significantly, which is mainly a result of overharvesting of eggs, subsistence or commercial harvest of large turtles and nesting habitat destruction. Incidental capture in coastal and pelagic fisheries can also be an important source of mortality for some stocks. Abundance trends for the six Pacific species of sea turtles are reviewed, using the best available quantitative information...|$|R
50|$|In the USA Program, women level four, five, or six do front handsprings on vault whereas men do {{not compete}} the skill until level six. Women level three do handstand <b>flatbacks</b> on vault opposed to men who perform a {{straight}} jump at level four and a front tuck at level five onto stacked mats. In both programs level seven {{all the way to}} elite can perform a variety of vaults.|$|R
25|$|Like the bowlback, the <b>flatback</b> has a round sound hole. This {{has been}} {{sometimes}} modified to an elongated hole, called a D-hole. The body has a rounded almond shape with flat or sometimes canted soundboard.|$|E
25|$|Vietnamese luthiers {{have worked}} with {{mandolin}} design. Mandolins being made in Vietnam today for the international market use the French <b>flatback</b> style. However, some Vietnamese luthiers have added their own innovation, putting sound holes in the mandolins' sides.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} 30 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, {{including}} the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, humpback whale and dugongs. Six species of sea turtles breed on the GBR – the green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, <b>flatback</b> turtle and the Olive Ridley.|$|E
25|$|The {{green sea}} turtle {{is a member of}} the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study {{clarified}} the status of genus Chelonia with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous Eretmochelys (hawksbill), Caretta (loggerhead) and Lepidochelys (Ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous Chelonia warranted their status as a genus, while Natator (<b>flatback)</b> was further removed from the other genera than previously believed.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{coast is}} visited by six species of sea turtle: the <b>flatback,</b> green sea, hawksbill, olive ridley, loggerhead and the {{leatherback}} sea turtles; all are protected in Australian waters. There are 35 species of Australian freshwater turtles from eight genera {{of the family}} Chelidae. The pig-nosed turtle is the only Australian turtle not of that family. Australia is the only continent without any living species of land tortoise.|$|E
25|$|The Algerian mandole was {{developed}} by an Italian luthier in the early 1930s, scaled up from a mandola until it reached a scale length of approximately 25-27 inches. It is a <b>flatback</b> instrument, with a wide neck and 4 courses (8 strings), 5 courses (10 strings) or 6 courses (12 strings). Used in music in Algeria and Morocco. The instrument can be tuned as a guitar, oud or mandocello, depending on the music {{it will be used}} to play and player preference. When tuning it as a guitar the strings will be tuned (E2) (E2) A2 A2 D3 D3 G3 G3 B3 B3 (E4) (E4). Strings in parenthesis are dropped for a five or four course instrument. Using a common Arabic oud tuning D2 D2 G2 G2 A2 A2 D3 D3 (G3) (G3) (C4) (C4). For a mandocello tuning using fifths C2 C2 G2 G2 D3 D3 A3 A3 (E4) (E4).|$|E
25|$|Indications for bracing: {{people who}} are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced {{according}} to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will fit into this table. For example, a person who is still growing with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or <b>flatback</b> could be considered for nighttime bracing. On {{the opposite end of the}} growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.|$|E
2500|$|Mandolins have a {{body that}} acts as a resonator, {{attached}} to a neck. The resonating body may be shaped as a bowl (...) or a box (...) [...] Traditional Italian mandolins, such as the Neapolitan mandolin, meet the necked bowl description. The necked box instruments include the carved top mandolins and the <b>flatback</b> mandolins.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{drawback}} of the Harrington Rod {{is that it}} straightens out {{the normal}} front to back curvature of the segment of the spine that is fused, which in many patients results in a flat back deformity, also known as [...] "flatback syndrome". [...] Advances in surgical techniques and technology in the late 1990s were eventually able, in most cases, to correct scoliosis without causing <b>flatback</b> syndrome, leading to the gradual phasing out of the Harrington Rod.|$|E
2500|$|The second decline {{was not as}} {{complete}} as the first. Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument. Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century, players began using new versions of the mandolin in new forms of music. Luthiers created the resonator mandolin, the <b>flatback</b> mandolin, the carved-top or arched-top mandolin, the mandolin-banjo and the electric mandolin. Musicians began playing it in Celtic, Bluegrass, Jazz and Rock-n-Roll styles — [...] and Classical too.|$|E
2500|$|Three of the {{sea turtles}} that live within the Cape Byron Marine Park which are {{considered}} threatened under the Species Conservation Act 1995 are the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) which is defined as endangered and the Green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) [...] which are both defined as vulnerable. These turtles are also considered threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 along with the Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricate) and the <b>flatback</b> turtle (Natator depressus).|$|E
2500|$|After {{the rise}} of the Soviet Union, bowlback mandolins were not {{imported}} in the numbers they had been. Although possibly that had much to with the turmoil starting in 1917, of the country being reorganized into a communist state, the timing also coincides with the drop in popularity worldwide, as the mandolin's Golden Era peaked. The bowlback didn't just disappear, as they are common in photos of mandolin orchestras in Eastern Europe in the 1930s. However, the mandolins produced in Soviet factories were of the cheap, <b>flatback,</b> [...] "Portuguese" [...] style—widespread throughout the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|The modern cittern {{may also}} be loosely {{included}} in an [...] "extended" [...] mandolin family. It resembles the <b>flatback</b> mandolins, but predates them, {{dating back to the}} Renaissance. It is typically a five course (ten string) instrument having a scale length between [...] The instrument is most often tuned to either D2–G2–D3–A3–D4 or G2–D3–A3–D4–A4, and is essentially an octave mandola with a fifth course at either the top or the bottom of its range. Some luthiers, such as Stefan Sobell also refer to the octave mandola or a shorter-scaled Irish bouzouki as a cittern, irrespective of whether it has four or five courses.|$|E
2500|$|Studebaker {{prepared}} well {{in advance}} for the anticipated post-war market and launched the slogan First by far with a post-war car. [...] This advertising premise was substantiated by Virgil Exner's designs, notably the 1947 Studebaker Starlight coupé, which introduced innovative styling features that influenced later cars, including the <b>flatback</b> [...] "trunk" [...] instead of the tapered look of the time, and a wrap-around rear window. Exner's concepts were spread through a line of models like the 1950 Studebaker Champion Starlight coupe The new trunk design prompted a running joke that one could not tell if the car was coming or going.|$|E
2500|$|Modern mandolinists such as Avi Avital and Joseph Brent use {{instruments}} customized, {{either by}} the luthier's choice or {{at the request of}} player. Joseph Brent's mandolin, made by Brian Dean also uses what Brent calls a false back. [...] Brent's mandolin was the luthier's solution to Brent's request for a loud mandolin in which the wood was clearly audible, with less metallic sound from the strings. The type used by Avital is variation of the <b>flatback,</b> with a double top that encloses a resonating chamber, sound holes on the side, and a convex back. It is made by one manufacturer in Israel, luthier Arik Kerman. Other players of Kerman mandolins include Alon Sariel, Jacob Reuven, and Tom Cohen.|$|E
