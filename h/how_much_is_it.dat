2500|$|On 11 August 2014, Ibrahimović paid US$51,000 to {{send the}} Swedish {{national}} football team for the intellectually disabled to the INAS World Football Championships in Brazil. After teammates Johan Elmander, Kim Källström, Andreas Isaksson and Per Nilsson donated autographed jerseys to be auctioned off for the cause, Ibrahimović responded, [...] "What {{the hell are you}} going to do with a shirt? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to go?".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came down}} for the trip," [...] said Miss Harris; [...] "that is all about it. There is nothing to make a fuss about. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> Captain Gibbs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, really, Mr. Tudor, I {{would do}} more for you than any other young man that I know, if you were {{only a little more}} punctual. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> you want now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] said Mary, [...] "I could but {{answer him}} as I did, Sadler and Somer being both nigh. I {{gave him my}} purse, with all there <b>was</b> therein. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> Andrew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that I know of," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{have heard}} nothing from her. By the bye, I lost {{some money to}} you at bridge the other evening. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Do you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis strange, most strange, {{that you}} should have gone into the lion's den, and have come out unscathed. Strange, indeed, that Glendower, who, as we know, is greatly in want of money, should have fixed your ransom at a low sum. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> Sir Oswald?" ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{far from}} this idea are the great masses of our really wealthy and well-to-do Londoners? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> needed, that wise men {{should try to}} re-awaken in them the sense of {{corporate}} life, and literally civilize them once more! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well, I can soon settle his business," [...] the Professor {{said to the}} children, [...] "if you'll {{just wait}} a minute. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> this year, my man?" [...] The tailor had come in while he was speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be {{feared that}} some towering professors, upon {{impartial}} self-examination, will find upon themselves some of these black spots; {{all of which are}} utterly inconsistent with that humility which is the proper and only becoming garb of a Christian.--Ryland--ED.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hutton felt ashamed. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> his own lack {{of sympathy}} that {{prevented}} her from feeling well every day? But he comforted himself by reflecting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only {{a case of}} feeling, not of being better. Sympathy does not mend a diseased liver or a weak heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "For an old woman? I am fifty-five. I {{have had}} many doctors. I {{would put them}} all in prison. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> you paid Dr. Stickney, in New York, Adolf? Five {{thousand}} dollars? And he did nothing--nothing. I'd rather be poor again, and work. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well {{to make the best}} of it."...|$|R
6000|$|... "A glance suffices to {{show that}} his mind <b>is</b> made up <b>how</b> <b>much</b> higher <b>it</b> <b>is</b> prudent to rise, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> ballast <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{expedient}} to preserve.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bacri," [...] he said, sitting down, {{while the}} master of the house stood respectfully before him, [...] "thou knowest the object of my visit--eh? Come, it {{is not the first time}} thou hast had to do with such as I. The plot thickens, Bacri, and thou must play thy part, willing or not willing. Say, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] he jubilated; [...] "not only do I feed better, {{and live}} more comfortable, and hold up my {{end with the}} fellows; but I'm {{actually}} saving money--or you are for me. Here I am, with furniture being paid for regular every month, and a little woman I'm mad over, {{and on top of}} it money in the bank. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Business before pleasure. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> Twelve dollars? For the {{privilege}} of suffocating in this compact little Black Hole? By my halidom, Comrade Gooch, that gentleman whose name you are so shortly to tell us has a very fair {{idea of how to}} charge! But who am I that I should criticise? Here are the simoleons, as our young friend, Comrade Maloney, would call them. Push me over a receipt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{all very}} wonderful, mother," [...] he said; [...] "and I {{should never have}} {{thought for a moment}} that you were so brave, and could have put things {{together}} like that, and could have carried out such a scheme. But I am awfully glad you have succeeded; because you had set your mind on it, and the money will I hope make you quite comfortable. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> after all mother? You never told me that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [This speech, though rather inadequately reported, {{was one of}} {{the best}} {{delivered}} on this occasion. That <b>it</b> <b>was</b> creditable to Mr. Vandenhoff's taste and feelings, the preceding sketch will show; but <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so, <b>it</b> does not show.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] thought I, [...] "this {{must be the}} secret." [...] I {{knew that}} scarce a ship came in from any Chinese port but she carried somewhere, behind a {{bulkhead}} or in some cunning hollow of the beams, a nest of the valuable poison. Doubtless there was some such treasure on the Flying Scud. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> worth? We knew not; we were gambling in the dark. But Trent knew, and Bellairs; and we could only watch and judge.|$|R
6000|$|Sleight {{looked at}} his {{companion}} attentively. [...] "You might have said so at first, and let up on this camp-meetin' exhortation. Well then--admitting you've got {{the old man and}} the young girl on the same string, and that you've played it pretty low down in the short time you've been there--I suppose, Dick Renshaw, I've got to see your bluff. Well, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it!</b> What's the figure you and she have settled on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. How deeply {{is it to}} be regretted, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be {{wondered}} at, that, in {{a country}} whose school of painting, though degraded by its system of meretricious coloring, and disgraced by hosts of would-be imitators of inimitable individuals, is yet raised by the distinguished talent of those individuals {{to a place of}} well-deserved honor; and the studios of whose sculptors are filled with designs of the most pure simplicity, and most perfect animation; the school of architecture should be so miserably debased! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will soon}} be cleared up," [...] she said, [...] "and then we shall feel quite dull. Of course all {{business}} men have these little ups and downs. Why, I suppose of all the men you meet upon 'Change, {{there is not one}} who has not some such story to tell. If everything was always smooth, you know, then of course every one would turn stockbroker, and you would have to hold your meetings in Hyde Park. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that you need?" ...|$|E
50|$|With {{a number}} of {{operational}} prototype Optacons available, an {{effort was made to}} get them in daily use by blind people in the community. The engineers were anxious to know how well the Optacon components held up in a real life environment, what uses were made of the Optacon, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> used, and <b>how</b> important <b>was</b> <b>it</b> in educational, vocational, and daily living. Several blind people in the Palo Alto community volunteered to participate, and Carolyn Weil was hired to coordinate, teach, and document this part of the project.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{would he}} be any the happier for it, dear uncle? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> better <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> the master of a square-rigged craft than to be master of a round-rigged craft?" ...|$|R
50|$|According to the Town of Berkley Board of Assessors, {{the island}} has a total area of 0.75 acre. There is no {{differentiation}} in the description between <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> land and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> water. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> covered predominantly in grass {{with a few}} small cedar trees.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I were Darvell I wouldn't take wages {{from such}} a skunk as you,' said Crinkett. 'A man as has robbed his {{partners}} of every shilling, and has married a young lady when he has got another wife living out in the colony. At least she {{was out in the}} colony. She ain't there now, Darvell. She's somewhere else now. That's what your master is, Darvell. You'll have to look out for a place, because your master'll be in quod before long. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> they gets for bigamy, Jack? Three years at the treadmill;--that's about it. But I pities the young lady and the poor little bastard.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be regretted, that so enlightened {{and able}} a divine as Smith, had not philosophically and scripturally enucleated this so {{difficult}} yet important question,--respecting the personal {{existence of the}} evil principle; that is, whether as [Greek (transliterated): to theion] of paganism is [Greek: o theos] in Christianity, so the [Greek: to ponaeron] is to be [Greek: o ponaeros],--and whether this is an express doctrine of Christ, and not merely a Jewish dogma left undisturbed to fade away under the increasing light of the Gospel, instead of assuming the former, and confirming the position by a verse from a poetic tissue of visual symbols,--a verse alien from the subject, and by which the Apocalypt enigmatized the Neronian persecutions and the apostacy through fear occasioned by it in {{a large number of}} converts.|$|E
60|$|In {{this tour}} {{my wife and}} her sister Sara were my companions. The account of the Brownie's Cell, and the Brownies, was given me by a man we met with {{on the banks of}} Loch Lomond, a little above Tarbert, and in front of a huge mass of rock by the side of which, we were told, preachings were often held in the open air. The place is quite a solitude, and the {{surrounding}} scenery very striking. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be regretted that, instead of writing such poems as the 'Holy Fair,' and others in which the religious observances of his country are treated with so much levity, and too often with indecency, Burns had not employed his genius in describing religion under the serious and affecting aspects it must so frequently take.|$|E

50|$|As {{the series}} title suggests, the {{audience}} submitted items of art, and Rothschild {{would tell them}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth.|$|R

6000|$|Diabolus continued: [...] "You are {{a man of}} merit, {{and want}} money; you will starve on your merit; you can only get money from me. Come, my friend, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> I ask the easiest {{interest}} in the world: old Mordecai, the usurer, has made you pay twice as heavily before now: nothing but the signature of a bond, which is a mere ceremony, and the transfer of an article which, in itself, is a supposition--a valueless, windy, uncertain property of yours, called, by some poet of your own, I think, an animula, vagula, blandula--bah! there is no use beating about the bush--I mean A SOUL. Come, let me have it; you know you will sell it some other way, and not get such good pay for your bargain!"--and, having made this speech, the Devil pulled out from his fob a sheet {{as big as a}} double Times, only there was a different STAMP in the corner.|$|E
60|$|For the {{preservation}} of the Church Establishment, all men, whether they belong to it or not, could they perceive their true interest, would be strenuous: but how inadequate are its provisions for the needs of the country! and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be regretted that, while its zealous friends yield to alarms on account of the hostility of Dissent, they should so much overrate the danger to be apprehended from that quarter, and almost overlook the fact that hundreds of thousands of our fellow-countrymen, though formally and nominally of the Church of England, never enter her places of worship, neither have they communication with her ministers! This deplorable state of things was partly produced by a decay of zeal among the rich and influential, and partly by a want of due expansive power in the constitution of the Establishment as regulated by law. Private benefactors, in their efforts to build and endow churches, have been frustrated, or too much impeded by legal obstacles: these, where they are unreasonable or unfitted for the times, ought to be removed; and, keeping clear of intolerance and injustice, means should be used to render the presence and powers of the Church commensurate with the wants of a shifting and still-increasing population.|$|E
6000|$|The {{design of}} the {{following}} essay is to consider, in a short and direct way, some of the limits that are set by sound reason {{to the practice of}} the various arts of accommodation, economy, management, conformity, or compromise. The right of thinking freely and acting independently, of using our minds without excessive awe of authority, and shaping our lives without unquestioning obedience to custom, is now a finally accepted principle in some sense or other with every school of thought that has the smallest chance of commanding the future. Under what circumstances does the exercise and vindication of the right, thus conceded in theory, become a positive duty in practice? If the majority are bound to tolerate dissent from the ruling opinions and beliefs, under what conditions and within what limitations is the dissentient imperatively bound to avail himself of this toleration? How far, and in what way, ought respect either for immediate practical convenience, or for current prejudices, to weigh against respect for truth? For <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> well that the individual should allow the feelings and convictions of the many to count, when he comes to shape, to express, and to act upon his own feelings and convictions? Are we only to be permitted to defend general principles, on condition that we draw no practical inferences from them? Is every other idea to yield precedence and empire to existing circumstances, and is the immediate and universal workableness of a policy to be the main test of its intrinsic fitness? ...|$|E
