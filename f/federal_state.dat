40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{survey was}} conducted to assess “attitudes towards risk and safety at work”, and more general attitudes to work among vets {{four to five years}} after German unification. Clear differences were observed between the old (West) and new (East) <b>Federal</b> <b>States</b> of Germany. Stress levels were significantly higher in the new <b>Federal</b> <b>States</b> but, interestingly, the city of Berlin shared the low stress features of employees in the former West Germany. Social cohesion or working climate was generally perceived more favourably in the new <b>Federal</b> <b>States.</b> Satisfaction at work was not significantly related to job stress, and did not show such clear differences between new and old <b>federal</b> <b>States.</b> Individuals from the new <b>federal</b> <b>States</b> were more emotional in their driving styles, less risk-taking and more safety conscious than their colleagues in the older <b>federal</b> <b>States.</b> The implications of these findings are discussed. © 1999, MCB UP Limite...|$|R

5|$|Taxes in the United States are levied at the <b>federal,</b> <b>state,</b> {{and local}} {{government}} levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by <b>federal,</b> <b>state</b> and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP. During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%). Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Keating's {{national}} {{reputation on}} the issue led President Nixon to appoint him to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, which had been begun under Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon B.

Keating, Nixon's only appointee on the 18-person commission, was the leading commission dissenter from the report.|$|E

A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level: the bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial).|$|E
5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in <b>federal,</b> <b>state,</b> and local governments an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E

The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million alone for police, fire and medical services.

5|$|Due to {{cutbacks in}} <b>federal,</b> <b>state</b> and local budgets, UCF has had over $140 million in funds cut from its {{operating}} budget since 2008.

So far UCF {{has been able}} to endure the budget cuts by implementing a hiring freeze, putting an end to some faculty perks, such as free seminars, cutting executive pay, and through wise management of funds. To help counter the budget decreases, the university received $18 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. UCF's operating budget for the 2014–15 fiscal year is $1.5 billion, a 13.9% increase from the previous year.

According to later claims, Gaddafi's paternal grandfather, Abdessalam Bouminyar, was killed by the Italian Army during the Italian invasion of 1911. At World War II's end in 1945, Libya was occupied by British and French forces. Although Britain and France intended on dividing the nation between their empires, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) declared that the country be granted political independence. In 1951, the UN created the United Kingdom of Libya, a <b>federal</b> <b>state</b> under the leadership of a pro-Western monarch, Idris, who banned political parties and centralized power in his monarchy.|$|E

5|$|History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1648) {{covers a}} period {{in the history of}} Poland and Lithuania, before their joint state was {{subjected}} to devastating wars {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. The Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a more closely unified <b>federal</b> <b>state,</b> replacing the previously existing personal union of the two countries. The Union was largely run by the Polish and increasingly Polonized Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, through the system of the central parliament and local assemblies, but from 1573 led by elected kings. The formal rule of the proportionally more numerous than in other European countries nobility constituted a sophisticated early democratic system, in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in the rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a <b>federal</b> <b>state</b> in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ is a {{descendant}} of the pan-German and national liberal camp (Lager) {{dating back to the}} Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. During the interwar era, the national liberal camp (gathered in the Greater German People's Party) fought against the mutually-hostile Christian Social and Marxist camps in their struggles to structure the new republic according to their respective ideologies. After a short civil war, the <b>Federal</b> <b>State</b> of Austria, an authoritarian Christian Social dictatorship, was established in 1934. By 1938, with the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany, the national liberal camp (which had always striven for an inclusion of Austria into a Greater Germany) had been swallowed whole by Austrian National Socialism and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism. Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime, and the national liberal camp was scarred after the war due to guilt by association with National Socialism.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} Central Committee's Division for Agriculture {{initially}} was Edwin Hoernle, with whom Rau had come from Stuttgart. Hoernle had been elected to the Executive Committee of the Comintern (ECCI) in November 1922 and Rau succeeded him as division chief the following year. Afterwards, Rau also became a leading member of various national and international left wing farmer and peasant organisations. From 1923 onward, {{he was a member}} of the Secretariat of the International Committee of the Agricultural and Forest Workers and beginning in 1924 of the executive committee of the Reich Peasant Federation (Reichsbauernbund). In 1930 this was followed with a membership on the International Peasants' Council in Moscow and in 1931 he became an office member of the European Peasant Committee. From 1928 to 1933 he was also member of the Preußischer Landtag, the Prussian <b>federal</b> <b>state</b> parliament. There he joined the committee on agricultural affairs of the parliament and became its chairman.|$|E
5|$|This {{demand was}} {{far-reaching}} and required {{transformation of the}} empire into a <b>federal</b> <b>state,</b> placing Lithuania {{on a par with}} the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian constitutional system. Heated discussions continued on the means to achieve this transformation. Some argued for armed resistance, but were reminded that the previous uprisings in November 1831 and January 1863 had failed. Others suggested peaceful and passive resistance: refusing to pay taxes, boycotting products from monopolistic companies (mostly those selling alcoholic beverages), not allowing children to attend Russian schools, evading drafts into the Russian army, and organizing factory worker strikes. The delegates, who were mostly small farmers, also discussed land reform, demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it. However, no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage the peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening in other parts of the Russian Empire.|$|E
