40|$|Abstract. A 4 <b>inch</b> {{drill pipe}} {{assembly}} {{has been developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 <b>inch</b> diameter holes. Normally, 6 <b>inch</b> diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> pipe with 4 - 3 / 4 <b>inch</b> OD tool joints because the tool joints for 4 <b>inch</b> pipe are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and tool joint and 5 <b>inch</b> or 5 - 1 / 4 <b>inch</b> OD tool joints are usually welded to 4 <b>inch</b> pipe. A 5 <b>inch</b> OD tool joint is too large for an overshot in a 6 <b>inch</b> diameter hole. A 4 <b>inch</b> drill pipe assembly with a 4 - 3 / 4 <b>inch</b> OD tool joint has been developed that can be used in 6 <b>inch</b> diameter holes. Four <b>inch</b> pipe has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> pipe such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. ! The results of finite element analysis on the tool joint. ! Full-scale lab testing of the tool joint. ! Case histories of similar assemblies. Drill String Design. The design of a drill string or selection of drill pipe size, weight and grade is based on three parameters...|$|R
