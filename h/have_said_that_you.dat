2500|$|You have, as {{you have}} {{proposed}} and {{as the president has}} commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. You're also talking about the government picking up {{a big part of the}} catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper two percent. You heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that. I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'He {{has friends}} here, no doubt,' pursued Carker. 'I perceive, {{from what he}} <b>has</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> go into society here. Do you know,' smiling horribly, 'I am so very glad <b>that</b> <b>you</b> go into society!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gino <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a boat {{which will}} do the {{friendly}} office to {{put me on the}} quay when our conference is over," [...] she remarked, with a presence of mind that luckily met the expedient of her late companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{recognized}} them {{as being}} the voices of angels the third time that you heard them. What angels were they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{before you}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have forgiven me!" [...] he entreated as he {{clung to her}} white draperies with a passionate gesture of appeal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah,--that's {{just the}} question. If anybody had asked me, I should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were {{the man of}} all men whom I could have best trusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah me; as I {{look back}} upon it all, how strange it seems. I dare say you don't {{remember}} the first day I met you, at Mr. Mildmay's,--when I asked {{you to come to}} Portman Square because Barrington <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were clever?" ...|$|R
50|$|Charlie Christensen {{uses his}} friends as {{inspiration}} for the characters and story's in Arne Anka. One of his friends <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sometimes notice <b>that</b> Charlie Christensen gets a particular look {{and then a few}} weeks later you read what you just said in an Arne Anka strip.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, Ament had a paper [...] "The Religions of China" [...] {{published}} in The Student Missionary Appeal: Addresses at the Third International Convention of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, {{in which he}} indicated: [...] "Some one <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot {{tell the truth about}} the Chinese without lying. They are the most irreligious people {{on the face of the}} earth." ...|$|R
60|$|Oddly enough, I {{encountered}} neither. But {{when you}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have said everything, for {{in every other}} way the conditions could scarcely have been fouler.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you were}} with Clark in Illinois?" [...] said the Baron, craftily. [...] "Pardon me, Mr. Ritchie, but I should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are too young." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay;--it is mine; {{it shall}} be mine if you love me, dear. I {{will tell you what}} story. They <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love your cousin, Earl Lovel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s a very {{extraordinary}} thing, we two {{coming together}} like this,” {{she said with}} conviction. “You coming in without knowing I was here and then telling me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can’t very well {{go out of the}} room. That sounds funny. I wouldn’t have been angry if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn’t. It would have hurt me. But nobody ever paid much attention to my feelings. Why do you smile like this?” ...|$|R
2500|$|Nonetheless Ziętek in {{his memoirs}} was {{disappointed}} {{with the results of}} the peace agreement that was pushed through by the British: [...] "Everywhere, our struggle for freedom was met with disdain, especially by British politicians. Lloyd George was the most infamous of them all, <b>having</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can not give a watch to a monkey because the animal will break it, implying that the watch was Silesia and the monkey Poland“ ...|$|R
2500|$|Part of {{what you}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> and Senator Kerry <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to do}} in order to get us out of the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials <b>have</b> both <b>said</b> they <b>have</b> no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{other day}} {{they said you}} were trifling with him, and you almost proved that you were not; lately they <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> be not, and you {{straightway}} begin to show--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The king {{then had}} the eleven {{brothers}} called before him, {{and said to}} them, 'You <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can get me a dove which has feathers of gold and silver time about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you laugh}} so?" [...] asked Hilda, reddening; {{for she was}} a little {{disturbed}} at Kenyon's ridicule, however kindly expressed. [...] "What can I <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think so very foolish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Leonard, she <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> wished it, {{she would}} come {{as if you were}} lying on your bed at home, and with more reverence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. He {{walked away}} from me to the window, and {{considered}} a little. Then he turned round suddenly and said 'What did you tell me was Mr. Sebright's opinion? Mr. Sebright thought she would be relieved instead of being terrified. In that case, what need is there {{for me to go}} away? You can acknowledge at once that she has seen your face, and not mine?' He put {{his hands in his pockets}} when he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> (<b>you</b> know Nugent's downright way)--and turned back to the window as if he had settled everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am tired, and I {{fear that}} I shall lack {{strength}} for to-morrow." [...] Oh, Linda, Linda! But, indeed, had you foreseen the future, <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> truly <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would want strength on the morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{brothers}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could, if you liked, get {{for me a}} lamp {{that can}} shine over seven kingdoms. That lamp must be mine within three days, or it will cost you your lives.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were having}} such a good time, Sir Henry," [...] he observed; [...] "in fact I should have thought {{you would have been}} rather glad of an {{opportunity}} to slip away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{speak to}} you like this," [...] the girl went on, [...] "but it's because I feel from what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know and love America. And I think I can help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Offer {{it to her}} unasked. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> already <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{would not}} accept her hand {{if you did not}} believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had her heart also,--and the {{sentiment}} did you honour. Think of her condition, and be generous to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Prince {{laid his}} hand upon his shoulder. [...] "It {{is the little}} cock of Tilford Bridge," [...] said he. [...] "On my father's soul, I <b>have</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would win your way. Did you receive the King's surrender?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Just after this, while Mr. Turnbull {{was still}} going on {{with a variety of}} {{illustrations}} drawn from the United States, Barrington Erle stepped across the benches up to the place where Phineas was sitting, and whispered a few words into his ear. [...] "Bonteen is prepared to answer Turnbull, and wishes to do it. I told him <b>that</b> I thought <b>you</b> should have the opportunity, if you wish it." [...] Phineas was not ready with a reply to Erle at the spur of the moment. [...] "Somebody told me," [...] continued Erle, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would like to speak to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! how {{wonderful}} {{you were in}} that act, Joe.' Aunt Julia sighed. 'Do you remember the back-fall you used to do down the steps? I always <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did the best back-fall in the profession.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{know of a}} coverlet, {{the most}} {{beautiful}} in the whole world, and which sounds over eight kingdoms when anyone touches it. You shall procure it for me, or else lose your lives,' said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are Cæsar," [...] {{answered}} Marcus. [...] "Now it is {{sunset and}} I am free; accompany {{me to my}} house, I pray you, for there much business waits me in which I need counsel, who am overborne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And go, Gonzaga. Get you to bed, {{and sleep}} {{you into a}} saner frame of mind. We will forget all this <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never speak of it again--nor of this love you say you bear me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, now, {{what have}} {{you to tell me}} about the Termagant? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> already <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are one of her crew, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were in the boat that day when we had a row about the whale. What more can you tell me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, they'd like to come; {{but whether}} it would be a {{pleasure}} after they were here is another thing. I should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> wanted to have them, they would enjoy better being simply asked to meet our own immediate family." ...|$|R
