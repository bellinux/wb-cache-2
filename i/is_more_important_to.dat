5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E
5|$|To help Rahul fight his alcoholism, Aarohi {{attempts}} to rehabilitate Rahul, sacrificing her singing career in doing so. After Saigal reminds {{them about their}} dream of Aarohi becoming a successful singer, Rahul orders her to focus on her work. During Aarohi's stage show, Rahul meets a journalist backstage, who accuses him of using Aarohi for pleasure and money. Furious, Rahul beats up the journalist and starts drinking. He ends up in jail, and Aarohi comes to bail him out. Rahul overhears Aarohi telling Saigal that {{she is going to}} leave her career for him and is ready to give up her celebrity status because Rahul <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> her. Rahul understands that he has become a burden in her life, and that leaving her is his only option to save her. The next day, he bids her farewell by assuring her that he will change his lifestyle and commits suicide by jumping from a bridge.|$|E

25|$|Robert Birrell has {{asserted}} that high immigration levels {{are being used}} by the Federal Government to stimulate aggregate economic growth, but that per capita growth <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Australians. Birrell concluded that high migration does not benefit existing residents, because it dilutes the benefit that can accrue from the export of non-renewable resources which form {{a large part of the}} Australian economy. As well, Birrell argues that a slowdown in labour force growth would require employers to pay greater attention to training, wages and conditions of workers.|$|E
25|$|Nick Bostrom {{has argued}} that from a {{utilitarian}} perspective, space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live {{for a very long}} period of time (possibly billions of years), which would produce an enormous amount of utility (or happiness). He claims that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner. In his paper, he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Transcortical aphasias include transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, {{and mixed}} transcortical aphasia.

Patients with transcortical sensory and mixed transcortical aphasia have poor comprehension and unawareness of their errors. Despite poor comprehension and more severe deficits in some transcortical aphasias, small {{studies have indicated that}} full recovery is possible for all types of transcortical aphasia.

25|$|DCC {{would fall}} into the {{chromosomal}} instability category. The chromosomal region of 18q has shown consistent LOH for nearly twenty years. Approximately 70% of primary colorectal cancers display LOH in this region, and the percentage increases when comparing early to advanced cancers. This increase in DCC loss in advanced cancer may indicate that DCC loss <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> tumour progression than tumour formation. However, region 18q is not the location of DCC alone, and many studies are in conflict when reporting whether 18q LOH is attributable to DCC or other tumour suppressor candidates in the neighbouring areas. Many reviews refuse to comment on DCC due to its history of conflicting information, stating that more study is required.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of active}} sonar by a {{submarine}} to determine bearing is extremely rare {{and will not}} necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the position of a}} hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|The {{recovery}} {{swings the}} arms sideways {{across the water}} surface to the front, with the elbows straight. The arms should be swung forward {{from the end of}} the underwater movement, the extension of the triceps in combination with the butterfly kick will allow the arm to be brought forwards relaxed yet quickly. In contrast to the front crawl recovery, this arm recovery is a ballistic shot. The only other way of lifting the arms and the shoulders out of the water is by dropping one's hip. Therefore, the recovery, at least the acceleration of the arms, is in no way relaxed. It is important not to enter the water too early, because this would generate extra resistance as the arms moved forward in the water against the swimming direction, however, during longer distances, this cannot be avoided, and it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> avoid dropping one's hips. A high elbow recovery, as in front crawl, would be disadvantageous because of the natural undulations that are partially caused by the recovery and the relaxed movement caused by the momentum of a triceps extension. Limitations of the shoulder movement in the human body make such a motion unlikely. Hands should enter into the water again at 11 and one with thumbs entering first and pinkie last.|$|E

25|$|The {{baseball}} behaves {{differently in}} those stadiums with artificial turf as well. Artificial surfaces are harder and more uniform than grass, {{and the ball}} tends to roll farther and straighter, and to bounce truer and more highly on these fields. Teams built to play {{the majority of their}} games on this field tend to place a higher premium on defence (since it is more likely to get an infield out) and speed (since it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> be able to beat out a throw) than on power hitting. The altitude of the stadium (most notably Coors Field) can also impact the distance a batted ball travels and the amount of ball movement a pitcher can generate with his deliveries, although recently balls have begun being placed in humidors at high-altitude parks to negate these effects. The amount of moisture in the dirt on the basepaths can also affect the behaviour of ground balls and the ease with which players may steal bases; some teams are known to alter the amount of watering done to the dirt depending on the skills of the home and visiting team. The amount of foul territory is also an important variable, since foul pop-ups that would be outs in some parks (e.g. the Oakland Coliseum) may end up in the stands in other parks, thereby allowing the batter to remain at the plate (e.g. Fenway Park and Coors Field). On the whole, though, these variations do not produce effects as great as variations in cricket pitches, with one arguable exception being Coors Field.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{the novel}} drew from {{prevalent}} assumptions {{during the time}} that dark-skinned people were somehow inherently inferior.

In her explorations of the depiction of African characters in white American literature, Morrison writes that [...] "no early American writer <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the concept of American Africanism than Poe" [...] because of the focus on the symbolism of black and white in Poe's novel. This possible racial symbolism is explored further in Mat Johnson's satirical fantasy Pym (2011).|$|E
