The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|With the {{destruction}} wrought by Cyclone Laurence in 2009 still fresh <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> residents, business owners, and farmers worked hurriedly to prepare their properties and livestock for Lua's onslaught. Horizon Power temporarily redirected power {{supply in the}} towns of Marble Bar and Nullagine from solar power stations to diesel generator stations. Evacuation shelters were opened to refugees of the storm with no safe living arrangements starting 16 March. About 110 individuals sought shelter at one such location in Nullagine. As the storm moved inland, flood warnings were posted throughout the Kimberley and the Pilbara, where officials closed public access to Karijini National Park. The impending cyclone forced {{the closure of the}} Great Northern and North West Coast highways, while flights to and from several airports were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{played a}} full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was {{appointed}} as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932–33 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up foremost <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth {{their place in the}} side, too old or had controversy attached to them. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was very effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players; it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} body image {{is used in}} a number of disciplines, {{including}} psychology, medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, philosophy and cultural and feminist studies. The term is also often used in the media. Across these disciplines and media there is no consensus definition, but body image may be expressed as how one views themselves in the mirror, or <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> It incorporates the memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons of one’s own appearance, and overall attitudes towards their height, shape, and weight. An individual’s impression of their body is also assumed to be a product of ideals cultivated by various social and cultural ideals.|$|E

When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence.

25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to imagination is that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop about our selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people to envision the experiences of others <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy toward others. Martin and Sugarman write {{that this kind of}} empathic envisioning is instrumental to therapeutically conceptualizing and understanding the clients with which therapists work.|$|E

Afterward, Frost is found physically shattered in her diamond form. As Bishop and Sage investigate the crime, Jean uses her increasingly growing Phoenix powers to reassemble Frost's body, acknowledging that Frost has genuinely fallen in love with Scott. Revived, Frost is able to name her attempted murderer – Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos, who had mind-controlled fellow student Angel Salvadore into shooting Frost in her single flaw with a diamond bullet, under the direction of Xorn.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} imagination to envision others’ experiences <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider imagination is so vital to not only reflexive development but it is vital to therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps establish some stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from imagination is only constitutive of a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E
5000|$|Clairvoyance or [...] "clear seeing", is {{the ability}} to see {{anything}} that is not physically present, such as objects, animals or people. This sight occurs [...] "in the mind's eye". Some mediums say that this is their normal vision state. Others say that they must train <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> with such practices as meditation in order to achieve this ability, and that assistance from spiritual helpers is often necessary. Some clairvoyant mediums can see a spirit as though the spirit has a physical body. They see the bodily form as if it were physically present.

This paper explores the potentials of blindfolded architects using their body {{to interact with the}} virtual architectural spaces that they create <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind's</b> eye while designing. The results reveal two major strategies used by architects, moving the visualizations in sync with the bodies and moving within the fixed visualizations.

25|$|By 1987 {{rural society}} was {{more open and}} diverse than in the 1960s and 1970s, and the rigid {{collective}} units of that period, which had reflected the state's overwhelming concern for security, {{had been replaced by}} networks and clusters of smaller units. The new, looser structure demonstrated the priority placed on efficiency and economic growth. Basic security, in the sense of an adequate supply of food and guarantees of support for the disabled, orphaned, or aged, was taken for granted. Less than half of China's population remembered the insecurity and risks of pre-1950 society, but the costs and inefficiencies of the collective system were fresh <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> Increased specialization and division of labor were trends not likely to be reversed. In the rural areas the significance of the work unit appeared to have diminished, although people still lived in villages, and the actions of low-level administrative cadres still affected ordinary farmers or petty traders in immediate ways.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, a middle class had {{developed}} that was leery of both the business elite and the somewhat radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. Known as Progressives, these people favored government regulation of business practices to, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the Interstate Commerce Act), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), Democrat President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Ida M. Tarbell wrote a series of articles against the Standard Oil monopoly. The series helped pave the way for the breakup of the monopoly.|$|E

25|$|In 1841 James David Forbes, {{professor}} of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, {{came to see}} the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how {{at a time when the}} idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds,</b> the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.|$|E
25|$|Sometime in 1842, the Home Committee {{selected}} the Rev.

Andreas Riis and his wife, Anna Wolters, Widmann and Thompson left Basel for the British leeward island of Antigua in the West Indies via Liverpool to engage and recruit black Christian men who would accompany them to West Africa while Halleut {{went directly to the}} Gold Coast to prepare the grounds for their arrival. With the assistance of James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, the Governor of Jamaica at the time, the Rev. Jacob Zorn, the Superintendent of the Moravian Mission in Jamaica, the Rev. J. F. Sessing and the Rev. J. Miller, an agent of the Africa Civilization Society, Riis was able to recruit candidates after a mass appeal across the island and an extensive and rigorous interview process. Many of the volunteers who initially applied to the programme were found to be unsuitable: a few were lapsed Christians, one was excited about the adventure and wished to mine for gold, another had an invalid wife who was too ill to travel while other potential recruits wished merely to return to the motherland, Africa, the mission work not being a top priority <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> It was quite an arduous task finding the right candidates to the extent that Riis and other Basel missionaries almost gave up on the initiative.|$|E
25|$|Around December 1240 {{news came}} that the Mongols were {{advancing}} towards Hungary. King Bela then installed front line defenses at the Carpathian Mountains, {{after which he}} returned to Buda and called a council of war and ordered unity against the Mongols. The opposite happened, however, {{as many of the}} barons were hostile towards the Cumans. The Hungarian barons noted that there were Cumans in the Mongol armies, but they didn't realize that this was because they were conscripted into it and had no say in the matter. In particular the barons didn't trust Koten, {{despite the fact that the}} Mongols had attacked his people for nearly 20 years. This chaos pushed Bela into a corner; feeling he needed to show his strength and keep the rebellious barons onside, he ordered Koten to be placed under house arrest. This did not placate the barons and had an opposite effect of erroneously seeming to admit that the King harboured doubts about Koten, too. This angered the Cumans, who were far from happy about the actions taken against them, and who had done nothing to invite such actions and hated the Mongols. News arrived on 10 March that the Mongols had attacked the Hungarian defenses at the Carpathian passes. This prompted Bela to send a letter to Duke Frederick of Austria asking for help. Frederick had previously wanted Bela's throne, but Bela responded by amassing a vast army and marching to the gates of Vienna, which forced Frederick to step back. On March 14 news had arrived that the Carpathian defense forces were defeated by the Mongols. Ironically, given the suspicion of the Cumans, they were the only ones who seemed willing to fight the Mongols, the memory of the fate that had befallen them on the steppes still being fresh <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> At the time the Hungarian forces were cowered behind the walls of Sibiu. By this time Bela had lost control of his army and many towns were destroyed. Soon thereafter Frederick arrived, and, wishing to harm the country's defense (in revenge to Bela), he stirred up further feelings against the Cumans.|$|E
