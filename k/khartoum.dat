5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to <b>Khartoum,</b> the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to <b>Khartoum,</b> Abdah bought a bus ticket to <b>Khartoum</b> for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in <b>Khartoum</b> with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in <b>Khartoum</b> in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
5|$|Gordon, {{operating}} out of <b>Khartoum,</b> helped extricate many loyal civilians who remained in Sudan, but refused ultimately to abandon the city. Contrary to his orders, he retained a small force in <b>Khartoum</b> and determined to give battle with the Mahdi before relinquishing control. Accordingly, Mahdist forces besieged <b>Khartoum</b> in March 1884, isolating the city {{from the outside world}} and placing a dire timer upon Gordon to surrender. After much delay, the British government reluctantly dispatched a relief expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley that would rapidly follow the Nile to <b>Khartoum.</b> Wolseley's column arrived on 28 January 1885, two days after <b>Khartoum</b> had fallen and General Charles Gordon's head delivered to the Mahdi.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, four busloads of SSDF {{recruits}} {{arrived in}} the area from <b>Khartoum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Major-General Charles George Gordon {{was given}} the job of {{evacuating}} the Egyptian garrison from <b>Khartoum.</b> He arrived on 18 February 1884. Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of <b>Khartoum</b> to {{the forces of the}} Mahdi, and also felt that by evacuating the city he would open the way for the Mahdi to threaten Egypt. He bombarded the authorities in Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses, and delayed starting the evacuation. On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of <b>Khartoum</b> declared for the Mahdi, cutting the telegraph and blocking river traffic. <b>Khartoum</b> was besieged, falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days. A relief column arrived two days after the city had fallen and Gordon had been killed. Despite a short-lived public outcry in Britain over Gordon's death, Britain took no further action in Sudan for several years.|$|E
5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people of diverse {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to <b>Khartoum.</b> Upon arriving in <b>Khartoum,</b> Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of <b>Khartoum</b> a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in <b>Khartoum.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1884 to 1885 Beato was the {{official}} photographer of the expeditionary forces led by Baron (later Viscount) G.J. Wolseley to <b>Khartoum,</b> Sudan, in relief of General Charles Gordon.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, a {{few months}} after his {{credentials}} had been accepted, Carney met with senior Sudanese foreign ministry officials prior to vacating the U.S. embassy in <b>Khartoum</b> for the safer environs of Nairobi. He proposed tangible steps to recover the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Washington and <b>Khartoum.</b> In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A. Africa experts, about U.S. sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to lift them.|$|E
5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was felt he had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and <b>Khartoum</b> and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the <b>Khartoum</b> administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz was {{involved}} in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama bin Laden and the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to extradite bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against <b>Khartoum</b> over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington D.C. with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan {{under pressure from the}} United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of <b>Khartoum</b> about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known terrorist groups and individuals.|$|E
5|$|P. d. rufidorsalis C. L. Brehm, 1855, {{described}} from <b>Khartoum,</b> Sudan, {{is found}} in the Nile valley from Wadi Halfa south to Renk in northern South Sudan, and in eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia to the Red Sea coast in Eritrea. It has also been introduced to Mohéli in the Comoros.|$|E
5|$|Petterson's {{compulsory}} {{delivery of the}} talking points based on faulty U.S. intelligence would {{set the stage for}} strained relations between Washington and <b>Khartoum</b> that lasted well into Carney's early tenure as ambassador. In late 1995, Carney was also asked to deliver a similar non-paper message based on what he would later recount as having been poorly sourced U.S. intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), {{set up in}} May 1940, {{was joined}} at <b>Khartoum</b> by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from émigré volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres {{consisting}} of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and £1 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major Orde Wingate was sent to <b>Khartoum</b> with an assistant to join {{the headquarters of the}} SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British Royal Air Force managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the Arbegnoch north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma–Gondar road and the Italian garrison at Wolkait was withdrawn in February 1941.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{were the}} side-loading paddle steamers Gordon, Duncan and Hutton, named after General Gordon of <b>Khartoum,</b> Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton. Each was {{powered by a}} {{condensing}} engine manufactured by John Peen & Son of Greenwich producing 100 nominal horsepower.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman was the posthumous son of Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah, who had proclaimed {{himself the}} Mahdi or messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith in 1881, {{and died in}} 1885 {{a few months after}} his forces had {{captured}} <b>Khartoum.</b> A joint British and Egyptian force recaptured Sudan in 1898. At first, the British severely restricted Abd al-Rahman's movement and activity. However, he soon emerged as the Sayyid (leader) of the Ansar religious sect, supporters of the Mahdist movement.|$|E
5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} <b>Khartoum,</b> Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before Black September, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out of Jordan, {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in <b>Khartoum.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{his travels}} Flashman meets {{people who took}} part in 19th-century events, {{including}} Queen Victoria, Abraham Lincoln, Otto von Bismarck, Oscar Wilde and Florence Nightingale, and he is involved as a participant in some of the century's most notable events, including the Indian Mutiny, the Taiping Rebellion, the charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of <b>Khartoum,</b> John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry and the Battle of the Little Bighorn.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 he {{was made}} a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George as thanks from the {{government}} for allowing the use of maps of the Upper Nile valley he had had made when working on the Khedive's projects. They were the most accurate survey of the area and {{were used in the}} British Relief of <b>Khartoum.</b> In 1887 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Nalder {{reported}} after {{a survey}} of his province {{that there was a}} general lack of tribal cohesion. Governor-General Sir Stewart Symes at <b>Khartoum</b> had little interest in development of the south of Sudan and he advised the local officials that chiefs should have territorial rather than ethnic authority. In 1936 Mongalla and the Bahr al-Ghazal provinces were incorporated into the Equatoria province, with headquarters at Juba, with parts of Upper Nile province detached.|$|E
5|$|Operation Infinite Reach was the codename for American {{cruise missile}} strikes on al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa {{pharmaceutical}} factory in <b>Khartoum,</b> Sudan, on August 20, 1998. The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach {{was the first time}} the United States acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor.|$|E
5|$|Rebasing at <b>Khartoum,</b> No. 237 Squadron {{undertook}} regular reconnaissance, dive-bombing and strafing sorties during October and November 1940. Meanwhile, the Southern Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery {{arrived in}} Kenya in October and, following {{a period of}} training, received 2-pounder guns and joined the front at Garissa {{around the turn of}} the new year. No.237 Squadron was partially re-equipped during January 1941, receiving some Westland Lysander Mk IIs, but most of the squadron continued operating Hardys.|$|E
5|$|The Sudan women's {{national}} football team is an unofficial, non-Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) recognised team called The Challenge that {{plays in a}} domestic competition in <b>Khartoum</b> against teams wearing traditional Muslim garb. It played its first competitive match in 2006. No FIFA recognised senior national team has played a single FIFA-recognised game. The development of a national team faces several challenges common to much of Africa, along with Sudan-specific issues such as religion. There is an additional problem of a fatwa banning the creation of women's teams.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in <b>Khartoum</b> under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the <b>Khartoum</b> government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had become}} evident that the Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya {{as a base for}} deeper {{involvement}} in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habré, the <b>Khartoum</b> Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habré as Prime Minister. The Malloum-Habré accord was actively promoted by Sudan and Saudi Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habré, with his good Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, the only chance to thwart Gaddafi's plans.|$|E
5|$|At about 7:30 PM <b>Khartoum</b> time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
5|$|On 8July 1930, Hardman married Dorothy Ursula Ashcroft Thompson at St George's, Hanover Square, in London; {{the couple}} had two sons and a daughter. In September the {{following}} year, he was posted to Heliopolis, Egypt, to serve with No.216 Squadron. Tasked with bombing and transport duties, the squadron operated Vickers Victorias and pioneered the air route from Lagos to <b>Khartoum</b> in 1934. Returning to Britain, Hardman entered the RAF Staff College, Andover, in January 1935. After graduating, {{he was promoted to}} squadron leader on 1February 1936. He served {{for the next two years}} as Staff Officer for Armament at No.23 (Training) Group in Grantham. Hardman entered the British Army's Staff College, Camberley, in January 1938, and was promoted to wing commander on 1January 1939.|$|E
5|$|Seamer married Letice Dorothy Lee, {{and had two}} children, Katherine Judith and Mary. By 1948 Seamer {{had risen}} to be the {{district}} commissioner for <b>Khartoum</b> North. When he left the Sudan Political Service in 1950, he returned to England and took up a teaching position at his old school, Marlborough College. In addition to teaching Latin, English and history, he became a housemaster, before his retirement in 1973. He served as mayor of Marlborough twice, and as a justice of the peace, and was awarded Freedom of the City in 2001. He died, following an illness on 16 April 2006, aged 92.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Cairo in April 1999, Bok {{was directed to}} Sacred Heart Catholic Church. This church was well known among the Dinka in <b>Khartoum</b> {{as a place of}} refuge in Cairo. While staying at Sacred Heart, Bok began to learn some English and made important contacts among the Dinka population of Cairo. He also began practicing his Christian faith without fear of reprisal. He eventually moved out of the church compound and into an apartment with other Dinka who were also seeking UN refugee status in order to leave Africa for the United States, Great Britain or Australia.|$|E
5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave. Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in <b>Khartoum</b> and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he was a slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at <b>Khartoum</b> to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt {{for more than a}} year, and who were in favor of peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E
5|$|The Mounted Infantry Depot was a post {{where young}} {{officers}} could be stationed, forming a ready reserve of young, educated officers available as volunteers for staff or command positions in African colonial campaigns. It was whilst {{attached to this}} post that Alderson saw service in the First Boer War in 1881 in the Transvaal. The following year, Alderson served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, fighting at the battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. Two years later, Alderson {{was attached to the}} Mounted Camel Regiment during the failed expedition to relieve <b>Khartoum</b> and rescue General Gordon. During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier. For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire, a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant.|$|E
5|$|The {{army was}} tested in 1964 when the {{conflict}} with Ethiopia over the Somali-inhabited Ogaden erupted into warfare. On 16 June 1963, Somali guerrillas started an insurgency at Hodayo, in eastern Ethiopia, a watering place north of Werder, after Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie rejected their demand for self-government in the Ogaden. The Somali government initially refused to support the guerrilla forces, which eventually numbered about 3,000. However, in January 1964, after Ethiopia sent reinforcements to the Ogaden, Somali forces launched ground and air attacks across the border and started providing assistance to the guerrillas. The Ethiopian Air Force responded with punitive strikes across its southwestern frontier against Feerfeer, northeast of Beledweyne and Galkayo. On 6 March 1964, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to a cease-fire. At {{the end of the}} month, the two sides signed an accord in <b>Khartoum,</b> Sudan, agreeing to withdraw their troops from the border, cease hostile propaganda, and start peace negotiations. Somalia also terminated its support of the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the new fort {{was similar to that}} of the other Royal Commission forts on the Thames, with an arc of granite-faced casemates, {{reinforced}} by iron shields. These, it was believed, would be virtually invulnerable to enemy fire. It was originally envisaged that the fort would have two tiers (in a design similar to that of Garrison Point Fort at Sheerness) mounting around 56 guns; 28 in casemates and the rest in barbettes on the fort's roof. Construction began on this basis in July 1861 but as the work progressed the design was changed, leaving the fort with only a single tier of casemates. Like its predecessors, its construction was seriously affected by the poor ground conditions and was disrupted by shifting and cracking foundations. Colonel Charles George Gordon, who was later to die in the Siege of <b>Khartoum,</b> supervised its final phases of construction. The fort cost a total of £130,000 to build.|$|E
