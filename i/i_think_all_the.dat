He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall....when he arrived, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people in East London waited outside to see him.|$|E
500|$|According to Hankinson, [...] "One of {{the best}} parts of the episode {{centered}} around Brittany and Santana, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> principals—Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too—did a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was [...] "absurdly preachy" [...] on the matter of rumors, though he said the episode was [...] "decent". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called [...] "arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode" [...] by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that [...] "Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss". Canning felt otherwise: [...] "It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it was just some ordinary, blah drama." ...|$|E
500|$|.....<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> grand leading {{facts of}} {{geographical}} distribution are explicable {{on the theory}} of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; {{and how it is}} that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{title was}} {{revealed}} as The Path of Totality. [...] "The title The Path of Totality {{refers to the}} fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time," [...] says Jonathan Davis, explaining the story behind the name. [...] "That's how this album came together. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> producers feel the same way. I'm not sure it could ever happen again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Portal told Vanderkloot to [...] "stay handy to the telephone". The {{next day}} Vanderkloot {{was taken to}} Winston Churchill's {{residence}} at No.10 Downing Street. Churchill, clad in robe and slippers, offered him a drink, beginning a relationship that had Vanderkloot flying the Prime Minister on sensitive diplomatic trips across war-torn Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Middle-East. [...] "He took calculated risks," [...] said his son, William III. There {{was a lot more}} risk in flying back then. It was a frontier, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> old pilots will say it, secretly to themselves, that they enjoyed being on their own. It was the wild blue yonder." [...] As Churchill's pilot, Vanderkloot flew Lord Mountbatten to England in June 1942, conveyed the Prime Minister and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke to Egypt in August 1942 to replace Claude Auchinleck commander of the British army in North Africa with Bernard Montgomery and also took Churchill to high-level talks in Moscow with Joseph Stalin, to Turkey to determine that country's wartime intentions, and to the Casablanca Conference in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Production officially {{began on}} September 10, 2012, with {{shooting}} concluding {{for some of}} the cast on December 21, 2012. After the Christmas break, filming resumed for two weeks in mid January {{for some of the}} main cast and was placed on hold for awards season. Principal photography resumed and concluded in March 2013. Shooting first took place in and around metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia and then moved to Hawaii, to shoot the arena scenes. The cast and crew were on a busy schedule, working 14-hour days and six days a week. In an interview with MTV, Josh Hutcherson confirmed scenes in the film would use IMAX cameras by stating, [...] "They're shooting, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stuff in the arena is going to be IMAX". Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth were in Ringwood, New Jersey shooting District 12 scenes involving snow for the beginning of the film on January 31 and February 1. Jennifer Lawrence confirmed that she would fly out to Hawaii on February 25, the day after she won the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 85th Academy Awards to shoot for the final 9 days along with Claflin and Hutcherson.|$|E
