40|$|Rig {{tests of}} a can-type {{combustor}} {{were performed to}} demonstrate two advanced ground power engine combustor concepts: steam cooled rich-burn combustor primary zones for enhanced durability; and variable combustor geometry for three stage combustion equivalence ratio control. Both concepts proved to be highly successful in achieving their desired objectives. The steam cooling reduced peak liner temperatures to less than 800 K. This offers the potential of both long life and reduced use of strategic materials for liner fabrication. Three degrees of variable geometry were successfully implemented to control airflow distribution within the combustor. One was a variable blade angle axial flow air swirler to control primary airflow while the other two consisted of rotating bands to control secondary and tertiary or <b>dilution</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Despite {{abundant}} {{evidence for}} the adverse health effects associated with welding fume, shipyard welders continue to have exposures that routinely exceed safe limits. Welding in shipyards can be particularly hazardous due dynamic conditions and work in enclosed and confined spaces. Currently, there are no specific ventilation guidelines available to shipyard welders, beyond general regulatory requirements for local exhaust and general <b>dilution</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. In this study, general ventilation guidelines were developed for inclusion in a training intervention. Using an observational tool based on those guidelines, a baseline characterization of the work practices and use of ventilation in enclosed and confined space welding tasks was performed at a Seattle shipyard. To assess ventilation effectiveness, a scoring system was developed to compare actual and recommended ventilation practices. Comparing ventilation techniques and estimated exposure suggests that adoption of the intervention guidelines reduces the potential for welding fume exposure. Additionally, an inter-observer assessment based on side-by-side field measurements shows good agreement for the observational behavior tool, establishing the method as a reliable way to detect a change in ventilation-related behavior post-intervention...|$|E
40|$|A pressure—swirl {{fuel nozzle}} {{generating}} a hollow—cone spray with nominal cone angle of 30 degrees {{is used in}} a swirl—stabilized combustor. The combustor is circular in cross section with swirl plate and fuel nozzle axes aligned and coinciding with the axis of the chamber. Kerosene is injected upward inside the chamber from the fuel nozzle. Separate swirl and dilution air flows are uniformly distributed into the chamber that pass through the honey comb flow straighteners and screens. Calculated swirl number of 1. 5 is generated with the design swirl plate exit air velocity of 30 degrees {{with respect to the}} chamber axis. Effects of swirl and <b>dilution</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates on the shape and stability of the flame are investigated. Stable and classical liquid fuel sheet disintegration zone exists close to the nozzle with no visible light followed by a luminous blue region and a mixed blue/yellow region that subsequently turns into yellow for most of the part in the flame. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) is used to measure drop size, mean and rms axial velocity for two cases of with and without combustion at six different axial locations from the nozzle. For the no—combustion case all air and fuel flow rates were kept at the same values as the combusting spray condition. Results for mean axial drop velocity profiles indicate widening of the spray due to combustion while the magnitudes of the peak velocities are slightly increased. No measurements inside the hollow—cone spray are possible due to burning of fuel droplets. Drop turbulence decreases due to combination of increase in gas kinematic viscosity and elimination of small drops at high temperatures. Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) radial profiles at all axial locations increase with combustion due to preferential burning of small drops...|$|E

40|$|Ames {{test data}} of {{experiments}} with smoke of six cigarette types {{were used for}} dose-response analysis and for derivation of a measure of mutagenic potency. Each cigarette type had been tested using a smoking machine and four dilutions of the smoke of each of seven cycles (one to seven cigarettes). Three plates had been exposed per cigarette number/smoke dilution combination and three control plates had been simultaneously exposed to clean air with each set of smoke-exposed plates. It was {{the aim of the}} statistical analysis to determine the slopes of dose-response relationships of various cigarette types and to compare them using statistical tests. Basically, the following procedure is recommended: (1) calculate a dose measure {{on the basis of the}} number of smoked cigarettes per cycle and <b>dilution</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> (2) Use the absolute count values of the individual plates as effect variable. (3) Describe the dose-response relations of the individual cigarette types on the basis of all available data with a polynomial model by means of Poisson regression analysis accounting for overdispersion. (4) Identify the linear dose-response region using the likelihood ratio test and restrict the data set to this region. (5) Use the slope of the linear model in the restricted data set as the basis of the mutagenicity measure. (6) Compare the slope for the individual cigarette type with the slope for a reference cigarette by means of multivariate Poisson regression using the likelihood ratio test and accounting for overdispersion. It is finally recommended to express the mutagenic potency as percentages related to the reference cigarette K 2 R 4 F. This type of cigarette was set here equal to 100 %; the following values are then obtained for some commercially available cigarette types: type A 25 %, type B 90 %, type C 119 %, type D 13 %, type E 59 %.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 102 - 106). Much of combustion research {{focuses on}} reducing soot particulates in emissions. However, current research at San Diego State University (SDSU) Combustion and Solar Energy Laboratory (CSEL) is underway to develop a high temperature solar receiver which will utilize carbon nanoparticles as a solar absorption medium. To produce carbon nanoparticles for the small particle heat exchange receiver (SPHER), a lab-scale carbon particle generator (CPG) has been built and tested. The CPG is a heated ceramic tube reactor with a set point wall temperature of 1100 - 1300 ??C operating at 5 - 6 bar pressure. Natural gas and nitrogen are fed to the CPG where natural gas undergoes pyrolysis resulting in carbon particles. The gas-particle mixture is met downstream with dilution air {{and sent to the}} lab scale solar receiver. To predict soot yield and general trends in CPG performance, a model has been setup in Reaction Design CHEMKIN-PRO software. One of the primary goals of this research is to accurately measure particle properties. Mean particle diameter, size distribution, and index of refraction are calculated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and a Diesel Particulate Scatterometer (DPS). Filter samples taken during experimentation are analyzed to obtain a particle size distribution with SEM images processed in ImageJ software. These results are compared with the DPS, which calculates the particle size distribution and the index of refraction from light scattering using Mie theory. For testing with the lab scale receiver, a particle diameter range of 200 - 500 nm is desired. Test conditions are varied to understand effects of operating parameters on particle size and the ability to obtain the size range. Analysis of particle loading is the other important metric for this research. Particle loading is measured downstream of the CPG outlet and dilution air mixing point. The airparticle mixture flows through an extinction tube where opacity of the mixture is measured with a 532 nm laser and detector. Beer's law is then used to calculate particle loading. The CPG needs to produce a certain particle loading for a corresponding receiver test. By obtaining the particle loading in the system, the reaction conversion to solid carbon in the CPG can be calculated to measure the efficiency of the CPG. To predict trends in reaction conversion and particle size from experimentation, the CHEMKIN-PRO computer model for the CPG is run for various flow rates and wall temperature profiles. These predictions were a reason for testing at higher wall set point temperatures. Based on these research goals, it was shown that the CPG consistently produces a mean particle diameter of 200 - 400 nm at the conditions tested, fitting perfectly inside the desired range. This led to successful lab scale SPHER testing which produced a 10 -point efficiency increase and 150 ??C temperature difference with particles present. Also, at 3 g/s <b>dilution</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate, an efficiency of 80 % at an outlet temperature above 800 ??C was obtained. Promise was shown at higher CPG experimental temperatures to produce higher reaction conversion, both experimentally and in the model. However, based on wall temperature data taken during experimentation, it is apparent that the CPG needs to have multiple heating zones with separate temperature controllers in order to have an isothermal zone rather than a parabolic temperature profile. As for the computer model, it predicted much higher reaction conversion at higher temperature. The mass fraction of fuel in the inlet stream was shown to not affect conversion while increasing residence time led to increasing conversion. Particle size distribution in the model was far off and showed a bimodal distribution for one of the statistical methods. Using the results from experimentation and modeling, a preliminary CPG design is presented that will operate in a 5 MW th receiver system...|$|E

Diffusion rate, <b>dilution</b> and carrier <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates, purity of air, VOC losses due to wall-interactions and leakages were considered as influence quantities of the VOC amount of substance fraction dynamically prepared in gas phase by the diffusion method. The contribution of the VOC losses to standard mixtures uncertainty and their sampling procedure are under study and a solution has not yet been proposed. In this paper, a conservative quantification of VOC losses is proposed, discussed and applied to a case study: a single stage dynamic dilutor with an acetone generation. An uncertainty budget was prepared to calculate target uncertainty for VOC losses due to leakages and VOC–wall interactions on Teflon®, Pyrex® and stainless steel tubing. Teflon® showed negligible interaction effects when the pipe was clean and long term effects were not considered. Uncertainty was not negligible for glass and stainless steel for which more accurate analyses are necessary. A leakage test was developed to assure negligible leakage contribution to uncertainty...|$|R

Liquid is impinged perpendicularly to the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> at the nozzle exit and atomized by the combined effects of collision, shear force and Pneumo - acoustic vibration. The condition of favorable resonant cell, the value of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> {{rate at which the}} sound pressure level increases rapidly - the singu 1 ar point of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate - and the semiexperimental equation of SMD with the liquid physical properties are obtained...|$|R
