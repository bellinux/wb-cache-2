40|$|The {{study of}} {{effectiveness}} of prebiotic dose of lactulose in 200 – 400 ml of milk formula «Bifidus» in nutrition of infants, hospitalized with <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> was performed. Microbiological effectiveness of «Bifidus» was estimated in 1 – 1, 5 months {{according to the}} results of gas-fluid chromatography with evaluation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Statistically significant increase of initially low level of SCFA testified to the restoration of quantity and activity of microbe populations in colon. The dynamics of SCFA in some rates was similar to that ones in children, receiving breast feeding and with data on quality-quantity bacteriological analysis. The study showed the key role of butyric acid level that influences on several microbiological features of intestinal flora in acute stage of <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b>   Key words: infants, <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> intestinal flora, short-chain fatty acids, lactulose.

When compared with the healthy controls (p < 0. 0001) and patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (p < 0. 0001) the prevalence of ASCA was significantly increased in patients with Crohn's disease and their first-degree relatives (p < 0. 01). Further significant differences concerning the frequency of ASCA within the different groups of our study population were not observed. In particular, ASCA were not found in increased prevalence in <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> These observations are compatible with a role of ASCA as a marker of genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease.

40|$|A current aim of {{nutrigenetics}} is {{to personalize}} nutritional practices according to genetic variations {{that influence the}} way of digestion and metabolism of nutrients introduced with the diet. Nutritional epigenetics concerns knowledge {{about the effects of}} nutrients on gene expression. Nutrition in early life or in critical periods of development, may have a role in modulating gene expression, and, therefore, have later effects on health. Human breast milk is well-known for its ability in preventing several acute and chronic diseases. Indeed, breastfed children may have lower risk of neonatal necrotizing <b>enterocolitis,</b> <b>infectious</b> diseases, and also of non-communicable diseases, such as obesity and related-disorders. Beneficial effects of human breast milk on health may be associated in part with its peculiar components, possible also via epigenetic processes. This paper discusses about presumed epigenetic effects of human breast milk and components. While evidence suggests that a direct relationship may exist of some components of human breast milk with epigenetic changes, the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Studies have to be conducted to clarify the actual role of human breast milk on genetic expression, in particular when linked to the risk of non-communicable diseases, to potentially benefit the infant’s health and his later life...|$|R

Determining the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease has been highly difficult mainly during {{the first years of}} this study carried out at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica (PUC) Clinical Hospital. For instance, it has been frequently confused with Irritable bowel syndrome and sometimes misdiagnosed as ulcerative colitis, <b>infectious</b> colitis or <b>enterocolitis,</b> intestinal lymphoma, or coeliac disease. Consequently, it seems advisable to characterize what the most relevant clinical features are, in order to establish a clear concept of Crohn’s disease. This difficulty may still be a problem at other medical centers in developing countries. Thus, sharing this information may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} this disease. Based on the clinical experience gained between 1963 and 2004 and reported herein, the main clinical characteristics of the disease are long-lasting day and night abdominal pain, which becomes more intense after eating and diarrhoea, sometimes associated to a mass in the abdomen, anal lesions, and other additional digestive and nondigestive clinical features. Nevertheless, the main aim of this work has been the following: is it possible to make, in an early stage, the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease with a high degree of certainty exclusively with clinical data? 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. We {{present an}} unusual case of metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. Typical areas of {{metastasis}} include bone, gynecological organs, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, {{in order of}} frequency. With regard to GI metastasis, extrahepatic represents a rare site. Case. Two years after being diagnosed with invasive lobular breast carcinoma, a 61 -year-old female complained of 3 months of nonspecific abdominal pain and diarrhea. A colonoscopy revealed 5 tubular adenomatous polyps in the ascending and transverse colon. Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was done 7 months after the colonoscopy to further evaluate persistent diarrhea. The CT results were consistent with <b>infectious</b> or inflammatory <b>enterocolitis.</b> Despite conservative management, symptoms failed to improve and a repeat diagnostic colonoscopy was obtained. Random colonic biopsies revealed metastatic high-grade adenocarcinoma of the colon. Discussion. Metastatic lobular breast carcinoma to the GI tract can distort initial interpretation of endoscopic evaluation with lesions mimicking inflammation. The interval between discovery of GI metastasis and diagnosis of lobular breast cancer can vary widely from synchronous to 30 years; however, progression is most often much sooner. Nonspecific symptoms and subtle appearance of metastatic lesions may confound the diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is needed for possible metastatic spread to the GI tract in patients {{with a history of}} invasive lobular breast carcinoma. Perhaps, patients with nonspecific GI symptoms should have an endoscopic examination with multiple random biopsies as invasive lobular carcinoma typically mimics macroscopic changes consistent with colitis...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim Accurate, noninvasive {{biomarkers}} {{are needed}} to diagnose and monitor inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as lipocalin 2, is expressed in inflamed colonic epithelium and neutrophilic granulocytes. This study explores its properties as a biomarker in feces and plasma and, for the first time, compares fecal NGAL systematically with the existing fecal biomarker calprotectin. Methods Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was measured in feces from 73 patients with IBD, 21 patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> 21 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and 23 healthy subjects using ELISA. The results were correlated to calprotectin, clinical score, endoscopic score, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein. Plasma from 119 patients with IBD and 28 healthy controls was analyzed for NGAL. Results Fecal NGAL levels (median and interquartile range) were significantly elevated in active ulcerative colitis (UC) 6. 05 (3. 6 – 15. 1) mg/kg and Crohn's disease (CD) 4. 9 (1. 5 – 7. 7) mg/kg, compared with patients with inactive UC 1. 3 (0. 4 – 2. 6) mg/kg, inactive CD 1. 5 (0. 5 – 1. 7) mg/kg, irritable bowel syndrome 0. 4 (0. 2 – 0. 6) mg/kg, and healthy controls (HC) 0. 3 (0. 1 – 0. 4) mg/kg. Patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> had significantly higher fecal-NGAL levels, 2. 7 (1. 4 – 5. 6) mg/kg than HC. Sensitivity and specificity was 94. 7 % and 95. 7 %, respectively, for distinguishing between active IBD and HC. Stability of NGAL in stool was excellent for 7 [*]days in room temperature. Plasma NGAL was significantly elevated in UC and CD compared with HC. Conclusions Fecal NGAL is a promising biomarker for IBD. As existing biomarkers are expressed mainly in granulocytes, NGAL's epithelial localization may give supplementary diagnostic information...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFebrile pain in {{the right}} iliac fossa {{is one of the}} most common reasons for {{consulting}} at an emergency service. Within this framework, the main diagnosis that is considered is appendicitis, the main complication of which is perforation. However, a certain number of other conditions can be responsible for this clinical picture, primarily including digestive tract and mesentery disorders including mesenteric lymphadenitis, Crohn's disease, <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> small intestine or colonic diverticulitis, ischaemic colitis or cancer of the caecum. This article illustrates the imaging semiology of the various right colonic, iliac, mesenteric and appendicular conditions that could potentially cause an infection of the right iliac fossa. It specifies the indications of ultrasound and CT scans, respectively, which depend on the age of the patient and the clinical signs and symptoms. Though the CT scan is commonly used in abdominal emergencies in general, and particularly in clinical pictures of infection of the right iliac fossa, ultrasound remains recommended as first line imaging when confronted with suspected appendicitis or lymphadenitis in a young subject or in the monitoring of Crohn's disease...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is a food-borne {{pathogen}} {{responsible for}} <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> The early-response transcription factor NF-jB triggers {{the expression of}} genes associated with cellular immune and inflammatory responses. Co-incubation of HeLa cells with viable C. jejuni leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-jB as determined by specific induction of a cellular luciferase-based reporter. Boiled cell-free extracts of C. jejuni are also potent dose-dependent stimulators of NF-jB-dependent transcription, the levels of which can reach up to 1000 -fold as compared with independent controls. Using both cultured HeLa cells and human colonic epithelial (HCA- 7) cells, the activation of NF-jB by C. jejuni boiled extract has been monitored through the degradation of IKBa and DNA binding of the nuclear translocated p 50 /p 65 heterodimer of NF-jB. These events are co-ordinated with elaboration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 8. Fractionation of the boiled C. jejuni extract suggests {{that the majority of}} the bioactive component has a molecular mass of 3 kDa or less, which is insensitive to proteinase K treatment...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory bowel {{diseases}} (IBD) are inflammatory diseases with a multifactorial {{component that}} involve the intestinal tract. The two relevant IBD syndromes are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). One factor involved in IBD {{development is a}} genetic predisposition, associated to NOD 2 /CARD 15 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) polymorphisms that might favor <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> that is possibly associated {{to the development of}} IBD. The identification of specific immunologic alterations in IBD and their relationship to the etiology of the disease is a relevant research topic. The role of intra and extracellular molecules, such as transcription factors and cytokines that are involved in the inflammatory response, needs to be understood. The relevance of immunologic molecules that might drive the immune response to a T helper (Th) 1, Th 2 or the recently described Th 17 phenotype, has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies with IBD patients. CD and UC predominantly behave with a Th 1 and Th 2 immune phenotype, respectively. Recently, an association between CD and Th 17 has been reported. The knowledge acquired from immunologic and molecular research will help to develop accurate diagnostic methods and efficient therapie...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of the combined use of fecal calprotectin (FC), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), perinuclear staining antineutrophil antibody (pANCA), small intestinal permeability test (IP), and bowel wall ultrasonography measurement (BWUS) in the diagnostic work-up of children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: All children referred for initial assessment of possible IBD were eligible. Patients with symptoms or signs (right-lower quadrant mass, perianal disease, or hematochezia) mandating a complete work-up for IBD were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent a clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation including biopsy examinations. The immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA ASCA, IgG pANCA, FC, IP, and BWUS were tested in all patients at the initial assessment. Results: A final diagnosis of IBD was made in 27 patients: 17 Crohn disease and 10 ulcerative colitis. Eighteen children had other gastrointestinal diagnoses (8 functional bowel disorders, 5 food allergy-mediated diseases, 4 <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> 1 familial Mediterranean fever). In patients with simultaneous abnormal values of FC, BWUS, and ASCA/pANCA, the estimated probability of having IBD was 99. 47 %. Patients with negative results on all tests had a 0. 69 % of probability of IBD. Conclusions: The incorporation of noninvasive diagnostic tests into the initial diagnostic approach may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and facilitate clinical decision-making when the diagnosis of IBD in children is initially uncertain. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella species cause a {{wide range}} of disease in {{multiple}} hosts. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium causes self-limited intestinal disease in humans and systemic typhoid-like illness in susceptible mice. The prevailing dogma in murine S. enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis is that distinct virulence mechanisms—Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI 1 and SPI 2) —perform distinct roles in pathogenesis, the former being important for invasion and intestinal disease and the latter important for intracellular survival and systemic persistence and disease. Although evidence from bovine infections has suggested that SPI 2 has a role in ileal disease, {{there is no evidence that}} SPI 2 is important for inflammation in a disease that more closely recapitulates human colitis. Using S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains that lack functional type III secretion systems, we demonstrate that SPI 2 is essential for complete virulence in murine <b>infectious</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> Using a recently characterized murine model (M. Barthel,S. Hapfelmeier, L. Quintanilla-Martinez, M. Kremer, M. Rohde, M. Hogardt, K. Pfeffer, H. Russmann, and W. D. Hardt, Infect. Immun. 71 : 2839 - 2858, 2003), we demonstrate that SPI 1 mutants are unable to cause intestinal disease 48 h after infection and that SPI 2 -deficient bacteria also cause significantly attenuated typhlitis. We show that at the peak of inflammation in the cecum, SPI 2 mutants induce diminished intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression and neutrophil recruitment but that wild-type and mutant Salmonella are similarly distributed in the lumen of the infected organ. Finally, we demonstrate that attenuation of intestinal inflammation is accompanied by resolution of typhlitis in the mutant, but not wild-type, infections. Collectively, these results indicate that SPI 2 is needed for enterocolitis, as well as for systemic disease...|$|E
