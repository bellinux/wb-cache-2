5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} jobs that horses <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E

5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not {{get close enough to}} the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops {{on either side of him}} so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E

Manson's Creek was only eight miles from Germansen Landing and when the news of Howell's strike was made, men rushed to this new site and staked their claims.

He invited ecclesiastical dignitaries from the capital to teach those monks and brought them back in line with the main teachings of Buddhism. Even though King Taksin had applied himself to reforming the Buddhist religion after its period of decline following the loss of Ayutthaya to Burma, gradually bringing it back to the normalcy it enjoyed during the Ayutthaya kingdom, since his reign was so brief {{he was not able to}} <b>do</b> <b>very</b> much.|$|E

25|$|In {{this early}} {{half of the}} 17th century, famines became common in {{northern}} China because of unusual dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season; these were effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility.

Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing a large but unknown number of people. The famine and drought in late 1620s and 1630s contributed to the rebellions that broke out in Shaanxi led by rebel leader such as Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong.|$|E
25|$|With Alec Bedser and the spinners {{doing most of}} {{the work}} against South Africa in 1951, Statham had to <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little in the Tests, but he only missed 100 {{first-class}} wickets due to injury and showed himself a formidable bowler on a pitch offering help. In India, his average was good, but the heat and humidity certainly seemed to take their toll upon his body and he did little in the Tests, with the result that he was not chosen for a Test match in 1952 even though he was gaining speed and straightness and was often extremely formidable despite conditions rarely favouring bowlers. In 1953, Statham was within a whisker of heading the first-class averages and bowled wonderfully on the most placid of pitches against Hampshire, but Bedser ensured he was not needed in the Ashes Tests. Statham and fellow fast-bowler Fred Trueman were on occasion, in 1953, called up to the Test squad, but with the England team maturing, the captain, Len Hutton did not feel comfortable playing two fast-bowlers, often preferring the more economical, slower bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. This meant that Statham and Trueman rarely bowled in tandem in this period.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.|$|E

500|$|However, {{as soon as}} 1887, {{important}} {{figures in}} the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Révolté that [...] "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement {{on the basis that}} anarchism could <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well without [...] "the individual dynamiter." ...|$|E

500|$|School {{was never}} a concern for Babcock, {{and he did not}} earn his high school diploma until the age of 95. On growing up in the area, Babcock claims that he [...] "didn't <b>do</b> <b>very</b> much," [...] {{although}} he admits that [...] "t was a fun place to grow up." [...] Babcock partook in fishing, hunting, and swimming—especially around the local Sydenham Lake—in order to pass the time with the other kids his age. He would return to the area in 1919, after his wartime experiences, but soon after left for the United States. Nevertheless, Babcock's relatives continue to work at the Crater Dairy farm (named after the Holleford crater, a remnant of a meteor strike) and the community grew to greatly respect John.|$|E

He was recruited by Spratt, who would later go on to say that Cruft had lent forward in the interview at one point whilst talking about the business and said [...] "You know, I think this kind of business ought to <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well, I do honestly." [...] Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system. The Maltese cross that was previously used in the bookkeeping was later instead stamped onto the biscuits as a type of trademark to distinguish Spratt's biscuits from other dog biscuits.|$|E
