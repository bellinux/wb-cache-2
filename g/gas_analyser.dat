50|$|The Russian Deputy Prosecutor {{declared}} in 2002 that a comprehensive {{testing of the}} samples showed no traces of any explosives, and that sacks from Ryazan contained only sugar. However Yuri Tkachenko, the police explosives expert who defused the Ryazan bomb, insisted that it was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He {{also said that the}} <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it {{was out of the question}} that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.|$|E

40|$|To measure pH in {{platelet}} concentrates, blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> {{with different}} calibration principles may be used. In this study, variances observed in pH measurements with {{two types of}} blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> were investigated. pH was measured in crystalloid solutions (platelet additive solution (PAS-II), phosphate-buffered solutions) and two types of platelet concentrates (containing 100 % plasma, or 65 % PAS-II/ 35 % plasma) with two blood gas analysers: either using liquid and gas calibration (AVL 945), or only liquid calibration (AVL OMNI). These measurements were compared with a reference method. Especially for PAS-II, large variation in pH was observed between AVL 945, AVL OMNI and the reference method: 6. 91 +/- 0. 02, 7. 35 +/- 0. 02 and 7. 188 +/- 0. 010, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 12, P < 0. 0001, paired t-test). A significant difference in pH was also found for platelet concentrates in 65 % PAS/ 35 % plasma (6. 88 +/- 0. 09 on AVL 945 and 7. 02 +/- 0. 09 on AVL OMNI, n = 134, P < 0. 0001). Comparison with the reference method revealed minor differences with AVL 945, whereas AVL OMNI gave a mean difference in pH of + 0. 17. Platelets in 100 % plasma revealed smaller differences (6. 93 +/- 0. 13 for AVL 945 and 6. 99 +/- 0. 13 for AVL OMNI, n = 95, P < 0. 0001). We conclude that different blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> can yield different pH values, especially in weak buffered solutions such as platelet concentrates in PAS-II.

A portable analyser employing the TGS 812 and TGS 824 Taguchi gas sensors was built in flow-through arrangements. The performance of the <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> was evaluated in terms of reproducibility, stability and sensitivity and was used to determine the ethanol content in various commercial beer and wine samples. The adsorption response mechanism of the tin-oxide gas sensors was also investigated using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model and this model was validated by determining the ethanol content of beer and wine samples.

40|$|Gaseous {{pollutants}} {{have been}} an environmental concern since 1956, when the first clean air act {{was established in the}} United Kingdom. Monitoring of gaseous emissions is a legal requirement in most countries, and this has generated a large demand for inexpensive, portable, and versatile <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Many of the current commercial <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> have differing advantages and disadvantages, however, high cost is an important factor. Instruments with low detection limits and the ability to measure multiple gases tend to be very expensive, whereas, single <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> tend to be much more affordable. A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer, originally developed for a previous M. Sc. project, has been further developed in order to increase the sensitivity and to extend the instrument to the measurement of multiple gases. This type of instrument would be useful for environmental, industrial, and research applications. The instrument was inexpensive to construct when compared with the cost of current commercial <b>gas</b> <b>analysers,</b> is robust, and is partially portable around the laboratory. Infrared radiation from two infrared sources, pass through adjacent sample and reference cells and into corresponding detector cells. A sample comprising the analyte gas is contained in the sample cell, a non-absorbing gas, such as argon, is contained in the reference cell, and pure analyte gas of interest is contained in the detector cells. The two identical detector cells, which follow the reference and sample cells in the infrared optic paths, communicate only through a differential capacitance manometer which accurately measures small pressure differences between the otherwise identical cells. Any trace amount of the analyte gas in the sample cell absorbs radiation, depleting the appropriate infrared frequencies. This results in lower energy incident on the sample detector cell, reducing the infrared induced pressure rise in that detector cell compared to the reference side detector cell. The pressure difference is ii proportional to the concentration of absorbing gas in the sample cell, which is then determined using a calibration graph. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide calibration graphs from 40 ppm to 1000 ppm have been successfully established, and detection limits of 10. 33 ppm for CO₂, 8. 81 ppm for N₂O and 9. 17 ppm for CH₄ were determined. Dried air samples measured using the spectrometer gave an average value of 382 ± 9. 6 ppm which can be compared to the latest global atmospheric loading of 382. 4 ppm...|$|R

The described system can provide high resolution, high precision concentrations of both radon and pCO 2 with nearly no additional effort compared to measuring only one of these gases.

40|$|Background: The Innocor device {{contains}} a highly sensitive photoacoustic <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> {{that has been}} used to perform multiple breath washout (MBW) measurements using very low concentrations of the tracer gas SF 6. Use in smaller subjects has been restricted by the requirement for a <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> response time of, 100 ms, in order to ensure accurate estimation of lung volumes at rapid ventilation rates. Methods: A series of previously reported and novel enhancements were made to the <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> to produce a clinically practical system with a reduced response time. An enhanced lung model system, capable of delivering highly accurate ventilation rates and volumes, was used to assess in vitro accuracy of functional residual capacity (FRC) volume calculation and the effects of flow and gas signal alignment on this. Results: 10 – 90 % rise time was reduced from 154 to 88 ms. In an adult/child lung model, accuracy of volume calculation was 20. 9 to 2. 9 % for all measurements, including those with ventilation rate of 30 /min and FRC of 0. 5 L; for the un-enhanced system, accuracy deteriorated at higher ventilation rates and smaller FRC. In a separate smaller lung model (ventilation rate 60 /min, FRC 250 ml, tidal volume 100 ml), mean accuracy of FRC measurement for the enhanced system was minus 0. 95 % (range 23. 8 to 2. 0 %). Error sensitivity to flow and gas signal alignment was increased by ventilation rate, smaller FRC and slower analyser response time...|$|E
