In his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary. Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 {{percent of the vote}}; <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of independents, and 70 percent of Republicans.|$|E

40|$|We exploit {{a voting}} reform in France to {{estimate}} the causal effect of <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> information on turnout and bandwagon voting. Before the change in legislation, individuals in some French overseas territories voted after the election result had already been made public via <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> information from mainland France. We estimate that knowing the <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> information decreases voter turnout by about 11 percentage points. Our study is the first clean empirical design outside of the laboratory to demonstrate the effect of such knowledge on voter turnout. Furthermore, we find that <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> information significantly increases bandwagon voting; that is, voters who choose to turn out {{are more likely to}} vote for the expected winner...|$|R
40|$|Electronic vote {{counting}} equipment {{makes it}} easy for a few persons to electronically manipulate vote counts and virtually impossible to independently audit vote count accuracy. Without routine independent audits of hand-countable voter verified paper ballots, insiders have freedom to manipulate vote counts with negligible possibility of detection. This new <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> discrepancy function allows us, for the first time, to know what patterns of <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> discrepancy result from various combinations of vote miscounts, partisan <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> completion rate differences, and random sampling error (by simulation). These patterns can be compared with actual discrepancy patterns produced in elections to determine what causes are consistent with actual election discrepancy. This paper also outlines statistical methods to determine the number of precincts with significant discrepancy, and how to test precinct-level <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> and official election results data for consistency with partisan <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> response rate explanations. Using these methods, mathematicians or statisticians can determine if vote miscounts are indicated prior to when candidates concede future elections...|$|R

5|$|Bolivia's U.S. embassy {{had become}} {{publicly}} {{highly critical of}} Morales; {{just prior to the}} election, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to Bolivia would be cut if MAS won the election. However, <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales as a criminal and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.|$|E
5|$|As candidate, the {{proposals}} of Mancera included to continue Ebrard's policies, {{an increase of}} 13.000 to 20.000 safety cameras, a reduction of car travel time, {{the expansion of the}} Mexico City Metro , a review of the issue of solid waste, the minibuses will be removed from the streets, 18 water purification plants, a Green Plan, the replacement of garbage trucks to separate organic and inorganic waste, among others. On July 1, 2012, <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> noted that Mancera was the presumed winner of the election, with a margin of 59.5–64.5%, and had approximately 40% more votes than the second-place candidate, Paredes. On July 7, 2012, the Federal District Electoral Institute (IEDF) announced Mancera as Head of Government-elect, endorsing him with a certificate; which he received on October 8, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. <b>Exit</b> <b>polls</b> revealed that 35% of voters would have voted for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E

5|$|Croatia's county prefects, {{city and}} town mayors are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong to the appropriate minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00pm when the polling stations close and <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> may be announced.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day, Perot {{finished}} {{in third place}} behind Clinton (the winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% {{of the vote in}} Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska and Loving County, Texas with over 40%. According to <b>exit</b> <b>polls,</b> 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} members of the councils is defined by the councils themselves, based on {{applicable}} legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national ethnic minorities are represented on the council as required by the constitution. Further members who belong to the minorities may be added to the council in no candidate of that minority has been elected through the proportional representation system. Election silence, as in all other types of elections in Croatia, when campaigning is forbidden, is enforced the day before the election and continues until 19:00 hours on the election day when the polling stations close and <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> may be announced. Six nationwide local elections have been held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent being the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, and city and municipal councils and mayors. In 2009, the HDZ-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in fifteen county councils and thirteen county prefect elections. SDP-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils, including the city of Zagreb council, and the remaining county council election was won by IDS-SDP coalition. The SDP won four county prefect elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election, the HSS won three county prefect elections, and the HNS and the HDSSB won a single county prefect election each.|$|E

25|$|When {{the polls}} {{around the country}} closed at 19:00 RTL and Nova TV {{published}} {{the results of the}} <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> conducted by Ipsos PULS. They predicted a landslide win for Josipović, giving him an advantage of almost 30 percentage points, significantly larger than all of the second-round polls. This shifted much of the political commentary and rendered much of the expected drama moot. The Josipović headquarters started celebrating immediately after the polls closed claiming that the difference is too large for Bandić to overcome and the <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> don't feature such a large statistical margin of error. The Bandić campaign said they'll wait for official results, but admitted it would be very hard for Bandić to overtake Josipović's 30 point lead even when the votes from abroad were tallied. The <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> predicted the outcome well as the ratio between the two candidates was 9 to 1 for Bandić abroad, where there were no <b>exit</b> <b>polls,</b> which narrowed Josipović's victory to a final difference of 21 percentage points.|$|E

25|$|As all {{the polls}} around the country closed at 7p.m., the first <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> were {{published}} by the major television networks. They showed Ivo Josipović easily claiming first place, but failing to obtain an outright majority winning 32%. The polls showed Milan Bandić, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vidošević in a statistical tie with each of them achieving 14%, 12% and 11% respectively. Andrija Hebrang's third place {{was seen as a}} great success as most opinion polls before the first round showed him with only single-digit approval, while Nadan Vidošević's placing was seen as a disappointment since most polls before the vote showed him battling for second place with Milan Bandić. The polls predicted Vesna Pusić and Dragan Primorac would be the only other candidates to pass 5% with each of them collecting 7% and 5% respectively. In 2007, during the parliamentary election, all <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> predicted SDP would narrowly win, when in the reality HDZ turned out as the victor. With that in mind, Andrija Hebrang expressed conviction that when actual results were published, he would overtake Bandić and qualify for second round. He claimed that <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> do {{not take into account the}} votes coming from the citizens living abroad and that conservative voters do not participate in <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> as much as liberal voters. However, the <b>exit</b> <b>polls</b> predicted the outcome almost perfectly as the country's electoral commission's results later confirmed.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>exit</b> <b>polling</b> has {{not been}} used to study Canadian {{elections}} before, such polls have methodological features that make them a potentially useful complement to data collected through more conventional designs. This paper reports on an experiment with <b>exit</b> <b>polling</b> in one constituency in the 2003 Ontario provincial election. Using student volunteers, a research team at Wilfrid Laurier University conducted an <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> in the bellwether constituency of Kitchener Centre to assess the feasibility of mounting this kind of study on a broader scale. The experiment was successful {{in a number of}} respects. It produced a sample of 653 voters that broadly reflected the partisan character of the constituency, and which can hence be used to shed light on patterns of vote-switching and voter motivations in that constituency. It also yielded insights about best practices in mounting an <b>exit</b> <b>poll</b> in the Ontario context, as well as about the potential for using wireless communication devices to transmit respondent data from the field. The researchers conclude that <b>exit</b> <b>polling</b> on a limited basis (selected constituencies) is feasible, but the costs and logistics associated with this methodology make a province-wide or country-wide study unsupportable at present...|$|R
