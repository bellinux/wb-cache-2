25|$|Altiero Spinelli (31 August 1907 – 23 May 1986) was an Italian Communist politician, {{political}} theorist and European federalist. Spinelli {{is referred}} to as one of the founding fathers of the European Union due to his co-authorship of the Ventotene Manifesto, his founding role in the <b>European</b> <b>federalist</b> <b>movement,</b> his strong influence on the first few decades of post-World War II European integration and, later, his role in re-launching the integration process in the 1980s. By the time of his death, he {{had been a member of}} the European Commission for six years, a member of the European Parliament for ten years right up until his death. The main building of the European Parliament in Brussels is named after him. The 1987–1988 academic year at the College of Europe and the 2009–2010 academic year of the European College of Parma were named in his honour.|$|E

Her political career started in 1983, when she became {{actively involved in the}} <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement,</b> before being elected as Secretary General of the European organization of Young European Federalists (“JEF Europe”) in 1987.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, with some former colleagues from Ordre Nouveau, {{he worked with}} various <b>European</b> <b>federalist</b> <b>movements.</b> He joined The Federation, and the French <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Europe {{proponents of}} deeper European {{integration}} are sometimes called <b>Federalists.</b> A major <b>European</b> NGO and advocacy group campainging {{for such a}} political union is the Union of <b>European</b> <b>Federalists.</b> <b>Movements</b> towards a peacefully unified European state have existed since the 1920s, notably the Paneuropean Union.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, many {{of these}} Non-Conformists (Robert Aron, Daniel-Rops, Jean de Fabrègues, Denis de Rougemont, Alexandre Marc, Thierry Maulnier) became activists of <b>European</b> <b>federalist</b> <b>movements.</b> The founder of Ordre nouveau, Alexandre Marc, became in 1946 the first {{secretary}} of the Union of <b>European</b> <b>Federalists.</b> He would then create the Centre International de Formation Européenne (CIFE) in 1954, which lives on to this day.|$|R
5000|$|From 1943, Albert Camus had {{correspondence}} with Altiero Spinelli {{who founded the}} <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> in Milan—see Ventotene Manifesto and the book [...] "Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati", Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus.|$|E
50|$|In January 1945, {{after the}} Liberation, along with Piero Calamandrei, Corrado Tumiati, Enzo Enriques Agnoletti and Paride Baccarini, he founded, in Florence, the Associazione Federalisti Europei (AFE, its acronym - in English Association of European Federalists), uniting {{afterwards}} integrating into the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> founded by Altiero Spinelli, which, between 1947-1948 {{had an important}} role.|$|E
5000|$|Marc {{participated in}} the {{creation}} of the group [...] "La Fédération" [...] and became, in 1946, the Secretary General of the Union of European Federalists and in 1953, the leader of the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> and founder of the journal L'Europe en formation. As a founder of the Centre international de formation européenne (CIFE) in 1954, he {{participated in the}} organization of the Hague Congress.|$|E
50|$|Various federalist organisations {{have been}} created over time {{supporting}} {{the idea of a}} federal Europe. These include the Union of <b>European</b> <b>Federalists,</b> the <b>European</b> <b>Movement</b> International and the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> Party.|$|R
5000|$|The US {{sought to}} promote an {{economically}} strong and politically united Western Europe {{to counter the}} threat posed by the Soviet Union. This was done openly using tools such as the European Recovery Program, which encouraged European economic integration. The International Authority for the Ruhr, designed to keep German industry down and controlled, evolved into the European Coal and Steel Community, a founding pillar of the European Union. The United States also worked covertly to promote European integration, for example using the American Committee on United Europe to funnel funds to <b>European</b> <b>federalist</b> <b>movements.</b> In order to ensure that Western Europe could withstand the Soviet military threat, the Western European Union was founded in 1948 and NATO in 1949. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, famously stated the organisation's goal was [...] "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down". However, without the manpower and industrial output of West Germany no conventional defence of Western Europe had any hope of succeeding. To remedy this, in 1950 the US sought to promote the European Defence Community, which would have included a rearmed West Germany. The attempt was dashed when the French Parliament rejected it. On 9 May 1955, West Germany was instead admitted to NATO; the immediate result was the creation of the Warsaw Pact five days later.|$|R
50|$|Various federalist organisations {{have been}} created over time {{supporting}} {{the idea of a}} federal Europe. These include the Union of <b>European</b> <b>Federalists,</b> the <b>European</b> <b>Movement</b> International and the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> Party. The Union of <b>European</b> <b>Federalists</b> (UEF) is a European non-governmental organisation, campaigning for a Federal Europe. It consists of 20 constituent organisations and it has been active at the European, national and local levels for more than 50 years. The European Movement International is a lobbying association that coordinates the efforts of associations and national councils with the goal of promoting European integration, and disseminating information about it. The <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> Party is the pro-European, pan-European and federalist political party which advocates further integration of the EU and the establishment of a Federal Europe. Its aim is to gather all Europeans to promote European federalism and to participate in all elections all over Europe. It has national sections in 15 countries.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the other}} prisoners {{and friends of}} Eugenio Colorni on Ventotene were Ernesto Rossi and Altiero Spinelli, who in 1941 co-authored the famous Ventotene Manifesto [...] "for a free and united Europe", i.e. an early sketch of a postwar {{democratic}} European Union. Ursula managed to bring {{the text of the}} manifesto to the mainland and took part in its dissemination. On 27 and 28 August 1943, she participated in the foundation of the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> in Milan.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1947 Roberto Lucifero was {{appointed}} General Secretary of the Italian Liberal Party. This reflected events at the Party Congress of November 1947 which had been widely interpreted as a take-over by the party's right wing. (Lucifero himself was a fervent monarchist, which {{in the eyes of}} some was the next worst thing to a closet fascist.) Pannunzio now joined the former party leader, Leone Cattani, and others, in resigning his party membership. Later he joined Altiero Spinelli's <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The europa was a token coinage {{created in}} 1928 by Joseph Archer, a {{politician}} and industrialist from the Nièvre region of France. The currency was promoted by Philibert Besson, the elected deputy for the Haute-Loire who, along with Archer, {{was an important}} figure in the early <b>European</b> <b>federalist</b> <b>movement.</b> The coins were minted {{in the name of}} a hypothetical [...] "Federated States of Europe" [...] (États Fédérés d'Europe). Unlike contemporary currencies that were based on the gold standard, the europa derived its notional value from labour.|$|E
50|$|The World <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> has Member Organizations (MOs) and Associate Organizations {{around the}} world, {{including}} Citizens for Global Solutions, Union of <b>European</b> <b>Federalists,</b> World Federalist Movement-Canada, The Universal Party, and the World <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> of Japan.

50|$|The Federalist Party (Parti fédéraliste, PF) was a French <b>European</b> <b>federalist</b> {{political}} party, {{founded in}} 1995 by Jean-Philippe Allenbach.

50|$|Born in Milan, Colorni taught {{philosophy}} at the University of Trieste, and {{was active in}} the anti-fascist Giustizia e Libertà movement. He married Ursula Hirschmann, and was an important influence on her brother Albert O. Hirschman, who dedicated his book Exit, Voice, and Loyalty to Colorni's memory. Colorni was one of the promoters of the Ventotene Manifesto and an early instigator of the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement.</b> In 1938 he was arrested for his anti-fascist political activity. He escaped but was killed in Rome by a Nazi ambush in 1944, shortly before the Allies arrived.|$|E
50|$|Irujo {{continued}} to be active in discussions over the federal constitution of Europe {{in the years that}} followed. At the congress of the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> in 1972 he was appointed honorary president of the Peninsula Federal Council of the European movement. On 25 March 1977 he returned from exile and was elected senator for Navarre. He was elected on the PNV platform to the provincial parliament of Navarre as representative for Pamplona in 1979. Manuel de Irujo Ollo died on 1 January 1981 at the age of 89.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> (Movimento Federalista Europeo, MFE) {{was founded}} in Milan in 1943 {{by a group of}} activists led by Altiero Spinelli. The {{principles}} which inspired its foundation are contained in the Ventotene Manifesto, drawn up in 1941 by Spinelli himself, in collaboration with Ernesto Rossi, Eugenio Colorni and Ursula Hirschmann. Vayssière notes that the manifesto is widely seen as the birth of European federalism. Spinelli (1907-86), a former Communist, became a leader of the federalist movement due to his primary authorship of the Manifesto and his postwar advocacy. The manifesto called for a break with Europe's past to form a new political system through a restructuring of politics and extensive social reform. It was presented not as an ideal, but as the best option for the Europe's postwar condition.|$|E

50|$|Following May 1948 Congress of the Hague, {{was created}} in Italy, in December 1948, a National Council of the European Movement which was an {{organism}} {{in charge of the}} cooperation between the pro-European MPs and the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement.</b> However its rebuilding was necessary in 1956 because of the opposition inside the pro-European movement between the so-called “functionalists”, supporters of a progressive market integration of the “little Europe” - in which they recognized the necessary base for every further development - and the majority of the Italian federalists, like Altiero Spinelli, very critical about the European governments after the failure of the European Community of Defence. In these conditions, it seemed unavoidable that the CIME assumes de facto an alternative character respecting to the militant federalism because of its composition (including political parties in charge and unions related to these). This situation evolved with time, notably thank to the accession of Giuseppe Petrilli at the Presidency in autumn 1964. In spite of being {{a former member of the}} EEC-three-first-year Commission, he matured a vision of the integration process which surpass the intergovernmental approach. The merger between the CIME and the Federalist Movement came to a conclusion in 1966 with the adhesion of the second to the first. The European Movement joined - first at the national level then to the European one - the fundamental positions of the federalist strategy and so recognized the importance of European Parliament election at the universal direct suffrage as an indispensable condition for any further progress on the political and institutional camp. When the parliamentary initiative of Altiero Spinelli (after the 1979 first EP elections) demonstrated the adequacy of this strategy, the CIME gave it its full support, through the strong pressure in favour of the treaty project made by the European Parliament to the Italian presidency of the Community, in the first semester of 1985. From there, the successive presidencies of Mauro Ferri, Mario Zagari e Giorgio Napolitano largely confirmed the continuity of the rapport within the CIME between the national political, social-economic forces and the federalist avant-garde. So the CIME counted among the protagonists in Italy of the constant commitment in favour of the Euro creation but also of European institutional reforms to get to the adoption of a real Constitution for the Union.|$|E
40|$|The {{beginning}} of organized European cooperation in adult education {{was the focus}} of a research study. A brief review of earlier research was conducted. Study findings indicated that, after World War II, Europe was less influential in issues of real significance in the world, with the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe and the center of power shifting to the United States from Western Europe. From a cultural point of view, the war was catastrophic to Germany's heritage. Other Western European countries were also in desperate need of recovery. In May 1948, a Conference of the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> was held in The Hague. Its ideological foundation was a federal Europe. Two short-term goals were set: the foundation of a Council of Europe and a European Cultural,'enter (ECC).

40|$|Subject of {{a recent}} revival of interest, {{for a long period}} Ferruccio Parri {{has been one of the}} great men “forgotten” by historians. Commander of the Resistance, he is a staunch {{supporter}} of its European identity. In June 1945 he became President of the Council for a semester, remaining a member of parliament until 1953. He can rightly be considered also one of the most important players in the beginning of the process of continental integration. The article focuses on this specific aspect. After the launch of the Marshall Plan and the start of the process of European unification, Parri is at the forefront in the fight for the European Federation. He becomes part of the European Parliamentary Union (UPE), of the Union Européenne des fédéralistes (UEF) and of the <b>European</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> (MFE). After the elections of 1948, he becomes president of the Italian Parliamentary Group for the European Union in the Senate. Since that moment, Parri is increasingly involved in the struggle for federalism, embracing the constituent method. In July 1949 he is appointed a member of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. His action in favour of the Constituent Assembly is especially lively after the presentation of the Pleven Plan. Because of is disagreement on the EDC, he comes out from the MFE in 1954, but he is continuing even after to deal with European integration...|$|E
