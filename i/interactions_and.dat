5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug <b>interactions</b> <b>and</b> preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E

The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic <b>interactions,</b> <b>and</b> van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E

Using a sample of about 2000 Portuguese high school students, a structural model reveals that low social self-esteem directly and negatively influences teacher-student <b>interaction</b> <b>and</b> student-student <b>interaction</b> <b>and</b> also learning performance.

5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong <b>interactions,</b> <b>and</b> the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close <b>interactions</b> <b>and</b> near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E

5|$|PSA-NCAM {{appears as}} another candidate. Mice lacking NCAM show a {{dramatically}} size-reduced OB and {{an accumulation of}} migrating precursors along the RMS.

It has been demonstrated that a cross talk exists between neurons and glial cells and data in favor of an active role of PSA–NCAM in this process has been presented. The lack of PSA–NCAM on the surface of migrating precursors might alter the proliferative properties of this glial cell population, a scenario that appears reminiscent of astrogliosis occurring in neurodegenerative diseases even before any signs of neuronal damage.|$|E
