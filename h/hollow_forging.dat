2500|$|The wheel rotated on a 71-ton, 45.5-foot axle {{comprising}} {{what was}} at that time the world's largest <b>hollow</b> <b>forging,</b> manufactured in Pittsburgh by the Bethlehem Iron Company and weighing 89,320pounds, together with two [...] cast-iron spiders weighing 53,031pounds.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor that}} affects its {{weight and balance}} is the {{construction}} of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength the blade might be <b>hollow</b> <b>forged,</b> or a fuller is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including: tin chira (triple fuller), dui chira (double fuller), angkhola (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large beveled edge.|$|R

40|$|The {{main fitting}} {{subassembly}} of {{main landing gear}} of an aircraft {{was sent to the}} laboratory for analyzing the mechanism and cause of failure. The subassembly was found broken at up-locking position. A part of the bearing was also found fractured and lost. Fractographic examination confirmed that the failure was by overload such as sudden impact. From gross fractographic features, it appears that in the sequence of failure, the plunger got fractured first resulting in fracturing of the bearing. Simultaneously, the <b>hollow</b> <b>forged</b> member made of Al-alloy got cracked along the forging-parting line with subsequent fracture. Analysis suggests that there could be oblique heavy landing of the aircraft which led to the sudden impact failure of the main fitting subassembly. There were no indications of progressive failure such as fatigue or stress corrosion cracking...|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{has a unique}} shape which {{has been described as}} [...] "half a silkworm's cocoon, cut in half the long way." [...] It is 1,175 feet (358.14 m) long, 325 feet (99.06 m) wide, and 211 feet (64.31 m) high, supported by 13 steel arches. There is 364,000 square feet (34 000 mÂ²) of unobstructed floor space, or an area larger than 8 football fields side-by-side. The Airdock has a volume of 55 million cubic feet (or about 1.5 million cubic meters). At the northeast end of the building a control tower and radio aerial are on top of the airdock. At each end of the building are two huge semi-spherical doors that each weigh 600 tons (544 000 kg). At the top, the doors are fastened by <b>hollow</b> <b>forged</b> pins 17 inches (43 cm) in diameter and six feet (1.83 m) long. The doors roll on forty wheels on specially-designed curved railroad tracks, powered by an individual power plant each, which can open the doors in about 5 minutes.|$|R

The old man was cutting a faggot in his garden by the hives. It was quite a second after his chopper fell that the chump of the blow reached their lazy ears.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of numerical analysis of forming a <b>hollowed</b> gear shaft <b>forging,</b> used in automotive industry. Numerical simulations of the process were made by means of finite elements method (FEM) in conditions of three dimensional state of strain with consideration of thermal phenomena. During calculations, geometrical parameters of the obtained products were analyzed, distributions of strains and temperatures were determined. The process force parameters were also given. In the result of conducted research works, it was stated {{that it is possible to}} form in a rotary way axi-symmetrical hollowed forgings...|$|R
25|$|At the {{southern}} end, NY315 begins in Waterville at an intersection with NY12. Paralleling Big Creek, the route heads northwestward through mostly rural and residential land. The route, locally known as Buell Avenue along {{this stretch of}} its source, crosses several of the creek's tributaries as it progresses towards the hamlet of Deansboro, where it bends slightly westward and uneventfully terminates at NY12B. Approximately midway between Waterville and Deansboro is <b>Forge</b> <b>Hollow.</b> Here, the road makes an S-shaped turn around Big Creek and one finds a rock face with caves and a natural spring. The entire route is five miles long.|$|R
5000|$|Rye House {{is located}} in Litchfield's Bantam borough, at the {{northwest}} corner of Old Mount Tom Road and Old <b>Forge</b> <b>Hollow</b> Road. The estate includes the main house, a gardener's cottage, landscaped gardens surrounding the house, and other amenities. The main house is a large 2-1/2 story stone structure, built out of stone that has been stuccoed except for rustic corner quoining. To the west of the house is a formally landscaped garden area, and a lawn extends south toward Old Mount Tom Road, where the property is fringed by trees. The house contains 18 rooms totaling 10,127 square feet. The property includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool and tennis court. [...] The gardener's cottage, itself a substantial construction is located near the estate entrance, {{on the west side of}} its drive. It is two stories in height, and has Bungalow/craftsman styling.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn today's {{competitive}} business environment, it {{has become}} increasingly important to reduce manufacturing and raw materials cost. For this purpose, an innovative process of design and manufacturing railway axles is developed. It is based on <b>forging</b> <b>hollow</b> axles which allows a significant reduction in steel consumption. In this work, we tried to analyze how these modifications induced by this new process and design impact the service behavior and particularly the durability face to cyclic loadings that can lead to fatigue failure. In the present study, a numerical chain has been developed going from the simulation of the manufacturing process up to the analysis in fatigue. In the first step, the forging process is modeled in order to predict the residual stress field and the initial plastic strain. From this initial condition, the assembly operation of the wheel on the axle is simulated before the redistribution of stresses and strains under cyclic load. The final objective is to obtain the cyclic loadingpaths, in order to provide the data needed for the analysis of fatigue...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to document part of a collaborative research program undertaken by the Centre for Computer Integrated Manufacture (CIM Centre) at Swinburne University of Technology in Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia and Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Ltd in the field of 'non-contact inspection'. This research program is one of two collaborative programs between the CIM Centre and ADI Ltd, related to inspecting the quality of components in an automated fashion, without the use of contacting sensors. There are a number of techniques currently being investigated at the CIM Centre, including lasers, vision, acoustic emission and X-ray based methods. This particular paper focuses on the research work undertaken by the first author in the detection of internal surface defects in <b>forged,</b> <b>hollow</b> cylindrical workpieces. The case study presented for consideration and discussion herein is related to the detection of cavity defects in forged pressure vessels. The paper provides a background into the range of alternative non-contact inspection techniques that are available (including lasers, ultrasonics, etc.) and the reasons why some of these failed to provide the functionality that was offered by the vision approach ultimately adopted. There is nothing unique about the application of vision systems in the detection of surface defects. However, in this research program, a number of factors have considerably complicated the application. These include lighting problems and the difficulties encountered in acquiring images within a confined cylindrical space. This paper documents the techniques that have been used to resolve some of these practical image acquisition and processing problems and the relative merits of each approach. The paper also examines some of the algorithmic problems involved in detection of particular surface anomalies in components through a range of techniques and concludes that the one most suited to the surfaces in the pressure vessel case-study is the so-called 'region-growing' approach...|$|R
