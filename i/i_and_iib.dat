40|$|Small {{populations are}} likely to have a low genetic ability for disease {{resistance}} due to loss of genetic variation through inbreeding and genetic drift. In vertebrates, the highest genetic diversity of the immune system is located at genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Interestingly, parasite-mediated selection is thought to potentially maintain variation at MHC loci even in populations that are monomorphic at other loci. Therefore, general loss of genetic variation in the genome may not necessarily be associated with low variation at MHC loci. We evaluated inter- and intrapopulation variation in MHC genotypes between an inbred (Aldra) and a relatively outbred population (Hestmann√∏y) of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in a metapopulation at Helgeland, Norway. Genomic (gDNA) and transcribed (cDNA) alleles of functional MHC class <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> loci, along with neutral noncoding microsatellite markers, were analyzed to obtain relevant estimates of genetic variation. We found lower allelic richness in microsatellites in the inbred population, but high genetic variation in MHC class <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> loci in both populations. This suggests that also the inbred population could be under balancing selection to maintain genetic variation for pathogen resistance...|$|E

A total of 603 patients with stage I or II HL were entered into this trial; laparotomy {{was carried out in}} 380 (63 %) patients. Stage I or IIA disease patients were randomised to receive IF or EF comprising a mantle or inverted Y fields alone. Stage <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> patients were randomised between mantle or inverted Y fields and total nodal irradiation (TNI). The dose was 35 Gy to uninvolved sites and 40 Gy to involved sites. The median followup of surviving patients was 25. 2 years with only 3. 3 % lost to follow-up. The treatment failure rate at 25 years in stage IA and IIA was 44 % after EF and 54 % after IF (P = 0. 01); in stage <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> this was 80 % (EF) and 82 % (TNI) at 25 years. No difference in overall survival between the randomised groups was seen. The incidence of second malignancies was 21 % after IF and 20 % after EF with a slight excess of lung cancer in the EF group. No significant differences in the causes of death between the randomised arms have emerged. In conclusion, IF radiotherapy for stage I and IIA HL results in a 11 % greater risk of relapse compared with EF but has no effect on overall survival, risk of second malignancy or cause of death at 25 years...|$|E

40|$|The {{passerine}} major {{histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> genes {{are different from those}} of the avian model species the chicken because passerines have (1) a larger number of MHC genes, (2) MHC genes with longer introns, and (3) MHC genes that are pseudo-genes. Most passerine MHC genes are transcribed (coding), extremely variable and subject to balancing selection. The high genetic diversity of the MHC genes of passerines is most likely maintained by selection from a large number of different pathogens. Association between MHC alleles and resistance to avian malaria infections have been reported in House Sparrows and Great Reed Warblers. Passerines are infected by a large number of different avian malaria infections.

40|$|The stapedius muscle (SM) is {{supposed}} to prevent cochlear damage by noise. Consequently functional demands are the ability of fast contraction with long endurance. This implies {{the presence of a}} large fraction of myosin type II fibres with an appreciable oxidative capacity. We determined the myosin composition of SM fibres using consecutive complete SM cross-sections (6 week old rats) which were processed by enzyme histochemistry (EHC) to determine acid/alkali lability of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) or by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using myosin heavy chain (MyHC) antibodies. Method accuracy was determined in co-processed extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Four hundred SM and 200 EDL fibres were assigned to mATPase type I, IIA, IIB, IIX or 'miscellaneous' ('Misc') categories. Per mATPase category the fibres were attributed to groups with specific MyHC composition. In the EDL, mATPase type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> fibres expressed only MyHC <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> respectively, whereas about 10 % of the type IIA and 40 % of the type IIX fibres expressed more than one MyHC. Thus IHC detects amounts of myosin isoforms which are not detected by EHC. The mATPase IIX category criterion leaves the possibility that this category contains fibres with myosin type IIA and/or IIB in larger amounts. The criteria of the mATPase categories type I, IIA or IIB preclude assignment to these categories of fibres which also contain other myosin isoforms in larger amounts. Such fibres were classified in one of the mATPase 'Misc' categories. Thus in the EDL the capability of the EHC criteria to select 'pure' fibres in terms of myosin differs per mATPase category. None of the SM fibres were assigned to the mATPase type I or IIB categories, about 25 % to the type IIA, 60 % to type IIX and 15 % (including most fibres which expressed MyHC I) to a 'Misc' category. All SM fibres expressed two or more MyHC isoforms, MyHC IIB occurring in all fibres and substantial amounts of MyHC IIA and/or IIX in most. These findings confirm the hypothesis that such fibres have the capacity to contract fast and have the better fatigue resistanc...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of altered thyroid state and denervation (Den) on {{skeletal}} myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression in the plantaris and soleus muscles. Rats were subjected to unilateral denervation (Den) and randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) euthyroid; (2) hyperthyroid; (3) and hypothyroid. Denervation caused severe muscle atrophy and muscle-type specific MHC transformation. Denervation transformed the soleus to a faster muscle, and its effects required the presence of circulating thyroid hormone. In contrast, denervation transformed the plantaris to a slower muscle independently of thyroid state. Furthermore, thyroid hormone effects did not depend upon innervation status in the soleus, while they required the presence of the nerve in the plantaris. Collectively, these findings suggest that both thyroid hormone and intact nerve (a) differentially affect MHC transformations in fast and slow muscle; and (b) are important factors in regulating the optimal expression of both type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> MHC genes. This research suggests that for patients with nerve damage and/or paralysis, both muscle mass and biochemical properties can also be affected by the thyroid state...|$|E

Considering that the CTRB derived from recycled materials, it is necessary to do the analysis of the effects on vehicle operating cost, because one of the parameters to measure the level of comfort and safety in driving path is determined by the condition of the pavement, which indirectly affects the speed generated in driving. This study aims to assess the extent of vehicle operating cost incurred by the vehicle group <b>I,</b> IIA <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> that have passed through the South Arterial Road, as well as to assess the influence of the compressive strength of Cement Treated Recycling Base (CTRB) on the vehicle operating cost of group <b>I,</b> IIA <b>and</b> <b>IIB.</b> This research was carried out by conducting a survey to get the average vehicle speed data group <b>I,</b> IIA <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> <b>and</b> the data collection of costs component for calculation of vehicle operating cost.

Four distinct alleles {{were found for}} each locus, corresponding to the sequence classes present in the homozygous discrete typing units (DTUs) I, IIa, IIb, and IIc. The alleles in DTUs IIa and IIc showed a spectrum of polymorphism ranging from DTU I-like to DTU IIb-like, in addition to DTU-specific sequence variation. DTUs IId and IIe were indistinguishable, showing DTU homozygosity at one locus and heterozygosity with DTU IIb and IIc allelic sequences at eight loci. Recombination between the DTU IIb and IIc alleles is evidenced from mosaic polymorphisms. These data imply that two discrete hybridization events resulted {{in the formation of}} the current DTUs.

Fragments from muscles were frozen and processed by mATPase in different pH. Adult and weanling rat soleus muscles presented a predominance of type I fibers and larger fiber diameters. In the plantar muscle in adult rats, the type IIB fibers demonstrated greater lesser diameter while in the weanling animals, types <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> fibers were larger. The plantar muscle of animals of both ages was composed predominantly of the type IID fibers. The type IID fibers were observed in similar amounts in the lateral gastrocnemius and the medial gastrocnemius muscles.

The angiosperm SUT family was previously classified into three or four distinct groups, Types <b>I,</b> II (subgroup <b>IIB)</b> <b>and</b> III, with dicot-specific Type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> monocot-specific Type <b>IIB</b> functioning in phloem loading. To {{shed light on the}} underlying drivers of SUT evolution, Bayesian phylogenetic inference was undertaken using 41 sequenced plant genomes, including seven basal lineages at key evolutionary junctures. Our analysis supports four phylogenetically and structurally distinct SUT subfamilies, originating from two ancient groups (AG 1 and AG 2) that diverged early during terrestrial colonization. In both AG 1 and AG 2, multiple intron acquisition events in the progenitor vascular plant established the gene structures of modern SUTs. Tonoplastic Type III and plasmalemmal Type II represent evolutionarily conserved descendants of AG 1 and AG 2, respectively. Type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> Type <b>IIB</b> were previously thought to evolve after the dicot-monocot split. We show, however, that divergence of Type I from Type III SUT predated basal angiosperms, likely associated with evolution of vascular cambium and phloem transport. Type I SUT was subsequently lost in monocots along with vascular cambium, and independent evolution of Type IIB coincided with modified monocot vasculature. Both Type <b>I</b> <b>and</b> Type <b>IIB</b> underwent lineage-specific expansion. In multiple unrelated taxa, the newly-derived SUTs exhibit biased expression in reproductive tissues, suggesting a functional link between phloem loading and reproductive fitness.

However, the genome sequencing of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) has partially redressed this gap in our knowledge of avian MHC genes. Here, we contribute further {{to the understanding of}} the zebra finch MHC organization by mapping SNPs within or close to known MHC genes in the zebra finch genome.

In the zebrafish some class IIB loci have been silenced, as only two genomically bona fide loci, DAA/DAB and DEA/DEB, have been described.

Here, the second generation selective HDAC 6 inhibitor citarinostat (ACY- 241), with a more favorable safety profile than non-selective pan-HDAC inhibitors, is shown to synergize with pomalidomide in in vitro assays through promoting greater apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, utilizing a multiple myeloma in vivo murine xenograft model, combination treatment with pomalidomide and ACY- 241 leads to increased tumor growth inhibition.

Contacts between the U 2 snRNA and SF 3 a 60, SF 3 b 49, SF 3 b 14 a/p 14 and SmG and SmB were detected. SF 3 b 49 appears to make multiple contacts, interacting with the 5 ‚Ä≤ end of U 2 and nucleotides in loops <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIb.</b> SF 3 a 60 also contacted different regions of the U 2 snRNA, including the base of stem-loop I and a bulge in stem-loop III. Consistent with it contacting the pre-mRNA branch point adenosine, SF 3 b 14 a/p 14 interacted with the U 2 snRNA near the region that base pairs with the branch point sequence. A comparison of U 2 cross-linking patterns obtained with 17 S U 2 snRNP versus purified spliceosomal A and B complexes revealed that RNA-protein interactions with stem-loop I and the branch site-interacting region of U 2 are dynamic. These studies provide important insights into the molecular architecture of 17 S U 2 snRNPs and reveal U 2 snRNP remodeling events during spliceosome assembly...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{findings}} {{have suggested that}} class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) (HDAC 4, - 5, - 7, and - 9) are inactive on acetylated substrates, thus differing from class <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIb</b> enzymes. Here, we present evidence supporting this view and demonstrate that class IIa HDACs are very inefficient enzymes on standard substrates. We identified HDAC inhibitors unable to bind recombinant human HDAC 4 while showing inhibition in a typical HDAC 4 enzymatic assay, suggesting that the observed activity rather reflects the involvement of endogenous copurified class I HDACs. Moreover, an HDAC 4 catalytic domain purified from bacteria was 1, 000 -fold less active than class I HDACs on standard substrates. A catalytic Tyr is conserved in all HDACs except for vertebrate class IIa enzymes where it is replaced by His. Given the high structural conservation of HDAC active sites, we predicted the class IIa His-NŒµ 2 to be {{too far away to}} functionally substitute the class I Tyr-OH in catalysis. Consistently, a Tyr-to-His mutation in class I HDACs severely reduced their activity. More importantly, a His- 976 -Tyr mutation in HDAC 4 produced an enzyme with a catalytic efficiency 1, 000 -fold higher than WT, and this ‚Äúgain of function phenotype‚Äù could be extended to HDAC 5 and - 7. We also identified trifluoroacetyl-lysine as a class IIa-specific substrate in vitro. Hence, vertebrate class IIa HDACs may have evolved to maintain low basal activities on acetyl-lysines and to efficiently process restricted sets of specific, still undiscovered natural substrates...|$|E
40|$|The Toll-interleukin- 1 {{receptor}} (TIR) and Nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domains are {{two major}} components of the TIR-NBS-leucine-rich repeat family plant disease resistance genes. Extensive functional and evolutionary studies have been performed on these genes; however, the characterization {{of a small group}} of genes that are composed of atypical TIR and NBS domains, namely XTNX genes, is limited. The present study investigated this specific gene family by conducting genome-wide analyses of 59 green plant genomes. A total of 143 XTNX genes were identified in 51 of the 52 land plant genomes, whereas no XTNX gene was detected in any green algae genomes, which indicated that XTNX genes originated upon emergence of land plants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ancestral XTNX gene underwent two rounds of ancient duplications in land plants, which resulted in the formation of clades I/II and clades IIa/IIb successively. Although clades <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>IIb</b> have evolved conservatively in angiosperms, the motif composition difference and sequence divergence at the amino acid level suggest that functional divergence may have occurred since the separation of the two clades. In contrast, several features of the clade IIa genes, including the absence in the majority of dicots, the long branches in the tree, the frequent loss of ancestral motifs, and the loss of expression in all detected tissues of Zea mays, all suggest that the genes in this lineage might have undergone pseudogenization. This study highlights that XTNX genes are a gene family originated anciently in land plants and underwent specific conservative pattern in evolution...|$|E
40|$|Lipoxygenase was {{extracted}} from Canola seeds (Brassica napus cv, Westar) and partially purified by precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 20 - 50 % of saturation. The optimum pH for the enzyme activity was 7. 5 and its K$ sb{ rm m}$ value was 2. 0 $ times$ 10 $ sp{- 4 }$ M. The {{activity of the}} enzyme extract was considerably greater on linoleic acid than on its ester or on linolenic acid. The effect of cyanide on the enzyme activity was also investigated. Further purification of the enzyme extract was performed by successive chromatography on ion-exchange and gel filtration, using FPLC system. Four lipoxygenase isozymes (<b>I,</b> IIA, <b>IIB</b> <b>and</b> III) were separated. The homogeneity of each isozyme was demonstrated {{by the presence of}} a single protein band on SDS-PAGE gel electophoresis. The molecular weights of isozymes <b>I,</b> IIA, <b>IIB</b> <b>and</b> III were, respectively, 72, 000, 106, 000, 78, 000 and 62, 000.

40|$|Skeletal muscles {{respond to}} several stimuli {{changing}} their phenotype. Muscular fibers adaptation capability {{is related to}} the presence of several myosin heavy chains (MHC). These express four types of pure fibers: <b>I,</b> IIA, IID <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> containing MHCI, IIa, IId <b>and</b> <b>IIb,</b> respectively. Among pure fibers, there are hybrid fibers, which can express two or more types of myosins. In this study, types of fibers constituting male Wistar rats semitendinous and their myosin heavy chains, as well as influence of intermittent training on hypertrophy of these fibers have been checked through MATPase histochemical technique and electrophoretic proteins separation. All types of pure and hybrid muscular fiber have been found, however the fibers of the types IIA, IID <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> were predominant, featuring muscle as a fast-contracting one. Training has promoted muscular fibers transition with a significant increase of fibers of IC, IIAD and IIDB type. A cross-section increase of fibers of IIDB <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> type has also been noticed. In summary, semitendinous muscle is essentially constituted by fast-contracting fibers and training could promote transition and hypertrophy of these fast fibers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{developed}} a method which, by combining histochemical, immunohistochemical, electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses on a single fibre, enables a sensitive characterization of human skeletal muscle fibres dissected from freeze-dried biopsy samples. For histochemical (and immunohistochemical) analysis fibre fragments (500 microns) of individual fibres were mounted in an embedding medium to allow cryostat sections of normalized thickness to be reproducibly obtained. The specificity of the myofibrillar Ca 2 + ATPase (mATPase) staining profiles in gelatin-embedded single fibre sections was tested by immunohistochemical reactions with anti-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) monoclonal antibodies specific to human MyHC <b>I,</b> IIA, <b>IIB</b> <b>and</b> IIA + <b>IIB</b> <b>and</b> by gel electrophoresis. The combined methodologies demonstrated the specificity of the mATPase staining patterns which correlated to the expression of distinct MyHC isoforms. In addition the results provide evidence that many fibres co-expressed different MyHC isoforms in variable relative amounts, forming a continuum. Staining intensities for mATPase, converted into optical density values by image analysis revealed that a relationship between mATPase and MyHC expression holds for hybrid fibres even when displaying one MyHC type with overwhelming dominance. The results also revealed that three MyHC isoforms <b>I,</b> IIA <b>and</b> <b>IIB</b> can be co-expressed on a single muscle fibre. In such a case mATPase alone, with the current protocols, does not allow an accurate characterization of the specific MyHC-based fibre type(s). Although some hybrid fibres may have displayed a non-uniform expression of myosins along their lengths, most fibres from the IIA/B group (type) remained very stable {{with respect to the}} relative amounts of the MyHCs expressed. Finally, a second slow MyHC isoform was recognized on immunoblots of a mixed muscle sampl...|$|R
