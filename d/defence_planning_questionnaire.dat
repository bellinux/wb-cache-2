40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{long-term}} <b>defence</b> <b>planning</b> {{systems of the}} Nordic countries Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, as well as France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Long-term <b>defence</b> <b>planning</b> is here understood as a process by which a given state arrives at a policy on the future development of their armed forces. It {{takes place at the}} interface between the political, military and civil service spheres. The study aims to identify the actors involved in long-term <b>defence</b> <b>planning,</b> and how the planning processes are carried out. The clearest finding is that long-term <b>defence</b> <b>planning</b> is conducted in very different ways in all the countries studied. There is a wide variety of actors and institutions who initiate, control and contribute to the long-term planning process. For instance, in some countries the ministry of defence is in control, while in others it plays a subordinate role. When it comes to how the planning is carried out, there are differences in frequency, timing and outlook, as well as how methodical and structured the different systems are. Moreover, {{there is reason to believe}} that these differences are rooted in the constitutional traditions and long-established public management practices of each country, and therefore difficult to change. When considering future international cooperation on long-term <b>defence</b> <b>planning,</b> these differences should be kept in mind...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel optimization technique {{for determining the}} setting of various emergency power system controls. This will allow {{for the production of}} a comprehensive <b>defence</b> <b>plan,</b> against events such as cascading blackouts. The goal of this technique is to retrieve a new equilibrium operation point following a severe contingency. In general, the emergency controls used to prevent cascading blackouts are generator tripping, fast-valving, load shedding, excitation controls and system islanding. However, generator tripping, load shedding and system islanding are the most effective control actions. As such, these are considered as the main emergency control actions in the proposed optimization technique described in this paper. This problem is a complex nonlinear problem and {{it is very difficult to}} solve using ordinary numerical optimization method such as mixed integer linear programming. Since Genetic Algorithm approaches are very successful at solving nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems, these have been applied in this work to produce an optimized <b>defence</b> <b>plan.</b> Genetic Algorithms are search algorithms based on the mechanism of natural selection and natural genetics subject to survival of the fittest among string structures that identify possible solutions to a problem. A Genetic Algorithm approach is used to find the optimal combination of generators and loads to be tripped as the best solution for the network to regain a new state of equilibrium that is operationally stable, whilst maintaining supply to as many consumers as possible. System islanding may also be applied if a satisfactory state of equilibrium can not otherwise be obtained. The optimization technique uses transient stability evaluation algorithms, based on timedomain simulation, to assess the fitness of the potential solutions. The test case, presented in this paper, for the optimization technique was the Libyan power system network. In order to show the validity of the optimized <b>defence</b> <b>plan,</b> a comparison between the existing Libyan power system <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> and the optimized <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> is presented for the case of a major blackout in the western part of the Libyan power system that took place on 8 th November 2003. The results presented in this paper show that a robust <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> with a satisfactory amount of load shedding and system islands can be obtained by the new technique. The paper also demonstrates that the new <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> outperforms the existing Libyan power system <b>defence</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

40|$|Military plans {{validation}} {{is typically}} {{a long and}} costly process requiring planners to validate their plans using anticipated scenarios or through military exercises. While military exercises provide realistic simulation of the plan, it is often the most expensive way of validating a plan. On the other hand, although using anticipated scenarios is relatively cheaper, the robustness of the validated plans {{is dependent on the}} scenarios against which they are validated. This, in turn, depends on the experience of the planners that crafted the scenarios. This paper describes research on an alternative way of plans validation in the context of air defence done at Naval Postgraduate School as part of a postgraduate course of study. It explores the possibility of using a multi-agent system (MAS) to analyze air <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> and generated potential air strike plans that exploit weaknesses in the air <b>defence</b> <b>plan.</b> The resulting plans are fed into a low resolution Discrete Event Simulation (DES) based air defence simulator to simulate the effects of the air strike plan against the air <b>defence</b> <b>plan.</b> A prototype was developed and has demonstrated the ability to validate air <b>defence</b> <b>plans</b> using MAS-generated strike plans and a low resolution DES-based simulation successfully...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{approaches}} which aim to automatically optimize power system security schemes. In this research, power system security scheme includes two main plans. The first plan, {{which is called}} the <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> scheme, is about preventing cascading blackouts while the second plan, which is called the restoration plan, is about rebuilding the power system in case of failure of the first <b>plan.</b> Practically, the <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> includes under-frequency load shedding and under-frequency islanding schemes. These two schemes are always considered the last stage of the defensive actions against any severe incident. It is recognized {{that it is not}} easy for any power system’s operational planner to obtain the minimum amount of load shedding or the best power system islanding formation. In the case of <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> failure, which is always possible, a full or partial system collapse may occur. In this situation, the power system operator is urgently required to promptly restore the system. This is not an easy task, since the operator must not violate many power system security constraints. In this research, genetic algorithms and expert systems are employed, as optimization methods, to identify the best amount of load shedding and island formation for the <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> and the shortest path to rebuild the power system for the restoration plan. In the process of designing the power system security scheme, the majority of the electromechanical power system security constraints are considered. It is well known that power system optimization problems often have a huge solution space. In this regard, many successful techniques have been used {{to reduce the size of}} the solution spaces associated with the optimization of the power system security schemes in this work. The Libyan power system is used as an industrial case study to validate the practicality of the research approaches. The results clearly show that the new methods that have been researched in this PhD work have shown great success. Using the Libyan power system, the optimized <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> has been compared to the current <b>defence</b> <b>plan.</b> The results of this comparison have shown that the optimized <b>defence</b> <b>plan</b> outperforms the current one. Regarding the optimized restoration plan, the results present the fact that the Libyan power system can be restored in reasonable time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors would}} also like to thank the iTesla TSOs (RTE, ELIA, National Grid, REN, Statnett, IPTO) for their {{collaboration}} in the survey and review of the work. In recent years the European power system has changed significantly, causing the system to be operated closer to the limits. The transition to more renewable generation is causing power injections at different locations from conventional generation. Secondly the integration of the internal electricity market is causing an increase in flows on interconnections between different areas of the European power system. Furthermore the time needed to construct new infrastructure pushes Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to better utilize the installed infrastructure. As the power system is strongly interconnected, a contingency in one area can affect the whole power system and possibly lead to a wide area black out. Therefore adequate <b>defence</b> <b>plans</b> need to be designed and in place to handle these situations. This paper starts with an overview of the terminology used in <b>defence</b> <b>plans.</b> Subsequently the current status of <b>defence</b> <b>plans</b> in Europe and the preferred sequence of actions to mitigate contingencies, is given based on a survey conducted among several European TSOs. Furthermore his paper gives an overview of how the ongoing changes with renewables, phasor measurement units (PMUs), power flow controlling devices and demand side response can affect the adequacy of <b>defence</b> <b>plans.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
