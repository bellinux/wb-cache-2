5|$|Geography {{has a large}} {{influence}} on Israel cuisine, and foods common in the Mediterranean region, such as olives, wheat, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, and vegetables such as tomatoes, <b>eggplants,</b> and zucchini are prominent in Israeli cuisine.

5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{eggplant}} salads and dips {{are made with}} roasted <b>eggplants.</b> Baba ghanoush, called salat ḥatzilim in Israel, is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, herbs and spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has a smoky taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise. Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt, or with feta cheese, chopped onion and tomato, or {{in the style of}} Romanian Jews, with roasted red pepper.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} ascorbic acid and {{phenolic}} compounds contents of <b>eggplant</b> flesh and <b>eggplant</b> peel were determined. Among the investigated <b>eggplant</b> cultivars generally <b>eggplant</b> peel had higher ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds contents than <b>eggplant</b> flesh. Ascorbic acid content in <b>eggplant</b> flesh ranged from 33. 62 to 92. 75 mg kg − 1 and in <b>eggplant</b> peel from 12. 45 to 111. 01 mg kg − 1. Phenolic compounds content ranged from 11. 77 to 22. 18 g kg − 1 in <b>eggplant</b> flesh and from 13. 46 to 29. 42 g kg − 1 in <b>eggplant</b> peel. <b>Eggplant</b> peel is usually treated as waste, i. e. byproduct, omitting its potentially beneficial characteristics. Due to higher ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds contents, further investigations {{should be directed}} on possible use of <b>eggplant</b> peel as natural ingredient for functional products formulation...|$|R

5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple <b>eggplants,</b> red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{pests and}} {{diseases}} that afflict other solanaceous plants, such as tomato, capsicum, and potato, are also troublesome to <b>eggplants.</b> For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since <b>eggplants</b> {{can be particularly}} susceptible to pests such as whiteflies, they are sometimes grown with slightly less susceptible plants, such as pepper, as a sacrificial trap crop. Four years should separate successive crops of <b>eggplants</b> to reduce pest pressure.|$|E

25|$|Even {{until the}} end of the 19th century, both Ashkenazim and Sephardim in Jerusalem stored large {{quantities}} of foodstuffs for the winter. In Sephardi households, these included rice, flour, lentils, beans, olives and cheese. Ashkenazim stored wine, spirits, olives, sesame oil and wheat. At the end of the summer, large quantities of eggs were packed in slaked lime for the winter. Most Sephardic and Ashkenazi families would also buy large quantities of grapes to make wine. Olives were also pickled and Sephardim pickled <b>eggplants</b> too.|$|E

25|$|Roman {{influence}} on the entire Mediterranean region was so considerable that to this day, the basic food {{in most of the}} region is still wheat bread, olives, olive oil, wine, cheese, and the occasional piece of meat or fish. The territories from the Atlantic to the Italian Peninsula, and especially the Catalan and Occitan-speaking areas were closely interrelated culturally and politically. The Muslim conquest of Sicily and southern Spain was highly influential on the cuisine by introducing new plants like lemons, pomegranates, <b>eggplants</b> and spices such as saffron. The coloring of food and many other cooking techniques were passed on by the Arab invaders to their European possessions and were gradually spread to regions further north.|$|E
25|$|Eggplant {{is often}} stewed, {{as in the}} French ratatouille. Eggplant is also often deep fried as in the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, the Turkish karnıyarık, or Turkish and Greek musakka/moussaka, and Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes. <b>Eggplants</b> can also be {{battered}} before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of tahini and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as kashk e bademjan, tomatoes as mirza ghassemi, or made into stew as khoresh-e-bademjan. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain yogurt (optionally topped with a tomato and garlic sauce), {{such as in the}} Turkish dish patlıcan kızartması (meaning fried aubergines), or without yogurt, as in patlıcan şakşuka. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are imam bayıldı (vegetarian) and karnıyarık (with minced meat).|$|E
25|$|The culinary {{traditions of}} Roman times lived {{on in the}} Byzantine empire. Inherited from Greek traditions {{was the use of}} olives and olive oil, wheat bread, and plenty of fish. These would very often be served or {{prepared}} with garós, the Greek term for garum, a sauce made out of fermented fish that was so popular that it more or less replaced salt as the common food flavoring. The Byzantine kitchen was also influenced by Arab cuisine from which it imported the use of <b>eggplants</b> and oranges. Seafood was very popular and included tuna, lobster, mussels, oysters, murena, and carp. Around the 11th century the habit of eating roe and caviar was also imported from the Black Sea region. Dairy products were consumed in the form of cheese (particularly feta), and nuts and fruits such as dates, figs, grapes, pomegranates, and apples. The choice of meats were lamb, and several wild animals like gazelles, wild asses, and suckling young in general. Meat was often salted, smoked or dried. Wine was popular, like elsewhere around the Mediterranean, and it was the drink of choice among the higher social classes, where sweet wines like Muscat or Madeira/Malmsey were popular. Among the lower classes, the common drink tended to be vinegar mixed with water. Like all Christian societies the Byzantines had to abide by the dietary restrictions of the church, which meant avoiding meats (and preferably general excesses) on Wednesdays and Fridays and during fast and Lent.|$|E
