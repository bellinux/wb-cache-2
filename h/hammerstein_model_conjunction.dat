The most commonly used model for isometric muscle has had a Hammerstein structure, in which a linear dynamic block is preceded by a static nonlinear function, To investigate {{the accuracy of the}} <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model,</b> the responses to a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) excitation of normal human plantarflexors, stimulated with surface electrodes, were used to identify a <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> but also four local models which describe the responses to small signals at different mean levels of activation. Comparison of the local models with the Linearized <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> showed that the <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> concealed a fivefold variation in the speed of response. Also, the small-signal gain of the <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> was in error by factors up to three. We conclude that, despite the past widespread use of the <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model,</b> it is not an accurate representation of isometric muscle. On the other hand, local models, which are more accurate predictors, can be identified from the responses to short PRBS sequences.

In {{order to}} measure {{accurately}} {{air fuel ratio}} in the engine exhaust gas, the <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model</b> of the exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) sensor was identified using the multivariable output error state space (MOESP) algorithm. Firstly, a static model of the EGO sensor was identified based on engine experiment data as a static nonlinear part of the <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model.</b> Then, the MOESP algorithm was used to build a state space model (SSM) of dynamic linear part of the <b>Hammerstein</b> <b>model.</b> To estimate model order, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion were computed, and validity of structure identification was verified by residual analysis. Then, the auto-regressive model with exogenous input (ARX) was compared with a subspace model.
