5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> It follows that {{if we have a}} perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Italian crested newt introduced {{in the range of}} the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

500|$|Beck drew {{attention}} to the importance of [...] "negative cognitions" [...] described as sustained, inaccurate, and often intrusive negative thoughts about the self.

5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} against this interpretation as the chronicler Jean de Wavrin, contemporary {{of the battle}} of Agincourt, reports that the captured archers would have three fingers cut, and not two.

25|$|If {{unsaturated}} esters are copolymerized with ethylene, {{either the}} alcohol moiety {{may be in}} the polymer backbone (as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) or of the acid moiety (e. g. in ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer). Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are prepared similarly to LD-PE by high pressure polymerization. The proportion of comonomer has a decisive influence on the behaviour of the polymer.|$|E

25|$|While {{any state}} may {{dissolve}} its assembly {{independently of the}} Federal Parliament, the traditional practice is for most state assemblies to be dissolved {{at the same time}} as Parliament, with the exception of Sabah and Sarawak, although these two states had held elections simultaneously with the rest of the country, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for Sabah in the 2004, 2008 and 2013 elections, and Sarawak in the 1969 and 1974 elections.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, modern Brazilian Portuguese {{was highly}} {{influenced}} by other languages introduced by immigrants through the past century, specifically by German, Italian and Japanese immigrants. This high intake of immigrants not only caused the incorporation and/or adaptation of many words and expressions from {{their native language}} into local language but also created specific dialects as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of German's Hunsrückisch dialect in the South of Brazil. This {{is also one of}} the main reasons why Brazilian Portuguese sounds so different from other Portuguese derivatives.|$|E
25|$|A {{tuning fork}} {{can be held}} {{near the mouth of}} a long pipe which is dipping into a barrel of water.

As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.|$|E
30|$|Yet in some cases, {{collective}} culture also promoted innovation. To {{explore the}} effect of collectivism further, they classified it into two types – nationalism (patriotism) and familism (localism). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of countries with collective culture featuring more nationalism or patriotism that showed a positive impact of collectivism on innovation.|$|R

25|$|Residues {{from the}} oil and gas {{industry}} often contain radium and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that the water inside an oil field is often very rich in strontium, barium and radium while seawater is very rich in sulfate so if water from an oil well is discharged into the sea or mixed with seawater the radium is likely to be brought out of solution by the barium/strontium sulfate which acts as a carrier precipitate.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{algebraic}} {{operations for}} real interval numbers (real closed intervals) {{can be extended}} to complex numbers. It is therefore not surprising that complex interval arithmetic is similar to, but not the same as, ordinary complex arithmetic. It can be shown that, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with real interval arithmetic, there is no distributivity between addition and multiplication of complex interval numbers except for certain special cases, and inverse elements do not always exist for complex interval numbers. Two other useful properties of ordinary complex arithmetic fail to hold in complex interval arithmetic: the additive and multiplicative properties, of ordinary complex conjugates, do not hold for complex interval conjugates.|$|E

50|$|During {{the period}} of the Japanese {{occupation}} (1931) and the Manchukuo (1932-1945) the Japanese conducted scholarly research on the local folk religion and established Shinto shrines, although without trying to impose Shinto on the native populations as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in occupied Korea and occupied Taiwan, as <b>the</b> Manchurian State <b>was</b> conceived as a spiritually autonomous nation.|$|R
25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri {{seems to}} have survived in local refugia the {{reduction}} of the favourable steppe-like habitat due to climatic extremes during the pleniglacial and interstadial periods, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> today. Pfenninger & Bahl (1997) suggested that snail species with restricted dispersal might survive in habitats of a size in the magnitude of few square meters. There is increasing evidence that such small spots with a favourable microclimate existed in the periglacial area of central Europe and were presumed to have provided refuges for comparatively cold resistant snail species. Southern and eastern European refugia were also supplemented by cryptic sanctuaries in northern Europe during the late Pleistocene in shaping present day species composition.|$|E
25|$|An {{interval}} {{can also}} {{be defined as a}} locus of points at a given distance from the centre, and this definition can be extended from real numbers to complex numbers. As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with computing with real numbers, computing with complex numbers involves uncertain data. So, given the fact that an interval number is a real closed interval and a complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers, {{there is no reason to}} limit the application of interval arithmetic to the measure of uncertainties in computations with real numbers. Interval arithmetic can thus be extended, via complex interval numbers, to determine regions of uncertainty in computing with complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, inside a population, the {{presence}} of many different alleles ensures {{there will always be}} an individual with a specific MHC molecule able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe. The evolution of the MHC polymorphism ensures that a population will not succumb to a new pathogen or a mutated one, because at least some individuals will be able to develop an adequate immune response to win over the pathogen. The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by recombination, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the antigen receptors.|$|E
