5|$|This is {{the period}} from the late 7th century (for most of Somerset) to 1066, though <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10th and 11th centuries England was under Danish control.

5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Air Commodore Peter Frank Raw, DSO, DFC, AFC (5 June 1922– 14 July 1988) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{pilot and}} officer. He joined the RAAF in 1941, {{and served as}} a flight instructor, bomber pilot and the {{commander}} of a communications unit during World War II. After the war he became a specialist navigator. Raw was appointed the commander of No. 2 Squadron in January 1953, but temporarily left this position <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year to participate in the 1953 London to Christchurch air race, in which he placed second.

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several Caribbean islands, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas, preparations there, if any, were unclear. Residents across Puerto Rico boarded up windows and secured roofs {{in anticipation of}} damaging winds. Governor Robert Hayes Gore placed the Hurricane Relief Organization and Red Cross on standby. As the storm neared Florida, the United States Weather Bureau—later the National Weather Service—posted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville. These were later extended to include {{the west coast of}} the state from Punta Rassa to Tarpon Springs. At the time, forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status; this unawareness extended to the storm's passage over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters only issued storm warnings <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texas coast, including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was {{minimally}} educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|Decommissioned in 1854, {{the castle}} was first leased, and later bought outright, by the Royal Yacht Squadron {{to form their}} new clubhouse. The Squadron then {{employed}} the architect Anthony Salvin to rebuild large parts of it between 1856 and 1858. It became the headquarters <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D-Day invasion force during the Second World War, but has otherwise remained in use by the Squadron and is a distinctive landmark in yacht races along the Isle of Wight.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to the international scene in the 2002 FIFA World Cup under Giovanni Trapattoni, after winning the Scudetto with Juventus. Del Piero scored the decisive goal against Hungary, which sealed Italy's qualification for the finals. Del Piero appeared as a substitute in Italy's opening win against Ecuador, wearing the captain's armband <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. He instantly scored with a header against Mexico, after coming on as a substitute, an equalising goal which saved Italy from the ignominy of a first round exit in their final group match. The goal sent Italy through to the second round, where they were eliminated by a golden goal in a controversial match against co-hosts South Korea, a match during which Del Piero started alongside Totti and Vieri.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, three kakapo {{were moved}} from Resolution Island {{to the nature}} reserve of Little Barrier Island {{north-east}} of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three kakapo were moved to another reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, {{despite the presence of}} feral cats <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervening period.|$|E
5|$|In McPherson's sector, Logan's {{division}} {{made another}} thrust down the Jackson Road at about 2 p.m., but met with heavy losses and {{the attack was}} called off. McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby's division, but with no success. Union casualties were 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about evenly divided across the three corps. Confederate casualties were not reported directly, but {{are estimated to be}} under 500. Grant blamed McClernand's misleading dispatches <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Hawaii on 22 July, {{the ships}} next stopped at Auckland, Sydney, and Melbourne. High seas and winds {{hampered}} the ships <b>for</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voyage to New Zealand, but they arrived on 9 August; festivities, parades, balls, and games were staples of the visits to each city.

Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E
