25|$|Booted Bantams in the UK are catered {{for by the}} Booted Bantam Society UK. The breed has 11 colours {{accepted}} by the Poultry Club of Great Britain. These are black, black mottled, blue, buff mottled, cuckoo, lavender, lemon millefleur, millefleur, porcelain, silver millefleur, white. The black and white Booted Bantams were created in the UK and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> over 100 years. In recent years more colours have been imported into the UK from mainland Europe and the most popular colour by far is the Lemon Millefleur Booted Bantam. Although not shown in large numbers at present they are a very popular pet and are becoming more common in people's back gardens. They are a breed that can be susceptible {{to a form of}} Mareks Disease although this can be bred out within a few years.|$|E
500|$|Senior Resident Magistrate Glenn Brown {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the public prosecutors for taking too long to prepare cases, often because of difficulty in finding and bringing witnesses. [...] Brown noted that [...] "Seventy per cent of the persons who are before the courts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> an inordinately {{long period of time}} - three to four years." ...|$|E
500|$|An indignant Mulder sneaks {{onto the}} base {{with help from}} Emil and Zoe. He sees a {{triangular}} craft fly overhead and then is captured by soldiers who tamper with his memory. Meanwhile, Scully reencounters Mossinger, whom she discovers is actually a security operative for the base. At gunpoint, she forces him to guide her to the base and exchanges him for Mulder. Having been denied {{the truth about the}} base, Mulder and Scully return to Washington. Days later, Mulder encounters Deep Throat while jogging at a local track. Mulder asks if [...] "they" [...] really are present on Earth; Deep Throat responds that [...] "they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a long, long time".|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{half an hour}} at least," [...] thought Father Brown. In fact, he had the air {{of sitting}} where he had sat when his dinner was cleared away.|$|R
60|$|Nat Hicks was {{socially}} acceptable; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> years, {{and owned}} his shop; but {{this person was}} merely Nat's workman, and the town's principle of perfect democracy {{was not meant to}} be applied indiscriminately.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Graham {{looked at}} him dubiously, but pursued with ardour: [...] "Why, just getting back to Florence, after not <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> so long--I should {{think it would be}} so romantic. Oh dear! I wish I <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the second time." ...|$|R
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, Hunt {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Broncos for an additional two years, with the intention of staying at the club {{for the rest of his}} career. On re-signing, Hunt stated, [...] "I look around and see guys like Webbie and Locky who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> their entire careers, and it's something I would like to do. If I can, I want to be a one-club player too. Playing footy is not just about 80 minutes out on the field every week. For me it is a career and I want to be happy where I am, satisfied that my game is progressing and that I am learning all the time to be a better player." ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, not of need," [...] {{said the}} sister. [...] "Many a maiden who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a time <b>has</b> gone {{out into the}} world, but some love this home the best, as I have done." ...|$|R

50|$|Basti was {{originally}} known as town. The {{origin of the}} name Vaishishthi is attributed {{to the fact that}} this area was the Ashram of Rishi (sage) Vashistha in ancient period.

5000|$|... "If an {{immigrant}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{a long time}} and there is no realistic prospect of returning them, then I do think that person's condition should be regularised so that they can pay taxes and join the rest of society," [...] Boris Johnson told the 2,500-strong assembly.|$|R
6000|$|... "But who, indeed, {{can answer}} that question?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Twice he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> flying visits. Once Alice <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{to see him in}} Berlin. He is, I believe, a very wealthy {{manufacturer}} there. He crosses often to England. He has money, and he is always gay." ...|$|R
