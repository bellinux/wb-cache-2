The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion.

The consequences and interpretations of these results have been extensively discussed by Mazia (1959, 1961).

This research worked with what are ultimately the second and third cohorts of settlement-reared community members who have limited experience with traditional subsistence beyond organized youth camps and occasional hunting trips, but comparatively more experience with southern media, formal education and training for wage labour employment. This research involved community youth as researchers to examine the vulnerability of youth in Ulukhaktok between the ages 8 and 24 years to changing conditions (e. g. who is vulnerable, to what conditions, how, and what is aiding or constraining the ability to adapt?) The research sample consisted of fifty-two youth with equal gender representation.

30|$|Mammalian cells {{including}} CHO cells consume {{large quantities}} of glucose and glutamine in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, while releasing waste products lactate and ammonia. It is reported that asparagine and glutamine are significant nitrogen and energy sources. Additionally, glutamine is known as an anaplerotic metabolic <b>fueling</b> biosynthesis <b>substance</b> (Xing et al. 2011), and asparagine {{is essential for the}} synthesis of glycine, cysteine, proteins, nucleotides, and lipids in cell proliferation. Glutamine and asparagine are the two most consumed amino acids in mammalian cell culture. To achieve high-specific growth rate, cell density, and productivity, the culture should be fed with high levels of glutamine or asparagine (Wlaschin and Hu 2006; Jain and Kumar 2008; Lu et al. 2013; Sengupta et al. 2011). Specifically, glutamine and asparagine are mutually related to each other not only in transportation but also in metabolism (Wipf et al. 2002; Huang et al. 2007; Kobayashi et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2014). Glutamine and asparagine could turn into glutamate and aspartate through deamination. And glutamate can carry on deamination to form α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In addition, aspartate used α-ketoglutarate to form oxaloacetate and glutamate through transamination. Oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate could enter TCA cycle to be further metabolized. Our study found that asparagine was important in the antibody production phase. Usually the concentration of asparagine was only half of glutamine concentration in feed media. Although asparagine and glutamine are key amino acids for cell growth and mAb productivity, but there were always more glutamine than asparagine in feed media. Therefore, how to correctly supply asparagine and glutamine in feed media to achieve high mAb production becomes a critical issue.|$|R

50|$|As long as exergy {{stands for}} the useful energy {{required}} for an economic activity to be accomplished, {{it is reasonable to}} evaluate the cost of the energy {{on the basis of its}} exergy content. Besides, as exergy can be considered as measure of the departure of the environmental conditions, it also serves as an indicator of environmental impact, taking into account both the efficiency of supply chain (from primary exergy inputs) and the efficiency of the production processes. In this way, exergoeconomy can be used to rationally distribute the exergy costs and CO2 emission cost among the products and by-products of a highly integrated Brazilian electricity mix. Based on the thermoeconomy methodologies, some authors have shown that exergoeconomy provides an opportunity to quantify the renewable and non-renewable specific exergy consumption; to properly allocate the associated CO2 emissions among the streams of a given production route; as well as to determine the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the production processes. Accordingly, the non-renewable unit exergy cost (cNR) kJ/kJ is defined as the rate of non-renewable exergy necessary to produce one unit of exergy rate/flow rate of a <b>substance,</b> <b>fuel,</b> electricity, work or heat flow, whereas the Total Unit Exergy Cost (cT) includes the Renewable (cR) and Non-Renewable Unit Exergy Costs.
