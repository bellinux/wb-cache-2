50|$|At {{the same}} time, the Commission was not {{unanimous}} in its conclusions or recommendations, and heated debates about <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings</b> and recommended actions were inherent {{part of its}} work. In particular, disagreements about where health research should be conducted: should it be in more capable research environments in high income countries where research {{can be done to}} higher standards and possibly lead to quicker results and more rapid development of technical interventions or should it be done in low and middle income countries where capacity for research still needed to be built in many instances? In the latter case, the outcome of research studies was not only a research product but also increased research capacity. This same debate continues to this date in virtually the entire field of global health.|$|E

50|$|Emulation {{has been}} {{researched}} in a diverse range of species, including humans. The methodology most often applied is the so-called ghost-condition - put forward by Cecilia Heyes and colleagues in 1994. Ghost condition demonstrations do not involve any information on body movements. Instead, {{the parts of the}} apparatus move as if a ghost moves them (for this purpose often very thin fishing line is attached to the moving parts and which transmits the necessary forces). While the use of this method (and subsequently the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings)</b> has been criticized on the basis of it lacking ecological validity (it is a strange thing for non-animate objects to move on their own accord), it succeeded in showing that environmental information can be enough for observational learning to occur (work on pigeons). Thus, the general validity of the ghost condition is now established. Chimpanzees tested with this methodology have sometimes failed to copy, but copied in another study - as did dogs.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the quality of reports of knee MRI examinations in form, content, and diagnosis and to assess the effect of three different quality improvement measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reports of 500 knee MRI examinations (first round, or baseline) were reviewed retrospectively by five musculoskeletal radiologists. Fifteen different criteria were assessed for formal and content-related quality of reports. Diagnostic discrepancies were categorized using a 5 -point scale, as follows: I, no deviation; II, undetected finding, clinically irrelevant; III, wrong <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding,</b> clinically irrelevant; IV, undetected finding, clinically relevant; and V, wrong <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding,</b> clinically relevant. Then three different quality improvement measures were applied prospectively to a total of 510 consecutive reports: a quiet work environment, double reading, and the use of a structured report template. These 510 knee MRI reports (second round) were evaluated using the same criteria. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in 13 of 15 criteria was found in the second-round reports: orthographic errors improved from 32. 4...|$|R

The second study considered the role of epistemic beliefs and thinking dispositions on less and more advanced college students’ <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> research <b>findings.</b> Results from both studies indicated that some people tended to focus more on the evaluation of evidence presented to them while others accepted the evidence at face value and focused on explanation, attempting to “make sense” <b>of</b> the research <b>findings</b> in terms <b>of</b> what they already knew (prior theories and beliefs). Educational experience was related to people’s <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the research <b>findings.</b> More advanced students tended to describe and critically evaluate data while less advanced students explained the data without considering their quality. Additionally, there were differences in the way students with different majors/areas of study interpreted research findings, with history and engineering students providing more evaluations <b>of</b> the <b>findings</b> than psychology students. Finally, correlational and regression analyses indicated that statistical/methodological training, general intelligence and sophisticated thinking dispositions were correlated with people’s tendency to evaluate research findings...|$|R

Finally, we illustrate how conducting mixed methods analyses {{can be used}} to enhance the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> significant <b>findings</b> in both quantitative and qualitative educational evaluation and policy research.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Right {{ventricular}} (RV) {{function is}} an independent determinant of prognosis {{in a number of}} pathologies, but its accurate quantification by echocardiography remains a challenge. With the evolving clinical utility of RV strain and strain imaging, several studies have used it to investigate normal and pathologic conditions. However, marked shape adaptations of the RV and the wide range of possible loading conditions complicate the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings,</b> which will be highlighted in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: RV strain and strain rate measurements have been proven feasible and found to offer potential advantages over traditional indices. They allow regional function estimation with less influence from the left ventricle (LV) or overall cardiac motion. However, there are contradictions in recent studies regarding expected values and regional patterns, which may be attributed to differences in imaging techniques but also to the challenging <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>findings.</b> SUMMARY: Strain and strain rate have a great potential for a more accurate description of RV function and a better understanding of its pathology. The imaging techniques are ready for translation into the clinical arena, but their greatest utility will only be realized once diagnostic values are more clearly defined. status: publishe...|$|E
