The steaming of zeolite H-Y was performed under water vapor pressures of 3. 4 - 81. 5 kPa and at a temperature of 748 K. To exclude an additional modification of the <b>dealuminated</b> zeolites Y, the samples were investigated in the nonhydrated state, i. e., without hydration after the dealumination. By 29 Si magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, a strong high-field shift of the signals of Si(3 Al) and Si(2 Al) sites in the spectra of nonhydrated zeolites Y in comparison {{with those of the}} hydrated samples was observed. This finding is explained by a change of the Si-O-T bond angles of Si(nAl) sites in the local structure of nonhydrated framework AlO 4 tetrahedra. With increasing water vapor pressure during the dealumination, a systematic decrease of the total amounts of framework aluminum atoms in nonhydrated zeolites Y was found by 27 Al spin-echo NMR and 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopies. The amounts of disturbed framework aluminum atoms, probably 3 -fold-coordinated species in nonhydrated zeolites Y, were determined by the increase of the concentrations of bridging OH groups after an ammonia adsorption/desorption treatment and by application of 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. By a quantitative comparison of the amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms, responsible for the occurrence of negative framework charges, and the amounts of charge-compensating residual sodium cations and bridging hydroxyl protons, the mean cationic charge of extraframework aluminum atoms was estimated.

In a sequence of thermochemical treatments, the former steps are suggested to influence the latter. Qualitative analysis has proven the dependence existing between the composition and the counteraction involved, on the one hand, and the electronic properties of the constituting elements, on the other hand. No linear increase of the BEs was, observed along our modification pathway. Extraframework species, which {{are supposed to be}} mainly cationic, are responsible for the superficial enrichment of modified zeolites. This enrichment does not always occur during steaming treatments, but also during acid-leaching ones...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe water {{adsorption}} {{properties of}} modified porous sorbents for {{solar thermal energy}} storage and heat transformation have been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) differential thermogravimetry (DTG), microcalorimetry, measurements of water adsorption isotherms, and storage tests. A chabazite type SAPO, a <b>dealuminated</b> faujasite type zeolite, and a mesostructured aluminosilicate, have been synthesized and compared with common zeolites X, Y and silica gel. It {{has been found that}} optimized lattice composition and pore architecture contribute to well adapt hydrophilic properties and a beneficial steep isotherm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} low {{temperature}} synthesis of β-C 2 S from mixture of lime, BaCl 2 and sili-ceous raw material (white sand, metakaolin and <b>dealuminated</b> kaolin) with the ratio (Ca + Ba) /Si = 2. The Mixtures were hydrothermally treated in stainless steel capsule at 180 ˚C for 5 hours and calcined at 750 ˚C for 3 hours. Raw materials, hydrothermally treated and calcined mixtures {{were analyzed by}} FTIR, XRD, TGA/DTA and SEM techniques. The reactivity siliceous raw materials to-wards lime under hydrothermal treatment increase in the following order: sand, metakaolin, dea-luminated kaolin. Because sand composes of quartz crystals, metakaolin composes of amorphous metakaolin structure while <b>dealuminated</b> kaolin composes from enriched amorphous silicate. Calcium aluminate and aluminosilicate hydrate were observed in case of metakaolin which con-tains appreciable amount of Al 2 O 3. Dicalcium silicate crystallizes into β-C 2 S in the temperature range 590 ˚C- 760 ˚C. Finally, β-C 2 S transforms to α’-C 2 S in the temperature range 790 ˚C- 860 ˚C. There is no sign {{for the formation of}} γ-C 2 S. This proves that Ba 2 + ions stabilized β-C 2 S and retards its transformation to γ-C 2 S because Ba 2 + ions replace some of calcium atoms in the structure o...|$|E
