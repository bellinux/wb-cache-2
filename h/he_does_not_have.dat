5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|Frohman, {{accompanied}} by several bugbait-controlled Antlions, eventually reaches Nova Prospekt, {{only to be}} turned away as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an appointment.

He is then drafted into the resistance after failing to disrupt its operations, and unintentionally signals {{the start of the}} resistance's uprising after one of his Antlions accidentally kills a Combine police officer. During the fighting, he accompanies Freeman himself and mingles with resistance members, aids the Combine in the capture of Alyx Vance, one of Freeman's allies, and reunites with Norman Frohman, his long-lost assassin twin brother, only to promptly witness his death {{at the hands of a}} Strider, a large tripodal assault synth.|$|E

5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E

In The King of Fighters XI, Kyo and Iori once again form a team with Shingo filling Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. However, the growing presence of the Orochi causes Iori to go berserk, forcing him to harm his teammates. Ash then appears and steals Iori's abilities after defeating him. In King of Fighters XII, Kyo is a playable character, but like each of them, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a team. Kyo reunites with the original members of the Esaka Team in The King of Fighters XIII. Additionally, an alternative version of himself, with different moves called NESTS Style Kyo, is available as downloadable content.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle between life and death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E

As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sub-Commander T'Pol – who {{has been}} invited to accept a Starfleet {{commission}} – takes the opportunity to travel to Vulcan to visit her mother, T'Les. When Commander Tucker mentions that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a home to go to, T'Pol invites him along. On Vulcan, after a tense homecoming, she learns that her mother has resigned from the Vulcan Science Academy as indirect punishment for T'Pol's actions at the P'Jem sanctuary. One logical way for T'Pol to restore her mother's position is to honor her engagement to Koss, {{a member of an}} influential family. Despite Tucker's feelings, who admits to T'Les' observation that he is in love with T'Pol, she consents to marry Koss. Just before the ceremony begins, however, T'Pol quickly kisses Tucker on the cheek.|$|E

Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
