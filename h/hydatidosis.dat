40|$|Abstract Background <b>Hydatidosis</b> is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} Echinococcus granulosus, and ingesting eggs released through the faeces from infected dogs infects humans. The {{location of the}} hydatid cysts is mostly hepatic and/or pulmonary, whereas musculoskeletal <b>hydatidosis</b> is very rare. Case presentation We report an unusual case of primary muscular <b>hydatidosis</b> in proximity of the big adductor in a young Sicilian man. The patient, 34 years old, {{was admitted to the}} Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases for ultrasonographic detection, with successive confirmation by magnetic resonance imaging, of an ovular mass (13 × 8 cm) in the big adductor of the left thigh, cyst-like, and containing several small cystic formations. Serological tests for <b>hydatidosis</b> gave negative results. A second drawing of blood was done 10 days after the first one and showed an increase in the antibody titer for <b>hydatidosis.</b> The patient was submitted to surgical excision of the lesion with perioperatory prophylaxis with albendazole. The histopathological examination of the bioptic material was not diriment in the diagnosis, therefore further tests were performed: additional serological tests for <b>hydatidosis</b> for the evaluation of IgE and IgG serotype (Western Blot and REAST), and molecular analysis of the excised material. These more specific serological tests gave positive results for <b>hydatidosis,</b> and the sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products from the cyst evidenced E. granulosus DNA, genotype G 1. Any post-surgery complications was observed during 6 following months. Conclusion Cystic <b>hydatidosis</b> should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of any cystic mass, regardless of its location, also in epidemiological contests less suggestive of the disease. The diagnosis should be achieved by taking into consideration the clinical aspects, the epidemiology of the disease, the imaging and immunological tests but, as demonstrated in this case, without neglecting the numerous possibilities offered by new serological devices and modern day molecular biology techniques. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman cystic {{echinococcosis}} (<b>hydatidosis)</b> is a parasitic zoonosis {{with almost}} complete worldwide distribution. Echinococcus granulosus, the dog tapeworm, causes <b>hydatidosis</b> {{which accounts for}} 95 % of human echinococcosis. Although this tapeworm is found in dogs as a definitive host {{and a number of}} intermediate hosts, humans are often infected from close contact with infected dogs. Humans {{are not part of the}} parasitic lifecycle and serve as accidental hosts. <b>Hydatidosis</b> is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of hepatic cysts in individuals from endemic areas. Clinicians should be aware of the long incubation period, the high frequency of negative serological tests, and the possibility of intraoperative evaluations of the cyst aspirate being non-diagnostic. We describe a case of serology negative <b>hydatidosis</b> that came to medical attention as an incidental finding in a young woman from Bangladesh. The patient underwent imaging and was then started on albendazole. After several weeks of albendazole, the cyst was punctured, aspirated, injected with hypertonic saline, re-aspirated, and then fully excised. Diagnosis was confirmed by microscopic evaluation of the cyst aspirate. Serological tests for <b>hydatidosis</b> may be negative in patients with early disease and thus should not be used to rule out this disease. Consideration of this diagnosis allows clinicians to avoid the catastrophic spillage of cystic contents risking an anaphylactic reaction, which might prove fatal.

Five restriction enzymes, MvaI, HaeIII, SacI, SacII, Hin 1 I, were used, yielding 14 alleles and 31 restriction patterns.

Nevertheless, 75 % of the farmers demonstrated interest in receiving information, mainly from a veterinarian. A wide diversity of potentially zoonotic parasites (Trichuris spp., Ancylostomatidae, Toxocara spp., Taeniidae) was found in 61 % of the dogs. This survey revealed farmers' lack of knowledge in relation to <b>hydatidosis</b> and a high prevalence of potentially zoonotic parasites in dogs, thus pointing to the need for health education and a closer collaboration between veterinarian and public health professionals.
