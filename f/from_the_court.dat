Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they had requested <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E

5|$|The {{mention of}} those princes who were {{publicly}} {{supposed to be}} Christians, as we find it in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. l. vii c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his family; and forms a contemporary evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who lived at an humble distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> of Rome, expresses himself with becoming diffidence concerning {{the truth of the}} fact.|$|E
5|$|The militants {{responsible}} for the murders were tried and executed in Damascus by Djemal Pasha in September 1915; the incident later {{became the subject of}} a 1916 investigation by the Ottoman Parliament led by Artin Boshgezenian, the deputy for Aleppo.

He has also been known to maintain several mistresses throughout his life, including during his married period.|$|E
5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain.

Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court.</b> If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> of Appeal {{is solely}} an appellate <b>court,</b> hearing appeals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Courts.</b> <b>The</b> Constitutional <b>Court</b> is {{primarily}} an appellate court, hearing appeals on constitutional matters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> of Appeal {{or in some}} cases directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Courts.</b> <b>The</b> Constitutional <b>Court</b> also occasionally acts as a court of first instance in certain cases involving the constitutionality of laws and government actions.|$|R

Of the Ngô brothers, only Thục and Luyện avoided being executed or assassinated during Vietnam's political upheavals.|$|E

The military appeal court hearing on 28 September took a few minutes before the court upheld all the convictions. In November, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry asked for a retrial in civilian courts, because they were convicted in military courts.|$|E
