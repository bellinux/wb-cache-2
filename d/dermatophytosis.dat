25|$|Topical {{steroids and}} {{antibiotic}} ointments such as Neosporin {{have not only}} shown to be ineffective in treating <b>dermatophytosis</b> caused by Aphanoascus fulvescens, but have {{also been shown to}} enhance its fungal growth. Ringworm infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains tolnaftate as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains griseofulvin as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with griseofulvin has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased griseofulvin administration, there is some residual scarring of the infected area. Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment that is completely effective against human <b>dermatophytosis</b> caused by A.fulvescens.|$|E
25|$|Keratinophilic fungal {{species that}} {{fall under the}} genus Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, or Microsporum, are {{pathogenic}} to humans and other animals, and {{are referred to as}} dermatophytes {{on the basis of their}} ability to cause <b>dermatophytosis</b> in these hosts. However, infections in these hosts caused by soil-derived keratinophilic saprotrophs like A.fulvescens are very seldom and only a few cases have been documented in the literature. The first documented case of A.fulvescens causing tinea corporis was in 1970 when the fungus was repeatedly isolated from a 4 x 5cm red patch on the inner right thigh of a 21-year-old white male. This case showcases the clinical importance of non-dermatophyte keratinophilic fungi such as A.fulvescens as a result of the ability to cause <b>dermatophytosis</b> in the form of tinea corporis in humans. While visually, the case of tinea corporis was indistinguishable from those caused by true dermatophytes, the infection did not respond well to typical treatment. This observation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment of the skin lesion and highlights the necessity of awareness for atypical opportunistic human pathogenic fungi.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} in dogs is ringworm, or <b>dermatophytosis,</b> an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. [...] There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. [...] About 70 percent of infections are caused by Microsporum canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. [...] Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. [...] Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the cliinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or clotrimazole. [...] Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or itraconazole. [...] Infection can spread to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Aphanoascus fulvescens is {{commonly}} found in the soil and in dung, living as a keratinophilic saprotroph. It is also often isolated from keratin-rich tissues such as hair and nails that have been discarded from the host. [...] A.fulvescens is a geophilic fungus and therefore does not normally infect mammals. The organism is more commonly isolated from soil that has been inhabited frequently by animals than soil that has not. However, while this fungus is not a true dermatophyte, it is opportunistic and has been seen to cause <b>dermatophytosis</b> in humans and other mammals on occasion. A.fulvescens has a worldwide distribution, however it is more frequently isolated in temperate climates. This is because the organism has optimal growth at 28 °C at which it grows 3–4mm per day and up to 25mm per week. At elevated temperatures, {{such as that of}} the human body (37 °C), A.fulvescens shows restricted growth, averaging only 5–6mm of growth over the course of seven days. This may be a possible explanation as to why infections involving A.fulvescens are uncommon in humans and other mammals.|$|E
5000|$|Ferret adrenal {{disease is}} {{extremely}} common {{and is the}} most common cause of alopecia in ferrets, typically affecting middle-aged specimens between three and seven years old. Bacterial pyoderma, <b>dermatophytosis,</b> and parasites can also cause the condition. [...] In rabbits, <b>dermatophytosis</b> is a prime cause of alopecia in young, newly weaned specimens. <b>Dermatophytosis</b> as a cause of alopecia is common in cats, too, and in long-haired varieties, dermatophytic pseudomycetomas may be to blame. Alopecia areata has been studied on mice in laboratories. In horses, human contact with the horse and the rubbing of the saddle across the mane can cause patches of hair loss.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} infectious skin diseases of cats is ringworm or <b>dermatophytosis.</b> Other cat skin infections include parasitic diseases like mange and lice infestation.|$|E
50|$|Clinical <b>dermatophytosis</b> is also {{diagnosed}} in sheep, dogs, cats, and horses. Causative agents, besides Trichophyton verrucosum, are T. mentagrophytes, T. equinum, Microsporum gypseum, M. canis, and M. nanum.|$|E
50|$|The {{anthropophilic}} varieties cause {{forms of}} <b>dermatophytosis,</b> that is, fungal {{infection of the}} skin. They are keratinophilic: they feed on the keratin in nails, hair, and dead skin.|$|E

50|$|Hedgehogs uncommonly {{transmit}} {{a characteristic}} fungal skin infection to human handlers {{as well as}} other hedgehogs. This ringworm or <b>dermatophytosis</b> infection is caused by Trichophyton erinacei, which forms a distinct mating group within the Arthroderma benhamiae species complex.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} equated with <b>dermatophytosis,</b> and, while most conditions identified as [...] "tinea" [...] {{are members of}} the imperfect fungi that make up the dermatophytes, conditions such as tinea nigra and tinea versicolor are not caused by dermatophytes.|$|E
50|$|In rare cases, immunocompromised {{individuals}} form severe dissemination on the skin, {{instead of}} small localized lesions {{as a result}} of handling infected animals. Only one case of extensive <b>dermatophytosis</b> was reported involving M. gallinae infection of a person with AIDS.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dermatophytosis,</b> {{also known}} as ringworm, is a fungal {{infection}} of the skin. Typically it results in a red, itchy, scaly, circular rash. Hair loss may occur in the area affected.

It is also associated with Asthma, atopic dermatitis and Diabetes.|$|E
50|$|Fungi {{thrive in}} moist, warm areas, such as locker rooms, tanning beds, {{swimming}} pools, and skin folds; accordingly, those that cause <b>dermatophytosis</b> may be spread by using exercise machines {{that have not}} been disinfected after use, or by sharing towels, clothing, or footwear, such as rental bowling shoes, ski boots, ice skates or roller skates.|$|E
50|$|Microsporum gallinae is {{a fungus}} {{of the genus}} Microsporum that causes <b>dermatophytosis,</b> {{commonly}} known as ringworm. Chickens represent the host population of Microsporum gallinae but its opportunistic nature allows it to enter other populations of fowl, mice, squirrels, cats, dogs and monkeys. Human cases of M. gallinae are rare, and usually mild, non-life-threatening superficial infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dermatophytosis</b> {{has been}} {{prevalent}} since before 1906, {{at which time}} ringworm was treated with compounds of mercury or sometimes sulfur or iodine.
