[...] According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription [...] "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon {{the recipient of the}} charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears [...] "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{is officially}} {{considered}} as the founding father of now famous Barça-Ajax school of football (also known as 'Barçajax school'), with a distinctive footballing philosophy and predominant style of play, that {{was born in}} Barcelona but has roots in the 1970s Dutch (Amsterdam) school of Total Football. La Masia, Barça's youth academy and talent factory, was among Cruyff's lasting legacy. It {{was the brainchild of}} Cruyff. In 1979, he wanted to establish a copy of the Ajax Youth Academy in Barcelona. His proposal was accepted by president Josep Núñez. It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. On 11 July 2010, Spain won the World Cup final with eight players from Barcelona; seven were from La Masia, and six of them were in the starting line-up: Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, Sergio Busquets, and Pedro. This set a record for the most players to be provided by a club side for a team in a World Cup final. On 10 January 2011, La Masia achieved a record breaking honour becoming the first youth academy to have trained all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in a single year, with Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi. On 25 November 2012, {{for the first time in}} the club's history, away at Levante's Estadi Ciutat de València, Barcelona played with eleven players formed at La Masia. In an English biography of Pep Guardiola, Guillem Balagué writes, [...] "Cruyff introduced some passing drills into Barça's 'arterial' system. And since then, the rondos have been not just a method but a symbol of the club's playing style: of dominating and never losing the ball. Cruyff blended several ideas and concepts and converted them into a philosophy – the seeds of which were planted throughout a club in urgent need of a footballing identity. Until then, the first team of Barcelona had been comfortably living in a world of excuses and enemies, content with their role as victims when faced with Real Madrid, an institution seen from Catalonia as the club of the Establishment," [...] and adding, “Xavi Hernández describes the style in its purest form: 'I pass the ball and move, or I pass the ball and stay where I am. I make myself available to help you; <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> I stop, I keep my head up and look, and, above all, I open up the pitch. Whoever has the ball is running play. That comes from the school of Johan Cuyff and Pep Guardiola. This is Barça.'" [...] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, former Barcelona manager Guardiola stated, [...] "Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] And one of the most famous La Masia graduates, Xavi, said, [...] "He [...] changed the idiosyncrasy of the club. He introduced the philosophy to keep the ball, to play in triangles, to attack. That philosophy remains true to this day. We're all students of Cruyff and his school of thought." ...|$|E
