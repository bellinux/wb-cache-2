40|$|To {{efficiently}} deploy eye-tracking within 3 D graphics applications, {{we present}} a new probabilistic method that predicts the patterns of user’s eye fixations in animated 3 D scenes from noisy <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data.</b> The proposed method utilises both the <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data</b> and the known information about the 3 D scene to improve the accuracy, robustness and stability. Eye-tracking can thus be used, for example, to induce focal cues via gaze-contingent depth-of-field rendering, add intuitive controls to a video game, and create a highly reliable scene-aware saliency model. The computed probabilities rely on {{the consistency of the}} gaze scan-paths to the position and velocity of a moving or stationary target. The temporal characteristic of eye fixations is imposed by a Hidden Markov model, which steers the solution towards the most probable fixation patterns. The derivation of the algorithm is driven by the data from two eye-tracking experiments: the first experiment provides actual eye-tracker readings and the position of the target to be tracked. The second experiment is used to derive a JND-scaled (Just Noticeable Difference) quality metric that quantifies the perceived loss of quality due to the errors of the tracking algorithm. Data from both experiments are used to justify design choices, and to calibrate and validate the tracking algorithms. This novel method outperforms commonly used fixation algorithms and is able to track objects smaller then the nominal error of an eye-tracker...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new method to correct eye {{movement}} artifacts in electroencephalogram (EEG) data. By using an eye tracker, whose data cannot be corrupted by any electrophysiological signals, an accurate method for correction is developed. The <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data</b> {{is used in}} a Kalman filter to estimate which part of the EEG is of ocular origin. The main assumptions for optimal correction are summed and their validity is proven. The eye-tracker-based correction method is objectively evaluated on simulated data of four different types of eye movements and visually evaluated on experimental data. Results are compared to three established correction methods: regression, principal component analysis, and second-order blind identification. A comparison of {{signal to noise ratio}} after correction by these methods is given in Table II and shows that our method is consistently superior to the other three methods, often by a large margin. The use of a reference signal without electrophysiological influences, as provided by an eye tracker, is essential to achieve optimal eye movement artifact removal...|$|E
50|$|From {{a system}} {{analysis}} point of view, eye-tracking applications should {{be distinguished from}} diagnostic or interactive system. In diagnostic mode, the <b>eye-tracker</b> provides <b>data</b> about the observer’s visual search and attention processes. In interactive mode, the eye-tracker is used as an input device. From a general point of view, an interactive system responds to the observer’s actions and interacts with him.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an improved approach for indicating visually salient regions {{of an image}} based upon a known visual search task. The proposed approach employs a robust model of instantaneous visual attention (i. e. “bottom-up”) combined with a pixel probability map derived from the automatic detection of a previously-seen object (task-dependent i. e. (“top-down”). The objects to be recognized are parameterized quickly in advance by a viewpoint-invariant spatial distribution of Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) interest-points. The bottom-up and top-down object probability images are fused to produce a task-dependent saliency map. The proposed approach is validated using observer <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data</b> collected under object search-and-count tasking. Proposed approach shows 13 % higher overlap with true attention areas under task compared to bottom-up saliency alone. The new combined saliency map is further used {{to develop a new}} intelligent compression technique which is an extension of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) encoding. The proposed approach is demonstrated on surveillance-style footage throughout...|$|E
40|$|Eye {{tracking}} {{has become}} a valuable tool for investigating infant looking behavior over the last decades. However, where eye-tracking methodology and achieving high data quality have received a much attention for adult participants, {{it is unclear how}} these results generalize to infant research. This is particularly important as infants behave different from adults in front of the eye tracker. In this study, we investigated whether eye physiology, positioning, and infant behavior affect measures of eye-tracking data quality: accuracy, precision, and data loss. We report that accuracy and precision are lower, and more data loss occurs for infants with bluish eye color compared to infants with brownish eye color. Moreover, accuracy was lower for infants positioned in a high chair or in the parents' lap compared to infants positioned in a baby seat. Finally, precision decreased and data loss increased as a function of time. We highlight the importance of data quality when comparing multiple groups, as differences in data quality can affect eye-tracking measures. In addition, we investigate how two different measures to quantify infant movement influence <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data</b> quality. These findings might help researchers with data collection and help manufacturers develop better eye-tracking systems for infants. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Supported {{by general}} {{revenues}} from the State of Texas. This research project analyzed drivers ’ eye scanning behavior at night when approaching signalized and unsignalized intersections using the data from a head-mounted eye-tracking system during open road driving on a prescribed route. During the 1000 -ft approaching the intersections, drivers shifted their glance more frequently when approaching the signalized intersections than they did at unsignalized intersections. Among different turning movements, left turns overall seemed to elicit different eye movement patterns than the right-turn or through-movements. When approaching intersections where they would turn left, the drivers glanced most often straight ahead, while glances {{to the right side}} decreased in frequency and glances to the left increased in frequency compared to the right-turn and through-movement intersections. This study used a binary logistic regression model to analyze the changes of probabilities of glances to each of four areas of the scene as a function of distance to the intersections. At some intersections, the probabilities of glances at particular areas significantly changed with the distance to the intersection. The report also discusses methodological issues with on-road studies, the coding of <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data,</b> an...|$|E
40|$|The {{marketing}} materials of remote <b>eye-trackers</b> suggest that <b>data</b> quality is invariant {{to the position}} and orientation of the participant {{as long as the}} eyes of the participant are within the eye-tracker's headbox, the area where tracking is possible. As such, remote eye-trackers are marketed as allowing the reliable recording of gaze from participant groups that cannot be restrained, such as infants, schoolchildren and patients with muscular or brain disorders. Practical experience and previous research, however, tells us that eye-tracking data quality, e. g. the accuracy of the recorded gaze position and the amount of data loss, deteriorates (compared to well-trained participants in chinrests) when the participant is unrestrained and assumes a non-optimal pose in front of the eye-tracker. How then can researchers working with unrestrained participants choose an eye-tracker? Here we investigated the performance of five popular remote eye-trackers from EyeTribe, SMI, SR Research, and Tobii in a series of tasks where participants took on non-optimal poses. We report that the tested systems varied in the amount of data loss and systematic offsets observed during our tasks. The EyeLink and EyeTribe in particular had large problems. Furthermore, the Tobii <b>eye-trackers</b> reported <b>data</b> for two eyes when only one eye was visible to the eye-tracker. This study provides practical insight into how popular remote eye-trackers perform when recording from unrestrained participants. It furthermore provides a testing method for evaluating whether a tracker is suitable for studying a certain target population, and that manufacturers can use during the development of new eye-trackers...|$|R
40|$|Research {{investigating}} cognitive {{aspects of}} information systems is often dependent on detail-rich <b>data.</b> <b>Eye-trackers</b> promise to provide respective data, but the associated costs are often beyond the researchers' budget. Recently, eye-trackers have entered the market that promise eye-tracking support at a reasonable price. In this work, we explore whether such eye-trackers are of use for information systems research and explore the accuracy of a low-cost eye-tracker (Gazepoint GP 3) in an empirical study. The results show that Gazepoint GP 3 is well suited for respective research, given that experimental material acknowledges {{the limits of the}} eye-tracker. To foster replication and comparison of results, all data, experimental material as well as the source code developed for this study are made available online...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the visual strategies adopted while walking in cognitively engaging environments is extremely valuable. Analyzing gaze when a treadmill and a virtual reality environment are used as motor rehabilitation tools is therefore critical. Being completely unobtrusive, remote eye-trackers are the most appropriate way to measure the point of gaze. Still, the point of gaze measurements are affected by experimental conditions such as head range of motion and visual stimuli. This study assesses the usability limits and measurement reliability of a remote eye-tracker during treadmill walking while visual stimuli are projected. During treadmill walking, the head remained within the remote eye-tracker workspace. Generally, {{the quality of the}} point of gaze measurements declined as the distance from the remote <b>eye-tracker</b> increased and <b>data</b> loss occurred for large gaze angles. The stimulus location (a dot-target) did not influence the point of gaze accuracy, precision, and trackability during both standing and walking. Similar results were obtained when the dot-target was replaced by a static or moving 2 D target and “region of interest” analysis was applied. These findings foster the feasibility of the use of a remote eye-tracker for the analysis of gaze during treadmill walking in virtual reality environments...|$|R
40|$|Aging brings {{cognitive}} changes. Language is {{not immune}} to these changes. The use of compensation strategies may permit older adults to achieve a performance level {{identical to the one}} obtained by younger adults. This research aims to study text comprehension in aging and the reading strategies used for by older and younger adults. Kintsch's cognitive model (1988) allows the identification of different levels of representation within text treatment (linguistic form, macrostructure, microstructure and situation model) and predicts the underlying cognitive components. Eye-tracking analyses during reading permit inference about the moments of reading treatment and detection of reading strategies. Sixty highly educated participants were assessed. They were divided in two age groups (20 - 40 and 60 - 80 years old). Participants were asked to read and understand three texts constructed to highlight the features of text comprehension within each one of the different levels of text representation. The amount of detail and the necessity of updating the situation model varied for each text. Eye movements were registered by an eyetracker (Cambridge research) during the reading process. Specific complementary tasks were administered to evaluate working memory, long-term memory, and executive functions. Variances analyses showed significantly lower performance by older adults regarding: 1) recall of the microstructure of the two texts {{with a high degree of}} detail, 2) macrostructure of the text with fewer details, and 3) performance on all tasks that evaluated cognitive components. Aging influenced treatment of levels of text representation depending on text characteristics. However, cluster analysis of the text comprehension and <b>eye-tracker</b> <b>data</b> revealed a group of older adults whose performance in reading comprehension was identical to the performance of younger adults, with the same reading profile. This result seems to show that use of compensation strategies by older adults at the onset of signs of cognitive deterioration is not necessary in reading...|$|E
40|$|Self-regulation is {{a highly}} {{adaptive}} process that enables goal-directed behaviour; however, individuals often fail to self-regulate successfully. Failures of self-regulation {{in the domain of}} health may be particularly harmful especially for those with chronic diseases. The Energy Model articulated by Baumeister and colleagues proposes that all acts of self-regulation rely on a single, finite energy resource. Thus, one possible explanation for self-regulation failure is insufficient energy. In the current research, four studies examine the relationship between the construct of energy, which can manifest in state or trait form, and self-regulatory success. Past research has demonstrated that individuals who perform two sequential tasks requiring self-regulation perform worse on the second task (the self-regulatory fatigue effect). The Energy Model proposes that this performance decrement can be explained by energy depletion. If this is true, then state energy should mediate the self-regulatory fatigue effect. A series of three experimental studies (studies 1 - 3) were designed to test this hypothesis. In Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to a gaze regulation task or to a no-regulation control group (as in Schmeichel et. al, 2003) before they watched a brief video clip. Following this first task, all participants worked on a second self-regulatory task (solving anagrams). Persistence and performance on this second task were the dependent measures and energy was measured before and after the initial video task. Contrary to the predictions of the Energy Model, the self-regulatory fatigue effect was not replicated in this study and so the mediating potential of energy could not be tested. However, ratings of task difficulty and effort suggested that individuals in the gaze regulation condition did not find this task to be very challenging. Accordingly, a second study was designed that added an additional level of self-regulatory demand by asking participants to rehearse a 7 -digit number during the video clip (memory regulation). When this was crossed with the gaze regulation manipulation, four conditions were created: no regulation, gaze regulation only, memory regulation only and memory + gaze regulation. Study 2 then followed the same approximate procedure as Study 1, with individuals {{randomly assigned to one of}} the four conditions. The results of this study were consistent with Study 1 in that the self-regulatory fatigue effect was not replicated. However, the manipulation check suggested that some of the participants in the gaze regulation conditions may not have adhered to experimental instructions and the conditions may have differed in the degree to which they were enjoyable and interesting to participants. Accordingly, a third study used an eye-tracker to assess self-regulation during the video task and evaluated aspects of task engagement. Study 3 followed the same procedures as Study 2. <b>Eye-tracker</b> <b>data</b> verified significant differences between the groups in terms of self-regulation during the initial video task; however, there were no other significant between group differences. Taken together, these 3 studies indicate that the self-regulatory fatigue effect may be less robust than previous research would suggest. An unexpected finding was the high degree of variability in the energy measures, which implied that individual differences in energy may be important to consider. Accordingly, Study 4 prospectively examined the role of dispositional energy in the self-regulation of diet and exercise behaviour by testing whether energy moderated intention-behaviour concordance in a sample of individuals newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. This study demonstrated that energy predicted future exercise behaviour in this sample and provided some preliminary support for the hypothesis that individuals with higher levels of dispositional energy may show more intention-behaviour concordance than those with lower levels of dispositional energy. Overall, these 4 studies provide some tentative support for the role of dispositional energy in the implementation of health behaviour, but do not support the Energy Model’s predictions regarding self-regulatory fatigue...|$|E
40|$|Real {{offshore}} operational scenarios {{can involve}} {{a considerable amount}} of risk. Sophisticated training programmes involving specially designed simulator environments constitute a promising approach for improving an individual's perception and assessment of dangerous situations in real applications. One of the world's most advanced providers of simulators for such demanding offshore operations is the Offshore Simulator Centre AS (OSC). However, even though the OSC provides powerful simulation tools, techniques for visualising operational procedures {{that can be used to}} further improve Situational awareness (SA), are still lacking. Providing the OSC with an integrated multi-sensor fusion framework is the goal of this work. The proposed framework is designed to improve planning, execution and assessment of demanding maritime operations by adopting newly-designed risk-evaluation tools. Different information from the simulator scene and from the real world can be collected, such as audio, video, bio-metric <b>data</b> from <b>eye-trackers,</b> other sensor <b>data</b> and annotations. This integration is the base for research on novel SA assessment methodologies. This will serve the industry for the purpose of improving operational effectiveness and safety through the use of simulators. In this work, a training methodology based on the concept of briefing/debriefing is adopted based on previous literature. By using this methodology borrowed from similarly demanding applications, the efficiency of the proposed framework is validated in a conceptual case study. In particular, the training procedure, which was previously performed by Statoil and partners, for the world's first sub-sea gas compression plant, in Aasgard, Norway, is considered and reviewed highlighting the potentials of the proposed framework...|$|R
40|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) {{is characterized}} by a broad range of behavioral and cognitive deficits that impact the long-term quality of life for affected individuals. However, the underlying changes in brain structure and function associated with these cognitive impairments are not well understood. Previous studies identified deficits in behavioral performance of prosaccade tasks in children with FASD. In this study, we investigated group differences in gamma oscillations in response to a prosaccade task. We collected MEG data from 15 adolescents with FASD and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC) {{with a mean age of}} 15. 9 ± 0. 4 years. During the prosaccade task, the participants began each trial by gazing at a centrally-placed fixation point. After a variable delay, a peripheral target appeared along the horizontal meridian in left or right visual field. The participants were instructed to saccade to the target as quickly and accurately as possible. Eye movement was recorded and synchronized to the MEG data using an MEG compatible <b>eye-tracker.</b> The MEG <b>data</b> were analyzed relative to the onset of the visual saccade. Time frequency analysis was performed using Fieldtrip with a focus on group differences in gamma-band oscillations. Following left target presentation, we identified 4 clusters over right frontal, right parietal and left temporal/occipital cortex, with significantly different gamma-band (30 - 50 Hz) power between FASD and HC. Furthermore, visual M 100 latencies described in Coffman et al. (2012) corresponded with increased gamma power over right central cortex in FASD only, which may represent compensatory activity in this group. Gamma-band differences were not identified for stimulus-averaged responses implying that these gamma-band differences were related to differences in saccade network functioning. These gamma-band differences in power may provide indicators of atypical development of cortical networks in individuals with FASD...|$|R
