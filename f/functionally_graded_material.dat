40|$|Abstract. There {{are much}} complex {{internal}} microstructures of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials,</b> and the mechanical parameters of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures varied {{with the space}} coordinates. Therefore, it is generally difficult to measure point by point macro distributions curves of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> properties based on available experimental conditions. The prerequisite for various analyses of the <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures is the determination of macro distributions curves of materials properties parameters. In practice, only the spatial distributions of different ma-terial components can be controlled {{in the course of}} materials production. Therefore, the <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> distributions curves need inversing and identifying by the materials components. In the pre-sent paper, the inversion and identification technique was put forward based on the positive static and dynamic analyses by the microelement method, which was applied to do the scale-span analyses for macro responses of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures based on the given materials components distributions in production...|$|R

50|$|In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a {{high-power}} laser {{is used to}} melt {{metal powder}} supplied to {{the focus of the}} laser beam. The laser beam typically travels {{through the center of the}} deposition head and is focused to a small spot by one or more lenses. The build occurs on a X-Y table which is driven by a tool path created from a digital model to fabricate an object layer by layer. The deposition head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Metal powder is delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head or can be split by an internal manifold and delivered through nozzles arranged in various configurations around the deposition head. A hermetically sealed chamber filled with inert gas or a local inert shroud gas is often used to shield the melt pool from atmospheric oxygen for better control of material properties. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. The process supports a wide range of materials including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and other specialty materials as well as composites and <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>material.</b> The process can not only fully build new metal parts but can also add material to existing parts for example for coatings, repair, and hybrid manufacturing applications. LENS (Laser Engineered Net Shaping), which was developed by Sandia National Labs, is one example of the Powder Fed - Directed Energy Deposition process for 3D printing or restoring metal parts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{interaction}} of two collinear cracks in <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> subjected to a uniform anti-plane shear loading is investigated by means of nonlocal theory. The traditional concepts of the nonlocal theory are extended to solve the fracture problem of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> To make the analysis tractable, {{it is assumed that}} the shear modulus varies exponentially with the coordinate vertical to the crack. By use of the Fourier transform, the problem can be solved {{with the help of a}} pair of triple integral equations, in which the unknown variable is the displacement on the crack surfaces. To solve the triple integral equations, the displacement on the crack surfaces is expanded in a series of Jacobi polynomials. Unlike the classical elasticity solutions, it is found that no stress singularity is present near the crack tips. The nonlocal elastic solutions yield a finite hoop stress at the crack tip, thus allowing us to use the maximum stress as a fracture criterion in <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> The magnitude of the finite stress field depends on the crack length, the distance between two cracks, the parameter describing the <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> and the lattice parameter of the materials...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} a polar {{orthotropic}} rotating solid disk with variable thickness made of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>material</b> is considered. A special stress distribution with the constant radial stress condition is proposed. <b>Functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>material</b> behavior {{is achieved by}} radially varying the degree of orthotropy (Jain, Ramachandra and Simha (1999). Rotating Anisotropic Disk of Uniform Strength, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 41 : 639 – 648). The thickness of the solid disk is also assumed to vary exponentially with any power of the radius. The natural frequencies of rotating disk are calculated by Rayleigh–Ritz method. The effect of this special stress distribution on increasing the natural frequency of transverse vibrations is demonstrated.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the optimal design of <b>Functionally</b> <b>Graded</b> <b>Materials</b> (FGM) is {{proposed}} in this paper. Instead {{of using the}} widely used explicit functional models, a feature tree based procedural model is proposed to represent generic material heterogeneities. A procedural model of this sort allows more than one explicit function to be incorporated to describe versatile material gradations and the material composition at a given location is no longer computed by simple evaluation of an analytic function, but obtained by execution of customizable procedures. This enables generic and diverse types of material variations to be represented, and most importantly, by a reasonably small number of design variables. The descriptive flexibility in the material heterogeneity formulation {{as well as the}} low dimensionality of the design vectors help facilitate the optimal design of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> Using the nature-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> with generic distributions can be efficiently optimized. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a PSO based optimizer outperforms classical mathematical programming based methods, such as active set and trust region algorithms, in the optimal design of <b>functionally</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> The underlying reason for this performance boost is also elucidated with the help of benchmarked examples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
