[...] He played in three games for the 1977 Miami Dolphins and had one {{interception}} (off Buffalo Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson).

500|$|On 3 July 2012, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{confirmed}} that Pogba {{had left the}} club after not signing a new contract. Ferguson stated that Pogba had signed for Italian club Juventus [...] "a long time ago as far as we're aware." [...] Ferguson also accused Pogba of disrespecting Manchester United, saying, [...] "It is disappointing. I don't think <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> any respect at all, to be honest. I'm quite happy that if they [...] carry on that way, they're probably better doing it away from us." [...] On 27 July, Juventus confirmed on their official website that Pogba had undergone a medical at the club, and the transfer was completed on 3 August, when he signed a four-year contract. He made his first appearance for Juventus in a pre-season friendly against Benfica in Geneva on 1 August, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute for Andrea Pirlo.|$|E

500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} after the war many of Cardus's earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry's death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as [...] "A great Englishman, {{measured}} by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation". In 1959, still in harness, Newman {{died at the age}} of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a Companion of Honour (CH), or even to the Order of Merit. Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend's powers, though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham's 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: [...] "He led us out of the Teutonic captivity. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> other and more sensitive worlds". After Beecham's death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau; in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers. Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing Pierre Boulez's Pli selon pli after a performance in 1965, he said he [...] "could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years after}} first seeing There Will Be Blood, I am {{convinced}} that Paul Thomas Anderson's profound portrait of an American primitive—take that, Citizen Kane—deserves pride of place among the decade's finest. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven {{in the form of}} a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to [...] "drink the milkshake" [...] of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than Boogie Nights and Magnolia—his rebel cries from the 1990s—Blood let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on Blood, I'll quote Plainview: [...] "It was one goddamn hell of a show." ...|$|E
