40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the stability of the Croatian banking sector. After the banking crisis of 1998, the Croatian banking system underwent a deep transformation process; foreign investors gained a dominating market share of more than 90 % of total assets, with Austrian banks holding 43 % thereof. Compared to other Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), the degree of banking intermediation is relatively high in Croatia. In recent years, lending to the private sector and in particular to households has risen whereas lending to the general government has declined. Foreign currencies continue {{to play an important role}} in the Croatian banking sector, in particular on the liabilities side of banks balance sheets. While maintaining a large negative net <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>position</b> on their balance sheets (with an increasing portion of net liabilities to nonresidents), Croatian banks overall net <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>position</b> seems to be marginally positive. Still, foreign currency(-indexed) lending represents a credit risk as it entails an indirect exchange rate risk. Asset quality, by contrast, has improved significantly over the past five years, the capital adequacy ratio is on a relatively high — albeit declining — level, and real return on equity (ROE) is now as high as the profitability levels observed in other CEECs.

An econometric model of the short run dynamics of deposit and loan dollarization is estimated for the last decade. We find that ruble appreciation was the main driver of the de-dollarization that occurred then and of the later episode of renewed dollarization. We estimate the overall (and sectoral) currency mismatches of the Russian economy. The results show a gradual improvement of the net <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>position</b> of the public sector, where we have seen significant accumulation of international reserves by the Bank of Russia and repayment of government debt.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the theoretical literature that analyses the link between international asset trade and international risk sharing. Despite the massive increase in cross-border asset trade since the 1990 's, consumption risk sharing across countries remains limited. In standard international business cycle models, efficient risk sharing requires that consumption should be higher {{in the country where}} it is cheaper to consume, implying a high positive correlation between relative consumption and real exchange rate, which is strongly rejected in the data. Recent contributions show {{that it is possible to}} account for this so-called 'consumption-real exchange rate anomaly' in models with goods and financial market frictions where international asset trade is restricted to a single non-contingent bond. Chapter 1 analyses whether this class of models can account for the anomaly under a richer asset market structure where agents can trade in domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> bonds. Even such a small departure from the single bond economy implies too much risk sharing compared to the data although the number of assets that can be traded is less than the number of shocks affecting each economy. Introducing demand shocks alongside sector-specific productivity shocks can improve the performance of the model only under specific parameter and monetary policy settings. Chapter 2 extends this analysis to study the implications of international trade in equities, portfolio transaction costs and recursive utility. Chapter 3 studies the interaction between monetary policy and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> in more detail. Different monetary policy regimes can lead to different <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> by changing the cyclical properties of the nominal ex- change rate. These external positions, in turn, affect the cross-border transmission of monetary policy shocks via a valuation channel. The way export prices are set has important implications for optimal <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>positions</b> and the valuation channel when prices are sticky and financial markets are incomplete. Chapter 4 compares the international transmission of uncertainty shocks under alternative asset markets with an emphasis on the behaviour of net foreign assets, exchange rate and currency risk premium and shows that a model with restricted asset trade performs better than a model with complete financial integration in matching certain aspects of the data regarding the dynamics of these variables in response to increased macroeconomic uncertainty.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this study is to didactically {{demonstrate}} the factors shaping the currency swap stock of domestic banks prior to the crisis and to provide a descriptive analysis of how the structure and the functioning of the market changed during the crisis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. In addition to the wide ranging applicability of the transaction, the rise in the currency swap stock of domestic credit institutions is also attributable to macroeconomic factors. The bulk of the exchange rate risk resulting from the high external borrowing requirement and rising external debt was carried by the domestic private sector, while the foreign sector shared a decreasing portion of the risk. The rapid increase in the swap stock was also due to the fact that the synthetic production of foreign currency funds with currency swaps was often more successful than the direct inflow of foreign currency funds. On the basis of the decomposition of the domestic banking system’s on-balance sheet <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>position,</b> we can state that it increased mainly as a result of items that also increased the balance sheet total. Following the outbreak of the global financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the conditions for ensuring foreign currency liquidity deteriorated significantly, which had a substantial effect on implied forint yields, and the turnover and structure of the swap market. While the total average turnover of the domestic FX swap market did not drop radically when the crisis was spreading, market liquidity did decline significantly for a few days and access to foreign currency liquidity became limited. The active role assumed by parent banks and shortening maturities contributed to moderating the decline in turnover. Anecdotal information relating to the tightening of counterparty limits vis-a-vis domestic banks is supported by the decline in the number of non-resident counterparties. The crisis also contributed to changes in the structure of the swap stock. The average remaining maturity of the gross stock began to decline directly after the Lehman bankruptcy, at the time of global dollar liquidity problems, followed by a rise starting from early 2009, principally owing to transactions concluded with parent banks. Domestic subsidiary banks managed to increase maturity primarily through cross-currency swap transactions concluded with intra-group counterparties, but non-group counterparties also concluded transactions with longer maturity with domestic banks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{generalisation}} of the noise trader transmission mechanism to examine the impact of central bank intervention on exchange rates.

This study is motivated {{by the lack of}} theoretical and empirical work on the sources of foreign exchange exposure of banking institutions.

In this study, top-down macro stress testing from a supervisory perspective was analyzed and discussed in general terms. Then, probable effects of credit, interest rate, exchange rate, and contagion risks on capital adequacy of Turkish banking sector in specified baseline and adverse scenarios were examined. First, different satellite panel econometric models for corporate and retail loans were used to estimate loan growth and non-performing loans. Second, model results were utilized to see effects of macro-economic scenarios on Turkish banking system according to the Basel's standard and economic capital approaches. Results of the study showed that economic growth and interest rates change had significant effects on corporate loans while along with these variables unemployment rate had significant effect on retail loans. Moreover, economic growth, exchange rates, and unemployment rate had significant impacts on corporate non-performing loans while only economic growth and unemployment rate had significant impact on non-performing retail loans.

40|$|Purpose – Recent {{research}} indicates that the random walk hypothesis (RWH) approximately describes the behavior of major dollar exchange rates during the post- 1973 float. The present analysis seeks to examine the profitability of currency futures trading rules that assume that spot exchange rates can be adequately modeled as a driftless random walk. Design/methodology/approach – Two random walk currency futures trading rules are simulated over all available data from the period 1984 - 2003. In both cases, the investor buys currencies selling at a discount and sells those selling at a premium, as the RWH implies. The two rules differ only {{in the way they}} allocate the hypothetical investor's resources among long and short <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>positions.</b> Findings – Results show that an investor who used these trading strategies over the past decade would have enjoyed large cumulative gains, although periods of profit were interrupted by periods of substantial loss. Research limitations/implications – The findings encourage the hope that profitable random-walk-based strategies for currency futures trading can be devised. The simulation results have important implications for those willing to hedge, borrowers, and speculators. Originality/value – This paper provides evidence that purchasing futures contracts on currencies priced at a discount and selling futures contracts priced at a premium has generally been a profitable trading strategy during the last two decades of floating exchange rates.

The information collected included foreign equity assets, <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> denominated debt assets and liabilities, expected future <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> receipts and payments from trade, the principal value of outstanding currency derivative contracts and policies on hedging <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> exposure. The survey was conducted by the ABS at the request of, and with the financial support of, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The survey provides additional information to that available in the International Investment Position, on the mitigating impact of hedging activities on <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> exposures...|$|R
40|$|The {{previous}} currency law of Nov. 22, 1983 imposed many {{restrictions on}} currency transactions, {{making it impossible}} to implement market mechanisms into that sphere of economic activity. Basic assumptions of a new <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Act of Feb. 15, 1989 is the principle according to which the duty to obtain a permit to enter into a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transaction is required only in matters expressly stated in the Act. It means that the Act introduces freedom of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transactions in relations indifferent {{from the point of view}} of economic and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> interests of the State. Besides, the new law provides for statutory guaranties of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> property rights. However, it also imposes on economic units the duty to resell to the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> banks part of those units' revenues in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The Act introduces also <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> auctions, open for all economic units. The auction price of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> is to be shaped by supply/demand rules. The Act, in an attempt to protect Polish currency, introduces the duty to obtain <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> permit for payments for goods, services and labour if these payments are to be effected in Poland between so-called domestic persons. The permit is necessary also in case of taking Polish currency and Polish securities abroad. A new solution is the provision allowing the retired persons who receive their pensions from foreign insurance companies to collect part of their allowances in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The new Law, although not free from defects, is a step in the right direction. Future amendment, justified by the requirements of social and economic praxis, are nonetheless indispensable. They should be aimed at furthering the liberalization of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> law...|$|R
40|$|I {{decompose}} {{the factors}} contributing to the riskiness of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowers. I compare counterfactual default probabilities of local and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowers estimated on disaggregated data. My {{results suggest that the}} currency mismatch with the depreciation of the local currency is the most important factor contributing to the riskiness of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowers, though boom-period excessive risk taking of banks is also concentrated in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> lending...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} effect on firm value of {{different}} <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (FC) financial hedging strategies identified by type of exposure (short or long term) and type of instrument (forwards, options, swaps and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt). We find that hedging instruments depend {{on the type of}} exposure. Short term instruments such as FC forwards and/or options are used to hedge short term exposure generated from export activity while FC debt and FC swaps into <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (but not into domestic currency) are used to hedge long term exposure arising from assets located in foreign locations. Our results relating to the value effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> hedging indicate that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives use increases firm value but there is no hedging premium associated with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt hedging, except when combined with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives. Taken individually, FC swaps generate more value than short term derivatives...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing by small firms, using {{information on the}} most recent loan extended to 3101 firms in 25 transition countries between 2002 and 2005. Our results suggest that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing is much stronger related to firm-level <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> revenues {{than it is to}} country-level interest rate differentials. Supporting the conclusion that carry-trade behavior is not the key driver of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing in our sample we find no evidence that firm-level indicators of distress costs or financial transparency affect loan currency denomination. Overall, our findings suggest that retail clients which do take <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans are better equipped to bear the corresponding currency risks than is commonly thought. Policy makers should therefore {{take a closer look at}} the characteristics of borrowers before implementing regulations which are aimed at curbing <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans. <b>Foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing Competition Banking sector Market structure...|$|R
5000|$|Government debt, synonymous to {{sovereign}} debt, can {{be issued}} either in domestic or <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies.</b> Investors in sovereign bonds denominated in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> have exchange rate risk: the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> might depreciate against the investor's local currency. Sovereigns issuing debt denominated in a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> may furthermore {{be unable to}} obtain that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> to service debt. In the 2010 Greek debt crisis, for example, the debt is held by Greece in Euros, and one proposed solution (advanced notably by World Pensions Council (WPC) financial economists) is for Greece {{to go back to}} issuing its own drachma. This proposal would only address future debt issuance, leaving substantial existing debts denominated in what would then be a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency,</b> potentially doubling their cost ...|$|R
