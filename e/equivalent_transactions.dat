40|$|BitCoin {{transactions}} are malleable {{in a sense}} that given a transaction an adversary can easily construct an <b>equivalent</b> <b>transaction</b> which has a different hash. This can pose a serious problem in some BitCoin distributed contracts in which changing a transaction's hash may result in the protocol disruption and a financial loss. The problem mostly concerns protocols, which use a "refund" transaction to withdraw a deposit in a case of the protocol interruption. In this short note, we show a general technique for creating malleability-resilient "refund" transactions, which does not require any modification of the BitCoin protocol.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to obtain an understanding as to the true economic nature of employee share options and the problems surrounding the accounting thereof. The main conclusion {{of this study is}} that employee share options should be expensed in the income statement as and when the employee's services are performed. The reason is that employee share options are valuable financial instruments which the employer has used to compensate the employee for his services. It was also concluded that exercise date accounting and classification of outstanding employee share options as liabilities on the balance sheet is the most appropriate accounting treatment. Such accounting treatment trues up the accounting of employee share options with that of cash-settled share appreciation rights, which are economically <b>equivalent</b> <b>transactions.</b> The measurement of employee share options should be based on their fair value using an option-pricing model adapted for the specific features of employee share options.

40|$|The tax {{consequences}} of substantively equivalent partnership mergers, divisions and incorporations can vary dramatically {{depending on the}} form of the transaction. This disparate treatment arises because the tax analysis of these partnership transactions inconsistently adheres to the “form” of the transaction and limits the use of legal “fictions”. This part-form, part-fiction approach distorts parties’ incentives about whether and how to undertake such transactions and can make the transactions less efficient, all without materially advancing other policy goals. This result is exacerbated by non-tax business exigencies that restrict parties’ abilities to implement certain transaction forms and by the increase in “formless” transactions. In order to treat substantively <b>equivalent</b> <b>transactions</b> similarly, this article proposes the adoption of a uniform regime in which the tax {{consequences of}} partnership mergers, divisions and incorporations are determined based on the legal “fiction” elected (from up to three choices) by the parties, regardless of the “form” in which the transaction is implemented. The proposed approach not only remedies the problem of disparate treatment and addresses the policy concerns raised by existing part-form, part-fiction regime, but also rationalizes the use of “form” and “fiction” in the tax analysis of substantively equivalent partnership transactions...|$|E

In The Great Transformation, Karl Polanyi claimed there are three types of economic productions: market economy, redistribution economy and reciprocity economy (Polanyi 1944). Thus, what are the relationship between these three types of economic production and three development stages (forgoers individual employment, “chain type” group employment, and “net type” group employment) of migrant workers “beehives”? For migrant workers who left rural village enter into big cities’ strange environment of <b>equivalent</b> <b>transaction</b> of market economy and/or political redistribution economy, it means they have been divorced from reciprocal nature economy system through economic system point of view. To obtain living space in this strong economic mode or economic system of big cities, migrant workers must use the existing reciprocal method brought from their hometown, find some footholds in the blank space in the process of transformation from reciprocal economy to market economy, or embed into the marginal space of institutionalized redistribution economy and market economy through chain type and web type “beehive” in the group.|$|R

It {{is the first}} research that provides analytical evidence on the condition under which the hybrid trigger has lower basis risk. Simulation results support my analyses. Major {{findings in this study}} provide insights to insurers who would proactively manage the basis risk of CAT bonds. Chapter 2 examines whether the parimutuel mechanism can hedge risk-averse people against catastrophic losses. Two optimal stake choice models are constructed. In the first model where the stakes of other players are exogenous, the optimal stake can be obtained by equating the marginal cost of a net payoff with the ratio of the expected marginal utilities in the payoff state and the no payoff state. The dynamic optimal hedge can be achieved if the odds, and the conditional probability of a hurricane hitting the target area, are available. In the second model, an optimal equilibrium stake is derived by maximizing the representative agent’s expected utility. Given no transaction fee and tax, we show that parimutuel insurance intrinsically leads to participants being underinsured due to basis risk. Although participants will be underinsured, parimutuel insurance guarantees no underlying risk borne by the issuer. We also derive the <b>equivalent</b> <b>transaction</b> costs of traditional insurance relative to HuRLOs. The actual transaction cost for traditional insurance is found to b...|$|R

40|$|In {{portfolio}} optimization, {{the inverse}} covariance matrix prescribes the hedge trades where {{a portfolio of}} stocks hedges each one {{with all the other}} stocks to minimize portfolio risk. In practice with finite samples, however, multicollinearity makes the hedge trades too unstable to be reliable. By reducing the number of stocks in each hedge trade to curb estimation errors, we motivate a “sparse ” estimator of the inverse covariance matrix with multiple zero off-diagonal elements. Comparing favorably with those under no-short-sale constraints and using shrunk covariance matrix, a portfolio formed on this estimator achieves significant risk reduction out-of-sample. By improving hedge trades, the portfolio delivers higher certainty <b>equivalent</b> returns after <b>transaction</b> costs in a range of situations. Mean variance portfolio optimization relies on covariances to transform expected returns into optimal portfolio weights. Consider a portfolio of N stocks.

40|$|In many cases, {{politicians}} {{and government officials}} are forbidden by law to accept monetary donations from interest groups or other outside parties as these monetary transfers are thought to cause social inefficiencies. The empirical literature supports this view as it finds a negative link between corruption (secret payments to government officials) and growth. However, banning monetary transfers to government officials might be discouraged as it is <b>equivalent</b> to restricting <b>transactions</b> {{in the market for}} political decision-making and inefficiencies can arise exactly because of these constraints. In this paper, we address the following question: Under which conditions should the government forbid its officials to accept monetary donations, even though enforcing such bans is costly and secret transfers still may occur? In particular, we analyze a common agency game, in which a government official acts as the common agent of the government and some third party, and identify some conditions under which banning economic interactions between the official and the third party is welfare enhancing. We also explain why secret monetary transfers to government officials can lead to economic inefficiencies. Corruption, Bribing, Common Agency, Exclusive Dealing, Hidden Contracting...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the asset {{allocation}} and portfolio optimization with small transaction costs. Three topics are studied. The first and second topics are on asset allocation problems with purely proportional transaction cost and strictly positive transaction cost, respectively. The fundamental objective is to keep the asset portfolio close to a target portfolio and in the meantime to reduce the trading cost in doing so. For each problem, we derive the quasi-variational inequality and prove a verification theorem giving sufficient conditions for a QVI solution to be the value function. The optimal strategy is a singular control in the first topic and an impulse control in the second. Furthermore, we provide a matrix exponential representation of the QVI solution for both problems and perform asymptotic analysis to characterize the optimal no transaction region when transaction costs are sufficiently small. Additionally, for both topics, we apply the asymptotic results for the boundary points and derive an expansion for the QVI solution, the optimality of which can be shown via verification theorem (up to leading orders). The third topic is on portfolio optimization with proportional transaction cost. We construct an efficient frontier problem (EFP) of maximizing expected terminal utility and minimizing terminal CVAR. We first solve the frictionless case by duality approach and nonsmooth analysis. For three representative utility functions, we obtain numerically the optimal trading strategy, optimal expected terminal utility and optimal CVAR. Our analysis of how these three quantities change with respect to different CVAR constraints provides flexibility for an investor to balance return and risk according to her own preference. We then include transaction cost to the EFP, which is <b>equivalent</b> to including <b>transaction</b> cost to a non-smooth utility maximization problem. Asymptotic analysis gives expansions for no transaction boundaries which are then applied to EFPs with different utility functions. This topic ends by numerical analysis on impact of introducing CVAR constraint and/or transaction cost for classical utility maximization problem. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the {{regulations}} found in the OECD model and the OECD TP guidelines concerning the arm’s length principle. The core of the arm’s length principle is that transactions between associated enterprises should be treated the same as transactions between independent enterprises. This principle can be found in Article 9 of the OECD model. One transaction that may fall within the scope of Article 9 of the OECD model is business restructuring. Business restructuring was previously an unregulated TP area but with the new OECD TP guidelines, from 2010, regulations have been formulated. The aim with thesis is therefore to examine how the arm’s length principle should be applied to the new guidelines for business restructurings of intangibles with an uncertain value {{at the time of the}} restructuring. In order to answer the question set out in this thesis some of the factors that affect the application of the arm’s length principle have been examined separately. Firstly the arm’s length principle that is the generally accepted TP method used by both taxpayers and tax administrations in order to find a fair price for transactions between associated enterprises. The principle seeks to identify the controlled transaction and thereafter find a comparable uncontrolled transaction that is similar to the transaction performed between the associated enterprises. The second part examined the meaning of the term business restructuring according to the new guidelines since there is no other legal or general definition. Business restructurings are defined as cross-border redeployments of functions assets and risks, performed by MNEs. As long as a transaction falls within this definition it will be subjected to the arm’s length principle for tax purposes. The third part examined intangibles since that also lack a general definition. The identification and valuation of intangibles is a complex and uncertain thing to do for both taxpayers and tax administrations. When applying the arm’s length principle it is however found that the issue of identification of what constitutes and intangible may be unnecessary. The aspect that should be considered is instead the value of the intangible or more precise, the value that independent enterprises would have agreed upon in a similar situation. The applicability of the arm’s length principle to business restructurings of intangibles with an uncertain value at the time of the restructuring should be found by performing a comparability analysis. In order to perform a comparability analysis, the controlled transaction firstly has to be identified. Thereafter, a comparable uncontrolled transaction needs to be found. An <b>equivalent</b> uncontrolled <b>transaction</b> may not be found in all cases and it should in those cases be examined what independent enterprises would have done if they had been in a comparable situation. The arm’s length principle should be applied to business restructurings of intangibles with an uncertain value in the same manner as for any other uncontrolled transaction. The issues for this type of a transaction become the identification of what constitutes a business restructuring and also how to determine a fair value for the intangibles. The OECD TP guidelines lack some guidance as to the issues that can occur when a comparable uncontrolled transaction cannot be found. This creates an unsatisfactory guesswork for both taxpayers and tax administrations when trying to determine what independent enterprises would have done if they had been in a similar situation. This creates an unnecessary uncertainty when trying to apply the arm’s length principle. ...|$|R
