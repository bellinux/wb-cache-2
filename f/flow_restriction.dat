40|$|This Note {{argues that}} {{the issues raised by}} {{transborder}} data <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions</b> must be dealt with on a global scale, not on a national basis. Part I of this Note discusses the international legal principles underlying the concept of freedom of information and the legal difficulties presented by the imposition of transborder data <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Part II analyzes the perception among developing nations that sovereign rights are threatened by an unrestricted flow of information and discusses the measures developing nations are implementing to control this perceived threat. Part III analyzes several approaches suggested for dealing with the problems of transborder data <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions</b> and argues that a new international forum must be created to constructively address the legitimate concerns of the developing nations. This Note concludes that since the effective demise of Unesco, progress must be made toward creating a viable international forum to address the multilateral concerns over transborder data <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Gas leaks: [...] Air leaks can {{be caused}} by burst or leaky hoses, {{defective}} o-rings, blown o-rings, particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a <b>flow</b> <b>restriction</b> orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke clamp seal extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or elastic deformation of the clamp by impact with the environment.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} refine the basic model of traffic {{assignment}} to capture supplementary flow relationships, the traditional modelling strategy is to modify the travel cost mapping.

It is, however, not the proper approach for incorporating traffic <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions</b> such as those imposed by joint capacities on two-way streets or in junctions, or {{the presence of a}} traffic control policy. We consider the introduction of side constraints to describe those flow relationships that have more natural interpretations as <b>flow</b> <b>restrictions</b> than as additional travel costs.
