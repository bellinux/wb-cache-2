Mathematical models developed during the past 15 years were organized into three categories: organism population dynamics, source features and transport, and management and control. One hundred forty-eight models were examined, and 56 were judged to have potential as <b>exposure</b> <b>models.</b> These 56 were screened to 31 models that were then evaluated against eight components that the ideal biotechnology model should have: (a) five state/process components (organism population, source application, exposure site, movement, and imposed management) and (b) three software components (user friendliness, availability/implementability, and flexibility).

OBJECTIVES: To compare relative risk estimates of mortality from diseases of the circulatory system for PM 2. 5 modeled from RS with that for PM 2. 5 modeled using ground-level information. METHODS: We geocoded the baseline residence of 668, 629 American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) cohort participants followed from 1982 to 2004 and assigned PM 2. 5 levels to all participants using seven different <b>exposure</b> <b>models.</b> Most of the <b>exposure</b> <b>models</b> were averaged for the years 2002 - 2004, while one RS estimate was for a longer, contemporaneous period. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate relative risks (RR) for the association of PM 2. 5 with circulatory mortality and ischemic heart disease. RESULTS: Estimates of mortality risk differed among <b>exposure</b> <b>models.</b> The smallest relative risk was observed for the RS estimates that excluded ground-based monitors for circulatory deaths (RR = 1. 02 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 00 - 1. 04 per 10 microg/m 3 increment in PM 2. 5). The largest relative risk was observed for the land use regression model that included traffic information (RR = 1. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 1. 17 per 10 microg/m 3 increment in PM 2. 5).
