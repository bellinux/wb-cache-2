The human lymphocytes were treated with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 μg/mL concentrations of BA dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), for 24  h and 48  h treatment periods. BA did not increase the SCEs for all the concentrations and treatment periods when compared to control and solvent control (DMSO). BA induced structural and total CAs at all the tested concentrations for 24 and 48  h treatment periods. The induction of the total CAs was dose dependent for the 24  h treatment period.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} fate of 14 C derived from radioactively labelled dietary precursors was determined in immature (18 - and 25 -day-old) lean and obese Zucker rats. This included measurement of 14 C incorporated into body lipid, non-essential amino acids and expired CO 2. Before weaning (18 days) {{there was no}} phenotypic difference between the fates of [14 C]palmitate and [14 C]-glucose.

This was reflected in the fate of acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. There was little phenotypic difference in the fraction of leucine or valine catabolized. The results presented here suggest that the high rate of lipogenesis found in the obese rat is supported by carbon from all the dietary precursors studied. It is also argued that the decreased protein deposition found in the obese rat is not caused by the high rate of lipogenesis removing precursors for protein synthesis, as has been suggested elsewhere [Cleary, Vasselli & Greenwood (1980) Am.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE 1) is a ubiquitously expressed {{plasma membrane}} protein.

The membrane domain of NHE 1 comprises the 500 N-terminal amino acids and is made of 12 transmembrane segments.

Our results suggest that EL 4 makes an extension upward from TM VII to make up part of the mouth of the NHE 1 protein and is involved in cation selectivity or coordination.

40|$|The RhaS and RhaR {{proteins}} are transcription activators that {{respond to}} the availability of l-rhamnose and activate transcription of the operons in the Escherichia coli l-rhamnose catabolic regulon. RhaR activates transcription of rhaSR, and RhaS activates transcription of the operon that encodes the l-rhamnose catabolic enzymes, rhaBAD, {{as well as the}} operon that encodes the l-rhamnose transport protein, rhaT. RhaS is 30 % identical to RhaR at the amino acid level, and both are members of the AraC/XylS family of transcription activators. The RhaS and RhaR binding sites overlap the − 35 hexamers of the promoters they regulate, suggesting they may contact the σ 70 subunit of RNA polymerase as part of their mechanisms of transcription activation. In support of this hypothesis, our lab previously identified an interaction between RhaS residue D 241 and σ 70 residue R 599. In the present study, we first identified two positively charged amino acids in σ 70, K 593 and R 599, and three negatively charged amino acids in RhaR, D 276, <b>E</b> <b>284,</b> and D 285, that were important for RhaR-mediated transcription activation of the rhaSR operon.

40|$|Two {{homologous}} GTPases (guanine-triphosphatases) in {{the signal}} recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR) use their cumulative energy during GTP (guanine-triphosphate) hydrolysis {{to control the}} co-translational protein targeting process. Distinct from classical GTPases, which rely on external factors to hydrolyze GTP, SRP GTPases stimulate one another's activity in a self-sufficient manner upon SRP-SR complex association. Although both ground-state and putative transition-state GTP analogs {{have been used to}} recapitulate the state of GTPase activation, the underlying mechanism of the activated state still remains elusive. In particular, several residues that were placed in pending positions {{have been shown to be}} important to GTP hydrolysis in biochemical studies. Here, we examined the stability and dynamics of three interaction networks involving these residues and discovered that they contribute to the GTPase activation via well-tuned conformational changes. The crystallographically identified pending residues Ffh:R 191 /FtsY:R 195 undergo extensive conformational rearrangements to form persisted interactions with FtsY: <b>E</b> <b>284</b> /Ffh:E 274, explaining the biochemically observed defective effect of R 191 mutant to the activation of both GTPases. In addition, the side chain of FtsY:R 142, one of the most important catalytic residues, rotates to an extended conformation that could more efficiently maintain the electrostatic balance for GTP hydrolysis. Finally, the invariant residues Ffh: G 190 and FtsY:G 194, instead of the supposed auxiliary water molecules, are proposed to stabilize the nucleophilic waters during GTPase activation. In complementary to experimental observations, these findings suggest a more favorable interaction model for SRP GTPase activation and would thus benefit to our understanding of how SRP GTPases regulate the protein targeting pathway.

Two mutations (R 557 X and H 160 FsX 173) were predicted to generate short truncated proteins; two mutations (<b>E</b> <b>284</b> K and Y 482 C) were located in the first extracellular loop and two (R 1901 S and Q 2196 H) in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ABCA 1. Two subjects found to be compound heterozygotes for ABCA 1 mutations did not have overt clinical manifestations of TD. Three subjects, all with premature coronary artery disease (pCAD), had a combination of genetic defects. Besides being heterozygotes for ABCA 1 mutations, two of them were also carriers of the R 3500 Q substitution in apolipoprotein B and the third was a carrier of N 291 S substitution in lipoprotein lipase. By extending family studies we identified 17 heterozygotes for ABCA 1 mutations. Plasma HDL-C and Apo A-I values in these subjects were 38. 3 and 36. 9 % lower than in unaffected family members and similar to the values found in heterozygotes for Apo A-I gene mutations which prevent Apo A-I synthesis.

Recent studies on FXIII {{indicate that the}} impact of the FXIII 34 Leu genotype on fibrin structure and fibrinolysis is affected by fibrinogen concentration. Therefore, we reinvestigated the association between fibrinogen concentrations and FXIII Val 34 Leu with early RPL. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, we enrolled 49 women with a history of two consecutive or three to six nonconsecutive pregnancy losses between the 8 th and 12 th week of gestation and 48 healthy controls. The risk for RPL in carriers of FXIII 34 Leu at fibrinogen levels above or below the median and first tertile of controls was evaluated. Results: In carriers of the 34 Leu allele, fibrinogen levels below the median (i. e., ≤ 300 mg/dl) and the first tertile (i. <b>e.,</b> ≤ <b>284</b> mg/dl) of controls were associated with an increased risk for RPL [(2. 9 (1. 1 - 7. 7), 3. 9 (1. 0 - 15. 0) ]. Conclusions: The FXIII Val 34 Leu polymorphism may be associated with the development of early RPL in association with fibrinogen concentrations. At fibrinogen levels in the low normal range, FXIII 34 Leu may modify fibrin structure toward an increased resistance to fibrinolysis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Passage in fetal rhesus lung (FRhL) cells {{led to the}} emergence of a small-plaque virus containing a single Met→Lys amino acid mutation at E 279, reverting this residue from the SA 14 - 14 - 2 to the wild-type amino acid. A similar virus was also constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (J. Arroyo, F. Guirakhoo, S. Fenner, Z. -X. Zhang, T. P. Monath, and T. J. Chambers, J. Virol. 75 : 934 - 942, 2001). The E 279 mutation is located in a beta-sheet in the hinge region of the E protein that is responsible for a pH-dependent conformational change during virus penetration from the endosome into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. In independent transfection-passage studies with FRhL or Vero cells, mutations appeared most frequently in hinge 4 (bounded by amino acids E 266 to <b>E</b> <b>284),</b> reflecting genomic instability in this functionally important region. The E 279 reversion caused a significant increase in neurovirulence as determined by the 50 % lethal dose and survival distribution in suckling mice and by histopathology in rhesus monkeys. Based on sensitivity and comparability of results with those for monkeys, the suckling mouse is an appropriate host for safety testing of flavivirus vaccine candidates for neurotropism. After intracerebral inoculation, the E 279 Lys virus was restricted with respect to extraneural replication in monkeys, as viremia and antibody levels (markers of viscerotropism) were significantly reduced compared to those for the E 279 Met virus. These results are consistent with the observation that empirically derived vaccines developed by mouse brain passage of dengue and YF viruses have increased neurovirulence for mice but reduced viscerotropism for humans...|$|E

The present study focused on studying the baseline characteristics and psychosocial profile of at-risk individuals undertaking genetic counselling and testing for hboc among Southern Chinese females residing in Hong Kong. METHODS: Hong Kong Chinese females who met the selection criterion were offered free genetic counselling and testing service sponsored by The Hong Kong Hereditary Breast Cancer Family Registry. They were surveyed in a face-to-face interview at a multidisciplinary breast clinic before they received pre-testing genetic counselling consultation. Sociodemographic information, medical history, pre-testing knowledge on hboc, coping style, and mood were also obtained. RESULTS: The study recruited 142 females (88. 7 % with cancer history). Better pre-testing baseline knowledge on HBOC {{was significantly associated with}} higher education level (p < 0. 001) and younger age (p < 0. 001). Cancer survivors were more resourceful in coping when facing adversities in life (p < 0. 05). A minority of participants (9. 9 %) showed considerable level of depressive mood even at the pre-testing stage (all of them with cancer history). However, cancer survivors anticipated greater positive changes and posttraumatic growth if they proved to be mutation-carriers (p < 0. 05) and more likely to believe that a negative result will bring relief (p < 0. 05) if to be compared with those without cancer history. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that high-risk Hong Kong Chinese females with cancer history, higher education level, and younger age were more receptive to breast cancer risk assessment. Although enduring a relatively higher level of distress if to be compared with their non-cancer counterparts, cancer survivors appeared to be more resourceful in coping methods when facing life adversities and their self-perceived resilience was higher in terms of facing a possible positive genetic testing result. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

Factors of risk more cited were hypertension identified by 416 [42. 0 %] and hyperlipidemia 284 [28. 7 %]. The most remembered symptoms were headache 277 [28. 0 %] and hemiplegia 219 [22. 1 %]. 375 (37. 8 %) respondents were unable to identify any risk factors and and 410 (41. 4 %) any symptom. The lack of knowledge {{of the population}} of Teresina in relation to stroke reflects the need for intervention through public and professional educational campaigns.

OBJETIVO: A doença de Chagas é um preditor de mau prognóstico em pacientes com insuficiência cardíaca (IC) crônica. O objetivo deste estudo é analisar se ela também prediz pior evolução para pacientes agudamente descompensados. MÉTODOS: Estudamos 417 pacientes hospitalizados por IC descompensada. A idade média foi de 51, 8 anos, sendo 291 (69, 8 %) homens. Os pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos: 133 (31, 9 %) chagásicos (CH) <b>e</b> <b>284</b> com outras etiologias. Num subgrupo de 63 pacientes (15, 1 % com doença de Chagas), dosaram-se citocinas e noradrenalina. RESULTADOS: Na internação, 24, 6 % necessitaram de inotrópicos, e em um ano a mortalidade foi de 54, 7 %. Os CH apresentaram maior mortalidade (69, 2 % vs. 47, 9 %, p BACKGROUND: Heart {{failure is}} a highly {{prevalent}} disease, the prognosis of which depends on different predictive factors. OBJECTIVE: Chagas disease is a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate whether this condition also predicts poor outcome in acutely decompensated patients. METHODS: Four hundred and seventeen patients admitted for decompensated heart failure were studied. Mean age was 51. 8 years, and 291 (69. 8 %) were male. They were divided into two groups: 133 (31. 9 %) patients with Chagas heart disease (CH) and 284 patients with heart failure of other etiologies. Cytokine and norepinephrine plasma levels were measured in a subgroup of 63 patients (15. 1 % with Chagas disease). RESULTS: At admission, 24. 6 % of the patients needed inotropic support, and one-year mortality was 54. 7 %. Mortality rates were higher in the CH group (69. 2 % vs. 47. 9 %, p < 0. 001). When data were compared, patients with Chagas disease were younger (47. 6 vs. 53. 8 years, p < 0. 001) and, on average, showed lower systolic blood pressure (96. 7 vs. 111. 2 mmHg, p < 0, 001), ejection fraction (32. 7 vs. 36. 4 %, p < 0. 001), and serum Na (134. 6 vs. 136. 0, p = 0. 026), in addition to higher TNF-&# 945; levels (33. 3 vs. 14. 8, p = 0. 001). The presence of hypotension requiring inotropic support, left ventricular (LV) diastolic diameter, renal function findings, and interleukin- 6 and norepinephrine plasma levels did not differ between both groups. CONCLUSION: Chagas disease patients admitted with decompensated heart failure had worse prognoses than patients with heart failure of other etiologies. This may be owing to a greater degree of cardiac impairment (lower ejection fraction) and hemodynamic instability (lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate), increased activation of the renin-angiotensin system (lower sodium), and increased cytokine levels (TNF-&# 945;) ...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant protein {{production}} (RPP) in Escherichia coli {{benefits from}} {{a long history of}} research which has facilitated the development of a plethora of strains and vectors suited to RPP applications. The identification and functional transfer to E. coli of an N-linked protein glycosylation system, pgl, from Campylobacter jejuni has recently enabled investigation of novel glycoprotein-based applications previously not possible in the organism. To date, a number of glyco-conjugate vaccines have been successfully produced in E. coli, and work towards âhumanisationâ of the characteristic C. jejuni glycan chain is continuing in order to produce glycoproteins suited to in vivo applications. Meanwhile, the C. jejuni glycan chain has been successfully attached to single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) to mediate their covalent attachment to functionalised surfaces for improved immunosensor development. In this study, the pgl system was further engineered by mutagenic analysis of the glycosyltransferase PglJ â which is responsible for addition of the third sugar of the heptasaccharide N-glycan chain. Mutagenesis of E 276 and <b>E</b> <b>284</b> of the functionally important EX 7 E motif resulted in glycoprofiles indicating that glycan chain extension was not completely eliminated in either glycovariant, in contrast to published results with homologous glycosyltransferase enzymes. Inactivation of PglJ by termination of translation or by creation of a E 276 A/E 284 A double mutant completely eliminated glycosyltransferase activity of PglJ. Termination of translation of PglH, which further extends the glycan chain produced by PglJ, was also carried out to confirm the partial activity of the PglJ single-site mutants. Disaccharide-linked scFvs produced in E. coli pglJ- cells were compared to fully (heptasaccharide-containing) -glycosylated and unglycosylated scFvs in surface attachment and antigen-binding studies. Adsorption of all scFvs onto polystyrene occurred at similar rates whereas both glycosylated protein variants displayed a specific and more rapid attachment (up to five-fold greater coating) to amine-functionalised surfaces than their unglycosylated counterpart. Upon adsorption, the three scFv variants exhibited similar antigen binding while the covalently attached, glycosylated scFvs displayed up to eight-fold higher antigen binding than the unglycosylated scFvs. This demonstrated the potential application of the truncated glycan in protein immobilisation, while minimising its immunogenicity and potential susceptibility of the sugar chain to degradation by glycosidase enzymes in vivo. Comparison of adsorption and covalent attachment of scFvs to functionalised cardiovascular stent materials confirmed the efficacy of immobilising scFvs for such applications via the shortened glycan tag. Meanwhile, the use of atomic force microscopy provided insight into the spatial positioning and distribution of covalently-immobilised scFvs on the stent material. A lectin array analysis was carried out to query glycovariants produced by E. coli cells harbouring the engineered C. jejuni pgl constructs against a broad panel of carbohydrate-binding lectins. This rapid and multivariate typing investigation identified SBA as a candidate lectin that was used to distinguish between the glycovariant sequences in western blots. Efforts to extend the C. jejuni-pgl-encoded glycan chain through the action of the CgtB enzyme derived from the LOS locus of C. jejuni, identified a number of bottlenecks in cgtB expression in E. coli and P. pastoris. Potential solutions to express the relevant glycosyltransferases and mediate terminal capping of E. coli-produced glycoproteins with sialic acids were established for future investigations. These results illustrate the potential of expression of recombinant glycoproteins and their glycan engineering in E. coli in fundamental studies of glycosyltransferase enzymes and in biotechnological applications. Bioconjugates that exhibit improved immobilisation and antigen binding over their absorbed, non-glycosylated counterparts can be readily produced via the incorporation of a minimal recombinant tag. The study also establishes characterisation approaches to detect and analyse subtle glycan changes in recombinant glycoproteins. The C. jejuni pgl glycosylation system utilised in this work will likely see increased adoption and continued engineering in RPP in the near future and this study contributes to its ongoing adaptation for applications in fields such as diagnostics and therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Em sistemas agrícolas em que se aplica lodo de esgoto, devem ser consideradas as necessidades de N das plantas e, simultaneamente, evitar a geração de excesso de nitrato, poluente potencial de águas subsuperficiais. Para isso, na determinação das quantidades máximas a serem aplicadas em determinado cultivo, devem-se conhecer algumas propriedades do lodo de esgoto e do solo. Uma delas é a fração de mineralização de compostos nitrogenados orgânicos (FMN) contidos nos resíduos que serão mineralizados durante o ciclo da cultura. Essa quantidade, somada ao N na forma mineral contido no lodo, fornece a quantidade de N do lodo de esgoto que ficará disponível durante a safra. Este trabalho teve como objetivo determinar se as aplicações anteriores de lodo de esgoto, feitas em um Latossolo, alteram a FMN do resíduo recentemente aplicado. O solo foi previamente tratado, em quatro cultivos sucessivos de milho, com quatro doses e dois tipos de lodo de esgoto, um de origem urbana (Franca, SP) e outro de origem urbano-industrial (Barueri, SP). O experimento de mineralização foi instalado em laboratório, com delineamento {{experimental}} em blocos casualizados e três repetições, realizado durante 15 semanas. As doses dos lodos de esgoto estudadas, na quinta aplicação, corresponderam a 160, 320, 640 e 1. 280 mg kg- 1 de N orgânico. Em sete épocas, foram determinados o pH e os teores de N nas formas amoniacal e nítrica. A FMN foi calculada com os dados obtidos para a mineralização líquida medida 105 dias após o início da incubação. Os comportamentos dos dois tipos de lodo foram similares, com taxa de mineralização inicial elevada. Os teores de amônio mantiveram-se baixos logo após o início da incubação até o final, com aumento linear nos teores de nitrato. Houve maior acúmulo de nitrato para as maiores doses aplicadas. O potencial de mineralização dos tratamentos, estimado pelo modelo exponencial simples, variou entre 58 <b>e</b> <b>284</b> mg kg- 1 de N. Não houve efeito das quantidades de resíduos previamente aplicadas ao Latossolo sobre a fração de mineralização do N orgânico recentemente aplicado via lodo de esgoto, com confiabilidade de 95 %. Os resultados mostraram que, em reaplicações na mesma área, as doses de lodo de esgoto devem ser menores do que as doses calculadas para aplicação única, devido ao N residual acumulado no solo, tanto na forma orgânica quanto inorgânica. In agricultural systems {{treated with}} sewage sludge, the management ought {{to seek an}} adequate N supply to plants, while avoiding nitrate enrichment because of its potential to pollute subsurface water bodies. Thus, when determining the maximum amounts {{to be applied to}} a specific crop, some sewage sludge and soil properties should be known. One is the fraction of organic N of the waste that will be mineralized (NMF) during the crop cycle. This quantity, combined with mineral N in the sludge, determines the amount of N in sewage sludge that will be available during the growing season. This study aimed to determine whether previous applications of sewage sludge affect the NMF of the residue recently applied to a Dark Red Dystroferric Latosol (Oxisol). The soil had been previously treated in four successive maize crops, with four rates and two types of sewage sludge, one of urban origin (Franca, SP) and the other from urban-industrial sources (Barueri, SP). The study of N mineralization was installed in laboratory in a randomized blocks design with three replications and lasted 15 weeks. In the fifth application, sewage sludge doses of equivalent to 160, 320, 640, and 1, 280 mg kg- 1 organic N were studied. On seven dates, the pH and the ammonium-N and nitrate-N concentration were determined. The NMF was calculated with data obtained for the net mineralization measured 105 days after the start of incubation. The performance of the two sludge types was similar, with a high initial mineralization rate. The ammonium levels remained low after the start until the end of incubation and there was a linear increase in nitrate levels during the same period. Nitrate accumulation peaked at the highest sewage sludge dose applied. The potential for mineralization, estimated by the simple exponential model, varied from 58 to 284 mg kg- 1 N. No effect of previously applied waste on the mineralization fraction of recently applied organic N by sewage sludge to the Oxisol was observed, with a reliability of 95 %. Results showed that for reapplications to the same area, sewage sludge rates must be lower than the doses calculated for a single application, due to accumulations of organic and inorganic-N in the soil...|$|E

We then performed etiological and phylogenetic analyses to better understand its molecular characterization and phylogenetic pattern, and also to aid in further evaluating its persistence in Southeast Asia. Methods: By using this modified procedure, we determined {{for the first time}} the complete genome sequence of the chikungunya virus strain, Zhejiang/chik-sy/ 2012, isolated in 2012 from a patient in Zhejiang, China. Sequence analyses revealed that this positive single strand of RNA is 12, 017 bp long. We found no single amino acid mutation in A 226 V, D <b>284</b> <b>E</b> and A 316 V. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our strain shared the greatest homology with a strain isolated in Taiwan, which was derived from a strain from Indonesia.

Incomplete endosperm modification during malting results in residual β-glucan that can contribute to increased wort viscosity and beer chill haze. Four newly identified forms of EI and EII and the reference enzymes EI-a and EII-a were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were characterized for enzyme kinetics and thermostability. EI and EII variants that exhibited higher residual β-glucanase activity than EI-a and EII-a after heat treatment also exhibited increased substrate affinity and decreased turnover rates. The novel EII-l form exhibited significantly increased thermostability compared with the reference EII-a when activity was measured at elevated temperature. EII-l exhibited a T 50 value, which indicates the temperature at which 50 % of β-glucanase activity remains, 1. 3 °C {{higher than that of}} EII-a. The irreversible thermal inactivation difference between EII-a and EII-l after 5 min of heat treatment at 56 °C was 11. 9 %. The functional significance of the three amino acid differences between EII-a and EII-l was examined by making combinatorial mutations in EII-a using site-directed mutagenesis.

40|$|Micromachined needles {{have been}} shown to {{successfully}} transport biological molecules into the body with minimal invasiveness and pain, following the insertion of needles into the skin. The aim of this research is to demonstrate that micromachined hollow polymer needle arrays fabricated using UV lithography into micromolds, a potential batch-manufacturable process, can exhibit comparable insertion and injection performance to conventional hypodermic needles for drug delivery into skin. 	A dual-exposure-and-single-development process flow is proposed for the above-mentioned UV lithography into micromolds approach to construct a pyramidal-tip hollow microneedle array with an integral baseplate and fluidic manifold. The developed process ultimately resulted in the ability to fabricate a 10 × 10 array of hollow SU- 8 microneedles measuring 825 μm in height, 400 μm in width, and possessing a lumen of 120 μm in diameter. The tip diameter of the microneedles ranges from 15 μm to 25 μm. The insertion force of single needles characterized using excised porcine skin as a substrate is 2. 4 ± 1. 2 N. Nevertheless, the high insertion force of 2. 4 N per needle may cause a significant concern when a large number of needles are required to insert into skin for drug delivery. 	Conventional hypodermic needles have two key structural characteristics: a sharp beveled tip and a large side-terminated lumen. Integration of these two key characteristics of hypodermic needles into microneedle design can potentially enhance microneedle performance. To reduce the insertion force and to incorporate the two key characteristics of hypodermic needles into the design of microneedles, a new needle tip design, namely the hypodermic-needle-like design, is presented. A 6 × 6 array of hypodermic-needle-like microneedles of 1 mm in height, approximate 350 μm in width, and with a lumen of 150 μm in diameter is demonstrated with successful insertion of the needle array into skin and an 85 % lumen openness yield. The insertion force is significantly reduced by an order of magnitude with the new needle tip design and is 0. 275 ± 0. 113 N per needle, comparable to that of hypodermic needles, i. <b>e.,</b> 0. <b>284</b> ± 0. 059 N.

There were no significant differences in MCP- 1 2518 A, G allele between black and white subjects. White subjects tended to have borderline significantly higher mean serum of vitamin D (58. 4 nmol/l) than black subjects (37. 7 nmol/l). The capacities of skin to synthesize vitamin D Post-UVB were significantly higher in whites than in black subjects. Conclusions: Black skin people had consistently higher susceptibility to infection by M. tuberculosis than are whites skin peoples.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{chikungunya}} virus outbreak of unprecedented magnitude is currently ongoing in Indian Ocean territories. In Réunion Island, this alphavirus has already infected {{about one-third of}} the human population. The main clinical symptom of the disease is a painful and invalidating poly-arthralgia. Besides the arthralgic form, 123 patients with a confirmed chikungunya infection have developed severe clinical signs, i. e., neurological signs or fulminant hepatitis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We report the nearly complete genome sequence of six selected viral isolates (isolated from five sera and one cerebrospinal fluid), along with partial sequences of glycoprotein E 1 from a total of 127 patients from Réunion, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Mayotte islands. Our results indicate that the outbreak was initiated by a strain related to East-African isolates, from which viral variants have evolved following a traceable microevolution history. Unique molecular features of the outbreak isolates were identified. Notably, in the region coding for the non-structural proteins, ten amino acid changes were found, four of which were located in alphavirus-conserved positions of nsP 2 (which contains helicase, protease, and RNA triphosphatase activities) and of the polymerase nsP 4. The sole isolate obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid showed unique changes in nsP 1 (T 301 I), nsP 2 (Y 642 N), and nsP 3 (E 460 deletion), not obtained from isolates from sera. In the structural proteins region, two noteworthy changes (A 226 V and D <b>284</b> <b>E)</b> were observed in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E 1. Homology 3 D modelling allowed mapping of these two changes to regions that are important for membrane fusion and virion assembly. Change E 1 -A 226 V was absent in the initial strains but was observed in > 90 % of subsequent viral sequences from Réunion, denoting evolutionary success possibly due to adaptation to the mosquito vector.

40|$|The α-helical coiled-coil motif is {{characterized}} by a heptad repeat pattern (abcdefg) n in which residues a and d form the hydrophobic core. Long coiled-coils (<b>e.</b> g., tropomyosin, <b>284</b> residues per polypeptide chain) typically do not have a continuous hydrophobic core of stabilizing residues, but rather one that consists of alternating clusters of stabilizing and destabilizing residues. We have arbitrarily defined a cluster as a minimum of three consecutive stabilizing or destabilizing residues in the hydrophobic core. We report here on a series of two-stranded, disulfide-bridged parallel α-helical coiled-coils that contain a central cassette of three consecutive hydrophobic core positions (d, a, and d) with a destabilizing cluster of three consecutive Ala residues in the hydrophobic core {{on each side of the}} cassette. The effect of adding one to three stabilizing hydrophobes in these positions (Leu or Ile; denoted as •) was investigated. Alanine residues (denoted as ○) are used to represent destabilizing residues. The peptide with three Ala residues in the d a d cassette positions (○○○) was among the least stable coiled-coil (Tm = 39. 3 °C and Urea 1 / 2 = 1. 9 M). Surprisingly, the addition of one stabilizing hydrophobe (Leu) to the cassette or two stabilizing hydrophobes (Leu), still interspersed by an Ala in the cassette (•○•), also did not lead to any gain in stability. However, peptides with two adjacent hydrophobes in the cassette (••○) (○••) did show a gain in stability of 0. 9 kcal/mole over the peptide with two interspersed hydrophobes (•○•). Because the latter three peptides have the same inherent hydrophobicity, the juxtaposition of stabilizing hydrophobes leads to a synergistic effect, and thus a clustering effect. The addition of a third stabilizing hydrophobe to the cassette (•••) resulted in a further synergistic gain in stability of 1. 7 kcal/mole (Tm = 54. 1 °C and Urea 1 / 2 = 3. 3 M). Therefore, the role of hydrophobicity in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils is extremely context dependent and clustering is an important aspect of protein folding and stability...|$|R

In this context, we have studied the role of R 284 K as a secondary mutation associated with mutations of the TAM 1 complex. Results: The cross-sectional study carried out with > 200 HIV- 1 genotypes showed that virological failure to tenofovir/emtricitabine was strongly associated with the presence of M 184 V (P < 10 - 10) and TAMs (P < 10 - 3), while K 65 R was relatively uncommon in previously-treated patients failing antiretroviral therapy. Clusters of mutations were identified, and among them, the TAM 1 complex showed the highest correlation coefficients. Covariation of TAM 1 mutations and V 118 I, V 179 I, M 184 V and R 284 K was observed. Virological studies showed that the combination of R 284 K with TAM 1 mutations confers a fitness advantage in the presence of zidovudine or tenofovir. Studies with recombinant HIV- 1 RTs showed that when associated with TAM 1 mutations, R 284 K had a minimal impact on zidovudine or tenofovir inhibition, and in their ability to excise the inhibitors from blocked DNA primers. However, the mutant RT M 41 L/L 210 W/T 215 Y/R 284 K showed an increased catalytic rate for nucleotide incorporation and a higher RNase H activity in comparison with WT and mutant M 41 L/L 210 W/T 215 Y RTs. These effects were consistent with its enhanced chain-terminated primer rescue on DNA/DNA template-primers, but not on RNA/DNA complexes, and can explain the higher fitness of HIV- 1 having TAM 1 /R 284 K mutations. Conclusions: Our study shows the association of R 284 K and TAM 1 mutations in individuals failing therapy with tenofovir/emtricitabine, and unveils a novel mechanism by which secondary mutations are selected in the context of drug-resistance mutations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There {{are five}} melanocortin receptors (MC 1 - 5) : these are G-protein-coupled receptors {{expressed}} in {{the central nervous system}} and in peripheral tissues. MC 4 and MC 5 have roles in controlling appetite, immuno-modulation, exocrine function, erectile dysfunction and grooming behaviour 1. The melanocortin receptor accessory proteins (MRAP 1 and 2) influence MC receptor transport. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor for the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormones and adrenocorticotrophic hormone, which bind to MC 4 and MC 5 receptors 1. Aims: 1. To characterise MC 4, MC 5 and MRAP 1 distribution in the reproductive tissues of female mice (hypothalamus, pituitary gland, uterus and ovary). 2. To investigate if MC 4, MC 5 and MRAP 1 expression changes with age or pregnancy. Method: Virgin C 57 BL/ 6 female mice aged 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 weeks and pregnant (aged 9 weeks plus 13 days post coitus) were sacrificed by schedule 1. Tissue RNA was extracted by TRIzol/RNA cleanup (Qiagen) and cDNA synthesised using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Thermoscientific). Appropriate reference genes were determined using GeNorm selection kit and software (Primerdesign; Biogazelle respectively). The following genes were the most stable and used in SYBRgreen RTqPCR according to precisionPLUS master mix protocol (Primerdesign for normalisation 2 of MC 4, MC 5 and MRAP 1 expression: Qiagen primers).

Pregnancy did not affect either MC 4 or MC 5 expression. MRAP 1 was expressed in the hypothalamus, ovary and pituitary and was unaffected by age. MRAP 1 expression was greater in the ovary and decreased in the hypothalamus of pregnant compared to non-pregnant mice (n= 3, p= 0. 0004). Conclusion: The role of the two MC {{in the development of the}} hypothalamus and uterus in young mice requires further investigation. The changes in MRAP 1 expression with pregnancy could result in changes in the signalling ability of both MC 4 and MC 5 since MRAP 1 has been shown to alter cAMP production resulting from activation of these two receptors in vitro 3.
