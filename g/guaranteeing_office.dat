Like many other nations, the Dutch require the registration and use of Responsibility Marks since 1797. The Dutch also use a date letter code. After the French defeat at Leipzig 1813 the History of the Netherlands was established. William VI, prince of Orange (known in Dutch as Willem Frederik), was proclaimed the sovereign. On March 15, 1815, {{with the support of the}} powers gathered at the Congress of Vienna, William proclaimed himself King William I of the Netherlands. He was also made grand duke of Luxembourg. The two countries remained separate despite sharing a common monarch. For our purposes, he retained much of the French legislation, including the precious metal guarantee law of November 9, 1787. On December 26, 1813 the precious metal laws were however, modified and the French hallmarks, the Gaul cockerels were replaced with Dutch lions. The existing <b>guarantee</b> <b>offices</b> were reopened after re-staffing and the production of the new hallmark dies. Willem abdicated in 1840. As of January 1, 1853 the out-of-date French guarantee law was replaced by a new Dutch law.

50|$|Based {{upon the}} Québec civil code and the Loi sur la {{protection}} du consommateur every merchant {{is responsible to}} uphold the legal guarantee of a product.

50|$|The British {{government}} {{appointed the}} Hilton Young Commission {{on the possible}} closer union of the British territories in East and Central Africa in 1927.

The minority report also suggested the partition of Northern Rhodesia, with its central area joining Southern Rhodesia: this was opposed by the British government. Even before the Commission's report was published, there were discussions between representatives of the settlers in Northern Rhodesia and the Southern Rhodesian government in 1928 on the terms of an amalgamation of the two Rhodesias.
