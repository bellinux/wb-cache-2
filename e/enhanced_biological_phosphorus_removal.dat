Formation of biofilms on the membrane surface is the suggested cause, yet little is known of the composition or dynamics of the microbial community responsible. To gain an insight into this important question, we applied 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with a curated taxonomy and fluorescent in situ hybridization to monitor the community of a pilot-scale MBR carrying out <b>enhanced</b> <b>biological</b> nitrogen and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> with municipal wastewater. In order to track {{the dynamics of the}} fouling process, we concurrently investigated the communities of the biofilm, MBR bulk sludge, and the conventional activated sludge system used to seed the MBR system over several weeks from start-up. As the biofilm matured the initially abundant betaproteobacterial genera Limnohabitans, Hydrogenophaga and Malikia were succeeded by filamentous Chloroflexi and Gordonia as the abundant species. This study indicates that, although putative pioneer species appear, the biofilm became increasingly similar to the bulk community with time.

5000|$|Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) are a {{group of}} {{bacteria}} that, under certain conditions, facilitate the removal of large amounts of phosphorus from wastewater in a process, called <b>enhanced</b> <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> (EBPR). PAOs accomplish this removal of phosphate by accumulating it within their cells as polyphosphate.PAOs {{are by no means}} the only bacteria that can accumulate polyphosphate within their cells and in fact, the production of polyphosphate is a widespread ability among bacteria. However, the PAOs have many characteristics that other organisms that accumulate polyphosphate do not have, that make them amenable to use in wastewater treatment. Specifically, this is the ability to consume simple carbon compounds (energy source) without the presence of an external electron acceptor (such as nitrate or oxygen) by generating energy from internally stored polyphosphate and glycogen. [...] Most other bacteria cannot consume under these conditions and therefore PAOs gain a selective advantage within the mixed microbial community present in the activated sludge. Therefore, wastewater treatment plants that operate for <b>enhanced</b> <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> have an anaerobic tank (where there is no nitrate or oxygen present as external electron acceptor) prior to the other tanks to give PAOs preferential access to the simple carbon compounds in the wastewater that is influent to the plant.|$|E
50|$|Sewage {{treatment}} plants {{that have an}} <b>enhanced</b> <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> step produce a sewage sludge that is rich in phosphorus.

This includes the extraction of phosphorus rich materials such as struvite from waste processing plants. The struvite can be made by adding magnesium to the waste. Some companies such as Ostara in Canada and NuReSys in Belgium are already using this technique to recover phosphate. Ostara has eight operating plants worldwide.|$|E

A pilot plant at the Sjölunda wastewater treatment plant in Malmö, Sweden, has formed the basis for the investigations.

40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{development}} and the in silico evaluation of a novel control strategy aiming at successful <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> in a wastewater treatment plant operating in an A 2 /O configuration with carbon-limited influent. The principle of this novel approach is that the phosphorus in the effluent can be controlled with the nitrate setpoint in the anoxic reactor as manipulated variable. The theoretical background behind this control strategy is that reducing nitrate entrance to the anoxic reactor would result in more organic matter available for <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal.</b> Thus, <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> would be enhanced {{at the expense of}} increasing nitrate in the effluent (but always below legal limits). The work shows the control development, tuning and performance in comparison to open-loop conditions and to two other conventional control strategies for <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> based on organic matter and metal addition. It is shown that the novel proposed strategy achieves positive nutrient removal results with similar operational costs to the other control strategies and open-loop operation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractExcessive {{phosphorus}} {{can cause}} eutrophication in water bodies {{and needs to}} be reduced in most wastewaters before being discharged into receiving waters. The excess <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> (EBPR) process {{has been shown to be}} an economical and environmentally compatible method for reducing phosphorus from wastewaters. Despite the complexity of EBPR mechanisms, appropriately designed and operated treatment plants can easily achieve <b>phosphorus</b> (P) <b>removal</b> as long as EBPR-available organic substrates such as short chain volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and an aerobic–anaerobic (respectively) reactor configuration are provided. Some factors and operating conditions, adversely affect the performance of EBPR plants. Available design and research information for the EBPR process were directly related to organic strength, solids and phosphorus content in wastewater. The success of excess <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> (EBPR) process is largely dependent on the characteristics of organic carbon present in wastewater. The COD and BOD 5 content of wastewater will also determine whether a <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> EBPR system is required.

40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> was {{studied in}} two {{full-scale}} waste stabilisation ponds (WSP). Luxury uptake by microalgae was confirmed to occur {{and in one}} pond the biomass contained almost four times the phosphorus required by microalgae for normal metabolism. However, the phosphorus content within the biomass was variable. This finding means that assumptions made in prior publications on modelling of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> in WSP are questionable. While fluctuations in microalgal growth causes variation in many water quality parameters, this further variation in luxury uptake explains {{the high degree of}} variability in <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> commonly reported in the literature. To achieve effective <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> high levels of both luxury uptake and microalgal concentration are needed. The findings of this work show that while high levels of these parameters did occur at times in the WSP monitored, they did not occur simultaneously. This is explained because accumulated phosphorus is subsequently consumed during rapid growth of biomass resulting in a high biomass concentration with a low phosphorus content. Previous laboratory research has allowed a number of key considerations to be proposed to optimise both luxury uptake and biomass concentration. Now that is has been shown that high levels of biomass concentration and luxury uptake can occur in the field {{it may be possible to}} redesign WSP to optimise these parameters. © IWA Publishing 2011...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 86 - 88. This {{investigation}} set out {{to establish}} in what degree the <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> characteristics of the Modified Activated Sludge Process could be enhanced by the in-plant addition of iron salts. The motivation for the investigation was: 1. Due {{to the lack of}} understanding of the exact pre-requisites for inducing excess <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> (luxury uptake), such removal could not always be guaranteed in many activated sludge plants, even in those designed in accordance with the best available knowledge for inducing this removal mechanism. 2. There was evidence to suggest that even where excess <b>biological</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> took place, the removal was limited by the process and the sewage characteristics. As a result, in plants where the specified <b>phosphorus</b> <b>removal</b> exceeded the possible biological removal, additional or alternative methods of removal had to be sought. In view of these factors it was concluded that only by chemical addition to the process, could a specified effluent quality be guaranteed. A laboratory scale Modified Activated Sludge (or Phoredox) Process, similar to that proposed by McLaren and Wood (1976), but without a secondary anoxic zone was set up and the process was evaluated with and without in-plant iron salt addition. Problems were encountered in predicting the biological removal as the removal tended to differ from one sewage batch to another, making it difficult to determine accurately the efficiency of the iron salt addition...|$|R
