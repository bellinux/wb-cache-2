40|$|The {{possibilities}} for {{wind energy production}} on the Kola peninsula in north-western Russia were studied in an extensive feasibility study. The Kola peninsula constitutes the Murmansk oblast, i. e. a region with some autonomous features, within the Russian federation. The wind resources {{in the region are}} very good, with annual mean speeds up to 10 m/s on the coast of the Barents Sea. A wind atlas is produced according to the methodology developed at Risø National Laboratories in Denmark and makes it possible to do reliable wind resource as-sessments and production estimates at prospective sites. There are more than 30 civil and military settlements located off the common electrical network. In these settlements electricity needs are currently supplied mostly by autonomous <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> Due to long distances and difficult access transport of fuel is costly and thus power prices are high.

50|$|The {{position}} is that as per available records, the first <b>diesel</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> was established in Delhi in the year 1905 when a private English Company by name M/s. John Fleming was given permission to generate electricity under {{the provisions of the}} Indian Electricity Act 1903. The above-mentioned Company was given the responsibility both of generation and distribution of power in a limited manner. That Company after obtaining license under the provisions of Electricity Act 1903 had set up a small 2 MW Diesel set at Lahori Gate in Old Delhi. Later on, this very Company was converted as Delhi Electricity Supply and Traction Company. In the Year 1911, the power generation was augmented by Steam Generation Station. In the year 1932, the management of Central Power House was handed over to New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC). In the field of power generation and distribution, a major break through was achieved in 1939 when Delhi Central Electricity Power Authority (DCEPA) was established. This Company was responsible for the supply of power to the areas covered by Local Bodies, namely, the Municipal Committees of Delhi, West Delhi and South Delhi, the Notified Area Committees of Red Fort, Civil Lines, Mehrauli, Najafgarh, and the District Board of Delhi. The supply of electricity to the Municipal Committees of Delhi-Shahdara and the Notified Area of Narela was done by different private agencies. In 1947 DCEPA took over a Private Limited Company by name Delhi electric Supply & traction Company Limited.|$|E
40|$|A {{promising}} way {{to increase}} the technical and economic characteristics of standalone power supply systems is to incorporate renewable energy installations in their structure. Photoelectric generators based on distributed sources are optimal technologies {{for the use of}} renewable energy sources in 0. 4 kV low-voltage power grid. The most common option is a hybrid system with photoelectric power stations (PES) incorporated into the local network of the <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> (DPS). Photoelectric stations meet all environmental requirements and can make a significant contribution to the electrification of remote settlements, tourist and agricultural field. This paper deals with stabilization of voltage value and reduction of losses of electric energy depending on the parameters of elements of power supply systems of radial type (0, 4 kV) with an installed capacity of up to 100 kW. The research has been conducted by simulating the operating modes of hybrid power systems of various configurations. To analyze the joint work of a photoelectric station with a <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> a mathematical model is created in the Simulink (SimPowerSystems) application of the MatLab R 2016 b program.

40|$|The Bubble-Greenhouse system {{combines}} the well established Seawater Greenhouse concept {{with a novel}} humidification-dehumidification (HD) process, based on the large air/water interface generated by bubbling air through a water filled column. Multistage bubble evaporators and multistage bubble condensers allow for effective recovery and reuse of latent heat via a heating/cooling circuit throughout all column stages. The system can operate with salinities of 5000 - 35, 000. ppm. Following the HD process, cooled vapour provides the tropical type greenhouse with a humid environment for selected crops. Additional condensation occurs along the greenhouse skin and is gravity-fed to drip line irrigation. Low grade energy options such as solar-thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geo-thermal and salinity-gradient solar ponds provide the energy for the Bubble-Greenhouse. Alternatively, waste heat from <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> nearby can provide cogeneration of electricity and bubble evaporator heat and pressure requirements. Crops grown inside a greenhouse demonstrate a strongly reduced water demand and the closed environment protects crops from insects and diseases. As the technology is conceptually simple to implement, it holds great potential for community participation, empowerment, skills development and capacity building of local people in remote locations...|$|R

5000|$|Drainage of a polder is {{performed}} by a pumping station or mill (gemaal in Dutch). Two were built for the Wieringermeer, the Leemans, a <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> <b>station,</b> near Den Oever and the Lely, an electrically powered one, near Medemblik. Different power systems {{were used in the}} stations as a safety mechanism. If one <b>station</b> lost <b>power,</b> the other one would still be able to keep the polder dry. The pumping mechanism itself was based on a variation of the Archimedes' screw, as designed by A. Baldwin Wood. The stations, completed in February 1930, managed to drain the polder after six months of continuous pumping. [...] "Drained" [...] in this context does not mean the land was wholly dry; extensive pools of shallow water still littered the muddy landscape. To make the soil usable it had to be further drained by a network of drainage canals. Small ditches were dug leading to larger watercourses, which in turn transported their water to the main drainage canals. These canals, dredged when the polder was still filled with water, conducted surplus water to the pumping stations. The resulting dehydration caused the former seabed to sink by over a metre in some places. Once the ground had settled, the smaller ditches were replaced with underground drainage tubes, which would be used for the normal drainage of the polder.|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} and energy parameters of Photovoltaic (PV) systems {{play a very}} important role when compared to conventional power systems. In the present paper, a typical PV-system is analyzed to its elements and an assessment of the material and energy requirements during the production procedures is attempted. A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is being performed on the production system of photovoltaics. Energy and environmental analyses are extended to the production of the primary energy carriers. This allows having a complete picture of the life cycle of all the PV-components described in the present study. Four different scenarios are examined in detail providing every possible aspect of scientific interest involving polycrystalline PV systems. In order to obtain concrete results from this study, the specific working tool used is the Eco-Indicator ’ 95 (1999) as being reliable and widely applied and accepted within LCA community. A process that relates inventory information with relevant concerns about natural resource usage and potential effects of environmental loadings is attempted. Large-scale PV-systems have many advantages in comparison with a conventional power system (e. g. <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> <b>station)</b> in electricity production. As a matter of fact, PV-systems become part of the environment and the ecosystems from the moment of their installation. Carbon Footprints of various PV-systems scenarios are greatly smaller than that of a <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> operation. Further technological improvements in PV module production and in the manufacture of Balance-of-System components, as well as extended use of renewable energy resources as primary energy resources could make Carbon Footprint of PV-systems even smaller. Extended operational period of time (O. P.
