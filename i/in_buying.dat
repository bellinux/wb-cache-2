5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested <b>in</b> <b>buying</b> both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help <b>in</b> <b>buying</b> the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E

5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector.

Britain's Alvis-Staussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible.

Italy, the Ottomans, and Greece were all reportedly interested <b>in</b> <b>buying</b> both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.
