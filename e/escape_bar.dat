Reading [...] Rabbi Yannai asked whether it was {{possible}} for a person of flesh and blood to escape from a government. Rather, Rabbi Yannai said that Pharaoh caught Moses and sentenced him to be beheaded. Just as the executioner brought down his sword, Moses' neck became like an ivory tower (as described in [...] ) and broke the sword. Rabbi Judah haNasi {{said in the}} name of Rabbi Evyasar that the sword flew off of Moses' neck and killed the executioner. The Gemara cited [...] to support this deduction, reading the words [...] "and delivered me" [...] as superfluous unless they were necessary to show that God saved Moses but not the executioner. Rabbi Berechyah cited the executioner's fate as an application of the proposition of [...] that a wicked ransoms a righteous one, and Rabbi Avun cited it for the same proposition applying [...] In a second explanation of how Moses <b>escaped,</b> <b>Bar</b> Kappara taught a Baraita that an angel came down from heaven in the likeness of Moses, they seized the angel, and Moses escaped. In a third explanation of how Moses escaped, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said that when Moses fled from Pharaoh, God incapacitated Pharaoh's people by making some of them mute, some of them deaf, and some of them blind. When Pharaoh asked where Moses was, the mutes could not reply, the deaf could not hear, and the blind could not see.

40|$|In 2012, the Fifth Circuit {{became the}} first circuit court to {{explicitly}} reject an argument that a fail–safe class—a class {{defined in terms of}} the defendant’s liability—was barred from class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Drawing on previous cases in which it had rejected challenges that class definitions were circular, the Fifth Circuit in In re Rodriguez outright disclaimed a prohibition against fail–safe classes. This decision diverged from the Sixth and Seventh Circuits’ proscription against certifying fail–safe classes, creating a split among the circuits. This Note explores this circuit split and argues that fail–safe classes must be proscribed because they allow class members to <b>escape</b> the <b>bar</b> of res judicata. This Note concludes that characterizing a class as fail–safe should provide independent justification for denying class certification...|$|R

There a fight broke out after Kaufman accused the Bulldogs of throwing the game. The fight engulfed the whole bar and police had to be called in. Kauffman and Cusack <b>escaped</b> the <b>bar,</b> before the police showed up.

5000|$|Ruthless killer Steve Michel {{is known}} {{to the public as}} [...] "The Claw" [...] for his way of killing her victims with his {{prosthetic}} hook. After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator. The insurance company only has twenty-four hours to find the stolen goods, or they have to reimburse the fur company. Tracy and his semi-competent assistant Patton examine the dead body at the morgue and find a note on it stating that there were three perpetrators performing the hit against the warehouse. It also mentions that they used a truck with the name [...] "Daisy" [...] on it. Unfortunately, the three perpetrators disguise the truck before Tracy can find it, and the lead is a dead end. The robbers soon leave their hideout in a local junkyard and go to a nearby bar to phone their boss and get new instructions. As they speak with the boss on the phone, their conversation is overheard by an informant, a blind beggar called Sightless, who goes to pass the information on. Sightless is sloppy and noisy when eavesdropping, and is nearly caught by The Claw. Still, he manages to <b>escape</b> the <b>bar.</b>|$|R
60|$|Excited {{almost to}} madness {{by the sight}} of their beloved master {{stretched}} bleeding on the ground, the knights dashed down the breach in eager pursuit. This action was decisive of the fate of the struggle. The panic among the janissaries at once spread, and the main body of troops, who had hitherto valiantly striven to regain the advantage snatched from them, now lost heart and fled in confusion. But their <b>escape</b> was <b>barred</b> by the great body of reinforcements pressing forward across the heap of rubbish that formed the breach over the deep ditch. Maddened by fear, the fugitives strove to cut a way through their friends. The whole of the defenders of the breach now fell upon the rear of the struggling mass, hewing them down almost without resistance, while the cannon from the walls and towers kept up an unceasing fire until the last survivors of what had become a massacre, succeeded in gaining their works beyond the ditch, and fled to their camp. From every gateway and postern the knights now poured out, and, gathering together, advanced to the attack of St. Stephen's Hill. They met with but a faint resistance. The greater portion of the disorganised troops had made no pause at their camp, but had continued their headlong flight to the harbour, where their ships were moored, Paleologus himself, heartbroken and despairing at his failure, sharing their flight. The camp, with all its rich booty and the great banner of the pasha, fell {{into the hands of the}} victors, who, satisfied with their success, and exhausted by their efforts, made no attempt to follow the flying foe, or to hinder their embarkation; for even now the Turks, enormously outnumbering them as they did, might be driven by despair to a resistance so desperate as once again to turn the tide of victory.|$|R

Alarcón thereupon hastened across to northern Eleuthera and visited a like treatment upon its English settlement, before returning to Charles Town on 15 November 1684 (O.S.) to set fire on its buildings and carry off numerous residents to Havana. The Bahamas subsequently remained devoid of any recognizable English presence until December 1686, when a small contingent from Jamaica under the preacher Thomas Bridges reoccupied New Providence Island, where more colonists gradually joined them.|$|R

He now supported Henrietta Maria's policy of foreign alliances and use of help from Ireland, and took part in several imprudent and ill-conducted negotiations which damaged the king's affairs. His fierce disputes with Rupert and his party caused further embarrassment. On 14 October 1645 he was made lieutenant general of the royal forces north of the Trent. The intention was to push through to join Montrose, but he was defeated on 15 October at Sherburn, where his correspondence was captured.

But perhaps her greatest delight was in finding that Jonathan Stubbs was at Albury. She had become so intimate with the Colonel that she regarded him quite like an old friend; and when a girl has a male friend, though he may be much less loved, or not loved at all, he is always more pleasant, or at any rate more piquant, than a female friend. As for love with Colonel Stubbs that was quite out of the question. She was sure {{that he would never}} fall in love with herself. His manner to her was altogether unlike that of a lover. A lover would be smooth, soft, poetic, and flattering. He was always a little rough to her,--sometimes almost scolding her. But then he scolded her as she liked to be scolded,--with a dash of fun and a greatly predominating admixture of good-nature. He was like a bear,--but a bear who would always behave himself pleasantly. She was delighted when Colonel Stubbs congratulated her on her escape from Kingsbury Crescent, and felt that he was justified by his intimacy when he called Mrs. Dosett a mollified she-Cerberus.|$|R

40|$|Background: There were 23 {{girls who}} <b>escaped</b> from <b>bar</b> “F” in Timika Province of Papua. In 29 August 2002 during medical examination, {{it was found}} that one of the girls {{suffered}} from HIV/AIDS, others had sexual diseases, and there were some of them who were pregnant. The government paid attention to them and hence, they were invited to a skill course and will be given an asset; nevertheless, only five girls who attended. Objective: This research was aimed to find out knowledge of girls who were being prostitute regarding the threat of reproductive health disease, role of customer, procuress, health care provider, friend and family in giving support on the unwanted pregnancy, sexual transmitted disease (STD) and HIV/AIDS as well as how is the reproductive health behavior toward prevention of unwanted pregnancy, STD and HIV/AIDS during trafficking in Timika. Method: This research was an explorative qualitative one and it was conducted with focus group discussion toward research subject of girls who were being prostitute in Timika and in-depth interview toward research subject and program manager in the provincial level as informant key. The subjects were chosen with purposive sampling that used selected criteria. Qualitative data analysis was used from data collection until forming an explanation of data validity by using source and method triangulation. Result: In general, AYLA did not experience unwanted pregnancy because they used contraception. Condom can be obtained from health care provider or bought to be offered to their guest when having sexual relationship although most of the guests refused to use it. This condition showed the low bargaining position of girls who were being prostitute in the transaction process. People surrounding girls who were being prostitute has reminded each other to have self protection toward prevention of unwanted pregnancy, STD and HIV/AIDS with contraception. They know the risk if they did not use condom in having sexual relationship. The low bargaining position caused girls who were being prostitute had high risk toward reproductive health disease and could not have safe sex in order to be avoided from the transmission of STD even HIV/AIDS. Conclusion: Most girls who were being prostitute already know unwanted pregnancy, STD and HIV/AIDS, but they still have bad attitude and behavior on the risk of sexual disease when their guests were not using condom because of girls who were being prostitute low bargaining position and behavior on washing reproductive organ with toothpaste after having sexual relationship caused irritation and reproductive system disorder...|$|R

Rachel is scared {{that they would be}} deemed illegitimate by society and tries to deny her love for her cousin. This offends and angers Dillon, who is against the social norms and wishes to love Rachel even if society believes it is the wrong thing to do. He wants to marry Rachel, but it is illegal to marry a first cousin. When the trouble with the coal company gets worse, Dillon asks that Rachel leave her job for the county, and help him in the fight against the coal companies as the other wives were doing. However, Dillon and Rachel were raised differently, and the words of her dying mother echoed in her head. She was raised by her mother to believe that men want a prim and proper lady, certainly not one who has sex before marriage. It would be wrong for kin to sleep with kin, and even more wrong for two first cousins to marry one another. Standing strong in these beliefs, Rachel ends up marrying Tony, an Italian man that Tommie and Arthur Lee set her up with. She has trouble having kids with Tony and continues to stay close to Dillon. Eventually, she gives into the fact that she loves Dillon and they make love in the secluded area of Trace Mountain where they conceive their daughter, Jackie. However, {{throughout the rest of the}} novel this escape to the mountain is kept quiet and Jackie believes until the very end that Tony is her father. After Rachel and Tony finally divorce due to an unhappy marriage and his <b>escapes</b> to the <b>bar,</b> Tony gets remarried and has trouble again having babies. Rachel fears that this will cause him suspicion of Jackie being his and that he will try to take her away.|$|R
