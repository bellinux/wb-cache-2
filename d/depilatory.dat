25|$|A nazirite can groom {{his hair}} {{with his hand}} or scratch his head and needn’t be {{concerned}} if some hair falls out. However a nazirite cannot comb his hair since it is a near certainty to pull out some hair. A nazirite {{is not allowed to}} use a chemical <b>depilatory</b> that will remove hair. A nazirite that recovers from Tzaraath, a skin disease described in , is obligated to cut his hair despite being a nazirite.|$|E

25|$|The {{patient may}} want to {{consider}} some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation is that people who have body hair on the chest {{may want to}} remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a <b>depilatory</b> agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
2500|$|Other plots {{to assassinate}} Castro that are {{ascribed}} to the CIA include, among others: poisoning his cigars (a box of the lethal smokes was actually prepared and delivered to Havana); exploding seashells to be planted at a scuba diving site; a gift diving wetsuit impregnated with noxious bacteria and mold spores, or with lethal chemical agents; infecting Castro's scuba regulator apparatus with tuberculous bacilli; dousing his handkerchiefs, his tea, and his coffee with other lethal bacteria; having a former lover slip him poison pills; and exposing him to various other poisoned items such as a fountain pen and even ice cream. The CIA even tried to embarrass Castro by attempting to sneak thallium salts, a potent <b>depilatory,</b> into Castro's shoes, causing [...] "his beard, eyebrows, and pubic hair to fall out". The US Senate's Church Committee of 1975 stated that it had confirmed at least eight separate CIA run plots to assassinate Castro.

5000|$|Leg shaving is the {{practice}} of removing leg hair by shaving the hair off using a razor or electric shaver. In addition, some people remove leg hair using waxing, sugaring, <b>depilatories,</b> epilators or other depilation devices, or lasers, but shaving remains the least expensive method.|$|R
25|$|Depilation is {{the removal}} of the part of the hair above the surface of the skin. The most common form of {{depilation}} is shaving or trimming.

6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} I have ever {{happened}} to mention to you, sir, a Mr. Digby Thistleton, with whom I was once in service? Perhaps you have met him? He was a financier. He is now Lord Bridgnorth. It was a favourite saying of his that {{there is always a}} way. The first time I heard him use the expression was after the failure of a patent <b>depilatory</b> which he promoted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a maxim {{of one of}} {{my former}} employers, sir--as I believe I {{mentioned}} to you once before--the present Lord Bridgnorth, that there is always a way. I remember his lordship using the expression on the occasion--he was then a business gentleman and had not yet received his title--when a patent hair-restorer which he chanced to be promoting failed to attract the public. He put it on the market under another name as a <b>depilatory,</b> and amassed a substantial fortune. I have generally found his lordship's aphorism based on sound foundations. No doubt we shall be able to discover some solution of Mr. Bickersteth's difficulty, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mentioned}} Mr. Thistleton, sir, {{because his}} {{was in some}} respects a parallel case to the present one. His <b>depilatory</b> failed, {{but he did not}} despair. He put it on the market again under the name of Hair-o, guaranteed to produce a full crop of hair in a few months. It was advertised, if you remember, sir, by a humorous picture of a billiard-ball, before and after taking, and made such a substantial fortune that Mr. Thistleton was soon afterwards elevated to the peerage for services to his Party. It seems to me that, if Mr. Corcoran looks into the matter, he will find, like Mr. Thistleton, that there is always a way. Mr. Worple himself suggested the solution of the difficulty. In {{the heat of the moment}} he compared the portrait to an extract from a coloured comic supplement. I consider the suggestion a very valuable one, sir. Mr. Corcoran's portrait may not have pleased Mr. Worple as a likeness of his only child, but I have no doubt that editors would gladly consider it as a foundation for a series of humorous drawings. If Mr. Corcoran will allow me to make the suggestion, his talent has always been for the humorous. There is something about this picture--something bold and vigorous, which arrests the attention. I feel sure it would be highly popular." ...|$|E

25|$|Temporary hair removal {{may last}} from several hours to several weeks, {{depending}} on the method used. These procedures are purely cosmetic.

Epilation methods, such as plucking, electrology, waxing, sugaring, threading remove the entire hair from the root, the results lasting several days to several weeks.|$|R

25|$|The body hair of {{surgical}} patients may be removed before surgery. In the past {{this may have}} been achieved by shaving, but that is now considered counter-productive, so clippers or chemical <b>depilatories</b> may be used instead. The shaving of hair has sometimes been used in attempts to eradicate lice or to minimize body odor due to accumulation of odor-causing micro-organisms in hair. Some people with trichiasis find it medically necessary to remove ingrown eyelashes. Shaving against the grain can often cause ingrown hairs.|$|R

In the 9th century, the use of chemical <b>depilatories</b> for women was introduced by Ziryab in Al-Andalus. Muslims are legislated by the Sunnah to remove under arm hair and pubic hair on a weekly basis; not doing after a 40-day period is considered sinful in the Sharia.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} in guinea pigs by {{measuring}} electrical conductivity and percutaneous absorption that after treating the skin with thioglycollic acid <b>depilatories</b> (pH 11. 3 – 11. 9), the barrier function is impaired. The electrical conductivity was raised to 40 – 60 μA/ 1 V and did not become normal until 5 – 7 days after depilation. The absorption rate of sodium chloride (22 Na) was increased about 3 times after depilation and 5 times after stripping compared with normal skin. The conclusion is that, if pre-depilation is used in absorption studies of when testing in delayed type of hypersensitivity, an increased absorption occurs, and augmented test reactions, which might be non-specific...|$|R

25|$|The Shulchan Aruch quotes the Talmud {{that because}} {{scissors}} have two blades, it would therefore {{be permitted to}} trim the beard by using them, since the cutting action would come from contact between two blades and not from that between blade and skin. In Germany and Italy, {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century, Jews started removing beards with the aid of pumice stones and chemical <b>depilatories,</b> which would leave the face smooth, as if it had been shaven. These are non-razor shaves which are not prohibited. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (Tzemach Tzedek) argued that shaving a beard would fall under the biblical regulation against males resembling a female (he also extended the prohibition for wanton destruction to destroying the hair of the beard); the Shulchan Aruch interpreted this regulation in a different way, arguing that it forbade men from removing hair from areas where women were accustomed to remove hair, such as underarm hair and pubic hair.|$|R
25|$|Complications of postsurgical wounds can {{be reduced}} before, during and after surgery. Before surgery, clinicians can treat the patient to reduce {{hemoglobin}} A1c levels to less than 7%. Those anticipating surgery can reduce their risk of complications by stopping smoking thirty days prior to surgery. The patient's skin can be evaluated {{for the presence of}} Staphylococcus areus prior to surgery since this bacterium causes wound infections in postoperative wounds. Treating any other infections prior to surgery also reduces the risks of a postoperative wound infection. Examples of these pre-existing infections are urinary tract infection or lower reproductive system infection. Removing the hair where the skin will be cut helps {{to reduce the risk of}} complications, though shaving is not considered to be appropriate and instead <b>depilatories</b> are used. Those who come in contact with the person who is receiving the surgery clean and disinfect their own skin surfaces. The patient's skin is also cleaned, scrubbed and treated with antiseptics. Patients undergoing surgery often receive antibiotics before surgery.|$|R
