5|$|Following Michael VIII Palaiologos' reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire {{was left}} in a grave position. There was plenty of talk among the Latin states of the Greek {{mainland}} and other regions of retaking Constantinople for the Latin Empire whilst to the north the main threat came from Serbian <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> the Balkans by king Stefan Uroš I. What was once a strong frontier under the Komnenian dynasty at the Danube river now threatened Constantinople itself.|$|E
5|$|In 504 the Gepids' {{power was}} {{significantly}} {{reduced by the}} Ostrogoths, who cut short their <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> the Danubian plains. The Gepids restricted themselves to {{the eastern part of}} the Pannonian Basin; this was to form the core of Thurisind's dominions, just as it had under the previous Gepid kings. By the early 6th century, the Gepid nobility converted to Arian Christianity, while most of the Gepids remained pagans.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy farmers {{continue}} to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration. The fires sometimes burn {{out of control and}} destroy forest edges along with the natural flora, increasing the damage even further than intended. Due to the nature of Madagascar's geology and soil, tavy also depletes the fertility of the soil, accelerating the crop rotation rate and necessitating <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> primary forests.|$|E

5|$|The English {{colonies of}} New England fought against French and Indian forces based in Acadia and Canada. Quebec City was {{repeatedly}} targeted (but never successfully reached) by British expeditions, and the Acadian capital Port Royal {{was taken in}} 1710. The French and Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart New England <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. Toward this end, they executed raids against targets in Massachusetts (including present-day Maine), most famously raiding Deerfield in 1704.|$|E

5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the Eurasian crag martin reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> lowland areas, {{particularly for the}} two tropical species, and the rock martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation is}} the earldom hypothesis. This assumes {{a period of}} Norse <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> the Northern Isles {{and the creation of}} an aristocratic dynasty that lasted well into the Medieval period, which exerted considerable influence in western Scotland and Mann into the 11th century. This version of events is essentially as told by the Norse sagas and is supported by some archaeological evidence although it has been criticised for exaggerating Orcadian influence in the Suðreyar.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the war, New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy {{were able}} to thwart New England <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in {{southern}} Maine. In 1703, Michel Leneuf de la Vallière de Beaubassin commanded a few French Canadians and 500 Indians of the Wabanaki Confederacy, and they led attacks against New England settlements from Wells to Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) in the Northeast Coast Campaign. They killed or captured more than 300 settlers.|$|E

50|$|In palaeoanthropology, Out of Africa I is {{the first}} series of hominin <b>expansions</b> <b>into</b> Eurasia, which took place from 1.8 to 0.8 million years ago (Ma).

5|$|A long bar of Danish territories in {{the south}} and lack of {{sufficient}} year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E
5|$|A {{prime example}} of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were {{destroyed}} by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.|$|E
5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its <b>expansion</b> <b>into</b> Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E
