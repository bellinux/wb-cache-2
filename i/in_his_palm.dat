5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} he has an ally who is also working {{undercover}} at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last.|$|E
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger {{on his left}} hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E
25|$|A heavily built man, Burge was a combative {{player who}} was {{regarded}} as quiet and genial off the field. An attacking player, he {{was known for his}} penchant for the hook shot and his ability against fast bowling. Burge {{is one of the few}} cricketers to be given out handled the ball. In a Shield match against New South Wales in 195859, the ball struck him on the pad and went up in the air. Unconsciously, he put up a hand and the ball landed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b>|$|E

50|$|A kshullaka {{may live}} in a house or may be a wanderer. He may eat food placed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> or from a container. He eats once a day. He may beg from a single house or from {{multiple}} ones.|$|R
60|$|He {{straightened}} {{himself with}} an effort, clenched his fists until the nails were nearly buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> and strode with a firm, steady {{step in the}} direction he had come. In a few moments he returned and stood before her.|$|R
25|$|Taylor {{was careful}} with his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm</b> and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.|$|E
500|$|... "Once when Brahma, the creator, {{was engaged}} in the {{performance}} of the sandhya (twilight) rituals, Indra approached and beseeched him to create a hero who could put to an end the increasing evil on earth. On being thus requested, Brahma looked steadily into the Chuluka-jala (the water of oblation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm)</b> and out sprang thence a great warrior, the progenitor of the Chalukyas". The Chalukyas claimed to have been nursed by the Sapta Matrikas ("seven divine mothers") and were worshippers of many gods including Siva, Vishnu, Chamundi, Surya, Kubera, Parvati, Vinayaka and Kartikeya.|$|E
500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{a black and}} white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while Kiedis' standing body conceals the other. There were originally two women whose photographs were planned to be used, one being Kiedis' girlfriend Ione Skye and the other being model Dawn Alane; the latter was ultimately chosen. Controversy arose, however, when Dawn claimed the band did not notify her that she was the one chosen to be on the cover of Mother's Milk. Furthermore, several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A more strictly censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original. The cover of the record was influenced by a promotional poster Kiedis had from the 1960s of Sly and the Family Stone, in which frontman Sly Stone held a miniaturized band <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm.</b> When Kiedis was finding shots of the band to use on the cover, Frusciante initially refused every photograph the vocalist showed him but settled on one of him sitting down laughing. Mother's Milk was affixed with an [...] "explicit language" [...] warning sticker that, according to Kiedis, [...] "oesn't bother me. Our lyrics are very explicit, whether it's about sex or friendship or love for life in general." [...] The cover booklet of the record {{features a}} painting by Hillel Slovak. Following the album's release, a limited number of promotional posters were issued with the model's breasts exposed. Dawn had no knowledge of the pressing and sued the band, winning a $50,000 settlement.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} his brickmaking, our adventurer {{found himself}} with a {{tolerable}} suit of clothes--somewhat darned--on his back, several blood-blisters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> and some verdigris coppers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pocket. Forthwith, to seek his fortune, he proceeded on foot to the capital, entering, like the king, from Windsor, from the Surrey side.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of the tympanum {{is based on the}} description of Christ that John the Evangelist makes in Revelation (Chapter 1 v 1 to 18). In the center, the Pantocrator is shown, displaying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> and feet the wounds of crucifixion. Christ sits and occupies the center at nearly four yards in height.|$|R

2500|$|Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were {{instrumental}} in forming the exclusive Thunderbird Heights tract in Rancho Mirage, once the home of President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty. According to Palm Springs Life magazine, that same tract inspired the name in late 1954 for the Ford Thunderbird. The magazine incorrectly cites that a favorite vacation spot for General Motors executives, Palm Desert's Eldorado Country Club, inspired the name for Cadillac's top model the year before â€” though Cadillac had chosen the name five years before the club's founding in an internal competition. Local automotive history inidcates that designer Raymond Loewy penned the Studebaker Avanti <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Palm</b> Springs home. Especially since the 1950s, Palm Springs and nearby golf clubs are hailed as the [...] "playground of celebrities". However {{it is said that}} celebrities travel or reside in the Palm Springs area inlesser numbers as compared to yesteryear, but the area's [...] "star power" [...] made a comeback in the 2000s.|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion {{was played}} by Chris Casamassa in the 1995 Mortal Kombat film. His rivalry with Sub-Zero is only {{mentioned}} in passing by Shang Tsung in the storyline, which instead had them both serving as his slaves under his command. Scorpion's spear {{was a living}} snake-like creature that shot from a slit <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm</b> and could fly to a limited extent. It is first seen when he engages in a standoff with Johnny Cage on Shang Tsung's ship, and later during his fight in the tournament against Cage that begins in a rubber tree forest, when the spear directly follows Cage until it goes completely taut with Cage just out of reach. Scorpion fires the creature a second time, but Cage dodges it and it fatally smashes into a tree. The fight continues in Scorpion's lair until Cage finally wounds Scorpion with several discarded weapons right after Scorpion performs his [...] "Fire Breath" [...] Fatality as an offensive move, causing Scorpion {{to burst into flames}} as he bleeds a glowing lava-like blood before exploding entirely. Scorpion's lair was constructed inside an airplane hangar and {{was not included in the}} script nor the movie novelization, in which Cage merely knocks Scorpion out in the forest with his Shadow Kick.|$|E

60|$|It {{was with}} a countenance sadly dejected that Crispin {{returned}} to his chamber and sate himself wearily upon the bed. With elbows {{on his knees and}} chin <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> he stared straight before him, the usual steely brightness of his grey eyes dulled by the despondency that sat upon his face and drew deep furrows down his fine brow.|$|R
6000|$|... --A deathsman of {{the soul}} Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not for nothing was he a butcher's son, {{wielding}} the sledded poleaxe and spitting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms.</b> Nine lives are taken off for his father's one. Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.|$|R

60|$|Jacob seized it {{immediately}} and retreated a little, holding the two knives <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> and bending over them in meditative comparison. By {{this time the}} other clients were gone, and the whole family had gathered to the spot, centering their attention on the marvelous Jacob: the father, mother, and grandmother behind the counter, with baby held staggering thereon, {{and the little girl}} in front leaning at her brother's elbow to assist him in looking at the knives.|$|R

5000|$|On October 27, 1964, Tong {{was found}} dead <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>Palms,</b> Los Angeles {{apartment}} by his close friend, Ben Wong. Tong died of an apparent suicide by barbiturate overdose. Police found an empty bottle of sleeping pills by his body and several notes addressed to his landlady, his attorney and police.

60|$|If La Boulaye was startled, {{his face}} never betrayed it, not by {{so much as}} the quiver of an eyelid. He sat on, his jaw <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>palm,</b> his eyes admiringly bent upon the speaker.|$|E
