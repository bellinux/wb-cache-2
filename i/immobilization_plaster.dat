40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate histological changes in skin tissue accompanying immobilization-induced hypersensitivity. Changes in mechanical sensitivity, epidermal thickness, and peripheral nerve profiles in the upper dermis were examined in glabrous skin of rat hind paw after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of ankle joint <b>immobilization</b> by <b>plaster</b> casts. Induction of mechanical hypersensitivity was confirmed after 2 and 4 weeks of joint immobilization. Epidermal thinning and increase in peripheral nerve profiles were observed in skin tissues in immobilized rats. The time course of epidermal thinning and increase in peripheral nerve profiles were similar closely to that of hypersensitivity, with significant differences between the immobilized and control rats after 2 weeks of immobilization, which became even more remarkable at 4 weeks of immobilization. These findings suggest that joint immobilization by cast induces epidermal thinning and increases peripheral nerve profiles in the upper dermis and that these changes might be partly responsible for immobilization-induced hypersensitivity...|$|R

40|$|K {{depletion}} {{leads to}} a selective loss of K from skeletal muscles, which {{is associated with a}} {{decrease in the number of}} [3 H]ouabain binding sites. The significance of the nerve supply for these changes has been assessed in denervation experiments with K-depleted rats. In K-depleted rats (age 4 - 12 weeks) denervation led to a partial recovery of the K contents in soleus (46 - 77 %), gastrocnemius (23 %) and extensor digitorum longus (e. d. l.) muscles (19 %) within 24 h. These effects were not prevented by beta-adrenoceptor blockade or mimicked by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. In K-depleted rats the number of [3 H]ouabain binding sites was not increased following denervation. In K-depleted rats 24 h of <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the entire hind limb caused 51 % recovery of the total K content in soleus, whereas gastrocnemius and e. d. l. showed 49 and 16 % recovery, respectively. Tenotomy for 3 h caused a rise in total K content of 33 % in soleus muscles from K-depleted rats. Anaesthesia for 3 h increased the total K content by 23 %. The recovery of K induced by denervation, <b>immobilization</b> in <b>plaster,</b> tenotomy or anaesthesia was associated with an equivalent decrease in Na content. Denervation performed before K depletion reduced the loss of K from soleus, but not from gastrocnemius and e. d. l. In both soleus and e. d. l. the number of [3 H]ouabain binding sites, however, decreased to the same level as in the contralateral innervated muscles. Denervation reduced, but did not prevent, the increase in the number of [3 H]ouabain binding sites seen after re-administration of K to K-depleted rats. It is concluded that the changes in Na-K contents seen after denervation in K-depleted rats are the outcome of cessation of muscle activity. The results give no support to the idea that the effects of K depletion on the K content and the number of [3 H]ouabain binding sites in skeletal muscle are mediated by the peripheral nerves...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Forearm {{fractures}} make 13 - 18 % of all injuries of {{the upper}} extremities in children. Most of them are older than 6 years. The degree of tolerance is different but children younger than 8 years can tolerate 15 - 20 degrees of angulation, 45 degrees of inadequate rotation and total displacement. Older children can tolerate angulation of 10 degrees, 30 degrees of in adequate rotation and complete dislocation. Material and methods Over a period of five years (1995 - 2000) 54 children with forearm fractures (22 stable and 32 unstable fractures) were treated at the Pediatric Surgery Clinic in Novi Sad. Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning were treatments of choice in 19 patients with unstable fractures: 7 kids with only radius pinning, three kids with isolated ulnar fixation, 9 kids with pinning of both bones. Open reposition and fixation with Kirschner wires was done in 13 kids. Results In the group of 22 children with stable fractures results were excellent in 17 (77 %), good in 4 (18. 5 %), and satisfactory in one child (4. 5 %). In the group of 32 children with unstable fractures excellent results were noted in 24 (75 %), good in 4 (12. 5 %) satisfactory in 3 (9. 4 %) and unsatisfactory in one child (3. 1 %) Discussion A large number of forearm fractures in children can be treated with manual reduction and <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization</b> into a tolerable position. However, in unstable fractures the method of choice is manual reduction with percutaneous pinning. Some authors prefer fixation of both bones, others fix only one. Conclusions Based on our experience it is concluded that orthopedic reposition and percutaneous pinning of unstable forearm fractures in children {{is very easy to}} perform, duration of intramedullar fixation is relatively short, removal of pins is also very easy without anesthesia and it requires short period of <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization.</b> This provides faster rehabilitation and improves quality of life...|$|R

The rupture is easily diagnosed by means of clinical examination (Thompson's test) and ultrasonography. The aim of the analysis was to point to the advantages of surgical treatment of a fresh Achilles tendon rupture as opposed to non-surgical treatment by <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization.</b> The examination was performed on 35 patients, of which 16 (45, 71 %) were treated operatively and 19 (54, 29 %) were treated nonoperatively. The average age of the patients was 38. 8 years, that is 37. 1 for those treated operatively and 40. 2 for those treated nonoperatively. Among the examinees, there were 29 (82, 86 %) men and 6 (17, 14 %) women. The operative treatment method consisted of percutaneous suturing, whereas the nonoperative treatment involved the circular above the knee <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization.</b> All operatively treated patients underwent the surgical treatment in the first 48 hours from the time when the injury had occured. Anesthesia was local and infiltrative. The obtained results showed that there were no unhealed ruptures or re-ruptures. In the group of patients who did not undergo the surgery, there was 1 re-rupture and 1 unhealed rupture, after which the surgical treatment had to be performed in both cases. In the group of operated patients there were no infections, however, 1 thromboembolism occured. Recovery of muscular strenght of the tendon and the realization of the full range of movement required less time in the operated patients. The ultrasonographic findings in the operated patients showed better consolidation of the rupture site, with less scar tissue formation. The conclusion, {{as a result of our}} experience, is that in the case of a fresh Achilles tendon rupture the priority must be given to surgical treatment by percutaneous suture, and each time when it is not possible to bring the ends of the tendon together...|$|R

Methods: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases. We included English- and non-English language studies, we hand-searched journals, and we contacted manufacturers. We analyzed data from six randomized trials that investigated pharmacological prophylaxis {{for the prevention of}} VTE in 1456 patients with lower-leg <b>immobilization</b> in <b>plaster</b> cast or orthosis. Two reviewers independently assessed the trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. Differences were resolved by consensus or arbitrage. Results: The pooled estimate from all trials revealed a highly significant and clinically relevant reduction in asymptomatic events with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis, compared to placebo or untreated control [risk ratio (RR) 0. 58; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 39 - 0. 86; P = 0. 006). The mean rate of VTE decreased from 17. 1 % to 9. 6 % with the use of LMWH. Subgroup analysis of methodologically superior trials (RR 0. 68; CI 0. 50 - 0. 92; P = 0. 01), proximal deep vein thrombosis (RR 0. 28; CI 0. 11 - 0. 72; P = 0. 008), tendon ruptures (RR 0. 60; CI 0. 38 - 0. 97; P = 0. 04), and fractures (RR 0. 62; CI 0. 45 - 0. 86; P = 0. 004) confirmed the robustness of the overall result.

All the fractures were managed with manipulation under general anesthesia and <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization.</b> Additionally, K-wire fixation was performed following manipulation in seven (46. 7 %) of the completely displaced fractures. The mean follow-up period was 1. 1 years (range 10 weeks to 2 years). RESULTS: The mean angulation of fractures prior to manipulation was 21. 5 +/- 10. 1 degrees, it decreased to 2. 4 +/- 4. 8 degrees following manipulation. Remanipulation was required in 11 fractures (9. 8 %) based on clinical and radiographic findings of redisplacement. Of these, eight fractures (8. 3 %) were incompletely displaced, and three fractures (20 %) were completely displaced. All completely displaced fractures that required remanipulation had been additionally treated with K-wire fixation. Fractures requiring further treatment had a mean angulation of 17. 1 +/- 5. 8 degrees prior to remanipulation, and a mean residual angulation of 4. 7 +/- 6. 0 degrees at final radiographic assessment. A perfect fracture reduction was achieved in all the patients with a Salter-Harris II injury (n= 22), and none of these patients required remanipulation. However, the quality of initial reduction was not associated with the development of redisplacement. There {{was no significant difference between}} isolated distal radius fractures (n= 58) and combined radius and ulna fractures (n= 32) with respect to remanipulation rate and final angulation (p> 0. 05). Final radiographs showed a significantly greater angulation in fractures which were initially completely displaced in comparison with those that were incompletely displaced (8. 2 +/- 7. 1 degrees vs. 4. 2 +/- 5. 7 degrees; p= 0. 024), but this was not of clinical significance. None of the patients had radial shortening and no K-wire related complications were encountered. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that there should be other factors involved in the development of redisplacement and the need for remanipulation other than the degree of fracture displacement and the quality of initial reduction. Selective K-wire fixation in displaced fractures does not seem to decrease redisplacement and remanipulation rates...|$|R
40|$|Background: Elbow dislocations can be {{classified}} as simple or complex. Simple dislocations are characterized {{by the absence of}} fractures, while complex dislocations are associated with fractures. After reduction of a simple dislocation, treatment options include immobilization in a static plaster for different periods of time or so-called functional treatment. Functional treatment is characterized by early active motion within the limits of pain with or without the use of a sling or hinged brace. Theoretically, functional treatment should prevent stiffness without introducing increased joint instability. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare early functional treatment versus <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization</b> following simple dislocations of the elbow. Methods/Design: The design of the study will be a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 100 patients who have sustained a simple elbow dislocation. After reduction of the dislocation, patients are randomized between a pressure bandage for 5 - 7 days and early functional treatment or a plaster in 90 degrees flexion, neutral position for prosupination for a period of three weeks. In the functional group, treatment is started with early active motion within the limits of pain. Function, pain, and radiographic recovery will be evaluated at regular intervals over the subsequent 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score. The secondar...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with myelomeningocele (MMC), {{a high number}} of fractures occur in the paralyzed extremities, affecting mobility and independence. The aims of this retrospective cross-sectional study are to determine the frequency of fractures in our patient cohort and to identify trends and risk factors relevant for such fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1988 and June 2005, 862 {{patients with}} MMC were treated at our hospital. The medical records, surgery reports, and X-rays from these patients were evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, 11 % of the patients (n =  92) suffered one or more fractures. Risk analysis showed that patients with MMC and thoracic-level paralysis had a sixfold higher risk of fracture compared with those with sacral-level paralysis. Femoral-neck z-scores measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) differed significantly according to the level of neurological impairment, with lower z-scores in children with a higher level of lesion. Furthermore, the rate of epiphyseal separation increased noticeably after cast immobilization. Mainly patients who could walk relatively well were affected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thoracic-level paralysis represent a group with high fracture risk. According to these results, fracture and epiphyseal injury in patients with MMC should be treated by <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization.</b> The duration of immobilization should be kept to a minimum (< 4  weeks) because of increased risk of secondary fractures. Alternatively, patients with refractures can be treated by surgery, when nonoperative treatment has failed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the diagnostic management of scaphoid fracture, 100 consecutive patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fractures were investigated. If a scaphoid fracture was seen on scaphoid radiographs, patients were immobilized in a plaster cast. If the radiographs were negative or dubious for scaphoid fracture, patients were referred for three phase bone scintigraphy. Then the patient was treated according to {{the result of the}} bone scan. A long-term follow-up (minimum 1 year) was performed in order {{to evaluate the}} incidence of non-union. In 49 of the 100 patients, a fracture of the scaphoid was recognized, in 29 of whom their scaphoid X-series was positive for scaphoid fracture. In 3 of the remaining 71 patients with negative scaphoid X-series, additional carpal box radiographs showed a scaphoid fracture, while 68 patients were referred for three-phase bone scintigraphy. Of these 68 patients, 17 patients (25 %) showed a hotspot on the bone scan in the region of the scaphoid. We found that scaphoid radiographs, additional carpal box radiographs and the bone scan (in radiographically negative patients) in combination with conservative therapy did not lead to non-union at long-term follow-up in patients who were treated for scaphoid fracture. We conclude that when a scaphoid fracture is diagnosed within the 1 st week followed by <b>plaster</b> <b>immobilization,</b> non-union of the scaphoid could be prevente...|$|R
40|$|Supracondylar humeral {{fractures}} (SCHF) are {{the most}} common elbow fractures in children, representing 3 % of all paediatric fractures. Treatment options for SCHF in children are based on the Gartland classification. Treatment of non-displaced fractures (type I) is non-operative. <b>Plaster</b> <b>immobilization</b> for 3 to 4 weeks is recommended, depending on the age of the child and fracture healing. Treatments of displaced supracondylar fractures (type II and III) of the humerus in children are still undefined in clinical practice. Because of divided opinions, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether delayed or immediate surgical treatment has an advantage in the treatment of supracondylar fractures in children. This is a prospective – retrospective clinical study. This study included 64 patients from 5 to 15 years old; 47 (73. 4 %) were boys and 17 (26. 6 %) were girls. The most common age range (59. 4 %) in this study was 5 - 8 years old. All patients were diagnosed with supracondylar fractures at the Institute for Orthopaedic Surgery “Banjica”. We analysed 17 parameters, which were obtained either from direct patient interviews or from their medical history. All patients were divided into two groups with matched characteristics. Group I consisted of 26 patients who had immediate operations. Group II consisted of 38 patients who had delayed operations...|$|R
