She could, however, count on the support of her family, scattered throughout Western Europe. In the United Kingdom, she shared her time between Spencer House, London, the residence of her youngest son, Prince Christopher; Regent's Park, where her daughter, Grand Duchess Marie, rented a mansion; Sandringham House, the home of her sister-in-law, Queen Alexandra; and Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace, where her nephew, King George V, lent apartments.|$|E

25|$|Despite these {{positive}} developments, {{the situation}} of Alexandra and her mother didn't improve. Indeed, Greece experiencing a series of military defeats against Turkey and a coup d'état soon forced King Constantine I to abdicate again, this time in favor of Diadochos George, on 27 September 1922. Things went {{from bad to worse}} for the country; a further coup forced the new ruler, his wife and his brother to leave the country on 19 December 1923. On 25 March 1924, the Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic</b> was proclaimed and both Aspasia and Alexandra were then the only members of the dynasty allowed to stay in Greece.|$|E

Indeed, Greece experienced a serious military defeat against Turkey and a coup d'état soon forced Constantine I to abdicate in favor of Diadochos George, on 27 September 1922. Things where {{from bad to worse}} for the country, and a failed monachist coup d'état forced the new King George II and his family into exile in December 1923.

25|$|In 1827, Ioannis Kapodistrias, from Corfu, {{was chosen}} by the Third National Assembly at Troezen as the first {{governor}} of the First <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic.</b> Kapodistrias established a series of state, economic and military institutions. Soon tensions appeared between him and local interests. Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent conference a year later, the Great Powers of Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince Otto von Wittelsbach as monarch. One of his first actions was to transfer the capital from Nafplio to Athens. In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, the Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic</b> was {{abolished}} and King George II (Alexandra's uncle) {{was restored}} to the throne after a referendum organized by General Georgios Kondylis. Alexandra was then {{allowed to return to}} Greece, a country she had not seen since 1924. Although she continued to reside in Venice with her mother (who still suffered the ostracism of the royal family), the princess was invited to all the great ceremonies that punctuate the life of the dynasty. In 1936, she participated in the official ceremonies who marked the reburial in Tatoi of the remains of King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and Dowager Queen Olga, all three died in exile in Italy. Two years later, in 1938, she was invited to the wedding of her uncle, the Diadochos Paul, with Princess Frederica of Hanover.|$|E
25|$|Posthumous {{daughter}} of King Alexander of Greece and his morganatic wife Aspasia Manos, Alexandra wasn't {{part of the}} Greek Royal Family until July 1922, when {{at the behest of}} Queen Sophia, a law was passed which retroactively recognized marriages of members of the Royal Family, although on a non-dynastic basis; in consequence, she obtained the style and name of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. At the same time, a serious political and military crisis, linked to the defeat of Greece against Turkey in Anatolia, gradually led to the deposition and exile of the royal family, beginning in 1924. Being the only members of the dynasty allowed to remain in the country by the Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic,</b> the princess and her mother later found refuge in Italy, with Dowager Queen Sophia.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} King's {{marriage}} to their cousin, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, the uninvited Prince Peter called {{a press conference}} in Athens and openly questioned the legality of the constitutional amendment. Above all, he attacked his cousin Paul's widow, the tremendously unpopular Queen Frederika, and accused her of having a bad influence on her son. King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie's first child, Princess Alexia, was born in 1965 and designated as the new heir presumptive, but Peter refused to recognise that either. Following the rupture between King Constantine and Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou the same year, the Prince openly criticised the King's conduct and suggested himself as an alternative to Constantine II. However, the abolishment of the monarchy and the proclamation of the Third <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1973 did not allow Peter to fulfill his dream of ascending the Greek throne.|$|E
25|$|This {{diplomacy}} {{was initially}} successful because the reigning Tsar, Alexander I (r.1801–25), {{was reluctant to}} support any revolutionary movement because of his experience during the Napoleonic Wars. Despite fervent support for the Greek cause in Russian nationalist circles, Alexander proved unwilling to defy Metternich and Castlereagh and offer the Greeks more than (limited) diplomatic support. Indeed, at the Congress of Verona (1822), Castlereagh persuaded Tsar Alexander to ignore the Greek cause altogether, even refusing to admit a Greek delegation to the conference. In the same year, Alexander also forced the resignation of his ethnic Venetian/Greek foreign minister, Count Giovanni Capo d'Istria (Ioannis Kapodistrias, later president of the First <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic),</b> for his passionate advocacy of the Greek cause. In 1824 the Tsar proposed a plan for Greek autonomy to the other powers, {{but it was clear}} that he was simply not prepared to act unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|His {{domestic}} {{position was}} weakened, however, by {{the effects of}} the Great Depression in the early 1930s; and in the elections of 1932 he was defeated by the People's Party under Panagis Tsaldaris. The political climate became more tense and in 1933 Venizelos was the target of a second assassination attempt. The pro-royalist tendencies of the new government led to two Venizelist coup attempts by General Nikolaos Plastiras: one in 1933 and the other in 1935. The failure of the latter proved decisive {{for the future of the}} Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic.</b> After the coup's failure Venizelos left Greece once more, while in Greece trials and executions of prominent Venizelists were carried out and he himself was sentenced to death in absentia. The severely weakened Republic was abolished in another coup in October 1935 by General Georgios Kondylis and George II returned to the throne following a rigged referendum in November.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, the Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic</b> was {{abolished}} and George II {{was restored}} to the throne after a referendum organized by General Georgios Kondylis.

Unlike Princess Alexandra, Aspasia was subsequently not invited to the ceremonies who marked the return of the remains of King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and Dowager Queen Olga to the Kingdom (1936), or the wedding of her brother-on-law, the Diadochos Paul, with Princess Frederica of Hanover (1938).

2500|$|Peter {{was born}} in Paris and spent his {{childhood}} in France, and did not set foot in Greece between 1912 and 1935 due to the First World War and the later proclamation of the Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic.</b> During that time, he came to know Denmark, the kingdom from which the Greek royal family originated. He joined the Royal Guards of Denmark in 1932 for basic military service, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1934. He spent summers at Bernstorff Palace, then owned by his paternal granduncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Due to their father's long-lasting sexual and emotional relationship with his uncle Valdemar, Peter and his sister Eugénie referred to Valdemar as [...] "Papa Two". As customary, Princess George took no part in her son's upbringing, and when he reached adolescence, only the counsels of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud helped them suppress their incestuous feelings for each other.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 March 1924, {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic,</b> the crowns were removed from all flags. On 20 February 1930, the national flag's proportions were established at a 2:3 ratio, with the arms of the cross being [...] "one fifth of the flag's width". The land version of the national flag was to be used by ministries, embassies, and in general by all civil and military services, while the sea flag was to be used by naval and merchant vessels, consulates and private citizens. On 10 October 1935, Georgios Kondylis declared that the monarchy had been restored. By decree of 7 November 1935, the 31 May 1914 decree was restored. Thereby, the crown was restored on the various flags. The crown was again removed by the military dictatorship in 1967, following the aborted counter-coup and subsequent self-exile of King Constantine II on 13 December. The sea flag was established as the sole national flag in 1969, using a very dark shade of blue, and on 18 August 1970, the flag ratio was changed to 7:12.|$|E
2500|$|The Marathon Dam was {{originally}} proposed, designed, funded and tendered in 1918, but was declared illegal by Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, who succeeded Eleftherios Venizelos in late 1920, because {{there had been}} no public bidding for the project. With a strong influx of Greek refugees from Asia Minor following the defeat at the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 (the [...] "Asia Minor Disaster") and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which led to the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, Greek officials were searching for a means to supply Athens with more water. An estimated 1.3 million refugees were returning and the population of Athens would end up doubling between 1920 and 1928. At the time, Greece underwent a period of political turmoil that saw the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of a Second <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic,</b> as well as several military coups and counter-coups. Near the end of this period, all major water supply projects for Athens were reevaluated and a five-volume report was published. The report described the Marathon Dam as [...] "the optimal solution" [...] and the [...] "last recourse" [...] for Athens.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{restoration}} of democratic rule, [...] regulated the new order structure of the <b>Hellenic</b> <b>Republic,</b> and reconfirmed {{the establishment of the}} Order of Honour, to be ranked second hierarchically after the Order of the Redeemer. A competition followed for the design of the new decoration, won by Konstantinos Kontopanos. His design was finalised in the Presidential Decree 849 of 11 November 1975. The original design was differed from the current: the head of Athena was of a different design, the motto was absent, and the intertwined letters ΕΔ, the initials of ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ were placed between the arms of the cross. The reverse featured a circular white band with the words ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ. In addition, the crosses were suspended from an oval laurel wreath. [...] The overall appearance and quality of the first designs were deemed unsatisfactory, and in late 1976, the French firm Arthus Bertrand was commissioned with making a new design, sans the ΕΔ, and without the enamel, giving the blue cross a more matte appearance. The French design also featured a new form of the star badge, {{in the form of an}} eight-pointed star, on which the entire cross badge was placed, while of the original design was four-pointed and featured only the cross's central disc with the head of Athena. This design was officially adopted in May 1977 (Presidential Decree 428), and the French firm provided two batches of orders until 1978.|$|E
