2500|$|When {{creating}} new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound {{in many different}} materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are leather, decorative paper, and cloth (see also: buckram). Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of particularly high-quality materials (especially full leather bindings), are known as fine or extra bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book {{that has already been}} printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. [...] "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, decorative <b>end</b> <b>sheets,</b> leather cover etc." ...|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{perforation}} patterns {{other than}} linear {{were used to}} mark stamps. A series of patents had been issued in the late 19th Century for perforation machines to be used on rail lines for ticketing. Libraries and private collections used similar perforating stamps to mark ownership of books. <b>End</b> <b>sheets,</b> title pages, and image plates were punched with the namesake of the collection. Today, similarly elaborate perforation patterns continue {{to be used in}} orienteering.|$|E
50|$|The Duster coupe {{provided}} the compact-sized Plymouth Valiant with a sporty body style to attract customers. The {{car was a}} $15 million effort to update the compact Valiant for the 1970 model year. The Valiant badge appeared only on the first model year Dusters, and continued to be used on all the companion 4-door sedan and 2-door Valiant Scamp hardtop models. The Duster {{was built on the}} Valiant platform and shared the same front <b>end</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, but featured a different design from the cowl back.|$|R

50|$|The club {{features}} a general viewing {{area on the}} first floor and another viewing area upstairs with a bar. There is also a kitchen area that is used for when bonspiels and tournaments provide food for the participants. Locker rooms are also provided for men and women. The lockers can be rented by member of the club. There is a little store within the club that sells curling equipment. There are six sheets, but often when national championships are being hosted one of the <b>end</b> <b>sheets</b> is used as a viewing area with bleachers. The building also holds a skating rink on the opposite side, separate from the curling club.|$|E
50|$|The firm of Garrett {{also sought}} a {{reliable}} stayless firebox for their smaller boilers at {{around the same}} time in the 1920s. Their solution was more conventional: a conventional outer firebox enclosed an inner firebox, where the inner crown sheet was formed into a curved valley. For a small firebox, this acted as a girder stay between the <b>end</b> <b>sheets</b> of the firebox and was sufficient to be self-supporting. The portable engines used this pattern alone. For the slightly more powerful road tractor boilers, the inner firebox was still self-supporting but the outer wrapper now required crosswise sling stays to support it, where previously it would have been supported by the stays to the inner firebox.|$|E
30|$|The girder {{repaired}} {{using one}} layer CFRP sheets failed by rupture of {{the sheets and}} the beam repaired using two layers CFRP sheets attached with the tension flange only failed by debonding at the <b>end</b> of the <b>sheets.</b> This debonding is hidden by wrapping the sheet on the web in beam RB 8 and by wrapping strips of GFRP at the CFRP <b>sheet</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sleek {{fastback}} styling {{characterized the}} B-bodied Streamliner Torpedo. The roofline swept from the windshield {{to the rear}} bumper in one smooth curve. The front <b>end</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{was the same as}} on the Deluxe Torpedo and trim difference between sixes and eights were also the same. Streamliner Sixes were in Series 26. Streamliner Eights were in Series 28. Beige corded wool cloth upholstery. There was also a Super Streamliner Torpedo subseries. Supers had the same body styling and trim but featured two-tone worsted wool cloth upholstery with pin stripes. They also added sponge rubber seat cushions, electric clocks, deluxe flexible steering wheels and divan type seats with folding center armrests. Two bodystyles were available: a 5-passenger 2-door Sedan Coupe and a 5-passenger 4-door Sedan.|$|R

50|$|The codex is made {{of animal}} skins folded into 39 sheets. Each sheet is a square 27 cm by 27 cm (11x11 inches), for a total length of nearly 11 meters (35 feet). All but the <b>end</b> <b>sheets</b> are painted on both sides, {{providing}} 76 pages. The codex is read from right to left. Pages 29-46 are oriented perpendicular {{to the rest of}} the codex. The top of this section is the right side of page 29, and the scenes are read from top to bottom. So the reader must rotate the manuscript 90 degrees in order to view the codex correctly. The Codex Borgia is organized into a screen-fold. Single sheets of the hide are attached as a long strip and then folded back and forth. Images were painted on both sides and painted over with a white gesso. Stiffened leather are used as end pieces by gluing the first and last strips in order to create a cover. The edges of the pages are overlapped and glued together, making the sheet edges hardly visible under the white gesso finish. The gesso creates a stiff, smooth, white finished surface that preserves the images below.|$|E
40|$|Hamilton Sundstrand (HS), {{together}} with NASA Johnson Space Center, developed methods to metallurgically join graphite fiber to aluminum. The {{goal of the}} effort was to demonstrate improved thermal conductance, tensile strength and manufacturability compared to existing epoxy bonded techniques. These improvements {{have the potential to}} increase the performance and robustness of phase change material heat sinks that use graphite fibers as an interstitial material. Initial work focused on evaluating joining techniques from 4 suppliers, each consisting of a metallization step followed by brazing or soldering of one inch square blocks of Fibercore graphite fiber material to aluminum <b>end</b> <b>sheets.</b> Results matched the strength and thermal conductance of the epoxy bonded control samples, so two suppliers were down-selected for a second round of braze development. The second round of braze samples had up to a 300 % increase in strength and up to a 132 % increase in thermal conductance over the bonded samples. However, scalability and repeatability proved to be significant hurdles with the metallization approach. An alternative approach was pursued which used nickel and active braze allows to prepare the carbon fibers for joining with aluminum. This approach was repeatable and scalable with improved strength and thermal conductance when compared with epoxy bonding...|$|E
40|$|Five {{improvements}} {{are reported in}} cold-plate fabrication. This cold plate {{is part of a}} thermal control system designed to serve on space missions. The first improvement is the merging of the <b>end</b> <b>sheets</b> of the cold plate with the face sheets of the structural honeycomb panel. The cold plate, which can be a brazed assembly, uses the honeycomb face sheet as its end sheet. Thus, when the honeycomb panel is fabricated, the face sheet that is used is already part of the cold plate. In addition to reducing weight, costs, and steps, the main benefit of this invention is that it creates a more structurally sound assembly. The second improvement involves incorporation of the header into the closure bar to pass the fluid to a lower layer. Conventional designs have used a separate header, which increases the geometry of the system. The improvement reduces the geometry, thus allowing the cold plate to fit into smaller area. The third improvement eliminates the need of hose, tube, or manifold to supply the cooling fluid externally. The external arrangement can be easily damaged and is vulnerable to leakage. The new arrangement incorporates an internal fluid transfer tube. This allows the fluid to pass from one cold plate to the other without any exposed external features. The fourth improvement eliminates separate fabrication of cold plate(s) and structural members followed by a process of attaching them to each other. Here, the structural member is made of material that can be brazed just as that of the cold plate. Now the structural member and the cold plate can be brazed at the same time, creating a monolithic unit, and thus a more structurally sound assembly. Finally, the fifth improvement is the elimination of an additional welding step that can damage the braze joints. A tube section, which is usually welded on after the braze process, is replaced with a more structurally sound configuration that can be brazed {{at the same time as}} the rest of the cold plate...|$|E

25|$|The 2013 models gain a new front <b>end</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{along with}} {{standard}} HID headlamps, {{along with a}} new LED tail light assembly. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger Brembo front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach 200+mph safely. Ford says the changes {{have resulted in a}} 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 is a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs.

5000|$|A new, trimmer El Camino was {{unveiled}} in 1978, adopting the new, more sharp-edged Malibu styling, and a one-inch longer wheelbase of 117 in. The front <b>end</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and doors were {{shared with the}} Malibu, and the rear tailgate and bumper was shared with the Malibu station wagon. For the first time, though, the El Camino had a unique chassis - it was shared with no other Chevrolet. The front end featured a new single rectangular headlight design. The base engine was a 200-cubic-inch (3.3-liter) V6 that developed , except in California where, to meet emissions standards, the 231-cubic-inch Buick engine was the base engine [...] Two upgrades could be ordered: a 305-cubic-inch V8 with , or a 350-cubic-inch V8 with [...] that was only available in El Caminos and Malibu station wagons.

5000|$|Beyond {{the senior}} Packard grille and front <b>end</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, Executives were further {{distinguished}} from the Clipper line by a unique side trim design that made reference to the senior Packards, and allowed for two-toned paint schemes. However, the interior appointments and instrumentation were pure Clipper. The prototypes produced for the all-new 1957 Packard and Clipper lines show an all-new Executive that would become a baseline Packard. All 1957 Clippers would have an all-new body which shared many inner panels with the all-new large Studebaker. Body panel sharing was the new plan for Studebaker-Packard models. Unfortunately the Insurance Companies would not finance the ambitious plan, and SPC was forced to retrench and ended up sharing body panels with the midsize Studebaker models. There was a 1957 Clipper, the last year to carry that name. Originally, {{the plan was to}} call the 1957 model an Executive. It was hoped to be a bridge car until an all-new big Packard could be introduced. See Facel-Vega for a 1959 proposal for a rebadged Packard.|$|R
