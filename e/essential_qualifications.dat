60|$|Sir Charles Bowen's {{translation}} of the Eclogues and the first six books of the AEneid is hardly {{the work of a}} poet, but it is a very charming version for all that, combining as it does the fine loyalty and learning of a scholar with the graceful style of a man of letters, two <b>essential</b> <b>qualifications</b> for any one who would render in English verse the picturesque pastorals of Italian provincial life, or the stately and polished epic of Imperial Rome. Dryden was a true poet, but, for some reason or other, he failed to catch the real Virgilian spirit. His own qualities became defects when he accepted the task of a translator. He is too robust, too manly, too strong. He misses Virgil's strange and subtle sweetness and has but little of his exquisite melody. Professor Conington, on the other hand, was an admirable and painstaking scholar, but he was so entirely devoid of literary tact and artistic insight that he thought that the majesty of Virgil could be rendered in the jingling manner of Marmion, and though there is certainly far more of the mediaeval knight than of the moss-trooper about AEneas, even Mr. Morris's version is not by any means perfect. Compared with professor Conington's bad ballad it is, of course, as gold to brass; considered simply as a poem it has noble and enduring qualities of beauty, music and strength; but it hardly conveys to us the sense that the AEneid is the literary epic of a literary age. There is more of Homer in it than of Virgil, and the ordinary reader would hardly realise from the flow and spirit of its swinging lines that Virgil was a self-conscious artist, the Laureate of a cultured Court. The AEneid bears almost the same relation to the Iliad that the Idylls of the King do to the old Celtic romances of Arthur. Like them it is full of felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of delicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England so did Virgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple of empire are equally dear to both poets; but neither of them has the grand simplicity or the large humanity of the early singers, and, as a hero, AEneas is no less a failure than Arthur. Sir Charles Bowen's version hardly gives us this peculiar literary quality of Virgil's verse, and, now and then, it reminds us, by some awkward inversion, {{of the fact that it}} is a translation; still, on the whole, it is extremely pleasant to read, and, if it does not absolutely mirror Virgil, it at least brings us many charming memories of him.|$|E

50|$|The seven {{stages of}} wisdom that {{characterize}} a Jivanmukta were mentioned by Ribhu to his son, Nidāgha, in the Varahu Upanishad, which stages are - a) Shubhecha ('good desire or intention'), b) Vicharana ('enquiry and contemplation'), c) Tanumanasi ('the mind rid of hankering after objects'), d) Sattvapatti ('the purified Chit {{resting on the}} Atman'), e) Asamsakti ('perfect non-attachment to objects'), f) Padartha-bhavana ('analysis of objects or love for objects'), g) Turiyattita ('superconsciouness' or moksha).

50|$|What {{skill set}} {{is needed to}} {{successfully}} serve {{in the role of}} Chief Information Officer in higher education? A review of the literature provides some useful perspectives. Linda Fleit (1999), the former president and founder of the IT Consulting Firm Edutech International from 1985 to 2008 and through this experience, well acquainted with the role CIOs in higher education institutions, indicated seven areas which she felt were requirements for CIOs. These included (as cited in Hawkins, 2004): 1) a clear vision about the role on information technology in higher education; 2) excellent oral and written communication and listening skills; 3) ability to form alliances and relationships with key campus constituents; 4) the ability to work collaboratively and effectively; 5) the ability to make and back hard decisions; 6) the ability to manage resources judiciously, and 7) deep expertise and knowledge in at least one aspect of technology. Cash and Pearlson (2004), representing the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and the Concours Group, respectively, identify leadership, business and technical competencies as essential for CIOs in higher education. Carol A. Cartwright (2002), who served as president of Kent State University from 1991 to 2006 and who is currently serving as president of Bowling Green State University, sought several <b>essential</b> <b>qualifications</b> in a CIO who would be expected to serve as a full-fledged member of her “executive orchestra”: proven leadership skills, strong management skills, and an understanding of the difference between these two. Wayne Brown (2010b), the CIO at Excelsior College who has conducted annual surveys with CIOs and executive management on the role and effectiveness of CIOs since 2003, surveyed 440 CIOs in higher education in 2010 to determine what they considered the top skills needed to be effective in their positions. Brown (2010b) reported that a CIOs’ top five skills in order were: communication skills, leadership, technical knowledge, interpersonal skills and higher education knowledge. It {{is interesting to note that}} the same question posed to members of the management team at higher education institutions revealed that they ranked the same top five skills as important but in a different order: technical knowledge, communication skills, leadership, higher education knowledge, and interpersonal skills. Lastly, Hawkins (2004) identified five skills that he believed were critical to success as a CIO in higher education: strong communication skills, boundary-spanning ability (i.e. the ability to work across the silos that often exist at institutions), leadership ability, management experience, and a strong understanding of the academic environment.|$|E

It suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four millions of slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established universal suffrage. Exhibiting unparalleled magnanimity, it criminally punished no man for political offenses, and warmly welcomed all who proved loyalty by obeying the laws and dealing justly with their neighbors. It has steadily decreased with firm hand the resultant disorders of a great war, and initiated a wise and humane policy toward the Indians. The Pacific railroad and similar vast enterprises have been generously aided and successfully conducted, the public lands freely given to actual settlers, immigration protected and encouraged, and a full acknowledgment of the naturalized citizens' rights secured from European Powers. A uniform national currency has been provided, repudiation frowned down, the national credit sustained under the most extraordinary burdens, and new bonds negotiated at lower rates. The revenues have been carefully collected and honestly applied. Despite large annual reductions of the rates of taxation, the public debt has been reduced during General Grant's Presidency at the rate of a hundred millions a year, great financial crises have been avoided, and peace and plenty prevail throughout the land. Menacing foreign difficulties have been peacefully and honorably composed, and the honor and power of the nation kept in high respect throughout the world. This glorious record of the past is the party's best pledge for the future. We believe the people will not in trust the Government to any party or combination of men composed chiefly of those who have resisted every step of this beneficent progress.:Second: The recent amendments to the national constitution should be cordially sustained because they are right, -not merely tolerated because they are laws, -and should be carried out according to their spirit by appropriate legislation, the enforcement of which can safely be entrusted only to the party that secured those amendments.:Third: Complete liberty and exact equality in the enjoyment of all civil, political, and public rights should be established and effectually maintained throughout the Union by efficient and appropriate state and federal legislation. Neither the law nor its administration should admit any discrimination in respect of citizens by reason of race, creed, color, or previous condition of servitude.:Fourth: The national government should seek to maintain honorable peace with all nations, protecting its citizens everywhere, and sympathizing with all peoples who strive for greater liberty.:Fifth: Any system of the civil service, under which the subordinate positions of the government are considered rewards for mere party zeal, is fatally demoralizing, and we therefore for a reform of the system by laws which shall abolish the evils of patronage, and make honesty, efficiency, and fidelity the <b>essential</b> <b>qualifications</b> for public positions, without practically creating a life-tenure of office.:Sixth: We are opposed to further grants of public lands to corporations and monopolies, and demand that the national domain be set apart for free homes and people.:Seventh: The annual revenue, after paying current expenditures, pensions, and the interest on the public debt, should furnish a moderate balance for the reduction of the principal, and that revenue, except so much as may be derived from a tax upon tobacco and liquors, should be raised by duties upon importations, the details of which should be so adjusted as to aid in securing remunerative wages to labor, and to promote the industries, prosperity, and growth of the whole country.:Eight: We hold in undying honor the soldiers and sailors whose valor saved the Union. Their pensions are a sacred debt of the nation, and the widows and orphans of those who died for their country are entitled to the care of a generous and grateful people. We favor such additional legislation as will extend the bounty of the government to all our soldiers and sailors who were honorably discharged, and who, in the line of duty, became disabled, without regard to the length of service or the cause of such discharge.:Nine: The doctrine of Great Britain and other European powers concerning allegiance- [...] "once a subject always a subject" [...] -having at last, through the efforts of the Republican party, been abandoned, and the American idea of the individual's right to transfer allegiance having been accepted by European nations, it is the duty of our government to guard with jealous care the rights of adopted citizens against the assumption of unauthorized claims by their former governments, and we urge continued careful encouragement and protection of voluntary immigration.:Tenth: The franking privilege ought to be abolished, and the way prepared for a speedy reduction in the rates of postage.:Eleventh: Among the questions which press for attention is that which concerns the relations of capital and labor, and the Republican party recognizes the duty of so shaping legislation as to secure full protection and amplest field for capital, -and for labor, the creator of capital, the largest opportunities and a just share of the mutual profits of these two great servants of civilization.:Twelfth: We hold that congress and the President have only fulfilled an imperative duty in their measures for the suppression of violent and treasonable organizations in certain lately rebellious regions, and {{for the protection of the}} ballot-box, and therefore they are entitled to the thanks of the nation.:Thirteenth: We denounce repudiation of the public debt, in any form or disguise, as a national crime. We witness with pride the reduction of the principal of the debt, and of the rates of interest upon the balance, and confidently expect that our excellent national currency will be perfected by a speedy resumption of specie payment.:Fourteenth: The Republican party is mindful of its obligations to the loyal women of America for their noble devotion to the cause of freedom. Their admission to wider fields of usefulness is viewed with satisfaction, and the honest demand of any class of citizens for additional rights should be treated with respectful consideration.:Fifteenth: We heartily approve the action of congress in extending amnesty to those lately in rebellion, and rejoice in the growth of peace and fraternal feeling throughout the land.:Sixteenth: The Republican party proposes to respect the rights reserved by the people to themselves, as carefully as the powers delegated by them to the state and to the federal government. It disapproves of the resort to unconstitutional laws for the purpose of removing evil, by interference with rights not surrendered by the people to either the state or national government.:Seventeenth: It is the duty of the general government to adopt such measures as may tend to encourage and restore American commerce and shipbuilding.:Eighteenth: We believe that the modest patriotism, the earnest purpose, the sound judgement, the practical wisdom, the incorruptible integrity, and the illustrious services of Ulysses S. Grant have commended him to the heart of the American people, and with him at our head we start to-day upon a new march to victory.:Nineteenth: Henry Wilson, nominated for the Vice-Presidency, known to the whole land from the early days of the great struggle for liberty as an indefatigable laborer in all campaigns, an incorruptible legislator, and a representative man of American institutions, is worthy to associate with our great leader, and share the honors which we pledge our best efforts to bestow upon them.|$|E
