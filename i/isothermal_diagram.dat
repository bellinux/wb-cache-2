This diagram is useful to control the resin transfer moulding (RTM) process involved to obtain a composite material from a ceramic fibrous preform. The system under study is a precursor for the ceramic matrix, obtained after pyrolysis of the polymerized resin. The knowledge of the composite properties at the polymerized state is necessary to fully control this process. The cure kinetics of this system is investigated under both isothermal and dynamic curing conditions by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The kinetics of the reaction is satisfactorily described by a Kamal and Sourour (K-S) phenomenological model. The K-S parameters are identified from isothermal data, taking into account an initial degree of cure, assuming a fully cured system {{at the end of}} the isothermal idle time. The model is in good agreement with both dynamic and isothermal experimental data. The glass transition temperature (T-g) is determined by DSC analyses as a function of the degree of polymerization and confirmed by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), and the results are modelled by Di Benedetto's formula. The change of visco-elastic properties is investigated using oscillatory rheology under isothermal conditions. The cure kinetics model allows a gelation criterion to be identified by plotting the shear loss modulus G `' vs. the degree of cure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

These two substitution mechanisms are represented by the joins from the phlogopite molecule (K(, 2) Mg(, 6) Al(, 2) Si(, 6) O(, 20) (OH) (, 4)) to the Ti-OSD (Octahedral Site Deficiency) molecule (K(, 2) Mg(, 4) TiAl(, 2) Si(, 6) O(, 20) (OH) (, 4)) and to the Ti-eastonite molecule (K(, 2) Mg(, 5) TiAl(, 4) O(, 20) (OH) (, 4)), respectively.;The solubility of Ti in phlogopite increases with increasing temperature and decreases with increasing pressure. For a given starting composition the Ti-OSD/Ti-eastonite and the eastonite/phlogopite ratios in the phlogopite solid solution coexisting with rutile increase with decreasing Ti-content of the phlogopite. The variations in the proportions of the phlogopite and the Ti-OSD end members with variations in temperature and pressure are minor.;The compositions of the experimentally produced phlogopites in terms of the relative proportions of the end member molecules are similar to the compositions of phlogopites from mantle xenoliths, mantle derived, mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks and lower crustal granulites. Based on the experimental data, compositional diagrams including the two Ti-rich phlogopite end members and the sum of the Ti-free end members were contoured for temperature (isobaric <b>diagrams)</b> and pressure (<b>isothermal</b> <b>diagrams).</b> The application of such a phlogopite geothermobarometer to phlogopites from mantle xenoliths and lower crustal granulites gives temperatures and pressures in good agreement with the temperatures and pressures determined by independent geothermometers and geobarometers. The accuracy of the temperature determinations is better than that of the pressure determinations.;Since the geothermobarometer is based on a subsolidus experimental study, it can not be applied to phlogopites that crystallized from a melt. Although further refinements of the phlogopite geothermobarometer are needed, the relationships derived from the simplified experimental system form a basis for determining the physical conditions of phlogopite formation in the upper mantle and the lower crust...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThermodynamic phase equilibria in {{synthetic}} slags (Al 2 O 3 –CaO–FeO–SiO 2 –V 2 O 3) {{were investigated}} with 0 – 27 wt. % vanadium oxide corresponding to industrial coal–petroleum coke (petcoke) feedstock blends in a simulated gasifier environment. Samples encompassing coal–petcoke mixed slag compositions were equilibrated at 1500 °C in a 64 vol. % CO/ 36 vol. % CO 2 atmosphere (Po 2 ≈ 10 − 8 atm at 1500 °C) for 72 h, followed by rapid water quench, then analyzed by {{inductively coupled plasma}} optical emission spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy. With increasing CaO content, FeO content, or both; the slag homogeneity region expanded and a composition range exhibiting crystals was reduced. The mullite (Al 6 Si 2 O 13) crystalline phase was not present in the slags above 9 wt. % FeO while the karelianite (V 2 O 3) crystalline phase was always present in compositions studied if a sufficient amount of vanadium existed in the slag. Based on the present experimental equilibrium evaluation, a set of <b>isothermal</b> phase <b>diagrams</b> showing effects of CaO and FeO on thermodynamic phase stabilities in the vanadium-bearing slags is proposed. Some uses of the diagrams for potential industrial practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The phase equilibria of the Sn-Au-Ni system, {{including}} six <b>isothermal</b> section <b>diagrams</b> in the Sn-rich portion at 200 - 600 degrees C, {{as well as}} three vertical sections at Au:Ni = 1 : 1, 50 at. %Sn, and 40 at. %Sn, were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray diffraction, and metallography. The experimental results indicated that (1) there exists a ternary compound Sn 4 AuNi 2 that is stable up to about 400 degrees C, (2) there are larger solubilities of Au in the Ni 3 Sn 2 phase in the Sn-Ni system and Ni in the SnAu phase in the Sn-Au system, and (3) there is the two-phase equilibrium between Sn 2 Ni 3 and SnAu compounds below 400 degrees C, rather than the continuous phase region from the Sn 2 Ni 3 to the SnAu phases reported previously. Thermodynamic assessment of the Sn-Au-Ni system was also carried out by using the calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) method, in which the Gibbs energies of the liquid, fee, and hcp phases are described by the subregular solution model and that of compounds, including a ternary compound, are represented by the sublattice model. The thermodynamic parameters for describing each phase were optimized and good agreement between the calculated and experimental results was obtained...|$|R
