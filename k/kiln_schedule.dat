One study was conducted at a commercial sawmill with trees harvested in central Arizona. The other study was conducted at the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin, in small experimental kilns with lumber from trees harvested in central Idaho. The three main variables in the studies were top loading, presteaming, and a high-temperature <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule.</b> A limited study of hot press drying was also included. The high-temperature <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule</b> in the experimental kilns reduced drying time to about half that of the conventional temperature schedule. Press drying time was slightly more than 3 h. Crook and bow caused most of the warp and the grade loss from warp. There {{was no evidence that}} presteaming affected warp or grade loss from warp. Top loading had a modest effect in reducing warp and grade loss from warp. High-temperature drying did not affect measured warp compared with the conventional temperature schedule. Grade loss from warp was less in high-temperature than in conventional temperature dried lumber. This might be explained by differences in moisture content change during storage. Press drying did not reduce warp or grade loss from warp. Keywords: kiln drying, warp, ponderosa pine, smalldiameter timber August 2001 Simpson, William T.; Green, David W. 2001.

40|$|Log sorting is {{necessary}} when processing aspen saw-dry-rip (SDR) to select optimum log diameter and to minimize number of logs with dark-colored centers. Wetwood, which {{is difficult to}} dry, is commonly associated with these dark centers. SDR processing involves drying 7 / 4 - to 8 / 4 -thick live-sawn flitches. Drying the flitch and then sawing studs produces straighter studs than sawing first and drying in stud form. High-temperature kiln drying (230 o F to 240 o F) has given good results with several species (such as, basswood and yellow-poplar).

In China it has been cultivated as a timber species for over 1000 years; however, the species does not appear to have been planted much outside China and Taiwan. Physical, mechanical, and drying properties of three stands of New Zealand-grown C. lanceolata were assessed and anatomical and pulping studies were reviewed. Results clearly showed that mechanical and physical wood properties of New Zealand-grown C. lanceolata are numerically lower than those of native-grown (Chinese/ Taiwanese) C. lanceolata. The main factor is a lower basic density resulting in reduced strength; shrinkage, however, appears to be fairly constant. In comparison to Pinus radiata D.

Depth (below the wood surface) and thickness of kiln brown stain were also determined in the dried P. radiata. Using stepped kiln schedules with either high air velocities or high relative humidity reduced development of kiln brown stain compared to accelerated conventional temperature 90760 °C drying, but considerably longer drying times were needed.

The moisture gradients within test boards were also simulated by the computer program and actually monitored by a thermo-moisture meter constructed by J. Forrer (1984). The measurements of moisture gradients in single boards and across a stack of boards were made in a small experimental kiln and in an industrial kiln respectively using a common <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule.</b> In spite of correctable temperature effects on the monitored D.

After adjustments of computer inputs, the simulated drying curves came into very good agreement with the actual drying curves. The same was true for moisture gradients predicted by the simulation and monitored by the thermo-moisture meter. Thus, Hart's computer simulation originally developed for and verified on white oak lumber worked for the drying of Douglas-fir heartwood lumber as well.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Forest and Wood Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{discolouration}} of South African softwood during kiln {{drying can}} reduce the value of furniture grade lumber. Thermal discolouration of wood, as found due to heat treatment, produces a homogeneously browner colour in wood than is normally expected. This type of discolouration is attributed to reactions of the macromolecules present in wood and is found in both hard- and softwoods. Yellow stain and kiln brown stain can severely alter the colour of the outer few millimeters of a wooden board and is attributed to the reaction of water-soluble sugars and nitrogenous compounds, present in the wood sap, after deposition at the wood surface due to liquid or capillary water flow during drying. A discussion of the mechanism of discolouration due to yellow stain and kiln brown stain would be incomplete without {{a good understanding of}} the liquid flow of water during drying above fibre saturation point. This thesis brings the two concepts of liquid water flow and discolouration in context and is presented in four chapters: • an introduction motivating the aims of the investigation (Chapter 1); • a literature review of factors which may influence discolouration and liquid water flow during drying (Chapter 2); • original manuscripts describing the discolouration of South African softwood and liquid water flow in hard- and softwood (Chapter 3); and • a final conclusion that links up the results from the investigations (Chapter 4). The investigations into the occurrence of yellow stain and kiln brown stain showed that the intensity of these types of discolouration was influenced by geographical origin (and/or climate), tree species, planing depth of dried lumber, and <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule</b> parameters like dry- and wet bulb temperature and time. The characteristic discolouration pattern of yellow stain and kiln brown stain indicated that this stain type was related to the wetline phenomenon that is found during the liquid water flow phase of drying wet wood. Thermal discolouration, on the other hand, occurred homogeneously throughout the volume of lumber and is, therefore, not related to free water flow, but to chemical changes of the macromolecules in wood. The results of the liquid water flow investigations support the invasion percolation theory of drying that states that the largest meniscus will retract into a drying liquid-filled capillary network until it is not the largest meniscus anymore. Fluctuations in the rate of moisture loss from the cores of wood pieces above fibre saturation point were also found. The pattern of fluctuation differed appreciably between Betula verrucosa and Pinus radiata. In both cases, the start of the last phase in rate of moisture loss from the core coincided with a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the drying wood piece. This behaviour is explained by the hypothesis that distinct capillary size classes are emptied of free water, in order, from large to small. As smaller capillaries are emptied, the capillary forces become greater, {{to the point where the}} forces are great enough to cause permanent or temporary deformation of the remaining water-filled capillaries. Classification and regression tree analysis was a useful statistical technique to analyse a large multivariate dataset. The importance of <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule</b> temperatures and planing depth to control yellow stain and kiln brown stain was clearly pointed out by the technique, which can help to simplify the control of colour quality during the industrial processing of wood...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} kiln drying of radiata pine with a primary focus on the change in wood colour that occurs during this process. The energy {{efficiency}} of the drying process has also been examined using computer modelling. The aim of this work was to develop guidelines for commercial wood dryers who wish to produce high quality appearance grade timber in a competitive commercial environment. The colour change in radiata pine wood during kiln drying is mainly caused by sap compounds accumulating at the wood surface and reacting to form coloured compounds. The initial research involved drying experiments designed to determine the relationship between this colour change and the <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule</b> and also measure the accumulation of colour forming compounds. The kinetics of the colour change reaction were also measured using two methods, one in-vitro and the other using small samples of wood. From these experiments a colour change equation was developed that predicts the rate of colour formation based on the drying conditions and this was incorporated into a kiln stack model along with an energy efficiency model. The combined model was used to simulate the drying process to find schedules optimised for energy use and wood quality. The model was also used to simulate the energy efficiency of different humidity control configurations for wood drying kilns. A kiln micro-sensor system was also developed for use in kiln diagnostics and control with the particular aim of identifying areas in wood drying kilns with adverse drying conditions. The recommendation to kiln operators wishing to reduce colour change is to not exceed 70 ? and to use lower relative humidity schedules with a wet bulb depression of 15 - 20 ?. Operating at lower humidity can increase the energy used by the kiln so it is also recommended that kiln designers incorporate heat recovery into the humidity control mechanisms of the kiln...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 As lumber {{producers}} {{are faced with}} a diminished and increasingly expensive raw material, the need to maximize resource recovery will increase. Trim-ends (particularly from waned boards) often contain some of the highest quality wood in any given log and lack functionality only in length. This waste, traditionally chipped for pulp, can be finger-jointed into lumber if the material can be dried properly for gluing. This research explores how different length submerchantable pieces dry relative to each other and merchantable lumber when subjected to typical commercial drying schedules as well as how trim-ends in two different charge configurations perform in a conventional dry kiln. Sixteen -foot long, Douglas-fir boards in nominal four, six and eight inch widths were used to produce simulated trim-ends in 0. 5 -, 1. 0 -, 1. 5 -, 2. 0 -, 2. 5 - and 3. 5 -foot lengths. Eight-foot-long boards were also dried as a comparison to the simulated trimends. One course of each width was stacked tight while a second was stacked with a 0. 375 inch space between the ends of the blocks. Four charges were dried using United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommended schedules for high and low grade Douglas-fir. Eight by four foot, self stickered aluminum racks with slots corresponding to each of the sampled widths and a wire-mesh box (random piled), loaded with actual trim-ends and subjected to the USDA low-grade Douglas-fir schedule, were compared. Although it was demonstrated that length affects the final moisture content of pieces with similar anatomy and initial moisture content, it is not a significant factor in determining the mean final moisture content of the average charge of short blocks. Using the methods in this experiment, sorting by length would not be necessary. Current commercial kiln schedules are likely in appropriate for drying short pieces. An applicable schedule should be developed using real time moisture content monitoring in the kiln (i. e. load-cells). Providing a space between blocks can significantly accelerate the drying rate of fresh lumber and may have a greater effect when combined with an appropriate <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule.</b> The aluminum racks and the wire-mesh box exhibited comparable final moisture content deviation when used to dry trim-ends.

40|$|The {{modification}} of schedules {{to meet new}} conditions is tradi-tionally a trial-and-error process.

40|$|Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. (Chinese fir) is an {{evergreen}} conifer occurring {{naturally in}} the sub-tropical region of central - southern China. C. lanceolata {{is considered one}} of the most important trees in China, in terms of areas of planting, timber production and timber usage; it has been cultivated as a timber species for over 1000 years and as such its silviculture is well developed. The species has not been planted (commercially) much outside China and Taiwan. The aim of this thesis was to provide, by way of physiological and genetic experiments (of seedlings) on a variety of provenances, information on the prospects for growing C. lanceolata as a commercial forest tree species in New Zealand. Additional factors such as growth pattern and habit, wood properties, palatability to opossums, and climate modelling were also examined. Provenance differences, while reported in the literature, were not so apparent in this study. Isozyme analysis of seed from eight of the eleven seedlots used in this study showed low levels of variability both as a species and between provenances, while a nursery trial did not produce any significant differences in terms of second year height growth or bud burst. However, length of growing season as evidenced by date of bud set did show some variation; with bud set being strongly correlated with latitude, mean annual temperature, mean temperature of the coldest month, and temperature sum. Similarly in the requirement of winter chilling in order to promote bud burst a north-south trend was apparent, as with the nursery trial, with northern provenances bursting fewer buds when little or no chilling was received. For the purposes of this study, however, the only observed difference which is important is the degree of bud set at the end of the growing season, with the closely correlated degree of frost damage. Northern provenances which set bud earlier are therefore better suited to New Zealand conditions. Growth of C. lanceolata responded greatly to temperature: Significant differences were seen between low and high day temperatures, with greatest growth at 28 °c. This is closely related to temperatures during its growth period in China; there, rapid growth occurs between June and September when mean monthly temperatures range from about 22 to 30 °C. There are few sites in New Zealand which have mean monthly temperatures this high over summer. Winter frost resistance was found to be adequate for most New Zealand sites and compares favourably with New Zealand podocarps and P. radiata. Hardiness values were - 15. 5 to - 15. 9 °C. Conversely however, C. lanceolata was very susceptible to out of season frosts; a heavy frost of - 5 °C resulted in 100 % mortality. Lighter frosts in autumn (ca. - 0. 5 to - 3. 5 °C) killed growing tips of seedlings that had not set bud. In choosing sites for the species, out of season frosts are likely to be a major limiting factor. Water requirements were high; new leaf growth was almost 50 % higher for unstressed seedlings (100 % field capacity) than for stressed seedlings (30 and 15 % field capacity). Mortality was also greater at the lowest water level although tolerance to low levels can be developed in well established seedlings at the expense of growth. Recovery of stressed seedlings was apparent after two weeks of rewatering to field capacity; however rates of photosynthesis were still significantly lower than those of unstressed seedlings and conversely stomatal resistance was greater. This suggests that long term (morphological) change had occurred in stressed seedlings. The nutrient experiment showed that nutrient deficiencies and poor growth occurred in seedlings grown at low nutrient levels. Greatest growth was found at high levels compared with other tree species, and tissue analysis also revealed comparatively high levels of foliar concentrations. There was evidence of mycorrhizal colonization resulting in greater seedling growth compared to seedlings that were non-mycorrhizal. However the response was less significant than overall nutrient status and was only apparent at high nutrient levels. Thus the species has a requirement for fertile soils and application of fertilisers. Temperature affected photosynthesis more than did light intensity. At 20 °C light saturation was approached at approximately one third of full sunlight (640 µE) while at 28 °C the response curve was still increasing. Light compensation point was low (20 µE) compared to P. radiata (39 µE). Seedling appearance was also greener when grown under 30 % shade cloth as opposed to full sunlight where seedlings appeared yellowed. This and studies on mixed stands and C. lanceolata's ecology suggest that the species prefers weak sunlight or low light intensities. Other experiments examined the growth pattern and habit of C. lanceolata. The species has a definite seasonal pattern of shoot growth; following bud burst in early September growth was typically sigmoid, slowing down and ceasing around April when buds were set. Small sized resting buds were formed over winter; no height growth occurred from May through to August (winter) until early September when buds began to swell and burst again. The growing season in New Zealand was approximately 8 months, the small size of the bud suggested that predetermined growth was only a minor part of the total season's growth and free growth must therefore follow. Estimation of seasonal shoot growth in mature (25 year old) trees indicated that less than half of a season's shoot growth was predetermined. Free growth allows C. lanceolata to maximise potential growing conditions while the predetermined component acts as a buffer against unfavourable years. Seedlings grown under an 8 hour daylength did not show any difference in growth to those under natural summer daylengths, and there was no sign of bud formation: However seedlings under high day (22 and 24 °C) and low night (9 and 7 °C) temperatures, and long (16 hour) photoperiod showed signs of dormancy after one month. Most seedlings had formed terminal resting buds and had adopted a brown winter colouration. Low night temperatures of 9 °C or less were therefore primarily responsible for bud set. C. lanceolata did not exhibit true dormancy in the sense that chilling was required before growth could resume under favourable conditions. However chilling did significantly hasten bud burst. Provenance differences were noticed when no chilling or very light chilling was applied; however after long periods of chilling all provenances burst bud more or less immediately. This suggests that under natural New Zealand conditions rapid bud burst would occur in all provenances. In addition to defining the species' requirements for (successful) growth, the presence of one 58 -year-old stand in New Plymouth and two 25 -year-old plots in Rotorua enabled a preliminary study on wood properties to be made. Basic densities were lower than much of the native grown (Chinese) C. lanceolata and considerably lower than the range for P. radiata in New Zealand. The low basic density resulted in lower strength values for mechanical properties (bending, compression, shear tests). Drying rates were very similar to P. radiata and air drying or drying under a conventional (high temperature) P. radiata <b>kiln</b> <b>schedule</b> produce very little degrade. The low strength and basic density of the timber makes C. lanceolata less suitable for structural uses compared with P. radiata, and more suited to end uses where strength is not important. Browse damage from opossums was also examined. Pen trials showed that there was a marked preference for P. radiata over C. lanceolata seedlings in the short term. However once P. radiata seedlings were eaten, C. lanceolata seedlings were then completely stripped over two nights. This suggests that damage at establishment may not initially be a problem, but that once opossums are familiar with C. lanceolata as a food source, damage may well increase. Global modelling using the WORLD program developed by Dr Trevor Booth showed a variety of countries as suitable for C. lanceolata, including those where the species has been planted and trialed. New Zealand sites were considered suitable when both uniform and winter rainfall distributions were included as parameters. A more detailed model for New Zealand developed by Dr Neil Mitchell was next used to identify specific areas. Results showed that C. lanceolata was climatically suited to a restricted range of sites, almost exclusively in the North Island. The experimental findings suggest that while New Zealand conditions may not be optimal for growth, the species nevertheless has (limited) prospects for establishment in New Zealand. Provenance differences in growth were not found at the early seedling stage of growth; however selection of provenances in terms of short growing season may be advantageous in reducing early autumn frost damage. The factors most likely to limit growth potential in New Zealand are: 1) Lower temperatures in the growing season. 2) Out of season frosts. 3) Water deficits, especially during summer. 4) Low fertility sites or lack of fertilising. 5) Possible browse damage by opossums. The climate model results agree with the findings from this study's experiments and furthermore, indicate specific locations. Again, however, the identified sites must also be assessed for the limiting factors given above (with the exception of low temperatures during the growing season) and this may further reduce potential sites...|$|E

40|$|Wood drying – {{important}} part of woodworking process, performed in economical and technological directions. A number of factors are encountered when drying the wood that influence the quality of dried material. High-quality dried wood is expensive and {{it is easier to}} process than wet wood. Wood drying schedules selection is a very {{important part}} of production cycle. A variety of wood drying schedules are tested and their efficiency verified, according to the drying time and final distribution of moisture content in dried wood. The wide variation of moisture content in wood after drying, cause a lot of trouble to process wood further. Main goal of this scientific work – identify the influence of place in the drying <b>kiln</b> and drying <b>schedule</b> on moisture content distribution in wood. The study of wood drying is carried out in a convection drying chamber with electronic humidity and temperature sensors and computer controls (RGK 170, CSA Electronic, Germany). Four different modes of low temperature drying are applied. Wood drying schedules are adjusted based on wood species that will be drying. Birch (lat. Betula) wood was used for the production of samples. The tests were carried out by drying 37 mm thickness birch wood to get 7. 5 % final moisture content of the wood. 240 birch wood samples has been made and 12 drying process performed in order to identify the influence of place in the drying <b>kiln</b> and drying <b>schedule</b> on moisture content distribution in wood. Wood humidity distributions in the applied drying schedule and place in the drying chamber were determined. Each drying process duration was found. All four schedules of drying were evaluated and the results are given. Research has shown that drying schedules doesn‘t have the effect on moisture content distribution in wood. However the place in the drying kiln affects moisture content distribution in wood...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} research, {{the effect of}} three <b>kiln</b> drying <b>schedules</b> of T 5 -D 2, T 5 -D 4, and T 5 -D 6 on poplar wood {{mechanical}} properties was investigated. The lumber was dried in a convectional laboratory kiln and then the compression strength in a parallel and perpendicular direction toward the grain, hardness, and nail withdrawal resistance were evaluated. The obtained results indicated with change from schedule T 5 -D 2 to T 5 -D 4, compression strength whether parallel or perpendicular to grain, hardness in tangential, radial, and transverse surfaces as well as, nail withdrawal resistance in tangential, radial, and transverse surfaces increased up to 18. 1, 7. 1, 16. 4, 19. 7, 14. 1, 19. 8, 5. 7, and 9. 2 % respectively, as against schedule T 5 -D 2. Despite T 5 -D 4 schedule, compression strength parallel to grain dropped in specimens dried by schedule T 5 -D 6. However, nail withdrawal resistance of specimens dried by T 5 -D 6 schedule was higher in all the three surfaces than the two other schedules. As regards, the T 5 -D 6 schedule, compression strength perpendicular to grain and also hardness in all the three surfaces rose as opposed to that of T 5 -D 2 schedule, but showed a decrease {{in comparison to the}} corresponding figure in T 5 -D 4.

Silva Fennica 41 (4) : 717 – 730. Deformations of timber, caused mainly by anisotropic shrinkage, can be partially directed by controlling annual ring orientation through different sawing patterns. Ring orientation also affects {{the movement of}} water from within the board to its surface, with rapidity of drying having implications for the wood colour. Here sawn silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) timber was classed into two groups according to ring orientation. Two drying methods were used. The final moisture content was lower and the colour lighter in dried boards with radial than with tangential flats, but deformations were larger in radial than in tangential boards. Both drying and ring orientation affected the final moisture content and moisture gradient of the boards. Very small differences in board sizes or shape {{had an effect on}} both colour and deformations. The results support the need for accurate sawing and for classing silver birch timber sawn into parquet billets according to ring orientation in order to optimise the drying quality.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} drying of hardwood timber with particular reference to seasoning blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in a solar kiln. The aims {{of this research}} were to develop an optimised drying schedule for drying blackbutt and to develop and validate a mathematical model for a solar kiln. In {{the first stage of}} this study, the cross-grain physical and mechanical properties were determined for blackbutt timber so that an optimised schedule (based on drying within a limiting strain envelope) can be developed using model predictive control techniques for drying 43 mm thick (green) blackbutt timber boards in solar <b>kilns.</b> This optimised <b>schedule</b> has been developed and tested in the laboratory. The drying time was 10 % shorter for this schedule than the original schedule, compared with an expected reduction in drying time of 14 % (relative to the original schedule). Overall the quality was slightly better and the drying time was shorter for the optimised schedule compared with the original schedule. A complete solar kiln model has been developed and validated based on comparisons between the predicted and the measured internal air temperatures, relative humidities and timber moisture contents. The maximum difference between the actual and predicted moisture contents was 0. 05 kg kg- 1. The agreement between the predicted and measured temperatures of the internal air is reasonable, and both the predictions and measurements have a similar cyclical pattern. The generally good agreement between the model prediction of the final moisture content and its measurement {{may be due to the}} careful measurement of the boundary conditions such as the solar energy input. The key uncertainties were identified as the heat exchanger output, the measurement of the initial moisture content, the amount of accumulation of condensate on the floor, and the estimation of sky temperature. The significant uncertainty (18 %) in the estimation of the initial moisture content is a key reason for the mismatch between the model prediction and the measurements. In terms of operating variables, the energy release rate from the heat exchanger had the greatest effect on the simulated performance, followed by the water spray and venting rates. The simulation suggested that a material with a lower transmissivity to thermal radiation may effectively lower radiation losses, improving the kiln performance, so such materials for glazing is a high priority...|$|R
40|$|Scheduling {{research}} has mainly focused on development of efficientÃ‚Â· algorithms for solving deterministic and single criterion models {{to overcome the}} associated computational time complexity. However, scheduling in practice, demands development of effective approaches in order {{to fill the gap}} between the theory and practice. As many other decision processes, scheduling usually involves imprecisely defined problem parameters and multiple conflicting criteria in real-life domains. This thesis aims to put forward novel methodologies for solving some real-life production scheduling problems. In particular two problems have been tackled that are faced in the production process of the collaborating establishment Denby Pottery Ltd: an integrated loading and scheduling problem of a batch processing kiln that is used to fire glazed products and scheduling of parallel flow-lines where products to be input to the firing kiln are glazed. The first problem concerns both short-term criteria of relevance to the shop-floor and criteria that are related to the longer term objectives of the firm. The short-term objectives, which are reduction of energy consumption and work-in-process inventories, can be modelled using crisp objective functions. The longer-term objectives of meeting financial targets of the firm and attaining balanced end-product inventory levels constitute imprecise goals to be achieved. Moreover, the relative importance of criteria is also iniprecisely defmed. A novel fuzzy goal programming method is developed for solving the <b>kiln</b> loading and <b>scheduling</b> problem. This method takes into account not only fuzzy goals but also fuzzy Ã‚Â•importance relations among the goals. A new fuzzy goal programming model of the problem is built. A prototype decision support system is developed that involves this model as its model base. The effectiveness of the developed methodolo. gy in producing different non-. dominated solutions has been demonstrated. The second problem considers scheduling of a set ofjobs on parallel non-identical flow. ~ ines with respect to sequence dependent set-ups, flow-line eligibilities and fuzzy due-dates. A hierarchical optimisation approach is proposed for solving the problem. In the first phase a s~redule maximising the minimum satisfaction degree with respect to the fuzzy due-dates is Ã‚Â·~ought. This is accomplished using a novel fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model : 3 f~~;problem. In the second phase further optimisation ofmachine utilisations is carried out '.;Und~r co~sideration of the solutions obtained in the first phase using a secondary model. The.,c~.
