Although {{the protein}} VHL (pVHL) {{was reported to}} be involved in the heart function, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that pVHL was upregulated in hearts from two types of genetically dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mice models. In comparison with the wild-type mouse, both DCM mice models showed a significant reduction in the expression of phospholamban (PLN), a potent inhibitor of sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase, and enhanced interaction between pVHL and PLN. To clarify whether pVHL is involved <b>in</b> <b>PLN</b> degradation <b>in</b> failing hearts, we used carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) -lowering reagent, to mimic the heart failure condition in PLN-expressing HEK 293 cells and found that CCCP treatment resulted <b>in</b> <b>PLN</b> degradation and increased interaction between PLN and pVHL.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a well-established animal model for rheumatoid arthritis. Methods. CIA was induced in female dark agouti rats. Inguinal (ILNs) and popliteal (PLNs) lymph nodes and distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) were retrieved at different time points. Tissues were processed for detection of PTHrP and cell marker proteins by immunohistochemistry. Lymph node RNA was extracted, and PTHrP mRNA quantified using competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results. Hyperplasia of ILNs was observed 2 days after injection, coinciding with the peak in PTHrP expression in ILNs (1240 373 gene copies/ng RNA vs normal 339 120, P_ 0. 05). Hyperplasia of PLNs was first seen at 1 day after onset of arthritis, coinciding with the peak in PTHrP expression <b>in</b> <b>PLNs</b> (2267 697 vs normal 781 136, P_ 0. 01).

For the constraints and challenges faced by PT PLN (Persero) Unit PLTU TJB Jepara related to the implementation of safety and health activities are followed up indiscipline of some employees related to the use of personal protective equipment and violations of the rules of safety and health such as smoking in the plant, with the making of a system sanctions for violators of safety rules and occupational health, as a means of controlling the enforcement of discipline. In terms of challenges, a form of socialization related to the rules and procedures for the safety and health of employees must be done by a variety of considerations level of education and social environment plural employees make the company must perform a different approach, so that the employees can receive and execute safety rules and health made by the company...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} examining the impact of job stress, communication and work environment on employee job satisfaction <b>in</b> PT. <b>PLN</b> (Persero) Cilacap Jawa Tengah. The object of this {{research was}} the employees of PT. PLN (Persero) Cilacap Jawa Tengah, namely: PLN APJ Cilacap, UPJ Sidareja and UPJ Majenang. The total number was 85 persons (census). This research applied multiple regression analysis, T test and T test. The study results revealed that job stress was negatively related to employee satisfaction, while communication and work environment positively affected employee job satisfaction <b>in</b> PT. <b>PLN</b> (Persero) Cilacap Jawa Tengah.

40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{identifying}} changes in gene expression in CD 4 + T cells during the development of diabetes in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, we used DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression in CD 4 + T cells from the pancreatic draining lymph nodes of NOD/BDC 2. 5 T cell receptor transgenic and WT NOD mice at different ages. At 4 and 6 weeks of age, we found up-regulation {{of a number of}} genes that are known to be induced by IFN-α. IFN-α levels and IFN-α–producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells were increased <b>in</b> the <b>PLNs</b> of 3 - to 4 -week-old NOD mice. Moreover, blockade of IFN-α receptor 1 in NOD mice by a neutralizing antibody at 2 – 3 weeks of age significantly delayed the onset and decreased the incidence of type 1 diabetes, increased the relative number of immature dendritic cells <b>in</b> the <b>PLNs,</b> and enhanced the ability of spleen CD 4 + T cells to produce IL- 4 and IL- 10. These findings demonstrate that IFN-α <b>in</b> the <b>PLNs</b> is an essential initiator in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice...|$|R
40|$|It is {{not known}} how naive B cells compute {{divergent}} chemoattractant signals of the T-cell area and B-cell follicles during in vivo migration. Here, we used two-photon microscopy of peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) to analyze the prototype G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) CXCR 4, CXCR 5, and CCR 7 during B-cell migration, {{as well as the}} integrin LFA- 1 for stromal guidance. CXCR 4 and CCR 7 did not influence parenchymal B-cell motility and distribution, despite their role during B-cell arrest in venules. In contrast, CXCR 5 played a nonredundant role in B-cell motility in follicles and in the T-cell area. B-cell migration in the T-cell area followed a random guided walk model, arguing against directed migration in vivo. LFA- 1, but not α 4 integrins, contributed to B-cell motility <b>in</b> <b>PLNs.</b> However, stromal network guidance was LFA- 1 independent, uncoupling integrin-dependent migration from stromal attachment. Finally, we observed that despite a 20 -fold reduction of chemokine expression <b>in</b> virus-challenged <b>PLNs,</b> CXCR 5 remained essential for B-cell screening of antigen-presenting cells. Our data provide an overview of the contribution of prototype GPCRs and integrins during naive B-cell migration and shed light on the local chemokine availability that these cells compute...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{characterize}} {{clinical outcomes}} {{in patients with}} intermediate or high-risk endometrial carcinoma who underwent surgical staging with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with intermediate or high-risk endometrial adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical staging with (PPALN group) or without (PLN) para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Data were collected, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and univariate and multivariate analyses performed to compare differences in adjuvant therapy, disease recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results. 118 patients {{were included in the}} PPALN group and 139 <b>in</b> the <b>PLN</b> group. Patients <b>in</b> the PPALN group were more likely to receive adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (25. 4 % versus 11. 5 %, OR= 2. 5, P= 0. 03) and less likely to receive adjuvant multimodal combination therapy (17. 81 % versus 28. 8 %, OR= 0. 28, P= 0. 002). DFS was improved <b>in</b> the <b>PLN</b> group as compared to PPALN (80 % versus 62 %, P= 0. 02). OS was equivalent (P= 0. 93). Patients in the PPALN group who had less than 10 para-aortic nodes removed were twice as likely to recur than patients who had 10 or more para-aortic nodes or patients <b>in</b> the <b>PLN</b> group (HR 2. 08, CI 1. 20 – 3. 60, P= 0. 009). Conclusions. Patients <b>in</b> the <b>PLN</b> group were more likely to receive multimodal adjuvant therapy and had better DFS than the PPALN group. Pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy may represent an effective treatment option for patients with intermediate or high-risk disease. If systematic para-aortic lymphadenectomy is performed and less than 10 para-aortic lymph nodes are obtained, multimodality adjuvant therapy should be considered to improve DFS...|$|R
