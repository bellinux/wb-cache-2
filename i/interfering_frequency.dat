40|$|The {{effect of}} {{spectrum}} sensing errors {{on the performance}} of cognitive radio transmission based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is evaluated by deriving analytical expressions for the average capacity and the average bit error rate as functions of different spectrum sensing parameters and data transmission parameters in the Rayleigh fading channels. Both the case with carrier frequency offset and the case without carrier frequency offset are considered. Numerical results are presented to show that spectrum sensing errors cause significant performance degradation and that the amount of performance degradation depends on the specific values of sensing and transmission parameters. In particular, the performance degradation caused by the primary user interference is more sensitive to the interfering amplitude and the number of subcarriers than to the probability of detection in spectrum sensing, the <b>interfering</b> <b>frequency</b> and the availability of the licensed band. Numerical results also show that the primary user interference caused by the sensing errors is dominant for small to medium values of the operating signal-to-noise ratio, while the inter-carrier interference caused by carrier frequency offset is dominant for large values of the operating signal-to-noise ratio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{biomedical}} amplifiers have a {{very high}} common mode rejection ratio. Nevertheless, recordings are often contaminated by residual power-line interference. Traditional analogue and digital filters are known to suppress ECG components near to the power-line frequency. Different types of digital notch filters are widely used despite their inherent contradiction: tolerable signal distortion needs a narrow frequency band, which leads to ineffective filtering in cases of larger frequency deviation of the interference. Adaptive filtering introduces unacceptable transient response time, especially after steep and large QRS complexes. Other available techniques such as Fourier transform do not work in real time. The subtraction procedure is found to cope better with this problem. Method The subtraction procedure was developed some two decades ago, and almost totally eliminates power-line interference from the ECG signal. This procedure does not affect the signal frequency components around the <b>interfering</b> <b>frequency.</b> Digital filtering is applied on linear segments of the signal to remove the interference components. These interference components are stored and further subtracted from the signal wherever non-linear segments are encountered. Results Modifications of the subtraction procedure have been used in thousands of ECG instruments and computer-aided systems. Other work has extended this procedure to almost all possible cases of sampling rate and interference frequency variation. Improved structure of the on-line procedure has worked successfully regardless of the multiplicity between the sampling rate and the interference frequency. Such flexibility is due to the use of specific filter modules. Conclusion The subtraction procedure has largely proved advantageous over other methods for power-line interference cancellation in ECG signals. </p...|$|E

The proposed antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 3. 8 - 11. 1 GHz with for over the entire UWB bandwidth. Good return loss and radiation pattern characteristics are obtained in the frequency band of interest. The proposed antenna is designed on low cost FR- 4 substrate fed by a 50 -O micro strip line. The simulation was performed in CST 2012 software. The antenna parameters such as resonant frequency, return loss, radiation pattern and VSWR are simulated and discussed in this paper.

40|$|Doppler shift {{compensation}} behaviour in horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus rouxi, {{was used}} to test the interference of pure tones and narrow band noise with compensation performance. The distortions in Doppler shift compensation to sinusoidally frequency shifted echoes (modulation frequency: 0. 1 Hz, maximum frequency shift: 3 kHz) consisted of a reduced compensation amplitude and/or a shift of the emitted frequency to lower frequencies (Fig. 1). Pure tones at frequencies between 200 and 900 Hz above the bat's resting frequency (RF) disturbed the Doppler shift compensation, with a maximum of intererence between 400 and 550 Hz (Fig. 2). Minimum duration of pure tones for interference was 20 ms and durations above 40 ms were most effective (Fig. 3). Interfering pure tones arriving later than about 10 ms after the onset of the echolocation call showed markedly reduced interference (Fig. 4). Doppler shift compensation was affected by pure tones at the optimum <b>interfering</b> <b>frequency</b> with sound pressure levels down to â€“ 48 dB rel the intensity level of the emitted call (Figs. 5, 6). Narrow bandwidth noise (bandwidth from Â± 100 Hz to Â± 800 Hz) disturbed Doppler shift compensation at carrier frequencies between â€“ 250 Hz below and 800 Hz above RF with a maximum of interference between 250 and 500 Hz above resting frequency (Fig. 7). The duration and delay of the noise had similar influences on interference with Doppler shift compensation as did pure tones (Figs. 8, 9). Intensity dependence for noise interference was more variable than for pure tones (- 32 dB to - 45 dB rel emitted sound pressure level, Fig. 10). The temporal and spectral gating in Doppler shift compensation behaviour is discussed as an effective mechanism for clutter rejection by improving the processing of frequency and amplitude transients in the echoes of horseshoe bats. ...|$|E

A simple {{discussion}} is given {{on the origin}} of intermodulation distortion in nonlinear devices concluding with reasons for placing primary interest on third order products. Nearby third order products are located at 2 f(x) â€“ f(y) and f(x) + f(y) â€“ f(z) where f(x), f(y), and f(z) represent all frequencies in a group. The number of nearby IM products of this type is equal to N(N - 1) (1 + (N - 2 / 2)) where N is the number of input frequencies to the nonlinear device.

40|$|In {{multi-stage}} engine design, it {{is difficult}} â€“ or impossible â€“ to design a rotating component free of resonance. But {{it is imperative to}} tune the <b>interfered</b> <b>frequencies</b> outside of the engine operating speed range, in order to avoid high cycle fatigue. This dissertation develops a methodology for accomplishing this design task. The first part of the work presents an approach for tuning of a single natural frequency of a turbine blade subjected to excitation generated by unsteady pressure in the operating speed range. Structural perturbations are performed in a way that only the eigenvalue of choice changes significantly, while producing only small disturbances to the other natural frequencies that lie outside of the operating speed range. This design technique {{is referred to as the}} Guided Tuning of Turbine Blades method (GTTB). The second part of the work presents an approach on the tuning two adjacent excited frequencies of a bladed-disc such as an impeller which has two sets of blades of different chord lengths, namely long and splitter blades. Two solutions are presented. The first one involves the reduction of the inter-blade coupling through stiffening the disc structure followed by individual blade tuning. The second solution is based upon the eigenvalue veering or non-coalescent property of the asymmetric cyclic sector of the structure. Validated through test measurements, this work indicates that a 5 % to 10 % shift of the eigenvalues is achievable in order to avoid resonance as normally encountered in engineering practice...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} processes {{can greatly}} {{benefit from the}} use of the boiling and condensation in two-phase flows. However, the use of two-phase flows may induce instabilities in the heat transfer system, causing control problems and possible damage to the equipment. Pressure Drop Oscillations (PDOs) are one of the instabilities prone to occur in convective heat transfer systems. The PDOs are characterized by oscillations of low <b>frequency</b> with <b>interfering,</b> high <b>frequency</b> signals known as Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs). In {{order to be able to}} control this kind of oscillations in a thermal system, a better understanding of the parameters affecting the PDOs is needed. In this thesis, experimental work considering the effect of the external system and heat flux on the PDOs have been performed using the Two-Phase Flow Instability Facility located at the Varmeteknisk lab, EPT, NTNU. During the experiments, a single, horizontal channel of 5 mm inner diameter was used as the test section, R 134 a as the working fluid and a regulative surge tank containing nitrogen gas was used as the the compressible volume required for occurrence of PDOs. For the external system, experimental analyses of the effect of the inlet and outlet restrictions of the heated test section, different compressible volumes and the pump bypass were conducted. It was shown that a restriction of either the inlet or outlet of the test section reduced the PDOs. Larger compressible volumes increased the PDOs, while they decreased for smaller volumes. With the use of a pump bypass, the system stabilized faster with regards to the PDOs. Different heat fluxes applied to the test section showed that the PDOs could be regulated by both the amount and the distribution of the heat applied. For an uniform, decreasing heat flux the PDOs decreased, while for an uniform, increasing heat flux the PDOs first increased before decreasing in magnitude. Both a linear increasing and decreasing heat profile were applied to the test section. The results showed that the decreasing heat profile, generating larger amount of vapour in the test section, increased the PDOs and especially the <b>interfering,</b> high <b>frequency</b> signals. The increasing heat profile had a stabilizing effect on the system. A discussion concerning the <b>interfering,</b> high <b>frequency</b> signals that were observed to occur together with the PDOs was carried out along with experiments resulting in a conclusion that the signals may actually be another kind of oscillations than the DWOs...|$|R

High-Frequency-band Doppler(HFD) observation technique is the most sensitive one for detecting movement of the disturbed regions since it can be applied for the spectral analyzing technique. It is therefore popular that the HFD technique has long been used for this purpose. However, we {{had to give up}} the HFD observation since the reference signal transmitted as the HF-band standard signal station JJY were reported in termination at the end of March in 2001.
