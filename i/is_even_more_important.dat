Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> for {{the second stage of}} taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

25|$|Netchain {{is a set}} of {{networks}} consisting of horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers.

25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what they need. The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because it is harder to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> for companies to allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E

25|$|A back march may be {{used when}} the band wishes {{to move in the}} {{opposite}} direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backwards, putting each foot down and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backwards marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backwards, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> during backward marching.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff always {{considered}} aesthetic and moral {{aspects of the}} game; {{it is not just}} about winning, but about winning with [...] "right" [...] style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. The beautiful game, for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, [...] "Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,". For Cruyff and the Cruyffistas (Cruyff's devout followers), to choose a [...] "right" [...] style of play to win <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than winning itself. Cruyff always believed in simplicity. He sees simplicity and beauty as inseparable. [...] "Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing," [...] as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy. [...] "How often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He always wants to do things prettier than strictly necessary." [...] Cruyff also perfected a feint now known as the [...] "Cruyff Turn". The feint {{is an example of the}} simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away. As Sweden defender Jan Olsson (a [...] "victim" [...] of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, [...] "I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career. I thought I'd win the ball for sure, but he tricked me. I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius." [...] With its high effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff Turn remains one of the most commonly used dribbling moves in modern football.|$|E
