5|$|Shahaf and Doriel built {{models of}} the wall, {{concrete}} drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots {{may have come from}} a position behind the France2 cameraman, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.|$|E
5|$|The Syrians {{responded by}} {{launching}} about 100 fighter aircraft {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> F-15s and F-16s.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E

5|$|The two {{production}} frame lengths, 4.15 (13.6) and 4.5metres (14.8ft), {{the latter}} of which was among the few such Jeep-derivatives in production in recent years, were both available in civilian and military models. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> market, Storms have long been exported to countries in South America, Asia, and Africa. A Jeep-managed production line in Egypt, whose vehicles are used by the Egyptian armed forces, was absorbed into the AIL Storm production after it closed in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E
5|$|The main Beersheba–Nazareth road {{running through}} the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, {{although}} thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, Lee D. Ross, a {{professor}} of social psychology at Stanford University, developed a theory of a type of construal that he calls [...] "naïve realism." [...] In a simple experiment, Ross took peace proposals created by Israeli negotiators, labeled them as Palestinian proposals, and told <b>Israeli</b> citizens that <b>the</b> ideas in the proposal were the ideas that Palestinians wanted <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> to adopt. Then, he took the original proposals and told <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> subjects that ideas on the proposal were the ideas that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> wanted <b>the</b> Palestinians to adopt. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> citizens liked <b>the</b> proposals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to <b>the</b> Palestinians more than <b>the</b> proposal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians to <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> {{even though they were}} the same proposal.

5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> inside <b>the</b> bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening {{fire on the}} main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through <b>the</b> marshes. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> attempted to hamper the retreat by dropping smoke capsules over <b>the</b> area <b>from</b> four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries as men tripped and were trampled during the retreat through the marshes.|$|R
