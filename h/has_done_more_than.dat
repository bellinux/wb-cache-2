500|$|The Chinese press {{had long}} given Wong's career very mixed reviews, and {{were less than}} {{favorable}} to her performance in Shanghai Express. A Chinese newspaper ran the headline: [...] "Paramount Utilizes Anna May Wong to Produce Picture to Disgrace China" [...] and continued, [...] "Although she is deficient in artistic portrayal, she <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough to disgrace the Chinese race." [...] Critics in China believed that Wong's on-screen sexuality spread negative stereotypes of Chinese women. The most virulent criticism came from the Nationalist government, but China's intellectuals and liberals were not always so opposed to Wong, as demonstrated when Peking University awarded the actress an honorary doctorate in 1932. Contemporary sources reported that this was probably {{the only time that}} an actor had been so honored.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers such as Justin Chang and Mark Kermode {{emphasized}} Scorsese's {{collaboration with}} his production crew {{and with his}} actors as contributing to the film's quality. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang called the film an [...] "anguished masterwork" [...] for Scorsese stating: [...] "Working with such sterling past collaborators as editor Thelma Schoonmaker, production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Scorsese <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> resurrect a vision of feudal Japan... Silencefeels less like a feat of adaptation than an act of artistic submission". Mark Kermode writing for The Guardian indicated exemplary performances by the range of Japanese supporting actors in the cast stating: [...] "The real stars however, are the Japanese cast, from Yōsuke Kubozuka’s enigmatic wretch, Kichijiro... to Yoshi Oida’s devout elder Ichizo, to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering. As a smiling, silver-tongued interpreter, Tadanobu Asano is a superb foil to the inquisitor, Inoue, played with fly-swatting menace by a wheedling Issey Ogata".|$|E

[...] Though a common practice of athletes, he has not established his own foundation. [...] Others who know Holliday have elaborated that he has written [...] "very significant" [...] checks to charities. [...] Starting in 2012, Holliday endorsed with Freese for Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital a pledge program called [...] "Homers for Health." [...] For each home run that the Cardinals hit, fans were encouraged to donate 25 cents. [...] The program became very successful, raising more than $3.7 million in its first five years. [...] Said Cardinal Glennon’s director of marketing and communications Rose Fogarty, “he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other Cardinal has done for this hospital since Stan Musial.

[...] Matt and Leslee brought us into the limelight.” [...] Further, Holliday is a frequent visitor to patients at the hospital, and to other children's hospitals.

500|$|Ferrier {{spent two}} months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought {{to her at the}} {{hospital}} by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would {{no longer be able to}} negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything to make me feel so much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E
