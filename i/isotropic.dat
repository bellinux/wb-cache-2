5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is <b>isotropic</b> on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly <b>isotropic</b> microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and <b>isotropic</b> {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A Universe that is both homogeneous and <b>isotropic</b> looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{surface energy}} — same as surface tension in <b>isotropic</b> materials.|$|E
5|$|The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, {{published}} in 1968, {{shows that in}} a given universe, if all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties in all directions (that is, they measure the background radiation to be <b>isotropic),</b> then that universe is an <b>isotropic</b> and homogeneous Friedmann–Lemaître spacetime. Cosmic isotropy and homogeneity are important as they are {{the basis of the}} modern standard model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|For example, the hardness, {{electrical}} and thermal conductivity {{are much higher}} within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and <b>isotropic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang theory {{depends on}} two major assumptions: the {{universality}} of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and <b>isotropic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{observational}} {{consequences of}} this effect can be derived using the equations from general relativity that describe a homogeneous and <b>isotropic</b> universe.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called {{ecliptic}} comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly <b>isotropic</b> comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, <b>isotropic</b> distribution.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional <b>isotropic</b> liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the <b>isotropic</b> phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an <b>isotropic</b> liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears <b>isotropic</b> as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely <b>isotropic</b> and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>isotropic</b> {{radiation}} {{refers to}} radiation {{which has the}} same intensity in all directions, thus an <b>isotropic</b> radiator does not radiate <b>isotropic</b> radiation.|$|E
25|$|Whether a {{radiator}} is <b>isotropic</b> {{is independent}} of whether it obeys Lambert's law. As radiators, a spherical black body is both, a flat black body is Lambertian but not <b>isotropic,</b> a flat chrome sheet is neither, and by symmetry the Sun is <b>isotropic,</b> but not Lambertian on account of limb darkening.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, the <b>isotropic</b> hyperfine {{splitting}} {{pattern for}} a radical freely tumbling {{in a solution}} (<b>isotropic</b> system) can be predicted.|$|E
25|$|The system moves (in quantum {{mechanical}} sense) in <b>isotropic</b> space.|$|E
25|$|The {{three-dimensional}} <b>isotropic</b> case {{is known}} as the Fermi sphere.|$|E
25|$|High level intrusives: <b>isotropic</b> gabbro, {{indicative}} of fractionated magma chamber.|$|E
25|$|The {{parameter}} used {{to define}} accuracy in the measurements is called <b>isotropic</b> deviation.|$|E
25|$|An <b>isotropic</b> {{radiator}} is {{a theoretical}} perfect speaker exhibiting equal sound volume in all directions.|$|E
25|$|The {{observatory}} {{has four}} radar transmitters, with effective <b>isotropic</b> radiated powers of 20TW (continuous) at 2380MHz, 2.5TW (pulse peak) at 430MHz, 300MW at 47MHz, and 6MW at 8MHz.|$|E
25|$|Stimulated {{emission}} {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} processes that {{led to the development of}} the laser. Laser radiation is, however, very far from the present case of <b>isotropic</b> radiation.|$|E
25|$|The Lennard-Jones {{potential}} {{is often used}} as an approximate model for the <b>isotropic</b> part of a total (repulsion plus attraction) van der Waals force {{as a function of}} distance.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{equally as}} {{important}} is optic character. Diamond and other cubic (and also amorphous) materials are <b>isotropic,</b> meaning that light entering a stone behaves {{the same way}} regardless of direction. Conversely, most minerals are anisotropic, which produces birefringence, or double refraction of light entering the material in all directions other than an optic axis (a direction of single refraction in a doubly refractive material). Under low magnification, this birefringence is usually detectable as a visual doubling of a cut gemstone's rear facets or internal flaws. An effective diamond simulant should therefore be <b>isotropic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{represent the}} most common yield criterion as applied to an <b>isotropic</b> material (uniform properties in all directions). Other equations have been proposed or are used in specialist situations.|$|E
25|$|In <b>isotropic</b> {{aquifers}} or aquifer layers {{the hydraulic}} conductivity (K) is equal for flow in all directions, while in anisotropic conditions it differs, notably in horizontal (Kh) and vertical (Kv) sense.|$|E
25|$|Stress {{birefringence}} {{results when}} <b>isotropic</b> materials are stressed or deformed (i.e., stretched or bent) causing {{a loss of}} physical isotropy and consequently a loss of isotropy in the material's permittivity tensor.|$|E
25|$|If {{the vector}} space V has extra {{structure}} {{that provides a}} decomposition of its complexification into two maximal <b>isotropic</b> subspaces, then the definition of spinors (by either method) becomes natural.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isotropic</b> {{rectangles}} play {{a fundamental}} {{role in this}} theory since they form the domains of existence for holomorphic functions, domains of convergence of power series, and domains of convergence of functional series.|$|E
25|$|Semi-confined {{aquifers}} {{with one}} or more aquitards work as an anisotropic system, even when the separate layers are <b>isotropic,</b> because the compound Kh and Kv values are different (see hydraulic transmissivity and hydraulic resistance).|$|E
25|$|Every Le Sage-type model {{assumes the}} {{existence}} of a space-filling <b>isotropic</b> flux or radiation of enormous intensity and penetrating capability. This has some similarity to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) discovered in the 20th century. CMBR is indeed a space-filling and fairly <b>isotropic</b> flux, but its intensity is extremely small, as is its penetrating capability. The flux of neutrinos, emanating from (for example) the sun, possesses the penetrating properties envisaged by Le Sage for his ultramundane corpuscles, but this flux is not <b>isotropic</b> (since individual stars are the main sources of neutrinos) and the intensity is even less than that of the CMBR. Of course, neither the CMBR nor neutrinos propagate at superluminal speeds, which is another necessary attribute of Le Sage’s particles. From a more modern point of view, discarding the simple “push” concept of Le Sage, the suggestion that the neutrino (or some other particle similar to the neutrino) might be the mediating particle in a quantum field theory of gravitation was considered and disproved by Feynman.|$|E
25|$|He {{called the}} {{gravitational}} particles ultramundane corpuscles, because he supposed them to originate beyond our known universe. The {{distribution of the}} ultramundane flux is <b>isotropic</b> {{and the laws of}} its propagation are very similar to that of light.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law is {{generally}} true only for <b>isotropic</b> or specular media (such as glass). In anisotropic media such as some crystals, birefringence may split the refracted ray into two rays, the ordinary or o-ray which follows Snell's law, {{and the other}} extraordinary or e-ray {{which may not be}} co-planar with the incident ray.|$|E
25|$|On {{a square}} lattice, symmetries {{guarantee}} that the coefficients Zi of the derivative terms are all equal. But even for an anisotropic Ising model, where the Zis in different directions are different, the fluctuations in H are <b>isotropic</b> in a coordinate system where the different directions of space are rescaled.|$|E
25|$|When groove spacing is {{less than}} half the {{wavelength}} of light, the only present order is the m = 0 order. Gratings with such small periodicity are called subwavelength gratings and exhibit special optical properties. Made on an <b>isotropic</b> material the subwavelength gratings give rise to form birefringence, in which the material behaves as if it were birefringent.|$|E
25|$|In reality, a {{coherent}} <b>isotropic</b> radiator of linear polarization {{can be shown}} to be impossible. Its radiation field could not be consistent with the Helmholtz wave equation (derived from Maxwell's equations) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a plane wave in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent {{to the surface of the}} sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the hairy ball theorem shows that a continuous vector field tangent to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an <b>isotropic</b> radiator with linear polarization.|$|E
25|$|Earthquakes {{not caused}} by fault {{movement}} have quite different patterns of energy radiation. In {{the case of an}} underground nuclear explosion, for instance, the seismic moment tensor is <b>isotropic</b> and this difference allows such explosions to be easily discriminated from their seismic response. This {{is an important part of}} monitoring to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.|$|E
