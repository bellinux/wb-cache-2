5000|$|<b>Debt</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> {{allows a}} group of lenders to lend funds to {{individuals}} or businesses in return for interest payment on top of capital repayments. Also known as Peer to peer lending or Peer to business lending. Borrowers must demonstrate creditworthiness and the capability to repay the debt, making it unsuitable for NINA or startups.|$|E

An online B 2 C loan service {{is provided by}} a financial company to multiple small companies or individuals via web based services and credit assessment system mainly based on customers’ online financial or business transactions; Online P 2 P lending is the financial service provided on a platform between individual lenders and borrowers, which is actually a kind of <b>debt</b> financing; <b>Crowdfunding</b> is actually equity financing driven by the projects advertised online.|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 2012, Seedrs Limited was {{launched}} {{as the first}} equity crowdfunding platform to receive regulatory approval from the Financial Services Authority. In August 2012, Richard Branson announced his support for crowdfunding, crowdinvesting and crowdlending platform BankToTheFuture.com in the Telegraph newspaper. In February 2013, the CrowdCube equity crowdfunding platform, which {{was launched}} in 2011, was authorised by the FSA. On 18 March 2014, the first investor-led equity crowdfunding platform, SyndicateRoom, was authorised by the FCA. In May 2014, Crowd for Angels, which is considered the first <b>debt</b> and equity <b>crowdfunding</b> platform authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), launched. In March 2015, Eureeca was the first international platform to receive regulatory approval from the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.|$|R
30|$|Several {{technological}} factors {{at multiple}} levels tend to drive or impede cross-border crowdfunding. The ability to transfer data and to complete transactions across borders {{is critical for}} crowdfunding to work fully as a platform across countries. While {{it is possible for}} an individual in one nation to open a private company in another jurisdiction, the different jurisdictions make cross-border access to investments a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. There are very few crowdfunding platforms that resolve this problem of cross-border access to investments. For instance, a Helsinki-based crowdfunding company, Invesdor, is the first one to obtain a license from the Finnish authorities, thereby being able to offer <b>debt</b> and equity <b>crowdfunding</b> services across all European countries. One of the notably specialized functions in cross-border crowdfunding is that it enables citizens of certain countries to access all relevant information and make investments.|$|R
40|$|A {{new federal}} statute authorizes the online 2 ̆ 2 {{crowdfunding}} 2 ̆ 2 of securities, {{a new idea}} based {{on the concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 reward 2 ̆ 2 crowdfunding practiced on Kickstarter and other websites. This method of selling securities had previously been banned by federal securities law but the new CROWDFUND Act overturns that prohibition. This Article introduces the CROWDFUND Act and explains that it can be expected to have two primary effects on securities law and capital markets. First, it will liberate startup companies to use peer networks and the Internet to obtain modest amounts of capital at low cost. Second, it will help democratize the market for financing speculative startup companies and allow investors of modest means to make investments that had previously been offered solely to wealthy, so-called 2 ̆ 2 accredited 2 ̆ 2 investors. This Article also offers two predictions as to how securities crowdfunding will play out in practice. First, it predicts that companies that sell equity via crowdfunding may find themselves the subject of hostile takeovers (though the founders of such companies can easily avoid that outcome if they act with a little foresight). Second, it predicts that issuers may prefer to <b>crowdfund</b> <b>debt</b> securities, such as bonds, rather than equity. The Article concludes with a few thoughts on the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s implementation of the Act in light of the potential for fraud...|$|R
