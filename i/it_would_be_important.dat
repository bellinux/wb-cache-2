25|$|For {{the premiere}} of Theodor Körner at the Berlin Court Opera, Liszt began with the former artistic {{director}} Count von Redern. However, Count von Redern recommended Liszt to run the premiere on a different stage because Prince Louis Ferdinand was {{to play a role}} which would affect the Prussian royal family too strongly. For the premiere to be accommodated elsewhere <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to gain Wagner's support, for whom Wendelin had fought for many years. But Wagner was too immersed in his own work to be of any help. Weißheimer's negotiations with Munich moved very slowly.|$|E

[...] His parents died in an influenza epidemic when he was only a year old, and the man he had thought was his father was really an uncle who had brought the 18-month-old Herrera there to provide him with a better life in the United States. Herrera worked as a farm hand, marrying and raising a family in El Paso before moving to Phoenix, Arizona with his American wife Ramona and three children, Mary, Elva, Silvestre, Jr. and his uncle. [...] When the United States entered World War II Herrera was drafted into the Texas National Guard, 36th Division.

[...] "The Column Commander wishes to emphasise the necessity for the most vigorous aggressive action and to remind all commanders that their horses enable them to get quickly to the flank of the enemy - which should be the sole object in any operation."
