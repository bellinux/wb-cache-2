5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the picture...the Kingston Trio were {{probably the best}} commercial group going, {{and they seemed to}} know what they were doing.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} I {{made my way}} to where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them it was still unclear what was going on. The guardsmen {{themselves}} looked stunned. We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Decomposition had {{commenced}} in the skin. Dark brown spots were on {{the anterior}} surface of the left chin. There was a deformity in {{the bones of the}} right leg, which was not straight, but bowed forwards. There was no recent external injury save to the neck. The body being washed more thoroughly <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> some healing sores. The lobe of the left ear was torn as if from the removal or wearing through of an earring, but it was thoroughly healed. On removing the scalp {{there was no sign of}} extravasation of blood.|$|E

25|$|So I {{turned around}} and there's this {{beautiful}} Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's going to do Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that they knew very well and that they knew I knew in spite of my brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E

500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E

In 2005, Westenra visited Ghana to publicise her project, [...] "Bikes for Ghana", and actively helped with fundraising to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them {{to get to their}} schools from outlying surrounding areas. When she was later interviewed about this charity work, she had this to say: [...] "I met girls who had been given bikes and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how much it meant to them. We wanted to borrow one just for a photo and they wouldn't let them go; they were really reluctant". 2 May 2007, SYD Edition, LOCAL: 5.|$|E

500|$|Herman Bang's {{novel was}} {{inspired}} by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Skørping Station {{in the north of}} Jutland. He noticed a young woman at the window who, her pale face couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: [...] "For the rest of the journey, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing — longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines — just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be peering out with the same look over Egnens Lyng — over the dreary plain." ...|$|E

[...] They will be sleepy to-morrow morning." [...] Popular history {{commonly}} portrays the Hessians as drunk from Christmas celebrations. However, historian David Hackett Fischer quotes Patriot John Greenwood, who fought in the battle and supervised Hessians afterward, who wrote, [...] "I am certain not a drop of liquor was drunk during the whole night, nor, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> even a piece of bread eaten." [...] Military historian Edward G. Lengel wrote, [...] "The Germans were dazed and tired but there is no truth to the legend claiming that they were helplessly drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he was already there.|$|E
