5|$|Shin Megami Tensei <b>If...</b> <b>is</b> a Japanese {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus in 1994 for the Super Famicom. It is a spin-off from the Shin Megami Tensei series, itself {{part of the larger}} Megami Tensei franchise. Since release, it has been ported to mobile devices, the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, and re-released digitally through Nintendo's Virtual Console service. The story follows a student of Karukozaka High School after their school is sucked into the realm of demons by a vengeful student's demon summoning spell going wrong.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei <b>If...</b> <b>is</b> a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take {{the role of the}} main protagonist (an unnamed male or a female named Tamaki Uchida in later Megami Tensei titles). As the main protagonist, the player explores both the demon-infested Karukozaka High School and five towers based on the Seven Deadly Sins. During the course of the game, using a wrist-mounted device called a COMP, the player fights demons through a turn-based battle system, using physical and magical attacks to deal damage, as well as healing party members and casting status buffs and ailments on enemies.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This <b>IF</b> <b>is</b> amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E

Erich Berneker wrote that became by contraction from bojan, which was borrowed from Mongolian-Turkic bajan ("rich, wealthy"), and noted Bajan is a personal name among Mongols, Avars, Bulgars, Altaic Tatars, and Kirghiz. Đuro Daničić decided for an intermediate solution; by origin is Avar or Persian from bajan (duke).|$|E

This scenario can only be explained with the possible distortion of cultural and ethnic identity of native Romanized population that happened after the fall of West Roman Empire, and that the new Slavic language and culture was seen as a prestigious idiom they had to, or wanted to accept.|$|E

25|$|Referring to potentiality, {{this is what}} a {{thing is}} capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the {{conditions}} are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and <b>if</b> <b>is</b> not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E
25|$|A chair {{without a}} back or arm rests is a stool, or when raised up, a bar stool. A chair with arms is an armchair; one with upholstery, {{reclining}} action, and a fold-out footrest is a recliner. A permanently fixed chair in a train or theater is a seat or, in an airplane, airline seat; when riding, it is a saddle or bicycle saddle; {{and for an}} automobile, a car seat or infant car seat. With wheels it is a wheelchair; or when hung from above, a swing. An upholstered, padded chair for two people is a 'loveseat', while if it is {{for more than two}} person it is a couch, sofa, or settee; or <b>if</b> <b>is</b> not upholstered, a bench. A separate footrest for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman, hassock, or pouffe.|$|E
25|$|Usually the {{intermediate}} frequency {{is lower than}} the reception frequency fRF, but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a higher IF frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10kHz to 30MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4MHz, so the primary images are far away. The first IF stage uses a crystal filter with a 12kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4MHz first IF with 80MHz to create a 1.4MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second <b>IF</b> <b>is</b> not a major problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second mixer is fixed tuned.|$|E

25|$|Many {{sports are}} not {{recognized}} as Olympic sports although their governing bodies are {{recognized by the}} IOC. Such sports, if eligible {{under the terms of}} the Olympic Charter, may apply for inclusion in the program of future Games, through a recommendation by the IOC Olympic Programme Commission, followed by a decision of the IOC Executive Board and a vote of the IOC Session. When Olympic demonstration sports were allowed, a sport usually appeared as such before being officially admitted. An International Sport Federation (<b>IF)</b> <b>is</b> responsible for ensuring that the sport's activities follow the Olympic Charter. When a sport is recognized the IF become an official Olympic sport federation and can assemble with other Olympic IFs in the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF, for summer sports contested in the Olympic Games), Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWS, for winter sports contested in the Olympic Games) or Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF, for sports not contested in the Olympic Games). A number of recognized sports are included in the program of the World Games, a multi-sport event run by the International World Games Association, an organization that operates under the patronage of the IOC. Since the start of the World Games in 1981, a number of sports, including badminton, taekwondo, and triathlon have all subsequently been incorporated into the Olympic program.|$|E

500|$|In the future, humanity, having {{begun to}} explore the Universe and master interplanetary spaceflight, {{encounters}} an alien race dubbed the [...] "buggers".

Ostensibly in preparation for another bugger invasion, an International Fleet (<b>I.F.)</b> <b>is</b> established on Earth, who create a Battle School in Earth's orbit to develop gifted children into commanders capable of defeating the buggers in the next war.|$|E
500|$|Iodine monofluoride (<b>IF)</b> <b>is</b> {{unstable}} at {{room temperature}} and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and iodine pentafluoride, and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in trichlorofluoromethane at −45°C, with iodine trifluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −78°C, or with silver(I) fluoride at 0°C. Iodine monochloride (ICl) and iodine monobromide (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Humphry Davy in 1813–4 {{not long after the}} discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that Justus von Liebig was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine {{at room temperature}} and purified by fractional crystallisation. Both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold, though not boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid, since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I–Cl bond occurs and I+ attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine. When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into [...] and [...] anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.|$|E
