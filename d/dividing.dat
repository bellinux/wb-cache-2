Besides, {{if and only if}} an odd prime p <b>divides</b> an (and 2p does not <b>divide</b> n), then p also <b>divides</b> an + k(p - 1) (if 2p <b>divides</b> n, then the sentence should be changed to [...] "p also <b>divides</b> an + 2kp". In fact, if 2p <b>divides</b> n and p(p - 1) does not <b>divide</b> n, then p <b>divides</b> an.) for every integer k (a condition is n + k(p - 1) must be > 1). For example, since 19 <b>divides</b> a11 and 2 × 19 = 38 does not <b>divide</b> 11, so 19 <b>divides</b> a18k + 11 for all k.

40|$|The {{issue of}} digital <b>divide</b> has {{attracted}} many researchers {{for over a}} decade, yet the understanding of digital <b>divide</b> is not comprehensive. This research examines three commonly recognised orders of the digital <b>divide,</b> which are: economic <b>divide,</b> the inequality of access to ICT associated with economic conditions; access <b>divide,</b> the disparity of access to ICT; and capability <b>divide,</b> the inequality of ability in using ICT, while conceptualising a fourth <b>divide,</b> innovativeness <b>divide,</b> which {{is defined as the}} disparity of individual’s willingness to try out any new information technology. The paper presents a tentative model based on extensive literature review which was explored using qualitative method. The findings generate new insights into the relationships among those four orders of digital <b>divide</b> which contribute to the theoretical framework to understand the digital <b>divide</b> more comprehensively and provide evidence on the impact of digital <b>divide</b> on e-government use.
