25|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the {{widespread}} acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating {{a position in the}} mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, <b>discriminant</b> <b>analysis,</b> factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.|$|E
40|$|Three multivariate {{methods for}} {{predicting}} death within 1 year for patients discharged after {{acute myocardial infarction}} were evaluated: Cox model, <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> and recursive partitioning. <b>Discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> was utilized to predict a new myocardial infarction (any new or nonfatal infarction). A Cox classification model developed in a population of 260 patients (group 1) discharged after myocardial infarction was tested in 886 patients from the same institution (group 2) and 582 patients from another institution (group 3). <b>Discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> and recursive partitioning were developed in group 2 and tested in group 3. Data gathered during the entire period of hospitalization were utilized. The important variables (ordered as selected by the analyses) for the end point death were: heart failure, ventricular tachycardia and atrioventricular block in the Cox model and heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, age and ventricular premature beats in the <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis.</b> For the end point new myocardial infarction, the important variables were: previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, extension of infarction during the acute phase and infarct site. For predicting death and survival within 1 year, {{each of the three}} schemes was comparable. For estimating the actual risk of death, the Cox model was best. Recursive partitioning had the advantage of using only one variable — heart failure. Total correct classification ranged from 65. 4 (Cox model) to 71. 6 % (<b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis)</b> for the original population (groups 1 and 2) and from 47. 9 (<b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis)</b> to 54. 3 % (recursive partioning) when the schemes were tested in patients in group 3.

40|$|Studies of {{hatching}} asynchrony in altricial {{birds have}} used several methods {{to determine if}} a brood hatches synchronously or asynchronously. The most commonly used methods include making frequent nest visits during the time of hatching and using nestling mass or other measures of size on a given day to estimate nestling age or to describe the extent of the size hierarchy within broods. We made daily nest visits to determine if House Wren (Troglodytes aedon) broods hatched synchronously or asynchronously, and then compared classification of these broods based on <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> with that based on mass differences of nestlings. The best misclassification rate based on <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> was 17. 5 %, whereas the rates based on mass differences (23. 1 %) and estimates of nestling age (27. 5 %) were higher, but not significantly higher. The most frequent error occurring in <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> was misclassifying asynchronous broods as synchronous broods, whereas the most frequent error based on mass differences of nestlings was misclassifying synchronous broods as asynchronous ones. <b>Discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> based on coefficient of variation of nestling mass and number of nestlings was about as effective (error rate = 17. 5 %) as was classification using individual masses. We recommend that investigators who wish to categorize broods objectively as synchronous or asynchronous based on nestling masses or other measures of size should use a <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
30|$|Earlier {{works on}} Indian Bengali {{population}} {{has shown that}} human orbits exhibit asymmetry (Biswas et al. 2015). In the present series, there was significant asymmetry in the orbital dimensions. So, we considered taking all the measurements of both sides in our <b>analysis.</b> <b>Discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> {{was used to determine}} which continuous variables discriminate between two or more naturally occurring groups. In this study, the method of <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> was used to evaluate how a linear combination of those four variables can discriminate between male and female skulls. DFA has been successfully used to determine sex in Indian Bengali samples of the sternum, hyoid, hip and clavicle (Mukhopadhyay 2010; Mukhopadhyay 2012 a, b, c; Sarkar and Mukhopadhyay 2015). Morphological assessment for sex determination(Birkby 1966; Calcagno 1981; Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Bruzek and Murail 2006) has been reported earlier with reasonable success.

25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and <b>discriminant</b> <b>analysis</b> approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E

40|$|Classification {{procedures}} are common and useful in behavioral, educational, social, and managerial research. Supervised classification {{techniques such as}} <b>discriminant</b> function <b>analysis</b> assume training data are perfectly classified when estimating parameters or classifying.
