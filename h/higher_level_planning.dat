40|$|We {{present a}} local {{approach}} for planning {{the motion of}} a car-like robot navigating among obstacles, suitable for sensor-based implementation. The nonholonomic nature of the robot kinematics is explicitly taken into account. The strategy is to modify the output of a generic local holonomic planner, so as to provide commands that realize the desired motion in a leastsquares sense. A feedback action tends to align the vehicle with the local force field. In order to avoid motion stops away from the desired goal, various force fields are considered and compared by simulation. 1 Introduction Motion planning for mobile robots {{in the presence of}} obstacles usually deals with holonomic vehicles, that can move in any direction of the free configuration space [1].

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a multilevel planning approach {{for the use}} in complex self-optimizing mechatronic systems. The approach has been designed for the RailCab system, which is an autonomous railbound transportation system. The term multilevel planning denotes planning on different levels of abstraction where each level involves different aspects and thus raises different planning tasks to solve. These planning tasks are not independent of each other. Plans for the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning</b> tasks involve re-configurations of the system’s software architecture and influence parameters used by the lower level planner to compute Pareto optimal behavior. Additionally, the higher level planner relies on plans computed by the lower level planner {{in order to meet}} the execution times (of system reconfigurations) that it assumed. To actually assure that the lower level planner computes Pareto optimal plans and takes multiple objectives (which are conflictive) into account, it is based on multi-objective optimization (with Pareto fronts as output).

We proposed two new hybrid algorithms which combine the advantages of A * heuristic search and Recursive Backtracking with prioritized search order to accelerate the solution process. The algorithms proposed use real time data-driven simulation to accurately predict the time taken by the yard crane in performing its operations and this helps in getting an optimal dispatching sequence that can be followed by the yard crane. Experiments carried out show that the proposed algorithms consistently perform very well over 18 all tested cases.

At a global level during this period, donors supported more integrative modalities of aid - sector wide approaches, poverty reduction strategy papers, direct budgetary support - with greater use of economic frameworks in decision-making. The Millennium Development Goals brought heightened attention to maternal mortality, but at the expense of a broader sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} production/operation control and planning in biomaterial manufacturing systems (BMS). This research studies the characterisctics of BMS, and develops a dynamic production planning system {{to reduce its}} operation cost. BMS is a multi-stage, multi-line and multi-product system, which has uncertainty in market demands and uncertain raw material supplies. First, a hybrid push/pull production framework is developed, which will combine the advantages of vertical hybrid push/pull and horizontal hybrid push/pull production systems. In the framework, the push and the pull production stage is connected by a junction point. A hierarchical production planning model is proposed to determine the production quantity for the push stage. At the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning,</b> a two-stage stochastic linear programming model is formulated to determine the production quantity by capturing the uncertainty in market demand {{in order to minimize}} the expected operation costs and the solutions for both discrete and continuous cases are discussed. At the lower level planning, a linear programming model is adapted to handle the uncertainty of raw material supplies and provide detailed planning. Two raw material input models are developed based on deterministic and stochastic cases. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed production planning method. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{current state}} of the art in the {{planning}} and coordination of autonomous vehicles is based upon the presence of speed lanes. In a traffic scenario where there is a large diversity between vehicles the removal of speed lanes can generate a significantly higher traffic bandwidth. Vehicle navigation in such unorganized traffic is considered. An evolutionary based trajectory planning technique has the advantages of making driving efficient and safe, however it also has to surpass the hurdle of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a real time genetic algorithm with Bezier curves for trajectory planning. The main contribution is the integration of vehicle following and overtaking behaviour for general traffic as heuristics for the coordination between vehicles. The resultant coordination strategy is fast and near-optimal. As the vehicles move, uncertainties may arise which are constantly adapted to, and may even lead to either the cancellation of an overtaking procedure or the initiation of one. <b>Higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning</b> is performed by Dijkstra’s algorithm which indicates the route to be followed by the vehicle in a road network.

Many large organizations are struggling to successfully adopt agile methods, but there is still little scientific knowledge on requirements management in large-scale agile development organizations. We present an in-depth study of an Ericsson telecommunications node development organization which employs a large scale agile method to develop telecommunications system software. We describe how the requirements flow from strategy to release, and related benefits and problems. Data was collected by 43 interviews, which were analyzed qualitatively. The requirements management was done in three different processes, each of which had a different process model, purpose and planning horizon. The release project management process was plan-driven, feature development process was continuous and implementation management process was agile. The perceived benefits included reduceddevelopment lead time, increased flexibility, increased planning efficiency, increased developer motivation and improved communication effectiveness. The recognized problems included difficulties in balancing planning effort, overcommitment, insufficient understanding of the development team autonomy, defining the product owner role, balancing team specialization, organizing system-level work and growing technical debt. The study indicates that agile development methods can be successfully employed in organizations where the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning</b> processes are not agile. Combining agile methods with a flexible feature development process can bring many benefits, but large-scale software development seems to require specialist roles and significant coordination effort.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} {{and the rate}} of discharge of motor units are determinants of muscle force. Within a motoneuron pool, {{recruitment and}} rate coding of individual motor units might be controlled independently, depending on the circumstances. In this study, we tested whether, during human quiet standing, the force of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle is predominantly controlled by recruitment or rate coding. If MG control during standing was mainly due to recruitment, then we further asked what the trigger mechanism is. Is it determined internally, or is it related to body kinematics? While seven healthy subjects stood quietly, intramuscular electromyograms were recorded from the MG muscle with three pairs of wire electrodes. The number of active motor units and their mean discharge rate were compared for different sway velocities and positions. Motor unit discharges occurred more frequently when the body swayed faster and forward (Pearson R = 0. 63; P < 0. 0001). This higher likelihood of observing motor unit potentials was explained chiefly by the recruitment of additional units. During forward body shifts, the median number of units detected increased from 3 to 11 (P < 0. 0001), whereas the discharge rate changed from 8 ± 1. 1 (mean ± SD) to 10 ± 0. 9 pulses/s (P = 0. 001). Strikingly, motor units did not discharge continuously throughout standing. They were recruited within individual, forward sways and intermittently, with a modal rate of two recruitments per second. This modal rate is consistent with previous circumstantial evidence relating the control of standing to an intrinsic, <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning</b> proces...|$|E
40|$|The key for {{robust and}} {{reliable}} usage of humanoid robots in various and unstructured environments {{relies on the}} planning and control capabilities. Moreover, different levels of autonomy are required, depending on the scenario and the task set to be accomplished. In general <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning</b> is executed at first, and each action (at lower levels) is subsequently planned. Nevertheless, in case of specific tasks where human decision is still preferred or in case of robot misbehavior, remote control of the robot is needed. In this thesis a hierarchical planning and control framework for humanoid robots is presented. The purpose of the proposed algorithms is to allow transitions from gross to fine motor skills and to act at different levels, such as joint, cartesian, primitive and task levels. Primitive and task level planning algorithms based on control primitives have also been implemented for both mobile manipulators and humanoid robots. Several examples of motion primitives are proposed for both robotics platforms. Furthermore, a Motion Description Language is used for both the formal validation of the obtained plans and for the generation of consistent complex plans starting from previously defined motion primitives. In case of failure {{of one of the}} planning levels, a human can remotely intervene to avoid undesired robots behaviors substituting the planner through the proposed Pilot Interface. This is a Graphical User Interface that acts as a natural connection between the different planning level and the human that in case of necessity can decide the correct level of autonomy of the robot (and hence the level of planning) to accomplish a task. Finally, both the planning algorithms and the Pilot Interface have been experimentally validated and applied on different robots and scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Public {{space is}} {{the domain of}} {{interest}} for urban planners and designers {{and the most important}} type of public space is streets. Public spaces, and particularly busy streets in urban centres, provide opportunities for people to meet, often by chance. As cities become increasingly multi-cultural in population the use and nature of public space reflects this. The best public spaces cater to the needs of all who use them and in multicultural societies this also means they must meet the expectations of people from different cultures. Many scholars have challenged the tendency for streets to be conceived of as movement channels, often at the expense of their use as social space. Streets have traditionally catered to a broad array of activities including walking, cycling and standing. Streets that facilitate such activities are preferred by the public. Streets in multicultural societies are also where people from different ethnic backgrounds find opportunities to interact. When public spaces are successful, they will increase opportunities to participate in communal activities. Spatial design is a critical success factor for streets; a goal for urban designers must be to create spaces where people from different social and cultural backgrounds value the public spaces they have access to. As cities become more multicultural the challenge is to design and manage spaces that appeal to the breadth of cultures that are represented in the population. Such public spaces are described in the literature as being more public. However, there is presently little information to help planners and designers to realise streets that appeal to people having different socio-cultural backgrounds. The research aims to identify those characteristics that will promote and maintain cultural diversity in the context of neighbourhood commercial streets in New Zealand’s multi-cultural society. The research is undertaken in two stages. “Stage One” makes use of ethnographic fieldwork as a basic method, complimented by structured field observations using a behavioural mapping procedure, and surveys of users of the streets. This stage provides data on specific streets and their usage through three case studies. Stage Two” utilises online surveys that generated data in relation to street visualizations. This stage seeks to understand what design characteristics and furniture arrangements are associated with stationary, social and gathering activities of people and to define design characteristics of footpath spaces preferred by each cultural group and all groups collectively. The main conclusion from this research is that retail activities remain the main concern of people in multi-cultural streets. Management and <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>planning</b> of retail activities on the streets could encourage and motivate possible tenants in order to enrich the retail assortment of the street and provide a means for social and cultural diversity. In addition to business activities, spatial design characteristics are found to have an influence on people’s behaviour and activity. The findings of this research suggest that retail and business activities, together with the design and skilful management of the public areas, could support a broader range of static and social activities among people of various cultural backgrounds. The thesis makes recommendations for urban planners and designers based on the findings of the research...|$|E
