5000|$|The first Kodak {{product called}} Kodachrome {{was invented by}} John Capstaff in 1913. His Kodachrome was a {{subtractive}} process that used only two colors: blue-green and red-orange. It required two glass plate negatives, one made using a panchromatic emulsion and a red filter, the other made using an emulsion insensitive to red light. The two plates could be exposed as a [...] "bipack" [...] (sandwiched <b>emulsion</b> <b>to</b> <b>emulsion,</b> with a very thin red filter layer between), which eliminated the need for multiple exposures or a special color camera. After development, the silver images were bleached out with chemistry that hardened the bleached portions of the gelatin. Using dyes which were absorbed only by the unhardened gelatin, the negative that recorded the blue and green light was dyed red-orange and the red-exposed negative was dyed blue-green. The result {{was a pair of}} positive dye images. The plates were then assembled <b>emulsion</b> <b>to</b> <b>emulsion,</b> producing a transparency that was capable of surprisingly good (for a two-color process) color rendition of skin tones in portraits. Capstaff's Kodachrome was made commercially available in 1915. It was also adapted for use as a 35 mm motion picture film process.Today, this first version of Kodachrome is nearly forgotten, completely overshadowed by the next Kodak product bearing the name Kodachrome.|$|E
50|$|In bipack color {{photography}} for motion pictures, two {{strips of}} black-and-white 35 mm film, {{running through the}} camera <b>emulsion</b> <b>to</b> <b>emulsion,</b> are used to record two regions of the color spectrum, {{for the purpose of}} ultimately printing the images, in complementary colors, superimposed on one strip of film. The result is a multicolored projection print that reproduces a useful but limited range of color by the subtractive color method. Bipack processes became commercially practical in the early 1910s when Kodak introduced duplitized film print stock, which facilitated making two-color prints.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} color motion picture film {{is linked to}} two companies: Technicolor and Eastman Kodak. Technicolor was formed in 1915 by Herbert Kalmus, Daniel Comstock, and W. Burton Wescott, who {{realized}} that color film could enhance motion picture entertainment. Introduced in 1932, it was a three-color process that was widely used into the late 1950 s. The three-color process utilized a camera with one lens that exposed three black and white negatives simultaneously by splitting the incoming visible light through a prism. The prism would create two beams of light which would then expose one film negative to green light {{and the rest of}} the split light exposed a red and blue bi-pack comprised of two film negatives placed <b>emulsion</b> <b>to</b> <b>emulsion.</b> 1 One film negative would be sensitized to blue light while the other to red light, once exposed, the two negatives would be separated to be processed. The Eastman Color process, developed by Eastman Kodak Company in 1950, was similar to Technicolor. Eastman Color used three light-sensitive emulsions that were sensitized to red, green, and blue light which were then coated onto a single film base. 2 Having all three emulsion layers on one film support does away with the bulky three-color process camera used in the Technicolor process. Eastman Color prints were less costly to produce than Technicolor prints. This was because Eastman Color only used one film negative versus Technicolors three. Within a decade, Eastman Color films began to show evidence of fading in the negatives and prints. The film industrys shift from Technicolor to Eastman Color film resulted in a shift in the color, tone, and color balance of the film prints. Technicolor three-color dye process produces a very stable color 1 Scott Higgins, 2 ̆ 2 Demonstrating Three-Colour Technicolor: 2 ̆ 2 Early Three-Colour Aesthetics and Design, 2 ̆ 2 Film History 12, 4 (2000) : 358 - 383. 2 ̆ 2 22 ̆ 2 Doug Nishimura, Email correspondence with author, June 3, 2015. 2 ̆ 2 22 ̆ 2 that doesnt easily degrade with hues that were “warm,” 2 ̆ 2 whereas Eastman Color tended to be “cooler” 2 ̆ 2 and almost neon-like. In this thesis, I will discuss the differences in dyes used by Technicolor and Kodak and illustrate how the dyes have altered over time. To do so, I have made measurements on dyed film test strips by using a spectrophotometer that was created specifically for this testing. I sampled twenty-five test dyed film strips and twenty-five Technicolor film reels. In addition, a single Eastman Color film reel was tested. This sample size of fifty-one items yielded raw data that was calculated into absorbance and transmittance wavelengths. These spectral curves allow for comparison between the dyes used and for an evaluation of the colors. In the discussion, I describe why knowledge of dye fading is important to museums and how spectral information on dyes could improve film preservation efforts. This data is analyzed by reviewing scholarly journals, case studies, and first-hand accounts of dye tests in an effort to further the knowledge for museums and professionals with a focus on information on motion picture film, preservation, and spectrophotometry...|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{mechanically}} perturb a liquid-in-liquid jet {{to manipulate}} the size {{and structure of the}} droplets formed from break-up of the jet. The induced break-up is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in the surrounding fluid flow. When the amplitude of perturbations is large and the interfacial tension of the liquid–liquid system is low, the size of the droplets can be precisely tuned by controlling {{the rate at which the}} liquid exits the tip of the dispensing nozzle through the frequency of perturbation. When applied to microfluidic devices with the appropriate geometry, our perturbation-induced droplet approach offers a strategy to manipulating droplet structures. We demonstrate that by varying the imposed perturbation frequency and phase lag, the structure of the multi-compartmental drops and the configuration of the resultant drops in the same flow condition can be manipulated.

30|$|The {{effects of}} water content, shear rate, temperature, and solid {{particle}} concentration on viscosity reduction (VR) caused by forming stable emulsions were investigated using Omani heavy crude oil. The viscosity of the crude oil was initially measured {{with respect to}} shear rates at different temperatures from 20 to 70  °C. The crude oil exhibited a shear thinning behavior at all the temperatures. The strongest shear thinning was observed at 20  °C. A non-ionic water soluble surfactant (Triton X- 100) was used to form and stabilize crude oil emulsions. The emulsification process has significantly reduced the crude oil viscosity. The degree of VR was found to increase {{with an increase in}} water content and reach its maximum value at 50  % water content. The phase inversion from oil-in-water <b>emulsion</b> <b>to</b> water-in-oil <b>emulsion</b> occurred at 30  % water content. The results indicated that the VR was inversely proportional to temperature and concentration of silica nanoparticles. For water-in-oil emulsions, VR increased with shear rate and eventually reached a plateau at a shear rate of around 350  s− 1. This was attributed to the thinning behavior of the continuous phase. The VR of oil-in-water emulsions remained almost constant as the shear rate increased due to the Newtonian behavior of water, the continuous phase.|$|R

PEG–PLA-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions show good stability at 4  °C and at room temperature. At 37  °C, squalane/PEG–PLA/PBS emulsion with oil/aqueous weight ratio of 7 / 3 (denominated PELA 73) was stable for 6 weeks without phase separation. As PEG–PLA being degraded, 30 % of free oil at the surface layer and 10 % of water at the bottom disassociated from the PELA 73 emulsion were found after 3 months.

As expected, flocculation was observed under conditions in which the zeta potential is decreased (around the isoelectric point and at high ionic strength). However, the extent of flocculation at higher ionic strength (> 50 mM NaCl) decreased with increasing protein-exposed hydrophobicity. A higher exposed hydrophobicity resulted in a higher zeta potential of the emulsion droplets and consequently increased stability against flocculation. Furthermore, the addition of excess protein strongly increased the stability against salt-induced flocculation, which is not described by DLVO theory. In the protein-poor regime, emulsions showed flocculation at high ionic strength (> 100 mM NaCl), whereas emulsions were stable against flocculation if excess protein was present.

This study investigates the synergistic effects of silica nanoparticles (of varying hydrophobicities) and non-ionic surfactant on phase inversion of water-in-oil <b>emulsion</b> <b>to</b> oil-in-water <b>emulsion.</b> The effect of oil viscosity on phase inversion phenomenon is also studied.

However, the encapsulation of lipophilic molecules inside these microgels remains a great challenge because of the complex oil-core matrix required. The present study describes an original two-step approach allowing the easy encapsulation of several oil microdroplets within alginate microgels. In the first step, stable oil microdroplets were formed by preparing an oil-in-water (O/W) Pickering <b>emulsion.</b> <b>To</b> stabilize this <b>emulsion,</b> we used two solid particles, namely the cotton cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). It was observed that {{the surface of the}} oil microdroplets formed was totally covered by a CNC layer, whereas CaCO 3 particles were adsorbed onto the cellulose layer. This solid CNC shell efficiently stabilized the oil microdroplets, preventing them from undesired coalescence. In the second step, oil microdroplets resulting from the Pickering emulsion were encapsulated within alginate microgels using microfluidics. Precisely, the outermost layer of oil microdroplets composed of CaCO 3 particles was used to initiate alginate gelation inside the microfluidic device, following the internal gelation mode. The released Ca 2 + ions induced the gel formation through physical cross-linking with alginate molecules. This innovative and easy to carry out two-step approach was successfully developed to fabricate monodisperse alginate microgels of 85 pm in diameter containing around 12 oil microdroplets of 15 mu m in diameter. These new oil-core alginate microgels represent an attractive system for encapsulation of lipophilic compounds such as vitamins, aroma compounds or anticancer drugs that could be applied in various domains including food, cosmetics, and medical applications...|$|R
