5000|$|The {{discovery}} of the triode's amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of electronics, the technology of active (<b>amplifying)</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>devices.</b> The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. Triode [...] "continuous wave" [...] radio transmitters replaced the cumbersome inefficient [...] "damped wave" [...] spark gap transmitters, allowing the transmission of sound by amplitude modulation (AM). Amplifying triode radio receivers, which {{had the power to}} drive loudspeakers, replaced weak crystal radios, which had to be listened to with earphones, allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first mass communication medium, with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920. Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode repeaters, invented at Bell Telephone after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915. Other inventions made possible by the triode were television, public address systems, electric phonographs, and talking motion pictures.|$|R

50|$|As {{with all}} {{electronic}} oscillation, motorboating occurs {{when some of}} the output energy from an <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> like a transistor or vacuum tube gets coupled back into the input circuit of the device (or possibly into an earlier stage of the amplifier circuit) with the proper phase for positive feedback. This indicates there is an unwanted feedback path through the circuit from output to input of an amplifying stage. The technical conditions for oscillation, given by the Barkhausen stability criterion, are that the total gain around the feedback loop (comprising the <b>amplifying</b> <b>device</b> and the feedback path) at the oscillation frequency must be one (0 dB), and that the phase shift must be a multiple of 360° (2π radians). Since most <b>amplifying</b> <b>devices,</b> transistors and tubes, are inverting, with the output signal 180° opposite in phase from the input, the feedback path must contribute the other 180° of shift.|$|R
