In other words, we {{characterize the}} backoff from the Han-Kobayashi (HK) achievable region, the largest inner bound known to {{date for the}} DM-IC. In addition, we also characterize the backoff from Sato’s region in the strictly very strong interference regime, and the backoff from Costa and El Gamal’s region in the strong interference regime. To do so, Feinstein’s lemma is first generalized to be applicable to the interference channel. Making use of the generalized Feinstein’s lemma, {{it is found that}} the dispersions for the DM-IC can be represented by the information variances of eight <b>information</b> <b>densities</b> when HK message splitting is involved, and of six <b>information</b> <b>densities</b> for another encoding strategy. We also derive an outer bound that leverages on a known dispersion result for channels with random state by Ingber-Feder. It is shown that for the strictly very strong interference regime, the inner and outer bound have similar algebraic forms. I...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 27 - 28 In {{this work}} we treat sequential decoding {{in the problem}} of sequence estimation on intersymbol interference (ISI) channels. We consider the magnetic recording channel as the particular ISI channel and investigate the coding gains {{that can be achieved}} with sequential decoding for different <b>information</b> <b>densities.</b> Since the cutoff rate determines this quantity, we find lower bounds to the cutoff rate. The symmetric cutoff rate is computed as a theoretical lower bound and practical lower bounds are found through simulations. Since the optimum decoding metric is impractical, a sub-optimum metric has been used in the simulations. The results show that this metric can not achieve the cutoff rate in general, but still its performance is not far from that of the optimum metric. We compare the results to those of Immink[9] and see that one can achieve positive coding gains at <b>information</b> <b>densities</b> of practical interest where other practical codes used in magnetic recording show coding loss.

40|$|The entropic {{perspective}} on the molecular electronic structure is investigated. Information-theoretic description of electron probabilities is extended to cover thecomplexamplitudes(wavefunctions) ofquantummechanics. This analysis emphasizes the entropic concepts due to the phase part of electronic states, which generates the probability currentdensity, thus allowing one to distinguish the information content of states generating the same electron density and differing in their current <b>densities.</b> The classical <b>information</b> measures of Fisher and Shannon, due to the probability/density distributions themselves, are supplemented by the nonclassical terms generated by the wave-function phase or the associated probability current. A complementary character of the Fisher and Shannon information measures is explored {{and the relationship between}} these classical <b>information</b> <b>densities</b> is derived. It is postulated to characterize also their nonclassical (phase/current-dependent) contributions. The continuity equations of the generalized <b>information</b> <b>densities</b> are examined and the associated nonclassical information sources are identified. The variational rules involving the quantum-generalized Shannon entropy, which generate the stationary and time-dependent Schrödinger equations from the relevant maximum entropy principles, are discussed and their implications for the system “thermodynamic” equilibrium states are examined. It is demonstrated that the lowest, stationary “thermodynamic” state differs from the true ground state of the system, by exhibiting the space-dependent phase, linked to the modulus part of the wave function, and hence also a nonvanishing probability current...|$|R

Meanwhile, according to Luke Maurits, Amy Perfors and Daniel Navarro, the reason for object-initial languages to be less common than other word orders {{could be explained by}} the effects of Uniform <b>Information</b> <b>Density</b> (UID). They suggest that “object-first word orders lead to the least uniform <b>information</b> <b>density</b> in all three of their estimated event distributions”(Maurits et al., 2010, p. 7), and was therefore least common.
