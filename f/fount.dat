5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se <b>fount</b> de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} <b>fount</b> of honour, is at {{the apex}} of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments into any of the three grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the close}} {{relationship}} between the Nine <b>Founts</b> and Shennong, the <b>Founts</b> were {{also referred to as}} Shennong's Nine <b>Founts,</b> and include: Zhao Dan, Han Sui, Re Hai, Wu Gou, Wu Hun, Chun Zi, Yan Bo, Du Zhang, and Long Tan.|$|R
50|$|Legends {{say when}} the great ancient god Shennong was born, the Nine <b>Founts</b> were formed. These <b>Founts</b> are also called the Nine Wells of Heaven and Earth, and are sources of {{nourishment}} for living beings. Within the Nine <b>Founts</b> is the world's most potent spiritual power, and they serve as the cores of the world's spiritual energy flow.|$|R
50|$|The Nine <b>Founts</b> {{were born}} with Shennong, and were {{cultivated}} for countless years by Shennong to gradually {{become the most important}} source of life in the world. Before the Nine <b>Founts,</b> all creatures were equal. No matter if they are beautiful beasts or vile pests, all beings share the lands with their nourishment.|$|R
5|$|In the beginning, {{there was}} only Primus, the god of light and creation, who had been brought forth by Cybertron itself as the {{counterpart}} to another, unnamed being. Deeming that his power was too great to be contained by himself alone, he split his potency into five beings, including of course himself, and also Solomus, who possessed great wisdom; Epistemus, who was a <b>fount</b> of knowledge; Adaptus, who could alter his shape into an infinity of forms; and Mortilus, the embodiment of death, the necessary end of life. For a time, these five entities, known as the Guiding Hand, led life on Cybertron to heights of harmony and creation, but eventually Mortilus tried to {{change the course of}} life so that the Cybertronians would become a Universe-conquering army. What followed was a veritable war of the gods, which ended in tragedy and devastation. Mortilus himself perished, but not before dealing severe and irreversible damage to {{the other members of the}} Guiding Hand. On the verge of death, Primus withdrew into the planet itself, communicating from then on through the supercomputer Vector Sigma; while the other three only survive as relics which are essential to the Cybertronian race. Solomus' essence had been imprisoned by Mortilus in a crystal container, but he managed to change it into a vessel which would let those who were worthy partake of his undying wisdom. In this form he is known as the Matrix of Leadership, which also provides a link to Primus and thus to life itself. Epistemus and Adaptus had been shred down to their very cores, but now became the first blueprints for the two most basic components of all Cybertronians from then on, namely the brain module and the transformation cog. With the death of Mortilus himself, a Cybertronian's life force would be immune to the ravages of time, rendering them effectively immortal.|$|E

50|$|The Nine <b>Founts</b> nourished all, and {{the world}} was peaceful, yet the three races that {{occupied}} the lands, the Beasts, the Gods, and the Humans, all developed selfishness and engaged in endless, ever-escalating conflicts, until a great battle broke out. The Gods possessed extraordinary strength, and gradually gained the upper-hand in the conflicts. Shennong realized that with the inception of selfishness, the three races will {{be hard pressed to}} share the lands. Since the Nine <b>Founts</b> are essential to nourishing living beings, to prevent them from being damaged in the three races' battles and afflicting all life, Shennong expended his divine powers to strengthen the Founts' protective wards, and took powerful worldly artifacts to create nine bracelets to serve as the keys to the Nine <b>Founts.</b>|$|R

The Victoria Cross has been presented to 94 Canadians and 2 Newfoundlanders between its creation in 1856 and 1993, when the Canadian Victoria Cross was instituted.
