You shall {{be one of}} us, for we travel with light hearts; and as for me, I sing merry songs, and tell merry tales, and am full of merry thoughts, and I dance merrily along the road, {{so that there is}} never any sadness among them that keep me company.

You may, however, conceivably be in need of some yourself; <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>five</b> pounds. I have my own cheque-book, and shall therefore have no {{need to consider the}} question again for--for the present. So far as you are concerned, I shall be guided solely by Mr Bethany. He will, I do not doubt, take full responsibility.' ...|$|R

I shan't want you any more to-day, but if I am at home when you come in you can let me know how you have got on. Be in by half-past nine always. You had better go on at your night school; you have nothing to do after dark and there is nowhere for you to sit here. There is no reason why you should not go on working there as usual.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is truth}} in that; much truth in your remark," [...] cried the colonel. [...] "What say you, my lads, will you fight the Frenchmen and the Don----ay! and even my own rebellious and {{infatuated}} countrymen?

Let one of you {{be in front of}} the great church as the clock strikes eight morning and evening. Do not wait above five minutes; if I am coming I shall be punctual. In the meantime take counsel among yourselves as to the best hiding place that can be selected. Between you you no doubt know every corner and hole in the country. I want a place which will be at once lonely and far removed from other habitations, but it must be at the same time moderately comfortable, as the captives we take must have no reason to complain of their treatment while in my hands. Think this matter over before I again see you." ...|$|E
