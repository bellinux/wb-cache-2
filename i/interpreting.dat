5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v. Turner (1833), <b>interpreting</b> the new act, the Court {{held that the}} offense of counterfeiting was committed even if the signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers. But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>interpreting</b> the {{hydrogen}} data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for <b>interpreting</b> and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E

50|$|A strong form of {{the second}} incompleteness theorem, proved by Pavel Pudlák, who was {{building}} on earlier work by Solomon Feferman, states that no consistent theory T that contains Robinson arithmetic, Q, can <b>interpret</b> Q plus Con(T), the statement that T is consistent. By contrast, Q+Con(T) does <b>interpret</b> T, by a strong {{form of the}} arithmetized completeness theorem. So Q+Con(T) is always stronger (in one good sense) than T is. But Gentzen's theory trivially <b>interprets</b> Q+Con(PA), since it contains Q and proves Con(PA), and so Gentzen's theory <b>interprets</b> PA. But, by Pudlák's result, PA cannot <b>interpret</b> Gentzen's theory, since Gentzen's theory (as just said) <b>interprets</b> Q+Con(PA), and interpretability is transitive. That is: If PA did <b>interpret</b> Gentzen's theory, then it would also <b>interpret</b> Q+Con(PA) and so would be inconsistent, by Pudlák's result. So, {{in the sense of}} consistency strength, as characterized by interpretability, Gentzen's theory is stronger than Peano arithmetic.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the structural sequence detectability problem in Free Choice <b>Interpreted</b> Petri nets, i. e. with the possibility of recovering the firing transition sequence in Free Choice <b>Interpreted</b> Petri nets using the output information when the initial marking is unknown. Based on the Free Choice <b>Interpreted</b> Petri net structure, three relationships are proposed which are devoted to capture the confusion over the transitions. These relationships depend on <b>interpreted</b> Petri nets structures such as T-invariants, P-Invariants, attribution and distribution places. Thus, the approach herein presented exploits the <b>interpreted</b> Petri nets structural information {{in order to determine the}} structural sequence detectability of an <b>interpreted</b> Petri net...|$|R

Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work.
