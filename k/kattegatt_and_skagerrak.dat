40|$|Swedish {{temperature}} and precipitation series from 1860 - 2001 are analysed  in this report. Sweden  {{is divided into}} four regions. These are defined according to the drainage basins: Gulf of Bothnia (Bv), Bothnian Sea (Bh), Proper Baltic Sea (EÖ) and <b>Kattegatt</b> <b>and</b> <b>Skagerrak</b> (Vh). Annual series of  {{temperature and}} precipitation as well as series for the traditional  seasons  winter (December  previous year, January, February), spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August) and autumn (Sep­ tember, October, November) are presented. All series have been homgenised and all missing values for incomplete series have been filled out by    interpolation.   Generally the analyses show that Sweden has become warmer  and wetter  in this centennial  perspective.   As a rule changes and trends are larger in the two northerly regions (Bv and Bh). The increase of annual temperature amounts to 0. 9 ° (Bv), 0. 8 ° (Bh), 0. 5 ° (EÖ) and 0. 5 ° (Vh) when data from the colder period 1860 - 1925 is compared with the warmer period 1926 - 2001. Annual precipitation <luring the drier period 1860 - 1920   is compared  with the wetter  period  1921 - 2001. The  relative changes  are 23 % (Bv), 15 % (Bh), 7 % (EÖ) and 7 % (Vh). Spring temperature  and winter precipitation  show especially !arge    mcreases.   Comparisons with runoff data indicate that evapotranspiration has become much larger. It is argued that the substantial increase of forest biomass could be one explanation and higher temperatures could be another. The increase of forest biomass leads to larger interception and then larger evaporation and as a rule also larger transpiration. The warming in spring and autumn leads to a longer active season for the vegetation...|$|E

We found that GAMs with organic carbon content of the sediment and latitude and longitude as co-variates explained as ca. 75 % of the variability of the contaminant sediment concentrations. For metals, a predominantly hotspot-driven spatial pattern was found, i. e., we identified historical pollution hotspots (e. g., Sørfjord in western Norway) for mercury, zinc, cadmium, and lead. Highest concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were found close to densely populated and industrialized regions, i. e., in the North Sea and in the Kattegat <b>and</b> <b>Skagerrak.</b> The spatial pattern of the PCBs suggests the secondary and diffuse atmospheric nature of their sources. Atmospheric inputs are the main sources of pollution for most organic chemicals considered, but north of the Arctic circle, we found that concentrations of PAHs increased from south to north most likely related {{to a combination of}} coal-eroding bedrock and the biological pump.
