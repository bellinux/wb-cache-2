40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{multiple}} pathways {{that are}} involved in neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer (PCa) are poorly elucidated. Evidence suggests that several environmental triggers induce NED leading to the adaptation of PCa to its close environment to maintain cell proliferation. Nevertheless, there is conflicting evidence regarding the prognostic role of NED in PCa. METHODS: In this review, we aimed to summarize all available data about NED and to assess the prognostic role of NED in disease progression and therapy resistance, and its role in routine clinical practice. This review was based on articles found through a PubMed literature search between 1993 and 2013. The study outcome measure was the effect of <b>NED</b> <b>on</b> oncologic outcomes at each PCa stage. RESULTS: In total, 59 articles reporting on the effect of <b>NED</b> <b>on</b> oncologic outcomes have been selected. In clinical practice, immunostaining for NED markers could have interesting predictive value for assessing the oncologic outcomes in patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. Thus, patients with high NED burden may be candidates for more aggressive treatment strategies targeting NED pathways. Conversely, strong evidence is lacking concerning its potential independent prognostic value in hormone-naive PCa. CONCLUSIONS: Current published data are not sufficient to recommend the use of NE markers in routine practice, particularly at early PCa stage...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with advanced (stage III-IV), previously untreated ovarian carcinoma were treated by: (a) induction chemotherapy (40 mg/m 2 cisplatin, days 1 - 4; 1. 5 g/m 2 cyclophosphamide, day 4; every 4 weeks for two cycles) followed by (b) intensification chemotherapy (100 mg/m 2 cisplatin, day 1; 650 mg/m 2 etoposide, day 2; 1. 8 g/m 2 carboplatin, day 3). Eligibility criteria further included: age less than 55 years, moderately good to poor tumour grade, macroscopic (> 0. 5 cm) residual tumour. Autologous peripheral stem cells were recruited after the induction cycles and, to ensure haematological support, autologous bone marrow harvesting was routinely {{performed in the}} first 14 cases. Haematological support consisted of autologous peripheral stem cells and autologous bone marrow transplant in 16 and four patients, respectively. All patients are evaluable for toxicity and 19 for pathological response, one being dead of systemic mycosis 35 days after the autologous bone marrow transplant. Severe extra-haematological toxicities were the following: gastrointestinal (100 %), neurological (10 %), hepatic (10 %). Pathological response was detected in 84 % of cases (CR 37 %, microscopic PR 26 %, macroscopic PR 21 %). Median follow-up times of 48 and 41 months have been reached respectively from enrolment and second-look. Four-year 62 % overall and 57 % progression-free survivals have been reached. Ten patients <b>are</b> <b>still</b> alive with <b>NED</b> (six of seven with CR, three of five with microscopic PR, and one of four with macroscopic PR). Autologous peripheral stem cell transplant significantly reduced the duration of aplasia compared with autologous bone marrow transplant, and toxicity was proved to be manageable in those patients undergoing autologous peripheral stem cell transplant. The prolonged disease-free survival in patients showing CR and microscopic PR suggests that further investigation on this new approach is worthwhile...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} sharp {{increase}} in the number of non-executive directors (<b>NEDs)</b> <b>on</b> the boards of UK listed firms. Using a sample period spanning the publication of the Cadbury Report (1992), this paper evaluates the implications of this increase. The main findings can be summarised as follows. First, the increased demand for NEDs has been more pronounced for firms classified as having proportionately too many executive board members in the pre-Cadbury period. Secondly, the probability of compliance with the Cadbury Report's proposal for a minimum of three NEDs is positively related to the magnitude of the expected net benefits of adding further non-executives to the board. Finally, there is little evidence that the increased use of NEDs caused firms to make costly adjustments to other elements of their control systems in an attempt to re-equilibrate their governance portfolios. These findings are consistent with claims that the recent trend towards greater <b>NED</b> representation <b>on</b> UK boards may have helped to raise general governance standards.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} measure the relationship between board composition (the proportion of <b>NEDs</b> <b>on</b> board, board size and CEO duality) and performance using ROA and ROE: A case of listed Banking and Financial firms in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean Banking and Financial sector financial crisis of 2002 - 2005 resulted in many Banking and Financial firms being liquidated and some placed under curatorship. This crisis prompted the RBZ to offer guidelines to restructure boards in this sector recommending a minimum of five directors made up with at least 60 % NEDs and CEO non-duality. Despite all these regulations, the failure rate in this sector <b>is</b> <b>still</b> very high. Therefore this research was seeking to establish {{whether it is a}} matter of board composition or they are other factors which influences the performance of Banking and Financial firms in Zimbabwe. Previous studies produced inconclusive results regarding the relationship between board composition and performance with some finding a significant relationship and others not finding any relationship. The research used explanatory and case study research designs in drawing out findings using Chi-square and OLS regression models to validate or invalidate hypotheses. Primary data was drawn from a sample of twelve expects in the Banking and Financial sector using questionnaires and structured interviews. Secondary data was drawn from th...|$|R
40|$|Using {{published}} {{data from}} the top 166 ASX companies and 1244 corporate board members, this paper presents an industry-level analysis of board structures and member profiles, and assesses {{them in terms of}} the ASX (2014, 2003) principles and recommendations. The analysis reveals that the average board size was seven, non-executive director (<b>NED)</b> representation <b>on</b> boards was 70 %, women held 14 % of seats on corporate boards, 17 % of NEDs were women and 2 % of firms had chairperson/CEO duality positions. The Financial, Industrial and Energy sectors consisted of a majority of executive directors from business and the accounting field and NEDs from the engineering field with work experience of 20 to 30 years. A greater degree of diversity in the field of study and previous experience in the same and different sectors was found in relation to board members in the majority of industrial sectors. The analysis reveals that board characteristics such as board size, having a clear majority of <b>NEDs</b> <b>on</b> boards, decreasing trends in chairperson/CEO duality position, board member diversity in terms of qualifications and previous experience in the same and different sectors were largely consistent with the ASX principles and corporate governance practices...|$|R

The extremal persistence assumptions in this paper are known to hold for mixing, L -NED, and some non- L-NED processes, including ARFIMA, FIGARCH, explosive GARCH, nonlinear ARMA-GARCH, and bilinear processes, and nonlinear distributed lags like random coefficient and regime-switching autoregressions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the under-researched area of corporate governance in small firms with an explicit focus on the potential value of a nonexecutive director (<b>NED)</b> <b>on</b> the small firm board and explicitly including the production and use of financial accounting information in small firm governance research. This is motivated {{by a desire to}} better understand corporate governance in small Irish firms and by the challenge of attempting to translate insights from theoretical work on large listed firms to small firms. A testable conceptual framework based on the two interlinked themes of interest, also including demographic and economic performance variables, is proposed. The role of the external accountant {{and the nature of the}} small firm-banking relationship are also explored. Following a broadly objectivist methodological tradition, data were collected from 79 small firm owners/managers using a survey instrument; five short qualitative interviews were conducted. Strength of association, logistic regression, and innovative multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) techniques, a methodological contribution of the thesis, were applied to data analysis. The study found statistically significant associations between both corporate governance mechanisms (non-executive director related) and economic growth; small firms with at least one <b>NED</b> <b>on</b> their boards are found to be more than three times more likely to experience growth. These small firms are found to be sophisticated in production and use of FAI; they actively track financial position and cashflow. International marketoriented small firms are more likely to experience growth, to produce both useful and sophisticated FAI, and to have both a <b>NED</b> <b>on</b> board and an active board. The external accountant is mainly involved in compliance related areas such as tax planning, auditing and statutory account preparation. There is little evidence of any financial intermediation but the more general small business advisory role is probably a core relation in local and national market oriented firms, a useful finding in terms of policy. The small firm-banking relationship is found to be asymmetric in terms of power, risk and information flows; its asymmetric nature is evident in credit matters related to assetbased collateral as distinct from prospect-based lending, in financial information flows, and in a very weak advisory role when compared to the board or external accountant. The thesis may be viewed as making a modest contribution to small firm theory development as stewardship theory and both the resource-based view and resource dependency theory are shown to have some explanatory power related to corporate governance; the stewardship function of financial accounting is also highlighted. The control model is found to be more relevant to local market oriented firms than the market model; the high levels of financial and business disclosure demanded by the latter, which the international market oriented segment of the sample satisfies, requires further research on possible transitions from one to the other and why, how and when non-executive directors join such boards...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new model}} {{for the development of}} trust in the working relationships between managing director (MD) and non-executive director (NED) dyads in UK small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It proposes a NED role trust typology of NEDtells, NEDadvises and NEDacts. This typology is influenced by the literature on trust development in working relationships within corporate governance and in small business contexts. When UK SME NED role practice is mapped against this new model, different patterns of NED role trust emerge for MDs and NEDs. The MDs perceive a role biased towards NEDadvises, whereas the NEDs perceive a role that is balanced between NEDtells and NEDadvises. This dual role was described by one NED respondent as being â€˜schizophrenicâ€™. This paper {{presents a}}nd discusses these findings and the implications for the wider corporate governance debate <b>on</b> <b>NEDs,</b> with particular reference to the recent UK banking crisis. The new model presents a possible explanation for governance failure attributed to the NEDsâ€™ behavior and recommends that further research investigate whether the CEOs and the MDs that also act as <b>NEDs</b> <b>on</b> other boards exhibit these different patterns of NED role trust. Do they exhibit another form of schizophrenia or are they chameleons, that is, able to switch between different patterns of NED role trust with ease? Or are they just NED role impersonators, analogous to a contestant on Stars in Their Eyes? â€œTonight Matthew Iâ€™m going to be â€¦ a non-executive director!...|$|R
