50|$|During World War II, {{projectiles}} used <b>highly</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> containing nickel-chromium-molybdenum, {{although in}} Germany, {{this had to}} be changed to a silicon-manganese-chromium-based alloy when those grades became scarce. The latter alloy, although able to be hardened to the same level, was more brittle and had a tendency to shatter on striking highly sloped armor. The shattered shot lowered penetration, or resulted in total penetration failure; for armor-piercing high-explosive (APHE) projectiles, this could result in premature detonation of the HE filling. Highly advanced and precise methods of differentially hardening the projectile were developed during this period, especially by the German armament industry. The resulting projectiles gradually change from high hardness (low toughness) at the head to high toughness (low hardness) at the rear and were much less likely to fail on impact.|$|E

40|$|At present, <b>highly</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> in the {{thickness}} range above 8 mm {{can be cut}} by laser radiation to only a limited extent: The high portion of alloying constituents is indeed reducing the thermal conductivity and thus the thermal losses during the cutting process. But on the other hand, especially with the most established laser cutting technique - laser oxygen cutting - the alloying elements are leading to detrimental effects even in the lower thickness range (1 - 4). Chromium oxides with a high melting point do not dissolve in the metallic melt. This condition causes a limitation of the exothermic reaction in {{the upper part of}} the cutting front. At the same time, the high viscosity of the oxide layer complicates the melt ejection. Thus, in the lower region of the cutting front, the oxide film is bursted by stagnating melt volume and subsequently an uncontrollable exothermic superreaction occurs. As is well known, this results in deep erosion, selective burning and high dross attachmen t. In order to solve these problems even in the sheet thickness range between 10 and 30 mm, 5 procedural variants of CO 2 laser beam cutting have been investigated and optimized...|$|E

The use of hydrofluoric acid in the sample dissolution process produced nearly invisible insoluble particles with the REEs, leading to erroneous quantification of these elements. The addition of boric acid, complexing HF, solved this problem.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} the {{examination}} of the role of W addition on properties of two sinter-hardened alloys with two different carbon levels. Additionally the influence of sinter-hardening process has been evaluated. Microstructural characteristic and mechanical properties of Ni-Mo steels with increasing amount of tungsten (from 0 to 0. 3 % wt.) were taken under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: Powder mixes have been compacted at 700 MPa and sintered in a vacuum furnace with argon backfilling at 1120 °C for 60 minutes. Rapid cooling has been applied with an average cooling rate of 2. 5 °C/s. Obtained steels were analyzed by scanning microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for phase distribution and mapping and light optical microscopy for observations of the microstructure. Charpy impact test, three-point bending, microhardness, pin-on-disk and disk-on-disk tests were used. Findings: The outcome of implemented vacuum sintering with rapid cooling as well as chemical composition were studied in terms of mechanical properties, focusing in particular on impact energy, hardness and wear resistance. The results achieved after the investigation of Ni-Mo and Ni-Mo-W sinter-hardened steels with low and high carbon content proved that applied process of sintering under vacuum and rapid cooling brought expected outcome. Research limitations/implications: The characteristics of powders and the applied cooling rate were found be a good compromise for mechanical properties and microstructures, though further researches should be carried out in order to examine different cooling rates and parameters of tempering process.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 212 - 223. The {{performance}} of developmental alloyed steels with improved abrasive-corrosive wear resistant properties has been evaluated. The synergistic effect of abrasion and corrosion in the accelerated wear of steels is examined {{and the main}} parameters identified. A model of the process is proposed. The model is used to develop the optimum abrasive-corrosive wear resistance in steels for applications in the gold mines of South Africa. A wide range of engineering steels, both commercially available and experimental, has been evaluated in laboratory simulated abrasive and abrasive-corrosive wear tests. An appraisal of the wear tests and {{the applicability of the}} results to in-service conditions has {{led to the development of}} an additional abrasive-corrosive wear test. It has been established that both the microstructure and chemical composition determine the resistance of a material to wear. Control of the microstructure by alloying and heat treatment is attempted in order to optimise the abrasive-corrosive wear resistant properties for each class of microstructure whilst maintaining adequate formability and weldability. Abrasion of a metal surface has been shown to accelerate the rate of corrosion. Three categories of corrosion behavior are defined. A model of the abrasive-corrosive wear process is proposed to account for the behavior. The model adequately predicts the outcome to a change in system parameter, namely: an increase in the corrosivity of the water, an increase in the frequency of abrasive events, a change in the chemical composition and the degree of passivity inherent in the material. Recommendations are made to maximize the abrasive-corrosive wear resistant properties without resorting to expensive <b>highly</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels.</b> To satisfy the needs of the mining industry, two microstructures of note are identified: a metastable austenitic (TRIP type) steel and a 0. 25 % carbon lath martensitic alloyed steel. A basic chemical composition is proposed with each microstructure. The austenitic steel is shown to achieve its abrasion resistance through the high degree of work hardening it undergoes during abrasion and the high ultimate strength of the strained material. The lath martensitic steel has the necessary strength to toughness ratio for good abrasion resistance. A 20 % degree of work hardening in conjunction with a bulk hardness in excess of 500 HV is prescribed for superior abrasion resistant properties in the wear system of the mines. The life time cost of the martensitic alloyed steel recommends it for applications in the gold mines of South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum arc {{remelting}} (VAR) is {{a secondary}} melting process for production of metal ingots with elevated chemical and mechanical homogeneity for highly demanding applications. The ingots from VAR process are typically {{used as a}} material for critical parts of jet engines and industrial gas turbines {{as well as in}} military applications and heavy industry. The specifications of such applications often demand outstanding material properties. The common examples of such materials are Ni or Ti-based super alloys and <b>highly</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels.</b> ^ One of the most important problems of Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) is the lack of chemical homogeneity in the produced ingots. Past numerical studies of VAR have demonstrated that the characteristics of the mushy zone, the fluid flow and their interaction are the key factors defining the severity and the character of macrosegregation in the produced ingots. Thus, a new numerical model of the complete VAR process, capable of representing two distinctive morphologies of mushy zone: rigid columnar structure and slurry of free floating equiaxed grains is introduced. The presented model accompanied by a simple criterion for the columnar-to-equiaxed transition allows the capture of segregation defects induced by motion and settling of equiaxed grains. ^ Moreover, the numerical simulations with the new model include studies of two distinctive flow regimes in VAR: strong Lorentz driven flow and weak buoyancy driven flow. The results demonstrate a swift transition from weak buoyancy driven flow to strong electromagnetically driven flow with the increase of arc current. The change of flow regime to strong electromagnetically driven mode results in stepwise increase of macrosegregation and thus is not desirable. The key to understanding the swift transition of flow regimes is the instabilities of the thermal stratification within liquid pool at {{the early stages of the}} VAR process. ^ The model also was used for the study of macrosegregation evolution during multiple VAR melts, when the ingot of the previous melt is used as a source material for the next melt. The simulation results demonstrated that the increase of microsegregation through the sequence of multiple melts mostly occurs due to the increase of ingot radius, and not the nonuniformity in electrode composition. However, in some instances, the electrode composition may result in additional buoyancy forces in the liquid pool and affect the flow regime and thus composition. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of railway wheel steel grades has gone towards higher strength to enhance rolling contact fatigue resistance {{and ability to}} withstand thermally induced damage throughout the service lifetime. In this study a recently developed wheel steel material for passenger trains containing high levels of manganese and silicon, approximately 1 wt% of each, was tested in low cycle fatigue at different total strain amplitudes. In addition, monotonic tensile and Charpy V-notch impact testings in the temperature range − 60 °C to 180 °C were performed.

At increased temperatures, though, there are indications of additional effects on monotonic behaviour.

40|$|The {{presence}} of alkali chlorides {{are well known}} to cause high temperature corrosion during combustion of biomass and waste. Low alloyed steels as well as stainless steels are experiencing an accelerated corrosion attack in such environments. Even though more <b>highly</b> <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> (i. e. higher Cr/Fe ratio in the steel) are being used, {{there is only a}} small decrease in corrosion rate compared to low alloyed steels. To maintain the corrosion rates at an acceptable level the temperature of the superheaters (used for steam production to the steam turbine) of the boiler have been lowered. However, this causes a decrease in power production when the driving force for waste-to-energy boilers in the future is to increase the power production by increasing the temperatures of the steam from the final superheater stage. One {{of the reasons for the}} corrosive behavior of alkali chlorides towards stainless steels is the formation of alkali chromates. It has been shown that alkali chlorides react with chromium in the initial formed protective oxide on stainless steel: 1 / 2 Cr 2 O 3 (s) + 3 / 4 O 2 (g) + H 2 O(g) + 2 KCl(s)  K 2 CrO 4 (s) + 2 HCl(g) This result in a chromium depleted oxide which is converted into an iron-rich fast-growing oxide. This oxide has much poorer protective properties as it has higher diffusion rates compared to chromium rich oxides. Furthermore, the iron rich oxide is also more susceptible towards chlorine induced corrosion by chlorine ions penetrating the oxide scale. This leads to the formation of transition metal chlorides (e. g. FeCl 2) at the metal/oxide interface causing poor scale adherence. A way to mitigate the alkali chloride induced corrosion is by introducing fuel additives and thus, changing the flue gas chemistry and furthermore the deposit composition. In this study, the effect of digested sewage sludge as fuel additive was investigated at the 12 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler at Chalmers University of Technology. The initial corrosion attack of the stainless steel 304 L(Fe 18 Cr 10 Ni exposed at 600 °C (material temperature) was investigated during 24 h exposure of three different environments. Deposit analysis by means of XRD and IC were carried out using Sanicro 28 (Fe 35 Cr 27 Ni 31) as sample ring. The exposures were denoted “RDF” (a reference exposure 80 %Bark + 20 %RDF), “SjöMed” (80 %Bark + 20 %RDF with sewage sludge from Sjölundaverket (medium dosage)) and “HimHög” (80 %Bark + 20 %RDF with sewage sludge from Himmerfjärdsverket (high dosage)). The results showed that the most severe corrosion attack of 304 L occurred in the “RDF” exposure. The corrosion attack was characterized by an up to 100 µm thick corrosion product layer and signs of internal corrosion of the steel. The deposit in the RDF exposure was dominated by alkali chlorides. The exposures with sewage sludge additions, “SjöMed” and “HimHög”, showed a remarkable decrease in corrosion rate. 304 L performed especially well in the “HimHög” exposure, the steel ring was protected by a thin oxide, less than 0. 3 µm in thickness. Furthermore, the deposit was dominated by sulphate- and phosphate containing compounds. The {{presence of}} alkali chlorides was low...|$|E
50|$|Alonizing is a {{diffusion}} metallizing {{process in}} that it is a thermochemical treatment that involves enriching the surface layer of an object with one or more metallic elements.

Below the CPT, metastable pitting activity peaks at around 300 mV (SCE), but occurs at all potentials up to the transpassive range. The morphology of these pits has been examined using SEM and a model is proposed in which precipitation of an anodic salt film within pits is the critical factor; above the CPT, a salt film is essential for stable pit growth, while below the CPT, the salt is an intermediary in oxide passivation, like that of iron in sulfuric acid.

The relevance of the parameter values and the prospects of using the proposed approach to predict the steady-state metal dissolution rate and thus the general corrosion behaviour of stainless steels are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHot {{stamping}} is a non-isothermal {{high temperature}} forming process, in which complex ultra high strength parts are produced, {{with the goal}} of no springback. Boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels,</b> especially 22 MnB 5, have been the point of focus for the materials choice in hot stamping. In this paper four high strength non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> as well as five boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> were hot stamped using water and nitrogen cooling media. Microstructural analyses as well as tensile tests of hot stamped samples were performed. Boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> obtained fully martensitic or bainitic microstructure while microstructure of non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> was consisted of some ferrite phase in addition to martensite and bainite phases. The results showed that boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> attained yield and tensile strength values of about 650 - 1370 MPa and 850 - 2000 MPa, respectively, while those related to non-boron <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> were, in order, about 600 - 1100 MPa and 900 - 1400 MPa. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The <b>highly</b> <b>alloyed</b> duplex {{stainless}} <b>steels</b> possess high strength, toughness and corrosion resistance especially against the {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC). In the present study, the initiation and propagation of short stress corrosion cracks in wrought super {{duplex stainless}} steel (SDSS) Zeron 100 (S 32760) has been investigated. The aim is to understand the contribution of austenite/ferrite interfaces on the kinetics of crack growth. Cracking was initiated from saturated MgCl 2 droplets in an atmospheric environment at 80 °C and relative humidity of 30 - 35 %. As-received and 10 % cold rolled samples were subjected to an applied strain of 0. 03 % under displacement controlled tests. Regular high resolution optical observations were recorded of the droplets and their surrounding area. Analyses of these images by digital image correlation were used to measure surface displacements. Differentiation of the displacement field to obtain the apparent surface strains {{can be used to}} detect crack initiation and propagation, and to measure crack opening displacements. Scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) demonstrate that pitting occurs in the ferrite and is a precursor for SCC initiation, The combined analysis is used to investigate the relative crack propagation rates in ferrite and austenite, and the effect of interphase boundaries on crack growth rates...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{field tests}} {{have been carried}} out in the {{superheater}} region of a commercial waste-fired 75 MW CFBC boiler using air cooled probes. Exposure time was 24 and 1000 hours. The effect of adding sulphur to the fuel on the corrosion of two high <b>alloyed</b> <b>steels</b> and a low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> was studied. The fuel consisted of 50 % household waste and 50 % industrial waste. The exposed samples were analyzed by ESEM/EDX and XRD. Metal loss was determined after 1000 hours. Both materials suffered significant corrosion in the absence of sulphur addition and the addition of sulphur to the fuel reduced corrosion significantly. The rapid corrosion of the high <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> in the absence of sulphur addition is caused by the destruction of the chromium-containing protective oxide by formation of calcium chromate. Adding sulphur to the fuel inhibited chromate formation and increased the sulphate/chloride ratio in the deposit. Iron(II) chloride formed on the low <b>alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> regardless of whether sulphur was added or not...|$|R
