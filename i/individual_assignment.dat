40|$|Many {{applications}} in ecological genetics involve sampling individuals from {{a mixture of}} multiple biological populations and subsequently associating those individuals with the populations from which they arose. Analytical methods that assign individuals to their putative population of origin have utility in both basic and applied research, providing information about population-specific life history and habitat use, ecotoxins, pathogen and parasite loads, and many other non-genetic ecological, or phenotypic traits. Although the question is initially directed at the origin of individuals, {{in most cases the}} ultimate desire is to investigate the distribution of some trait among populations. Current practice is to assign individuals to a population of origin and study properties of the trait among individuals within population strata as if they constituted independent samples. It seemed that approach might bias population-specific trait inference. In this study we made trait inferences directly through modeling, bypassing <b>individual</b> <b>assignment.</b> We extended a Bayesian model for population mixture analysis to incorporate parameters for the phenotypic trait and compared its performance to that of <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> with a minimum probability threshold for assignment. The Bayesian mixture model outperformed <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> under some trait inference conditions. However, by discarding individuals whose origins are most uncertain, the <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> method provided a less complex analytical technique whose performance may be adequate for some common trait inference problems.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} introduce computer lab exercises on NP-completeness proofs in a class already containing computer lab exercises on algorithms and data structures. In the article {{we are interested in}} the answer of the following question: Can the students feel that their understanding of theoretical computer science is improved by performing a computer lab exercise on the subject? The class is mandatory for students in a computer science program, and is taken by about 130 students each year. Theory of NP-completeness proofs with reductions has previous years been examined on an <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> with written solutions handed in and later explained orally by the student to a teacher. The new assignment is performed as a computer lab exercise where students are working in small groups of two. This exercise is placed before the <b>individual</b> <b>assignment,</b> and is examined first by running automated test cases and later by an oral presentation in lab to a teacher. An improvement can be observed of the students ’ average results since the new assignment was introduced. This is not enough to prove the benefit of using the new assignment. However, the responses to questionnaires at course evaluations show that almost all students think that the assignment really gave them better understanding of polynomial reductions in NP completeness proofs. The students’ result on the new assignment corresponds closely to their results on the following <b>individual</b> <b>assignment.</b> Seemingly, the new assignment predicts accurately who is going to pass the following assignment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the genetic {{characteristics}} of six breeds of Chinese local sheep using 19 microsatellite loci and to effectively validate statistical methods for <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> based on informative microsatellites. All the six breeds deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium expectations, while the majority of markers complied. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of overall loci for the six populations ranged from 0. 283 (SRCRSP 5) to 0. 852 (OarVH 72). Tibetan sheep were the most diverse population with the highest mean allelic richness (6. 895), while Ujmuqin (UQ) harboured the lowest allelic richness (6. 000). The F?statistics for the six populations were FIS?=?? 0. 172, FIT?=?? 0. 082 and FST?=? 0. 077, respectively. Furthermore, the pair?wise FIS revealed a moderate genetic differentiation among populations (P?<? 0. 01), indicating that all breeds can be considered genetically independent entities. The lowest genetic differentiation was between Tengchong (TC) and UQ (FST?=? 0. 041), and the highest one was between TC and Fat?tailed Han (FST?=? 0. 111). In comparing the three statistical models, we note that the seven microsatellite loci (MAF 65, OarJMP 58, SRCRSP 9, MCM 140, OarAE 129, BM 8125 and SRCRSP 5) commonly used for <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> will ensure a powerful detection of individual origin, with accuracy up to 91. 87 %, when the likelihood?based method is used. Overall, these findings shed light onto the genetic characteristics of Chinese indigenous sheep and offer a set of microsatellite loci that is simple, economic and highly informative for <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> of Chinese sheep...|$|E

40|$|The Lanyu is a {{miniature}} pig breed indigenous to Lanyu Island, Taiwan. It is distantly related to Asian and European pig breeds. It has been inbred to generate two breeds and crossed with Landrace and Duroc to produce two hybrids for laboratory use. Selecting sets of informative genetic markers {{to track the}} genetic qualities of laboratory animals and stud stock is an important function of genetic databases. For more than two decades, Lanyu derived breeds of common ancestry and crossbreeds {{have been used to}} examine the effectiveness of genetic marker selection and optimal approaches for <b>individual</b> <b>assignment.</b> In this paper, these pigs and the following breeds: Berkshire, Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire, Meishan and Taoyuan, TLRI Black Pig No. 1, and Kaohsiung Animal Propagation Station Black pig are studied to build a genetic reference database. Nineteen microsatellite markers (loci) provide information on genetic variation and differentiation among studied breeds. High differentiation index (FST) and Cavalli-Sforza chord distances give genetic differentiation among breeds, including Lanyu’s inbred populations. Inbreeding values (FIS) show that Lanyu and its derived inbred breeds have significant loss of heterozygosity. <b>Individual</b> <b>assignment</b> testing of 352 animals was done with different numbers of microsatellite markers in this study. The testing assigned 99 % of the animals successfully into their correct reference populations based on 9 to 14 markers ranking D-scores, allelic number, expected heterozygosity (HE) or FST, respectively. All miss-assigned individuals came from close lineage Lanyu breeds. To improve <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> among close lineage breeds, microsatellite markers selected from Lanyu populations with high polymorphic, heterozygosity, FST and D-scores were used. Only 6 to 8 markers ranking HE, FST or allelic number were required to obtain 99 % assignment accuracy. This result suggests empirical examination of assignment-error rates is required if discernible levels of co-ancestry exist. In the reference group, optimum assignment accuracy was achievable achieved through a combination of different markers by ranking the heterozygosity, FST and allelic number of close lineage populations...|$|E
40|$|Assignment of an {{individual}} to the population from which it most probably originated based on its multilocus genotype has been widely applied in recent years. In this study, <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> based on microsatellite data was used to identify a case of fishing competition fraud. Despite {{the fact that the}} true population of origin was most probably not among the reference populations, recent modifications of the assignment tests were used in confidently excluding (p < 0. 0001) the possibility of a 5. 5 kg salmon (Salmo salar) originating from the fishing competition location, Lake Saimaa (south-east Finland). In fact, the probability of the suspect salmon originating from one of the regions that supply most of Finland's fish markets was found to be over 600 times higher than it originating from Lake Saimaa. When presented with this evidence, the offender confessed to purchasing the salmon at a local fish shop and criminal charges were laid. This study emphasizes the potential practical application of the <b>individual</b> <b>assignment</b> procedure, in particular the usefulness of confidently excluding populations as the origin of {{an individual}}.
