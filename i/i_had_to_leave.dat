However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion.

[...] The piece had been performed the previous day, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. It was also performed in London, Hamburg, Boston and Leipzig in October and November 1899. Dvořák was finally able to personally conduct the piece in Budapest in December of that year.|$|E

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together.

He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E

500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure.
