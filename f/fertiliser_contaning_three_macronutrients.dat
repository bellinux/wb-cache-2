40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is the first}} “port of call ” {{for the actions of}} nutrients following ingestion, and all <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients,</b> carbohydrate, protein and fat, have potent modulatory effects on gastrointestinal function, including the stimulation of exocrine and endocrine secretions and modulation of pressures in the upper {{gastrointestinal tract}}, resulting in a slowing of gastric emptying. Of the <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients,</b> protein is now generally regarded as the most “satiating ” nutrient. In contrast, due to its high energy density, wide availability and effects on the palatability of foods, dietary fat may promote passive overconsumption. Despite these detrimental effects, fat has potent effects on those gastrointestinal functions that favour the suppression of energy intake. For example, the presence of fat in the small intestine slows gastric emptying, leading to an increase in distension of the stomach. Distension of the stomach, particularly of the antrum, the distal region of the stomach, {{has been shown to be}} associated with increased perception of fullness and suppression of subsequent energy intake (1). The motor patterns in the gastrointestinal region that underlie the slowing of gastric emptying include a relaxation of the proximal stomach (or fundus), suppression of pressure waves in the antrum and duodenum, and stimulation of both tonic and phasic pressures in the pylorus, with the latter most likely being the most important mechanism. Interaction of fat with small intestinal receptors also triggers the release of gut hormones, including cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), and the suppression of ghrelin.

The present study evaluated the macronutrient intake status of older Chinese people (aged $ 60 years), investigated whether they had intake levels that met the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI), and explored the associations between macronutrient intakes and age groups, sex, education levels, work status, BMI groups, urbanicity levels and four socio-economic regions of China (Northeast, East Coast, Central and Western). Dietary intake data of 2746 older Chinese with complete dietary intake data in the Longitudinal China Health and Nutrition Survey (2009 wave) carried out across four diverse regions were analysed. Dietary intake data were obtained by interviews using 24 h recalls over three consecutive days. The MUFA:SFA ratios were calculated based on the Chinese Food Composition Table. Less than one-third of the older Chinese people included in the present study had intake levels meeting the adequate intake for carbohydrate-energy and fat-energy; less than one-fifth had intake levels meeting the recommended nutrient intake for protein-energy; {{and more than half of}} the older people had fat-energy intakes higher than the DRI.

30|$|Most of the {{research}} system in Africa emphasizes on managing the <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients</b> nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) (Kang and Balasubramanian 1990; Smaling et al. 1993; Smaling and Braun 1996). In this region, crop production is critically dependent on sub-optimum nutrient application, especially N and P which are very low in amount with less than 8  kg ha/year (Crawford and Jayne 2010; Morris et al. 2007; Smaling 2006). Such agricultural practice accelerates the depletion of other macronutrients and micronutrients (Cobo et al. 2010; Sanchez 2002; Smaling et al. 1997) and causes negative soil nutrient balances. In Ethiopia, the nutrient depletion has been 41, 6, and 26  kg/ha/year for N, P, and K, respectively (Stoorvogel and Smaling 1990). This problem is aggravated by the inherent poor fertility in most tropical soils (Okalebo et al. 2003). These practices, consequently, lead to the less responsive or non-responsive soil (Foli 2012; Vanlauwe et al. 2014). When farmers applied fertilizers on this soil, they did not get benefit by increasing crop productivity. Due to this reason, farmers became reluctant to apply inputs, besides the cost of fertilizer is increasing.|$|R

Forms of P in the soil will affect its availability. The P-sorption character of soils will affect P fertilizer reactions in the soil and thus influence the amount of P fertilizer necessary and carry-over effects of applied P.

Here we investigated {{the contribution of}} diet-derived macronutrients and anorectic hormones to the reversal of the fasting-induced ARC activation during 2 h refeeding. Refeeding of 12 h-fasted mice with a cellulose-based, non-caloric mash induced only a small reduction in c-Fos expression. Refeeding with diets, containing carbohydrates, protein or fat alone reversed it similar to chow, however this effect depended {{on the amount of}} intake. The fasting-induced ARC activation was unchanged by subcutaneously injected amylin, CCK (both 20 microg/kg), insulin (0. 2 U/kg and 0. 05 U/kg) or leptin (2. 6 mg/kg). Insulin and leptin had no effect on c-Fos expression in neuropeptide Y or proopiomelanocortin containing ARC neurons. Interestingly, CCK but not amylin reduced the ghrelin-induced c-Fos expression in the ARC in ad libitum fed mice suggesting that endogenous CCK may inhibit orexigenic ARC neurons when acting together with other feeding-related signals. We conclude that all <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients</b> and also non-nutritive, ingestion-dependent signals contribute to an inhibition of orexigenic ARC neurons after refeeding. Similar to the previously demonstrated inhibitory in vivo action of peptide YY, CCK may be a postprandial mediator of ARC inhibition. Key words: c-Fos, insulin, leptin, amylin...|$|R

Using six soils from low input cropping systems of subtropical Australia, the effects of long-term cultivation (≤ 70 y) on <b>three</b> <b>macronutrient</b> cations (Ca, Mg, and K) and three micronutrient cations (Cu, Zn, and Mn) was examined. For Ca, Mg, and K, exchangeable concentrations generally remained constant and were not influenced by the period of cultivation. As a result, concentrations of these nutrients in grain tissues of wheat (Triticum aestivum) also remained constant over time. However, concentrations of DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, and Mn often (but not always) decreased significantly over time, with Cu decreasing 21 %, Zn by 34 %, and Mn by 46 % (when averaged across soils where significant differences were found). In some soils, these decreases in DTPA-extractable micronutrients also resulted in concomitant decreases in grain tissue concentrations. These decreases in DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn, and Mn concentrations do not result only from the export of nutrients in grain tissues, but also, from an increase in soil pH caused by a cultivation-induced mixing of alkaline subsoil into the surface soil.

50|$|Muscular {{activity}} {{accounts for}} much of the body's energy consumption. All muscle cells produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules which are used to power the movement of the myosin heads. Muscles have a short-term store of energy in the form of creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when needed with creatine kinase. Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in the form of glycogen. Glycogen can be rapidly converted to glucose when energy is required for sustained, powerful contractions. Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis. Cardiac muscle on the other hand, can readily consume any of the <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients</b> (protein, glucose and fat) aerobically without a 'warm up' period and always extracts the maximum ATP yield from any molecule involved. The heart, liver and red blood cells will also consume lactic acid produced and excreted by skeletal muscles during exercise.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present review summarises current {{knowledge}} and recent {{findings on the}} modulation of appetite by dietary protein, via both peripheral and central mechanisms. Of the <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients,</b> proteins are recognised as the strongest inhibitor of food intake. The well-recognised poor palatability of proteins is not the principal mechanism explaining the decrease in high-protein (HP) diet intake. Consumption of a HP diet does not induce conditioned food aversion, but rather experience-enhanced satiety. Amino acid consumption is detected by multiple and redundant mechanisms originating from visceral (during digestion) and metabolic (inter-prandial period) sources, recorded both directly and indirectly (mainly vagus-mediated) by {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Peripherally, the satiating effect of dietary proteins appears to be mediated by anorexigenic gut peptides, principally cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide- 1 and peptide YY. In the CNS, HP diets trigger the activation of noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract and melanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Additionally, there is evidence that circulating leucine levels may modulate food intake. Leucine is associated with neural mechanisms involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), energy sensors active in the control of energy intake, at least in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. In addition, HP diets inhibit the activation of opioid and GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, and thus inhibit food intake by reducing the hedonic response to food, presumably because of their low palatability. Future studies should concentrate on studying the adaptation of different neural circuits following the ingestion of protein diets...|$|R

Several irregularities regarding dietary intake and food choices were noted among the study participants. Although, the patients were counseled regarding diet before Ramadan, many did not follow the dietary advice. All patients had taken food at Iftar but majority of them preferred fried items like samosas, pakoras (fried snack), chicken rolls etc. these deeply fried items can lead to post Iftar hyperglycemia.

The striking finding was almost absence of meat (protein) intake at Iftar but study from India showed increment of all <b>three</b> <b>macronutrients</b> during Ramadan (3). This may result in higher intake of items from carbohydrate and fat groups resulting in hyperglycemia after iftar.

Carbohydrate composition of the diet determines carbohydrate oxidation regardless of fat content of the diet. Both exogenous and endogenous fat oxidation are higher in obese than in lean subjects. The influence of high fat intake on accumulation of fat mass is operative rather over a long term. Several future directions are addressed, such {{that a combination of}} increased physical activity and modification in diet composition, in terms of energy density and glycemic index, is recommended for children and adolescents...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and pH on growth and antibiotic production by three isolates of Coniothyrium minitans (Conio, Contans and IVT 1), known {{to produce the}} macrolide antibiotic macrosphelide A, were examined in modified Czapek Dox broth (MCD). Antibiotic production was determined by incorporating heated (60 degrees C for 5 min) C. minitans spent culture filtrates of MCD (10 %, v/v) into potato dextrose broth and assessing {{the ability of the}} filtrates to inhibit growth of S. sclerotiorum. All isolates grew over the temperature range of 10 - 30 degrees C, with the optimum at approximately 15 - 20 degrees C. Antibiotics were produced by all isolates at 10 - 30 degrees C. Culture filtrates of MCD from all isolates incorporated into PDB inhibited growth of S. sclerotiorum by > 50 %, whereas there was a reduction in inhibition at 30 degrees C for Conio and IVT 1 but not <b>Contans.</b> All <b>three</b> isolates grew over the pH range of 3 - 7, with greater biomass production in buffered pH 3 - 5 than the unbuffered control (pH 4. 8) media. Antibiotics were produced by all isolates at pH 3 - 5. Culture filtrates of MCD from all three isolates grown at pH 3 - 5 inhibited growth of S. sclerotiorum, with the greatest effect on inhibition observed at pH 3. There were no differences in growth inhibition between isolates at pH 3 and 4, but culture filtrates from Conio grown at pH 5 inhibited S. sclerotiorum more than those of IVT 1 grown at the same pH. The significance of these results for biocontrol and optimizing antibiotic production by C. minitans is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of studies have {{demonstrated}} that glucose and/or carbohydrate ingestion can facilitate certain aspects of cognitive performance in healthy young humans (e. g. Kennedy & Scholey, 2000; Sünram-Lea, Foster, Durlach, & Perez, 2002). Recent evidence indicates that different macronutrients may influence cognition and mood in different ways (e. g. Fischer, Colombani, Langhans, & Wenk, 2001; Kaplan, Greenwood, Winocur, & Wolever (2001) R. J. Kaplan, C. E. Greenwood, G. Winocur and T. M. S. Wolever, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 74 (2001), pp. 687 – 693. View Record in Scopus | Cited By in Scopus (30) Kaplan, Greenwood, Winocur, & Wolever, 2001). The aim {{of this study was to}} examine further the effects of <b>three</b> different <b>macronutrients</b> on mood and cognition. In a within-participant, blind, placebo-controlled design, 18 healthy young adults were administered iso-energetic drinks containing fat, protein or glucose, and a matching inert placebo. Cognitive performance and mood were assessed at baseline, and 15 and 60 min after drink ingestion. Individual differences in dietary restraint were assessed and blood glucose levels were measured. There was general enhancement of memory processes following a protein drink. In addition, psychologically mediated, post-drink improvements in alertness were observed and individual differences in dietary restraint may have moderated cognitive performance following drink administration...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether daily dietary fiber intake at the reference level has {{any impact on}} studied hormones in a population of Thai women. Material and Method: Twenty-eight healthy Thai women (aged 18 - 20 years, BMI 18. 5 - 25 kg/m 2) {{with a history of}} regular menstrual cycles committed themselves to prepared food without changing the usual ratio of <b>three</b> major <b>macronutrients.</b> Dietary fiber from natural source at the amount of 8 - 10 g/day equal to their regular consumption was added to their daily diet for one menstrual cycle, then, increased to be 25 - 30 g/day for another 2 successive cycles. A single blood sample on midluteal day (day 18 - 23) was obtained in all three cycles. Plasma luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, cortisol, and insulin together with total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were analyzed. Results: The measured hormones and lipids did not change significantly when compared between a control and two experimental cycles (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: Short-term consumption of 25 - 30 g/day fiber diet as recommended by the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) in a Thai population did not alter the studied hormones and lipids thus did not create any health problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of substrate oxidation in living individuals can facilitate metabolic investigations. Indirect calorimetry and tracer techniques allow such measurements. Indirect calorimetry provides simultaneous {{calculation of the}} rate of oxidation of the <b>three</b> major <b>macronutrients</b> (carbohydrates, fat and protein) from respiratory gas exchanges and urinary nitrogen excretion. Such estimates represent net substrate oxidation rates. Thus, carbohydrate oxidation represents the oxidation of either endogenous glycogen or exogenously administered carbohydrate. It also includes de novo lipogenesis (with simultaneous oxidation of lipids in amounts equivalent to their synthesis), but does not include oxidation of glucose formed from gluconeogenesis from amino acids or glycerol. The accuracy of these calculations depends on {{the adequacy of the}} stoichiometry used for oxidation of substrates, which has to be varied when special forms of substrate are used. Tracer techniques consist in administration in tracer amounts of a selected nutrient labelled with 14 C or 13 C and monitoring of the specific activity/isotopic enrichment of the substrate in plasma and of the pulmonary elimination of labelled CO 2. Such techniques allow assessment of the actual rate of oxidation of one substrate at a time. However, there are major pitfalls relating to the recovery of labelled CO 2 in breath during oxidation of the substrate as well as during non-steady state conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{metallic}} elements {{concentrations of}} medicinal plants (coriander, dill, Echinacea, lavender, chamomile, mint, and plantain, used for phytopharmaceutical products), cultivated in unpolluted region, {{were analyzed by}} neutron activation analysis. The essential nutrients, macro-, micro-, and trace elements (K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Rb, Sr, and Zn), potentially toxic elements (Al, As, Ba, Co, Sb, Cr, and V), and rare earth elements were monitored and were compared with those presented in the literature. An estimation of their contributions to intake and toxicity for a person was made, which revealed that (a) teas prepared from the examined plants represent useful contribution to the food provided intake of <b>three</b> essential <b>macronutrients</b> (K, Ca, and Mg); (b) the Cu, Mn, Rb, Sr, Zn, and rare earths levels are normal or low; (c) the quantities of As, Ba, Co, Sb, Cr, and V do not represent toxicological concerns; (d) {{the examination of the}} estimated Al and Fe quantities recovered in infusions in the conditions of usual daily tea consumption is below the Tolerable Daily Intake values. The strategy of cultivation of medicinal plants in unpolluted areas is efficient and beneficial. However, individual plants ability to concentrate preferentially certain elements suggests controlling the contamination level of raw materials...|$|R
