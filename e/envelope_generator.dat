25|$|Voltage-controlled {{amplifier}} (VCA) – After {{the signal}} generated by one (or {{a mix of}} more) VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> it then passes on {{to one or more}} voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator. The gain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage (CV), coming from an <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> an LFO, the keyboard or some other source.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{acoustic}} musical instrument produces sound, the loudness and spectral {{content of the}} sound change over time in ways that vary from instrument to instrument. [...] The [...] "attack" [...] and [...] "decay" [...] of a sound have a great effect on the instrument's sonic character. Sound synthesis techniques often employ an <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> that controls a sound's parameters {{at any point in}} its duration. [...] Most often this is an (ADSR) envelope, which may be applied to overall amplitude control, filter frequency, etc. [...] The envelope may be a discrete circuit or module, or implemented in software. [...] The contour of an ADSR envelope is specified using four parameters: ...|$|E
2500|$|Musician Vince Clarke of the British synth pop bands Depeche Mode, Yazoo, and Erasure used a BBC Micro (and later a BBC Master) {{with the}} UMI music {{sequencer}} to compose many hits. In music videos from the 1980s featuring Vince Clarke, a BBC Micro is often present or provides text and graphics {{such as a}} clip for Erasure's [...] "Oh L'Amour". The musical group Queen used the UMI Music Sequencer on their record A Kind of Magic. The UMI is also mentioned in the CD booklet. Other bands who have used the Beeb for making music are A-ha and the reggae band Steel Pulse. Paul Ridout is credited as [...] "UMI programmer" [...] on Cars' bassist/vocalist Benjamin Orr's 1986 solo album, The Lace. Black Uhuru used the <b>Envelope</b> <b>Generator</b> from SYSTEM software (Sheffield) running on a BBC Micro, to create some of the electro-dub sounds on Try It (Anthem album 1983).|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>envelope</b> <b>generators.</b> EG1 has Delay, Attack, and Release parameters, whilst EG2 has Hold, Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release. The <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> have S-trig trigger inputs.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{triggering}} the <b>envelope</b> <b>generators,</b> one {{can connect}} {{the output of}} the envelope follower to the main VCA's INITIAL GAIN input. In that mode of operation, the <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> are not used and the envelope of the MS-20's output is simply that of the external signal.|$|R

2500|$|Hartford Courant {{music critic}} Roger Catlin {{has said that}} the album's appeal is limited to aficionados of [...] "early {{synthesizer}} experiments". Malcolm Cecil, who {{went on to become a}} leading synthesizer proponent as the co-creator of TONTO, recalls that when he first encountered a Moog 3P, his immediate thought was: [...] "Geez, this is the [...] that George Harrison made that record on. I'm looking at it, and I saw it has filters, <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> – what the hell is all this stuff?" [...] Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers has cited Electronic Sound as an influence. In his introduction to the 2014 CD booklet, he recalls discovering a rare copy of the LP in a Tokyo record shop in the 1990s and says that the sleeve [...] "now hangs on the wall of my studio, just next to my own Moog modular, beaming inspiration straight to my brain".|$|E
2500|$|The SID chip {{has three}} channels, {{each with its}} own ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> and filter capabilities. Ring {{modulation}} makes use of channel N°3, to work with the other two channels. Bob Yannes developed the SID chip and later co-founded synthesizer company Ensoniq. Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as [...] "primitive, obviously...designed by people who knew nothing about music". Often the game music has become a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 are Rob Hubbard, Jeroen Tel, David Whittaker, Chris Hülsbeck, Ben Daglish, Martin Galway, Kjell Nordbø and David Dunn among many others. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are often played as arpeggios, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. As of 2008, it became possible to play four channel 8-bit audio samples, 2 SID channels and still use filtering.|$|E
5000|$|Three-part <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> with {{separately}} adjustable Attack and Decay or Release, and selectable Sustain on or off. The <b>Envelope</b> <b>Generator</b> can {{be triggered}} by either the keyboard, or the LFO.|$|E

5000|$|There is one <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> with {{controls}} for Hold, Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release.|$|E
50|$|The <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> in the CZ synthesizers {{were far}} more {{flexible}} than a traditional four-stage ADSR envelope; they were eight stage <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> where each stage had a rate and level value. The rate value determined how fast the envelope would move; the level value would determine what pitch/filter cutoff/volume the envelope would have. There was a single sustain stage, and an end stage.|$|R
5000|$|Synthesizer: 2 oscillators, 1 noise generator, 2 filters, 1 wave shaper, 3 <b>envelope</b> <b>generators,</b> 2 LFOs, 6 virtual patches ...|$|R
50|$|The {{pulse output}} is {{available}} through the patch panel. It is unipolar (0 or +5V) and suitable for triggering the S&H or the <b>envelope</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each of the AX-60's 6 {{synthesizer}} voices {{consist of}} a single oscillator, which can output sawtooth, triangle, square, or sawtooth+triangle waveforms. Interestingly, pulse-width modulation is available for all four waveforms, with a dedicated low-frequency oscillator (LFO) for this parameter. Pitch can be modulated by an LFO or the VCF cutoff frequency ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> while the VCA volume has its own <b>envelope</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnus Choir also {{features}} an ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> state variable filter and reverb effect emulation.|$|E
50|$|Synthesizer 101 A {{monophonic}} synthesizer {{with built-in}} keyboard, oscillator, filter, ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> and attenuator.|$|E
50|$|All four ranks use {{a common}} voice-card design (called a tone {{generator}} in Yamaha parlance) to produce their sounds. Each voice card features a voltage controlled oscillator with multiple waveforms, 2-pole high-pass and low-pass voltage controlled filters, and two <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> for filter modulation and VCA control. There {{is also a}} variable band-pass filtered sawtooth wave, and high-pass filtered square wave on each card. There are a total of 36 voice cards in a GX-1, containing 36 oscillators, 72 <b>envelope</b> <b>generators,</b> and 144 filters. Due to the extensive use of epoxy-potted sub-modules, {{a complete set of}} GX-1 voice cards alone weighs more than a Polymoog.|$|R
5000|$|ADSR Envelopes - each voice {{can have}} up to five <b>envelope</b> <b>generators.</b> Each <b>envelope</b> is of the {{standard}} Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release model (ADSR), {{with the addition of}} an initial Delay phase, thus making them DADSR envelopes, to be exact.|$|R
50|$|The Minimoog can be {{controlled}} using its built-in, 44-note keyboard, which is equipped with modulation and pitch-bend wheels or by feeding in an external one-volt-per-octave pitch-control voltage and triggering the <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> with an inverted switch trigger (S-Trigger in Moog terminology).|$|R
50|$|The VCA also {{utilizes}} an ADSR envelope. There {{is a third}} ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> for modulation purposes.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a simple}} single {{transistor}} VCA. The amplitude of the VCA can be controlled by the <b>envelope</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The JX-3P's {{architecture}} {{is similar to}} the Juno series synths produced around the same time. Both machines employ the same interval-timer DCO technology, use the Roland IR3109 low-pass filter, a discrete VCA, and have an on-board stereo chorus effect. The JX-3P has a single ADSR <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> and a single modulation oscillator - both software-generated (while the Juno-6 and Juno-60 use analogue circuitry for the <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> which achieves a more dynamic sound).|$|E
50|$|AudioSim {{contains}} 2 oscillators, 4 <b>envelope</b> <b>generators,</b> 2 LFOs and a self oscillating multimode filter. The {{parameters of}} the different modules are adjustable in real-time via the GUI using the mouse. The program also has MIDI support for Gravis Ultrasound and SoundBlaster cards.|$|R
50|$|The filter can be {{controlled}} by {{either of the two}} <b>envelope</b> <b>generators,</b> an ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) and a simple AR (attack, release) and modulated by the LFO, sample-and-hold, the keyboard, or a separate CV (pedal) input on the back panel.|$|R
5000|$|ADSR {{envelopes}} - provide envelope modulation to [...] "shape" [...] {{the volume}} or harmonic {{content of the}} produced note in the time domain with the principal parameters being attack, decay, sustain and release. These are used in most forms of synthesis. ADSR control is provided by <b>envelope</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|SW18 and SW19 (toggle or momentary) are {{switches}} {{that together}} control the logic for the <b>envelope</b> <b>generator.</b> If both switches are open then the VCO only is selected. If SW18 is closed and * SW19 is open the <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> {{is controlled by}} the one shot generator. If SW18 is open and SW19 is closed the mixer only is selected. If both SW18 and SW19 are closed the VCO is selected with alternating polarity.|$|E
5000|$|One 24db/oct {{low pass}} filter/VCF, that {{can use the}} <b>envelope</b> <b>generator,</b> has three-position {{keyboard}} tracking, and is capable of self oscillation.|$|E
5000|$|EG - An <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> is a {{transient}} voltage source. A trigger {{in the presence}} of a gate, applied to an <b>Envelope</b> <b>Generator</b> produces a single, shaped voltage. Often configured as ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) it provides {{a transient}} voltage that rises and falls. It can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger {{in the presence of}} a gate. Usually it controls the amplitude of a VCA or the center frequency of a VCF, but the patchable structure of the synthesizer makes it possible to use the <b>envelope</b> <b>generator</b> to modulate other parameters such as the frequency or pulse width of the VCO. Simpler EGs (AD or AR) or more complex (DADSR—Delay, Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) are sometimes available.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{polyphonic}} analog synthesizers {{used it for}} keyboard-scanning (also wheels, knobs, displays...) and D/A or PWM {{control of}} analog levels; in newer designs, sometimes sequencing and/or MIDI-communication. The Z80 was also often involved in the sound generation itself, implementing LFOs, <b>envelope</b> <b>generators</b> and so on. Known examples include: ...|$|R
