40|$|Kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) is {{a highly}} {{productive}} pasture species that supports high stocking rates and milk production per hectare, but production per cow is low due to low nutritive value. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the grazing capacity, milk production and milk composition of dairy cows grazing irrigated kikuyu over-sown with Italian (Lolium multiflorum var. italicum), Westerwolds (L. multiflorum var. westerwoldicum) or perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) during autumn. The grazing capacity of the kikuyu–ryegrass systems was lower during winter and autumn than during spring and summer, with the seasonal grazing capacity of the perennial ryegrass treatment more evenly distributed than that of the <b>Italian</b> and Westerwolds <b>ryegrass</b> treatments. The perennial ryegrass treatment had a lower butterfat and milk production per lactation than the <b>Italian</b> and Westerwolds <b>ryegrass</b> treatments, but had the highest milk solids and fat corrected milk production per hectare. The latter was a result of the higher annual grazing capacity achieved by the perennial ryegrass treatment. It was concluded that because kikuyu over-sown with perennial ryegrass supported a higher number of animals and had a more evenly distributed fodder-flow, it achieved higher animal production per hectare than kikuyu over-sown with annual ryegrass varieties.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{growth and}} low forage quality of kikuyu restrict milk production. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the yield and nutritional value of irrigated kikuyu over-sown with perennial, <b>Italian</b> or Westerwolds <b>ryegrass</b> grazed by dairy cows. The three pasture systems reached optimum growth during different months and seasons. Lowest growth rates occurred during winter. Peak growth rates occurred during spring for the Italian ryegrass–kikuyu, summer for the Westerwolds ryegrass–kikuyu, and late spring and early summer for perennial ryegrass–kikuyu pasture. All three pasture systems had similar total annual dry matter yields (kilograms dry matter [DM] per hectare) during year 1, but the perennial ryegrass–kikuyu pasture achieved a higher annual DM yield during year 2. As kikuyu density increased in kikuyu–ryegrass pastures from winter to summer, the DM and neutral detergent fibre content increased, whereas the metabolisable energy content decreased. All three treatments were deficient in calcium during all seasons and in phosphorus during summer and autumn as a pasture for high-producing dairy cows. [URL]...|$|R

Sponsorship: BBSRC; DefraLINK (Sustainable Livestock Production Programme) IMPF: 01. 59 RONO: 00 A set of 15 Italian (Lolium multiflorum), three hybrid (L. boucheanum) and 33 perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) cultivars were evaluated for their rust susceptibility in the field. The cultivars were grown in 2001, 2004 and 2007 at 29, 32 and 27 European sites, respectively. Rust incidence was scored during different growth cycles using {{a scale from}} one (no rust) to nine (susceptible). Crown rust (Puccinia coronata f. sp. lolii) was the most frequently observed rust species on Italian, hybrid and perennial ryegrass during all three experimental years. There was a highly significant difference in mean crown rust scores among <b>Italian</b> and perennial <b>ryegrass</b> cultivars, respectively, {{in each of the}} 3 years. The ranking of the cultivars was very consistent across the different sites within each year (with some exceptions), despite a significant interaction of cultivar response with sites. Moreover, the rank order correlations of mean cultivar rust scores were highly significant (r > 0. 9) between the years. Stem rust (P. graminis f. sp. graminicola) occurred almost exclusively on perennial ryegrass. The cultivars showed significant variation in stem rust susceptibility. Rank order correlations of mean cultivar stem rust scores were mostly significant between sites within each year and highly significant between the years. The ranking of perennial ryegrass cultivars was different depending on whether crown or stem rust was scored. However, the rank order correlation between the mean disease scores of the cultivars for the two pathogens was low but still significant. At a particular site the assessment of crown or stem rust was in most cases very consistent over the period of experimentation.

This chapter presents information on the origin and systematics of these forage grasses which share a high degree of genome ancestry with the cereals originating in the eastern Mediterranean basin. It considers how plant breeding has enhanced natural genetic resources to produce valuable new varieties with improved production and livestock nutrition characteristics together with increased tolerance of environmental stresses caused by biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic (temperature, water and mineral extremes) pressures. The challenge of maintaining the optimum balance between vegetative growth and seed production is also addressed. Breeding methodologies based on traditional techniques are discussed and the integration of new biotechnologies into breeding programmes is reviewed. Breeding achievements are evaluated and future goals considered in relation to the increasingly diverse demands placed on grassland to provide ecosystem services, amenity value and systematic breeding as well as providing feed for ruminants...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{sustainable}} practices {{is an important}} goal in agriculture. One possibility involves the development of perennial cereal crops, but the mechanisms of perenniality first need to be understood. While in annual cereals flowering structures die following seed production, in perennial grasses, perenniality is achieved by maintaining at least one shoot in a vegetative state. There are two views on perennating tiller origin in perennial grasses: some authors suggest that all over-wintering tillers flower in spring and summer, leaving spring-initiated tillers to perennate, while others indicate that spring-initiated tillers are too immature to survive summer conditions, thereby implying that flowering must be prevented in some over-wintering tillers. An understanding of perenniality will therefore require an understanding of flowering control in these species. Temperate perennial grasses have dual induction requirements for flowering, where plants become competent to perceive inductive signals following vernalisation, and flowering is initiated by inductive photoperiods. Two hypotheses were formulated to test these models. The ‘environmental control hypothesis’ stated that all adequately vernalised perennial ryegrass tillers would flower on sufficient exposure to inductive photoperiods. Alternatively, the ‘spatial control hypothesis’ stated {{that in addition to}} the environmental mechanisms, a spatial control mechanism acts to regulate flowering. Two experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. Perennial <b>ryegrass</b> and <b>Italian</b> (annual) <b>ryegrass</b> were induced to flower and differences between the annual and perennial habits at flowering time were observed. However neither hypothesis was proven. In the second experiment, flowering was studied in detail in individual tillers of perennial ryegrass. The eldest tiller flowered in all flowering plants. The second eldest tiller did not flower in 72 % of plants with more than one reproductive tiller, while the third eldest tiller flowered in 94 % of these plants. These data favour the spatial control hypothesis which suggests that a spatial regulatory mechanism might act to repress flowering in some competent perennial ryegrass tillers. These results were supported by studies of meristem morphology and by a preliminary gene expression study. Maintenance of older, established tillers in a vegetative state might allow the perennial plant a greater chance of survival during summer...|$|R

Festulolium provide specialist function and novel alternatives to existing grass cultivars that may lack resilience against abiotic or biotic stresses.

In the future, it would seem very likely that breeding amphiploid Festulolium will also benefit from the genomic advances achieved in diploids using introgression. As future Festulolium cultivars are expected to be extremely diverse, this will require that regulations for registration rely on a genome-based classification and suitable official tests for better acknowledgement of agronomic advances by end-users...|$|R
40|$|In 1943 a new {{ryegrass}} {{appeared on}} the New Zealand market, known first as H 1, but later as short rotation ryegrass. This new grass was a hybrid produced by the Grasslands Division, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and combined {{some of the more}} valuable features of its parents <b>Italian</b> and perennial <b>ryegrass.</b> Since that time the grass has been tried over a wide range of soils and climate with varying management and utilisation, so that the picture of its sphere of usefulness is now fairly clear. The characteristics of the grass as first produced are as follows :- The fertility and moisture requirements for optimum production are high, being intermediate between ItaIian and perennial ryegrass; a very quick establishing grass, producing a large flush of feed in the first season; one of the earliest spring grasses; non-productive in hot, dry weather and subject to severe mortality;a phenomenal power of regeneration from shed seed under conditions of high fertility; permanence variable, depending on fertility, moisture, and management; habit of growth upright and open, demanding rotational grazing; palatability excellent. In other words, this grass leans towards the Italian parent, but is capable of becoming more or less permanent on a wider range of soils. Since the first release subsequent selections have aimed at eliminating its lack of permanence. There is some evidence that this has been achieved in part with the nucleus seed of 1948. At Lincoln College great use has been made of this grass. Since 1943 eighteen fields have been sown in which short-rotation ryegrass was a dominant constituent of the mixture. One original pasture still remains, E. 8; now in its seventh year, it is still a good pasture & the present time 242 acres of our 542 acres of pasture contain short-rotation ryegrass as a dominant. We have made some use of it on the lighter land at Ashley Dene and we have results of observations at the Kirwee Experimental Farm. Over the last two seasons measurements of seasonal production have been made so that we have accumulated some evidence. But first a word of warning as to our experiences: we extended the use of short-rotation ryegrass during a cycle of rainfall of over 30 inches per year. We now appear to have entered a cycle of about 20 inches, so that our earlier experiences may be of limited value under conditions of lower rainfall...|$|R

GR and susceptible (GS) <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> populations were established in the greenhouse and transplanted in prepared corn row beds in the fall of 2011 and 2012 at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 plants∙meter− 1 of crop row. <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> plants overwintered and developed over the following spring-summer. Glyphosate was applied at 1. 26 kg∙ae/ha (1. 5 × of labeled rate) in the spring to burndown the <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> plants and corn was planted into the ryegrass residue 2 - 3 wk later. Current corn production practices were followed. Corn density (early and late season), heigh...|$|E

40|$|A mixture {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Lincoln University to investigate if mixtures of <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass,</b> red clover and balansa clover gave more high quality forage and suppressed weeds better than <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> monocultures. Thirteen seed mixtures with varied species proportions were sown at 20 and 30 kg/ ha in March 2011. The minimum amount of <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was 50 % of the total sowing rate. Plots were harvested six times over 12 months and were neither irrigated nor fertilised. Inclusion of red clover increased yield by 41 % compared with the <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> monocultures (13. 79 vs. 9. 75 t DM/ha), and provided effective weed suppression (< 5 % of total annual yield) and high quality forage (17. 5 % crude protein, 11. 3 MJ/ kg DM metabolisable energy). No benefits were gained from mixing balansa clover with <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> The optimum seed mixture was 12 kg/ha of <b>Italian</b> <b>ryegrass,</b> 8 kg/ha of red clover and no balansa clover...|$|E
40|$|Under climate change, it {{is likely}} that the {{suitable}} area for forage crop cultivation would change in Korea. The potential cultivation areas for <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium multiflorum L.), which has been considered one of an important forage crop in Korea, were identified using the EcoCrop model. To minimize the uncertainty associated with future projection under climate change, an ensemble approach was attempted using five climate change scenarios as inputs to the EcoCrop model. Our results indicated that most districts had relatively high suitability, e. g.,> 80, for <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> in South Korea. Still, suitability of the crop was considerably low in mountainous areas because it was assumed that a given variety of <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> had limited cold tolerance. It was predicted that suitability of <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> would increase until 2050 s but decrease in 2080 s in a relatively large number of regions due to high temperature. In North Korea, suitability of <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was considerably low, e. g., 28 on average. Under climate change, however, it was projected that suitability of <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> would increase until 2080 s. For example, suitability of <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> was more than 80 in 10 districts out of 14 by 2080 s. Because cold tolerance of <b>italian</b> <b>ryegrass</b> varieties has been improved, it would be preferable to optimize parameters of the EcoCrop model for those varieties. I...|$|E
