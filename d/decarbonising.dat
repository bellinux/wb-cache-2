40|$|AbstractHeating {{is arguably}} {{one of the}} most {{difficult}} sectors to <b>decarbonise</b> in the UK's energy system. Meeting the 80 % greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2050 is likely to require that heat related emissions of CO 2 from buildings are near zero by 2050, and there is a 70 % reduction in emissions from industry (from 1990 levels). Though it is clear that the use of the natural gas network will reduce over time, recent modelling suggests a limited residual role for gas by 2050 to help meet peaks in heat demand. High levels of uncertainty about the way in which heat will be <b>decarbonised</b> present a number of challenges to policy makers. This paper will explore the risks and uncertainties associated with the transition to a low carbon heat system in the UK as outlined by the 4 th carbon budget review. The potential impact of key uncertainties on the levelised costs of heat technologies and the development of energy networks are explored using a sensitivity analysis approach. Policy changes required to <b>decarbonise</b> the heat sector are also examined...|$|R

30|$|There is {{no lack of}} {{alternative}} technologies {{to kick off the}} energy transition in other sectors.

Some also argue that hydrogen could be the solution for the decarbonisation of the transport sector, but here, electric vehicles are the front runner in terms of global policy momentum and technology development [41].

50|$|A zero-carbon city runs {{entirely on}} {{renewable}} energy; {{it has no}} carbon footprint and will in this respect not cause harm to the planet. Most cities throughout the world produce energy by burning coal, oil and gas, unintentionally emitting carbon. Almost every activity humans do involves burning one of these fossil fuels. To become a zero carbon city, an established modern city must collectively reduce {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} to zero and all practices that emit greenhouse gases must cease. Also, renewable energy must supersede other non-renewable energy sources and become the sole source of energy, so a zero-carbon city is a renewable-energy-economy city. This transition which includes <b>decarbonising</b> electricity (increasing the importance of the sources of renewable electricity) and zero-emission transport, is undertaken as a response to climate change. Zero-carbon cities maintain optimal living conditions while eliminating environmental impact. Instead of using established cities, many developers are starting from scratch {{in order to create a}} zero-carbon city. This way they can make sure every aspect of a city contributes to it being carbon free.|$|E
5000|$|Barker {{has stated}} that the climate change problem {{requires}} urgent action aimed at <b>decarbonising</b> the world economy.

Where many current calculations get it wrong is in the assumption that more stringent mitigation measures will necessarily raise the overall cost, especially when there is substantial unemployment and underuse of capacity as there is today." [...] He has expressed the view that tougher restrictions for greenhouse gas emissions may, if done properly, actually have a positive macroeconomic effect: [...] "There is some evidence that harder greenhouse-gas targets and regulation may actually increase benefits through improved innovation and distribution of low-carbon technologies, and increased revenues from taxes or permits. These revenues can be spent to further support new technology and to lower other indirect taxes, ensuring the fiscal neutrality of these measures." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{chapters}} of this cumulative dissertation {{contribute to the}} evidence base {{on the effect of}} different policies on <b>decarbonising</b> energy supply, in other words reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy use while maintaining energy services. The use of fossil fuels is the most important source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the dissertation is embedded in the wider debate on climate change and its mitigation. In particular, the analyses respond to three research questions related to the energy-climate nexus. First, which are the macroeconomic impacts of promoting energy saving and low-carbon technologies, here the impacts of promoting EU biofuel use? Second, how effective are public support mechanisms in <b>decarbonising</b> economies, here past public energy R&D spending in the presence of energy and climate policies in OECD countries?

30|$|However, {{the real}} {{challenge}} of the next decade is to move the energy transition beyond the power sector. Heat production—in industry and in buildings—is {{a major source of}} CO 2 emissions today. Certainly, efficiency improvements, renewable sources (geothermal or solar thermal), or <b>decarbonised</b> electricity (for example, for heat pumps or resistance heaters) can play an important role, but they all hit constraints at a certain point in time. For example, based on what we can see today, large-scale seasonal electricity storage for heating purposes is unlikely to become economically feasible. Other problems arise in industry, where it is not evident how to substitute high-temperature process heat (today mostly provided by natural gas) with <b>decarbonised</b> electricity.|$|R
40|$|This work tackles {{the carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) {{emission}} problem in process sites, particularly {{in relation to the}} site utility systems. There are three basic decarbonisation routes to deal with the CO 2 emission problem in energy production. These are pre-combustion, post-combustion and the oxy-combustion routes. For each route, different CO 2 separation technologies can be exploited. This work has adopted different decarbonisation routes with both conventional CO 2 separation technologies and novel pre-combustion routes. Unlike the CO 2 emission problem of energy generation taken in isolation, the emissions from a utility site can be widely distributed. To challenge this problem, utility sites are integrated with <b>decarbonised</b> combined heat and power generation systems. By doing this, some of the utility products like power, steam and fuel can be substituted by products from the <b>decarbonised</b> power generation system. Consequently, reduced carbon dioxide emissions from the utility system can be achieved. Thus, a wide range of decarbonisation designs can be applied with power generation. Among them, pre-combustion with novel CO 2 separation technology has the best performance. Integrating <b>decarbonised</b> combined heat and power generation systems can give significant potential for CO 2 emission reduction to the utility site...|$|R

This chapter summarises modelling methodologies developed in the ETSAP community to assess economic impacts of <b>decarbonising</b> energy systems at a national level. The preceding chapter focuses on a global perspective. The modelling studies outlined here show that burden sharing rules and national revenue recycling schemes for carbon tax are critical for the long-term viability of economic growth and equitable engagement on combating climate change. Traditional computable general equilibrium models and energy systems models solved in isolation can misrepresent the long run carbon cost and underestimate the demand response caused by technological paradigm shifts in a decarbonised energy system. The approaches outlined within have guided the first evidence based decarbonisation legislation and continue to provide additional insights as increased sectoral disaggregation in hybrid modelling approaches is achieved...|$|E

40|$|Urban environments, once built, {{are slow}} to change, {{therefore}} the neighbourhoods we build today, will ideally be designed to meet our future needs. The combined challenges of climate change, population growth and finite resources demand we rapidly <b>decarbonise</b> our cities. Failing to provide the necessary infrastructure to <b>decarbonise</b> Australian cities today will place a social, environmental and economic burden upon future generations of Australian society. At a high strategic level this imperative is acknowledged but in practice government planning agencies have typically placed greater emphasis upon maintaining land supply and housing affordability over effectively fostering a culture of sustainable urbanism. The absence of a strong sustainability culture within the built environment sector, has seen barriers, such as the ‘sustainability cost premium’ and the political ‘short termism’ of a three year electoral cycle, impede more rapid transition to a widespread culture of sustainable urbanism practice. This paper describes six international ‘low carbon precinct’ case studies to show how {{they were able to}} overcome some of these barriers. The case studies employ a diverse range of strategies including demonstration project trials, integrated eco-services, and innovative funding models to deliver low carbon precincts. It shows how political, skill and market barriers can be overcome through the use of different delivery models, and how these models may provide useful lessons to help develop pathways to <b>decarbonise</b> urban development in Australian cities...|$|R
