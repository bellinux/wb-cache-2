25|$|Nursing in the United Kingdom {{has a long}} history. The {{current form}} of nursing is often {{considered}} as beginning with Florence Nightingale who pioneered 'modern nursing'.

Nurses work across all demographics and requirements of the public; Adults and Children and mental health. Nurses work in a range of specialties from the broad areas of medicine, surgery, theatres, investigative sciences such as imaging, neo-natal etc. Nurses also work in a large areas of sub-specialities such as respiratory, diabetes, neurology, infectious diseases, liver, research, cardiac etc. Nurses often work in multi-disciplinary teams but <b>increasingly</b> <b>are</b> found working independently.|$|E

[...] The use of decision support software such as AMPDS is also common, as are surveillance 'add-ons'. [...] As a result, many dispatchers are trained to a high level in their own right, triaging incoming calls by severity, and providing advice or medical guidance by telephone prior {{to the arrival of}} the ambulance or rescue squad on the scene. [...] Some are certified as EMTs or paramedics in their own states, and <b>increasingly,</b> <b>are</b> becoming certified as Emergency Medical Dispatchers.|$|E
