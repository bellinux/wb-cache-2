50|$|In {{the absence}} of a joint secretariat to {{coordinate}} cooperation amongst NARC member states, Libya voluntarily played this role during the initial phase of starting up NARC which lasted for three years (2005-2008). Later on, the second meeting of NARC Ministers of Defence held in Tripoli in December 2008 approved a recommendation to establish an executive secretariat to be located in Tripoli. Subsequently, the NARC Executive Secretariat and Planning Element were inaugurated in April 2009. It was however, expected that staff from other member states will join the Executive Secretariat and PLANELM in September 2010. While both Egypt and Algeria had <b>identified</b> <b>staff</b> for the two elements, these countries were yet to sign the hosting agreement with Libya, and in some cases the deployment of staff was constrained by domestic considerations including promotions and retirements. Meanwhile, progress in generating the civilian officers for the PLANELM lagged even further behind; this essentially meant that the NARC PLANELM was purely military in 2010.|$|E

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for providing guidance to agencies on developing such plans. Its guidance states that in their continuity planning, agencies should consider the use of telework [...] that is, work performed at an employee's home or at a work location other than a traditional office.

40|$|Introduction and Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore beliefs about tobacco {{dependence}} treatment from the perspective of staff and clients in addiction treatment settings. Design and Methods: A qualitative study was conducted between August and November 2013 using grounded theory methodology. Participants were recruited from four government-funded drug and alcohol services in a regional centre of New South Wales, Australia. Treatment centre staff (n= 10) were interviewed using a semistructured interview guide and two focus groups (n= 5 and n= 6) were held with clients of the same treatment centres. Results: Both clients and staff wish to do more about tobacco use in addiction treatment services, but a number of barriers were <b>identified.</b> <b>Staff</b> barriers included lack of time, tobacco-permissive organisational culture, lack of enforcement of smoke-free policies, beliefs that tobacco is not a treatment priority for clients and that clients need to smoke as a coping strategy, and perceptions that treatment was either ineffective or not used by clients. Clients reported smoking as a habit and for enjoyment or stress relief, seeing staff smoking, nicotine replacement therapy unaffordability and perceptions that nicotine replacement therapy may be addictive, and inability to relate to telephone cessation counselling as barriers to quitting smoking. Discussion and Conclusions: Client and staff perceptions and attitudes about the treatment of tobacco, particularly those relating telephone support and nicotine replacement therapy, provided information, which will inform the design of smoking cessation programs for addiction treatment populations...|$|E
40|$|Paper 626 -Provision of {{high quality}} {{hospital}} food that meets patient???s nutritional needs requires attention to detail across hospital food services. There is limited evidence on the nutritional adequacy of hospital food and views of nursing and catering staff involved in its provision. The aim was to evaluate the adequacy of hospital food in a district general hospital for patients on normal and texture modified diets against agreed nutritional standards and to explore staff views on the provision of hospital food provision. We conducted three studies, incorporating quantitative and qualitative methodology that investigated different aspects of hospital food services. Food preparation and service was observed over three days. Weights of ingredients; methods of preparation which deviated from instructions and portion sizes were recorded. Nutritional values of meals were calculated and compared against nutritional standards. Six interviews with catering and nursing staff exploring {{their views on the}} provision of hospital food were recorded, transcribed and analysed for emerging themes. Food served to patients requiring a normal diet met the nutritional standards although portion sizes varied. Texture modified food provided below nutritional standards for macro and micro nutrients.

40|$|Objectives: Improving {{the quality}} of primary health care in South Africa is a {{national}} priority and the Western Cape Department of Health has <b>identified</b> <b>staff</b> and patient experience as a key component. Its strategic plan, Vision 2020, espouses caring, competence, accountability, integrity, responsiveness and respect {{as the most important}} organisational values. This study aimed to measure the personal values of staff, as well as current and desired organisational values. Design: A cross-sectional survey used the cultural values assessment tool. Data were analysed by the Barrett Value Centre. Setting and subjects: Staff and managers at five community health centres in the Cape Town Metropole. Outcome measures: Personal values, current and desired organisational values, organisational entropy and organisational scorecard. Results: In total, 154 staff members completed the survey. Participants reported personal values that are congruent with a move towards more patient-centred care. The top 10 current organisational values were not sharing information, cost reduction, community involvement, confusion, control, manipulation, blame, power, results orientation, hierarchy, long hours and teamwork. Desired organisational values were open communication, shared decision-making, accountability, staff recognition, leadership development and professionalism. Organisational entropy was high at 36 % of all values. Only teamwork and community involvement were found in both the current and desired culture. The organisational scorecard showed a lack of current focus on finances, evolution and patient experience. Conclusion: The organisational culture of the Metro District Health Services is currently not well aligned with the values expressed in Vision 2020, and the goal of delivering patient-centred care...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that protecting health care facilities against outbreaks of pandemic influenza requires pharmaceutical resources such as antivirals and vaccines. However, early in a pandemic, vaccines will not likely be available and antivirals will probably be of limited supply. The containment of pandemic influenza within acute-care hospitals anywhere is problematic because of open connections with communities. However, other health care institutions, especially those providing care for the disabled, can potentially control community access. We modeled a residential care facility by using a stochastic compartmental model {{to address the question}} of whether conditions exist under which nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) alone might prevent the introduction of a pandemic virus. The model projected that with currently recommended staff–visitor interactions and social distancing practices, virus introductions are inevitable in all pandemics, accompanied by rapid internal propagation. The model <b>identified</b> <b>staff</b> reentry as the critical pathway of contagion, and provided estimates of the reduction in risk required to minimize the probability of a virus introduction. By using information on latency for historical and candidate pandemic viruses, we developed NPIs that simulated notions of protective isolation for staff away from the facility that reduced the probability of bringing the pandemic infection back to the facility to levels providing protection over a large range of projected pandemic severities. The proposed form of protective isolation was evaluated for social plausibility by collaborators who operate residential facilities. It appears unavoidable that NPI combinations effective against pandemics more severe than mild imply social disruption that increases with severity...|$|E
40|$|Background Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{simulation}} training for geriatric medicine is useful and potentially very effective to improve teamwork, coordination of care and the patient experience. [1] This project aimed to design a ward-based, sustainable simulation training programme for multidisciplinary healthcare staff in an older persons’ unit. Methods To ensure the training was appropriate to the ward context, we conducted semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with staff from the multi-disciplinary team (n= 27). Interview topics included; staff views on quality of care, the current service, team work, communication and how care could be improved. Staff were asked what the programme might include to enhance multi-disciplinary care on the ward and what {{they would like to}} learn from participation. Results The majority of staff believe patients have a largely positive experience on the ward despite staff shortages. Good elderly care was associated with: a holistic approach to care, patient-centred care, multi-disciplinary teamwork and respecting the patient. Suggestions for inclusion in the programme were <b>identified.</b> <b>Staff</b> identified the following areas for personal learning; team building, receiving feedback from other disciplines, increased awareness of core issues affecting the patient and a better grasp of the system of care for the elderly. Conclusions Previous research suggests simulation training can play a role in enhancing team work and the patient experience. Prior consultation with staff can guide programme content by highlighting staff perceptions of the current service, identifying priorities for staff and service development and providing suggestions for the programme.
