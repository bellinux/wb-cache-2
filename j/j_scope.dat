40|$|In {{each case}} the direct Coombs test was {{strongly}} positive. The amount of adult haemoglobin in cord blood as {{estimated by the}} Kleihauer technique {{has been used as}} a measure of success of intraperitoneal transfusion given before birth. It is apparent that the accuracy of this measure would be com-promised if the proportion of adult haemoglobin were already altered in rhesus affected babies who had not received intraperitoneal transfusion. Since it has been shown (Bhoyroo et al., 1970) that there is a good correlation between fetal haemoglobin measured by the Singer and Kleihauer tech-niques, our results indicate that the Kleihauer technique can be used for this purpose with reason-able accuracy, bearing in mind the fact that there is a wide scatter in normal values for both rhesus affected babies and normal controls. Summary Fetal haemoglobin was estimated by the alkaline denaturation method of Singer and by the Kleihauer technique in cord blood of 14 infants affected by haemolytic disease of the newborn. No difference in the proportion of fetal haemoglobin was found compared with that of normal infants of similar gestational age. We are grateful to Dr. <b>J.</b> W. <b>Scopes</b> and Mr. H.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{linguistic}} stereotypes of cities. Therefore, {{the object of}} our interest is onomastic material (oikonyms, ie. own settlement names), which, however, is viewed {{from the perspective of}} cognitively and culturally oriented linguistics. The main theory, which the thesis is based on, is J. Bartmiński's theory of stereotype (incl. the so-called. profiling). We have dealt with the names of three Czech cities that currently belong to the administrative unit of the Vysočina Region: Jihlava, Pelhřimov, Pacov. Following the methodology of Polish authors of <b>J.</b> Bartmiński's <b>scope</b> we have analyzed each of them in terms of three areas: language data, text data and empirical data. We found out concrete connotations of these names in Czech language, and {{on the basis of these}} findings of ours we have formulated their stereotypes. Besides the formulation of the three selected specific stereotypes, this thesis also presents some general observations about stereotypes of cities. It is esp. a case of a proposal the profiles (ie. general aspects, which are usually used in the process of profiling a stereotype), with which you can work in research on stereotypes of cities in general. Furthermore, this thesis elaborates the methodology of analyzing text data, which should be in the centre of attention [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{qualified}} pharmacists {{in our country}} is currently extremely high. One way of achieving; {{the goal is to}} increase intake of student’s enrolled tor the course in different schools of pharmacy. The pharmacy profession is among the highest health professional in the world. Despite this is the professional that many people confuse its duties and scope of work. This study was undertaken in order to know what generally the A-level PCB students know about pharmacy profession and if they would wish to opt it for further studies. A tool with structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the students from Ilala district in Dar es Salaam secondary schools taking Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Most of students knew about pharmacy profession where 94. 5 % agreed that pharmacist is the drug expert. In addition to that a workforce plan, training and education is needed to emphasize on the <b>j</b> oh <b>scope</b> and responsibilities of the pharmacist. It can be concluded that the pharmacy profession is faced by problems which are multifaceted. A coordinated effort to enhance pharmacy workforce plan, training and education is needed in order to prepare an adequate number of competent pharmacists in the country and help the recognition of the professional in the world...|$|R

RAE 2008 Aims and objectives: This project was commissioned by the Yorkshire Museums Libraries & Archives Council (YMLAC) in order to ?increase YMLAC?s and the Archive domain?s knowledge and understanding of the methodologies / approaches available to undertake economic and social impact assessment. ? The objectives were to: - Systematically review the published evidence on economic and social impact assessments adopted in the archives domain, both within the UK and internationally - Develop a taxonomy of usage, based on the need to differentiate primary and secondary users, economic and social impacts - Assess the transferability of other schemes developed for the valuation of information or information services to the archives sector - Develop an impact taxonomy that addresses economic / social impacts over time - Produce a mapping of impact type against methods, noting any particular problems or opportunities in deploying these methodologies. Conclusions and recommendations: Impact assessment for the archives sector has been very limited but the existing evidence at least indicates the type and range of impacts to be expected; there is however insufficient research data of the rigour and scope required for generalisation across the domain. Methodologies that could be applied to the archives domain include SP techniques, which might address some of the difficulties of assessing the impact of secondary usage and the ?non-user?; however, more detailed case studies are necessary to establish the parameters of value, before these could be applied in practice. An approach adapted from the health sector concept of QALYs could offer a way forward. Thought should also be given to whether the level of investment required in developing complex methodologies can be justified by their eventual end-use. Such techniques are dependent on the perceived ?public value? of archives, which highlights the need for further work to raise awareness of the domain and what it does...|$|R
40|$|The term 'globalisation' {{has been}} used widely and loosely. On the one hand there are the descriptives, of {{increased}} flows of goods, services, capital and people. On the other hand there is the prescriptive agenda, {{that there is a}} new global era, ruling out certain economic and political choices. The blurring of the lines between the two categories-of the descriptive and the prescriptive-presents the obvious starting point for academic investigation. And in both cases, the role played by technology takes centre stage. In the first case the argument is that the new developments in information technology, computing, telecommunications, broadcasting and so on have opened up the world economy. As for the second category, such developments are seen as leaving national governments helpless in the face of global corporate players. In this paper we therefore reconsider some of the evidence, focussing particular on the role of technology. N. B.

40|$|Before I {{started to}} read this book, I searched for the authors’ {{definition}} of user experience (UX). To my surprise, I did not find one. Of course, I may have missed it; however, if it is really missing then this is definitely a weak aspect of the book. The reason I started with this search is because many people have issues with UX, usability, and related concepts. These terms are often used without scoping or defining them, which diminishes the value of work conducted in this field. For {{the purposes of this}} review, I will adopt the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9241 - 210 definition of UX: “A person’s perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system, or service” ([URL] This comes quite close to the book’s definition of user research: “the systematic study of the goals, needs, and capabilities of users so as to specify design, construction, or improvement of tools to benefit how users work and live” (p. 9). However, although related, these definitions do differ. The definition of user research includes the definition of UX. This makes for an odd start to the book. Fortunately, some resources available online provide more information on {{the ins and outs of}} UX [1, 2, 3]. These sources can help readers get a solid footing for reading this book. Many books have already been published on UX, some even by the same publisher [4, 5, 6]. Where Buxton’s book [4] emphasizes the qualitative aspects of UX, Tullis and Albert [5] and Goodman et al. [6] focus on quantitative aspects of UX, as this book does. However, they focus on data acquisition and not on data analysis, which is the prime focus here. This is what makes this book valuable for both students and practitioners. Both these categories of readers can also benefit from a complementary book by the same authors [7]. This book provides more hands-on computing practice, examples, and exercises to give readers a jump-start on quantifying UX. The book takes a pragmatic and realistic [...] hence, the best possible [...] approach. In chapter 1, the authors provide four decision trees that help the practitioner or student choose the right chapter to start with (and skip the others). As such, it provides even pointers up to section level for the methods denoted in the decision trees. So, there are no more excuses for making a mistake when choosing your design of quantitative analysis. Having said this, it should be noted that the book provides an overview of rather basic statistical analysis and does not touch advanced statistical analysis (for example, mixed models and structural equation models). As such, the book provides room for follow-up books to continue where it leaves off. Without going into too much depth, I can say that the authors provide the basic mathematics underlying their analysis. For those that lack the fundamentals of statistics, the authors provide an appendix with a nutshell overview. Reading this book requires high-school-level mathematics, nothing more, which makes the book accessible to a very wide audience. On the other hand, those already in the field can use it as a refresher. Moreover, each chapter takes a historical stance, providing sufficient explanations and a decent list of references. I will admit that I had a false start with this book. I noticed its weak spot [...] perhaps its only one [...] from the beginning. However, taken as a whole, it provides a pragmatic approach to quantifying UX, without oversimplifying or claiming too much. It delivers what it promises. As such, this book is valuable for both practitioners and students, in virtually any discipline. It can help psychologists transfer their statistical knowledge to UX practice, it can help practitioners quickly assess their envisioned design and analysis, it can help engineers demystify UX, and it can help students appreciate UX’s merits. 1) Hassenzahl, M.; Tractinsky, N.

40|$|Includes bibliographies. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the distribution patterns, reproductive cycles, growth rates and physiological processes in four species of South African marine mussels - Aulacomya ater, Choromytilus meridionalis, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Perna perna. The first chapter is a preliminary account of the introduction of the invasive M. galloprovincialis, and its ecological effects. Its rate of invasion is estimated by monitoring changes in the diet of oystercatchers, as well as comparing its resistance to silt and dessication, and its reproductive and its growth strategies with those of other intertidal mussel species. It appears that although presently mainly confined to cool water of the west and south coasts, M. galloprovincialis will soon colonize in the near future the warmer waters of the east coasts. The second chapter consists of a survey revealing the distribution patterns and standing stock of the four species around the South African coasts. The cool upwelled waters of the west coast support the major populations of A. ater, C. meridionalis and M. galloprovincialis, while the warm east coast is mainly colonized by the brown mussel P. perna. The Transkei and Natal coasts are intensively exploited by subsistence gatherers with an annual rate of removal approaching or even exceeding standing stock. The overall wild crop is ca > 1000 metric tons, while aquaculture output is estimated at 800 tons per annum. The third chapter looks at the timing and the intensity of spawning of the four species. Gamete build up and release results in marked variation in flesh yield. The dry flesh weight of M. galloprovincialis can vary three-fold between ripe and spawned conditions at a length of 65 mm. Equivalent figures for C. meridionalis, A. ater and P. perna are respectively 2. 8, 2. 3 and 2. 2 -fold. It appears that A. ater shows the greatest gamete output with three annual spawnings, followed by M. galloprovincialis and C. meridionalis with two protracted spawnings. The fourth chapter deals with growth performance of the four species under different environmental conditions. A. ater consistently grows much slower than other species, is intolerant to aerial exposure or silt load and grows best in cold waters. C. meridionalis also likes cool water conditions, but is the most tolerant of silt load. M. galloprovincialis and P. perna are the least affected by tidal exposure and both grow faster in warm water conditions. In terms of aquaculture development, M. galloprovincialis is the most appropriate species to grow on the west and south coasts, while P. perna will be the candidate for the east coasts of South Africa. The fifth chapter compares rates of filtration, respiration and ammonia excretion, as well as absorption efficiencies and subsequent scope for growth in the four mussel species. All species maintain a relatively steady scope for growth over the ration levels 1 - 7 mg 1 -. However, rates are the highest in M. galloprovincialis (254 J h- 1 at 7 mg 1 - 1 ration) followed by C. meridionalis and P. perna at 117 and 70 J h- 1 and finally A. ater, with only 23 <b>J</b> h- 1. <b>Scope</b> for growth in M. galloprovincialis is high at all temperatures (1 o- 20 Â°c) while that of A. ater is low and declines rapidly with temperature. The scope for growth of P. perna and C. meridionalis is intermediate, but while C. meridionalis becomes less efficient at higher temperatures P. perna show a rapid increase with increasing temperature. These physiological measures are correlated to the observed distribution pattern and growth rates in the field...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionPolitical Participation {{is one of}} {{the main}} discussions in {{political}} sociology and political development in all countries. It is considered as an aspect of political development that can also support the political organizations to achieve democracy. In fact, the degree of political participation is a mean to know whether governments are logical or not. The main goal of this study is to examine social-psychological causes influencing political participation of Isfahan University teachers. The factor of political tendency and membership in organs are based on Huntington’s and Nelson’s Views. They considered social superiority and a person’s capability on a person’s tendency on political participation. They believed that if a person tends to be a member of group and councils, they will perform political participation more. On the other hand, there are other factors such as age, education, earning, race, tribe, religion which are based on Budwell’s View. It is necessary that some factors such as media and political effects are based on Olson’s theory. First hypothesis: There are some relations between demographic factors (people’s age, sex, single / marriage, member in organs) and political Participation. Second hypothesis: There are some relations between political environment and political Participation. Third hypothesis: There are some relations between individualism and political Participation. Fourth hypothesis: There are some relations between political knowledge and political Participation. Fifth hypothesis: There are some relations between collective media and political Participation. Sixth hypothesis: There are some relations between political tendency and political Participation. Seventh hypothesis: There are some relations between political effects and political Participation. Eighth hypothesis: There are some relations between relative abandonment and political Participation. Ninety hypothesis: There are some relations between sense at political powerless and political Participation. Sense at political powerless and political Participation. Matherial & MethodsMethodology of this study has done on quantity based on examination. Data is collected by questionnaire. The statistical society were teachers in Isfahan university based on the last statistics of Instruction Organ in 1388 - 89 among 511 teachers. They have chosen by these factors including: Isfahan University itself which is large, it contains a great amount of teachers and scholars in internal and external, political movements. The second, it is easy to political movements. The second, it is easy to access teachers to gather data fine by researchers in Foresaid University. It is necessary that University teachers are more realism than other common people; they can teach us the dominant realities on political environment in the University. In order to collect example, Cooker an formula has been used, they were 119, which were added also to 120. They have chosen randomly in the systematic system. The main factors are examined in the following ways:The dependant factors of same study are political Participation. They constitute: political decision, choice of leaders (vote), revolution, coup d’état, scholar councils, lecture sessions and political debate, general crowds, walking, vote, crowds, Participation in informal political discussions (among family members, family, friends or office), member in groups, accessing political post in the offices. There were 11 points which were examined by Likert 5 degree. The choice of 2 is absolutely opposite, and 5 is absolutely agree. There were 6 items in political knowledge, and 7 in political environment, 11 in individualism, 7 in political tendency, 9 in political effects, and 12 in relative abandonment which were based on Likert 5 degree,Discussion of Results & ConclusionsAccording to this study, there is meaningful relation between collective, media factors (r= 0. 53), political knowledge (r= 0. 27), political environment (r= 0. 77), political effects (r= 0. 37), political tendency (r= 0. 28), relative abandonment (r=- 0. 24), political sense of powerless (r= 0. 28) and political Participation. The results show that collective media has the mast meaningful relations to dependant factor. The results of multi-level Regression show that there is direct dependence between collective media factors (Beta= 0. 31), political environment (Beta= 0. 29), political knowledge (0. 15), relative abandonment (Beta= 0. 18), political effect (Beta= 0. 22) and political tendency (Beta= 0. 17). As whole, these factors can assign the dependant factors (R 2 = 0. 39). Data of political Participation among University teachers show that middle of political Participation in 50 / 48 for every person in the study which is high comparing the range of marks (55 to 11). It shows high Participation among University teachers. The results of previous studies and theoretical studies show that political Participation of University teachers are based on changeable, different factors. The results show if feeling of political, lack self-confidence in political powerless, people’s relative abandonment will increase, such factors can decrease social, political Participation, of University teachers. The results show that political tendency of those who have answered, political knowledge, application of collective media and political environment can influence University teachers to increase political Participation. The results of same study and Moradi et al (2009) were based on meaningful membrane in organs, were aligned with the studies of Dianati (2003) about political knowledge, but it was not aligned with Chaboki (2003) about sex. It is necessary that it was aligned with Kavoosi’s studies (2007) about psychology such as political tendency. Besides, one of factors which has influenced on political Participation meaningfully but it is contrary is sense of political powerless. The results show, if a person feels political powerless more, he will accompany in the political trends less. It is aligned with Hashemi’s studies et al (2009). The results of study about political Participation of University teachers are aligned relatively with Milbrat and Goel’s political tendency and political Participation. Milbrat and Goel emphasize that if a person was influenced on political tendency more (including political discussions, membrane in organs and political information) he will also accompany in politics more. For them, political environment is also important in political Participation, hence political culture may accelerate Participation councils, or vice versa it may notThere for, the principles of play such as rote rights, rote frequency, political agents, the views to street crowds, political movements, pressure groups are the main factors. Besides, the results of study about political Participation of University teachers are based on Vakari’s and Olson’s views which are agreeable. Vakari believes collective media plays key and influencing roles in voting and political Participation. For him, collective media is located in the center political issues; it can call people to accompany in politics to increase political Participation. Media is the pulse of power, because people who access it are able to influence others. For Olson, the effect of politics is based on change, and revolution of politics range. When people accompany in a choice more, they will deserve their choices and effects.
