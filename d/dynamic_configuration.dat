2500|$|An old {{standing}} dynamic {{problem is}} how DNA [...] "self-replication" [...] {{takes place in}} living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of supercoiled DNA fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated biopolymer molecules called fibers or chains (that are made of repeating nucleotide units of four basic types, attached to deoxyribose and phosphate groups), its molecular structure in vivo undergoes <b>dynamic</b> <b>configuration</b> changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions. Supercoiling, packing with histones in chromosome structures, and other such supramolecular aspects also involve [...] in vivo DNA topology which is even more complex than DNA molecular geometry, thus turning molecular modeling of DNA into an especially challenging problem for both molecular biologists and biotechnologists. Like other large molecules and biopolymers, DNA often exists in multiple stable geometries (that is, it exhibits conformational isomerism) and configurational, quantum states which are {{close to each other}} in energy on the potential energy surface of the DNA molecule.|$|E

50|$|However, dynamic {{configurations}} (i.e., {{not stored}} in a static configuration file but taken from outside the host, and potentially changing after boot) have been an increasingly more common configuration, especially as we've moved from physically large servers to more portable hosts that may be plugged and unplugged (or moved from WiFi hotspot to WiFi hotspot) at {{the will of the}} user. Bootp was an early protocol used for this, and to this day its descendant DHCP is still very common.

40|$|Information {{visibility}} {{is generally}} useful for decision makers distributed across supply chains. Availability {{of information on}} inventory levels, price, lead times, demand, etc. can help reduce uncertainties as well as alleviate problems associated with bullwhip effect. A majority of extant literature in this area assume a static supply chain network configuration. While this was sufficient a few decades ago, advances in e-commerce and {{the ease with which}} order processing can be performed over the Internet necessitates appropriate <b>dynamic</b> (re) <b>configuration</b> of supply chains over time. Each node in the supply chain is modeled as an actor who makes independent decisions based on information gathered from the next level upstream. A knowledge-based framework is used for <b>dynamic</b> supply chain <b>configuration</b> and to consider the effects of inventory constraints and 'goodwill,' as well as their effects on the performance dynamics of supply chains. Preliminary results indicate that neither static nor <b>dynamic</b> <b>configurations</b> are consistently dominant.
