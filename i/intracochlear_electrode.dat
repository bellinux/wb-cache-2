Background: The development of perimodiolar electrode arrays for cochlear implants requires detailed information from postoperative radiologic assessment on the position of the array in relation to the cochlear structures.

Such measurements, however, require one to control the possible interference between fMRI acquisition and the implanted electrodes.

ECAP and psychophysical thresholds were obtained for basal, middle, and apical probe electrodes in the presence of a subthreshold interaction stimulus delivered simultaneously to each of seven to eight interaction electrodes per probe. The results showed highly significant correlations between ECAP and psychophysical threshold shifts for all nine subjects, which suggests that the ECAP can adequately predict psychophysical electrical-field interaction patterns for subthreshold stimuli.

Our hypothesis is that RSC stimulation would convey {{the information contained in}} acoustic signals more effectively, improving sound perception and hearing performance for speech in noise and music. Two main factors that RSC takes into account are channel interaction [1] and refractory properties [2] of the stimulated neural population. They can be characterized by electrophysiological measurements of the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) using “spread of excitation” (SoE) and “recovery function” characterization paradigms respectively [3]. Using this information, for a given stimulus sequence, it is possible to calculate the refractory state of each stimulation site at any given time. In RSC, the stimulus is shaped according to the refractory states of stimulation sites. The spectral representation of the input sound is weighted by the refractory recovery information as well as the electric field distribution function before the next stimulus is selected.

All six specimens underwent glycol methyl methacrylate embedding, were examined via micro-CT scan and were then sectioned for histological analysis of undecalcified samples via BSEM and OM.

The SMSP has previously been compared with the present MSP (MULTIPEAK) processor and found to improve speech comprehension results. The SMSP speech processing scheme has recently been implemented successfully in a new speech processor, also developed at the University of Melbourne, which utilises digital signal processing techniques. The programming flexibility of this processor has facilitated the investigation of variations of the SMSP strategy which might provide further enhancement of speech perception. Three variations have been investigated: firstly, increasing the constant pulse rate from the usual 250 Hz to 400 Hz; secondly, changing the number of electrodes selected in each stimulation period from 6 to numbers between 4 and 8; thirdly, sharpening the spectral peaks prior to selection of the active electrodes. The results of these studies showed that all three variations had minimal effect on speech perception in quiet, but that {{increasing the number of}} electrodes selected for stimulation to 8, or increasing the rate of stimulation, was advantageous for some subjects when listening in background noise.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments investigating both sequential and concurrent auditory grouping in implant listeners. Some grouping cues used by normal-hearing listeners should also be available to implant listeners, while others (e. g. fundamental frequency) {{are unlikely to be}} useful. As poor spectral resolution may also limit implant listeners’ performance, the spread of excitation in the cochlea was assessed using Neural Response Telemetry (NRT) and the results were related to those of the perceptual tasks. Experiment 1 evaluated sequential segregation of alternating tone sequences; no effect of rate or evidence of perceptual ambiguity was found, suggesting that automatic stream segregation had not occurred. Experiment 2 was an electrode pitch-ranking task; some relationship was found between pitch-ranking judgements (especially confidence scores) and reported segregation. Experiment 3 used a temporal discrimination task; this also failed to provide evidence of automatic stream segregation, because no interaction was found between the effects of sequence length and electrode separation. Experiment 4 explored schema-based grouping using interleaved melody discrimination; listeners were not able to segregate targets and distractors based on pitch differences, unless accompanied by substantial level differences. Experiment 5 evaluated concurrent segregation in a task requiring the detection of level changes in individual components of a complex tone. Generally, large changes were needed and abrupt changes were no easier to detect than gradual ones. In experiment 6, NRT testing confirmed substantially overlapping simulation by <b>intracochlear</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Overall, little or no evidence of auditory grouping by implant listeners was found.
