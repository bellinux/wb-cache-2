5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs at the <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel {{to cover the}} Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
5|$|From her <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Florida, Stowe {{was greatly}} impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings {{the praises of}} Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone had the Transvaal's {{annexation}} as a British territory formally {{announced in}} Pretoria on 12 April 1877. Burgers resigned {{and returned to}} the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as President was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train {{for the first time in}} his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the sea.|$|E

50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic Peninsula is disputed but {{apparently}} occurred in 1820. The most likely <b>first</b> <b>sighting</b> <b>of</b> the Antarctic Peninsula, {{and also of}} the whole Antarctic mainland, was probably on 27 January 1820 by an expedition of the Russian Imperial Navy led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen. But the party did not recognize as the mainland {{what they thought was}} an icefield covered by small hillocks.|$|R

500|$|Shackleton {{was shocked}} by his <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Nimrod after her arrival in London from Newfoundland in June 1907. [...] "She was much {{dilapidated}} and smelt strongly of seal oil, and an inspection [...] showed that she needed caulking and that her masts {{would have to be}} renewed." [...] However, in the hands of experienced ship-fitters she soon [...] "assumed a more satisfactory appearance." [...] Later, Shackleton reported, he became extremely proud of the sturdy little ship.|$|E
500|$|Hubbell {{would not}} permit Antarctic to sail with Abby on board; {{possibly}} he had designs on her. Morrell sailed from Manila without her, and initially had little luck in finding sea cucumbers in any quantity. Eventually Antarctic reached the Carteret Islands, a small atoll which now forms part of Papua New Guinea, and found sea cucumbers in abundance. [...] Morrell set up camp {{on one of the}} islands, where he faced a hostile reception from the population, who were nevertheless intrigued by their <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> metal. [...] There were thefts of tools; Morrell responded by holding several chiefs as hostages, at which the islanders mounted a full-scale attack on Morrell's shore base. Fourteen crew members were killed; Antarctic was forced to make a hasty withdrawal, leaving much equipment behind.|$|E

500|$|The city {{remains in}} a {{destroyed}} condition. Syria has left the ruins in place and built a museum to memorialize its destruction. [...] It maintains billboards at the ruins of many buildings and effectively preserves it in the condition that the Israeli army left it in. The former residents of the town have not returned and Syria discourages the re-population of the area. However, in the 2004 census by the Central Bureau of Statistics, a small population of 153 people living in 28 households was recorded, all living {{in the neighborhood of}} Rasm al-Rawabi. The Rough Guide to Syria describes the current appearance of the city: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the flattened houses on Quneitra's outskirts is the most dramatic; many of the unscathed roofs simply lie on top of a mass of rubble, leaving the impression of a building that has imploded." ...|$|E
500|$|Bär {{was born}} on 25 May 1913 in Sommerfeld near Leipzig in the Kingdom of Saxony, a federated state of the German Empire. His parents were farmers, and in 1916, his father was killed in action on the Western Front of World War I. Bär {{attended}} the Volksschule, a combined primary and lower secondary school, in Sommerfeld. Initially, he planned on taking over the family farm in Engelsdorf and following graduation attended the agriculture school in Wurzen. Aged 15, he became a glider pilot, joining the glider club on the [...] "Schwarzer Berg" [...] (Black Mountain) at Taucha. Bär then {{wanted to become a}} forester, for everything associated with wildlife and forests interested him. His <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> a Junkers transport aircraft changed his mind and convinced him that he should become an aviator. As a teenager, he had ambitions to become an airline pilot with Deutsche Luft Hansa. He acquired the nickname Pritzl because of his affection for Pritzl candy bars.|$|E
500|$|The finest {{architects of}} the day {{submitted}} plans to transform the older family house into a modern architectural extravaganza. [...] Among them was Robert Adam, who submitted {{a plan for the}} west portico, but his idea was dropped. The architect Nicholas Revett was consulted and created the west portico. Today, the <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the house as approached from the drive is this west end of the house, which appears as a Grecian temple. The eight-columned portico, inspired by the Temple of Bacchus in Teos was completed by 1770, and is considered to be the earliest example of Greek revival architecture in Britain. The opposite (east) end of the house, designed by Roger Morris and completed c. 1755, appears equally temple-like, but this time the muse was the Villa Rotunda in Vicenza. Thus the two opposing porticos, east and west, illustrate two architectural styles of the late-18th century: the earlier Roman inspired Palladian architecture and the more Greek inspired Neoclassicism.|$|E

500|$|Richard Owen {{showed that}} fossils of extinct species Darwin found in South America were allied to living {{species on the}} same continent. In March 1837, ornithologist John Gould {{announced}} that Darwin's rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea (though their territories overlapped), that mockingbirds collected on the Galápagos Islands represented three separate species each unique to a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches. Darwin began speculating, {{in a series of}} notebooks, on the possibility that [...] "one species does change into another" [...] to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> an ape, and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed.|$|E
500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Australia on 12 January 1836 {{reminded}} him of Patagonia, but inland the country improved and he was soon filled with admiration at the bustling city of Sydney. On a journey into the interior he came across a group of aborigines who looked [...] "good-humoured & pleasant & they appeared far from such utterly degraded beings as usually represented". They gave him a display of spear throwing for a shilling, and he reflected sadly on how their numbers were rapidly decreasing. At a large sheep farm he joined a hunting party and caught his first marsupial, a [...] "potoroo" [...] (rat-kangaroo). Reflecting on the strange animals of the country, he thought that an unbeliever [...] "might exclaim 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been [...] work; their object however has been the same & certainly the end in each case is complete'," [...] yet an antlion he was watching was very similar to its European counterpart. That evening he saw the even stranger platypus and noticed that its bill was soft, unlike the preserved specimens he had seen. Aboriginal stories that they laid eggs were believed by few Europeans.|$|E
500|$|The {{regiment}} {{remained at}} Hill 70 until 12 May, {{when they moved}} [...] north-east to Maler. On arrival they established a line of observation posts and sent reconnaissance patrols further east into the desert. Four days later the 2nd Squadron sent a troop on a reconnaissance to Sabhket El Bardawil. On 18 May the regiment occupied the Katia Oasis, {{and the next day}} sent a patrol to Ard [...] to the east. They gained their <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Turkish forces in the region, but they were too distant to engage. On 29 May the regiment, {{along with the rest of}} the brigade, travelled thirty miles overnight to Salmana, and early next morning surprised the Turkish garrison. The main part of the assault was carried out by the Auckland Mounted Rifles. The water supply at Salmana was insufficient for a complete mounted brigade, so they had to return to Maler that night. Between 21–23 June the regiment provided flank protection for the 1st Light Horse Brigade on a reconnaissance of Katia. Then, on their return to Maler, they were attached to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, who gave them the nickname [...] "Well and Trulys". In July the regiment lost its machine-gun section, which was transferred to the newly formed brigade Machine-Gun Squadron. The Maxim guns were replaced by three Lewis guns, one per squadron. The loss of the section also reduced the regiment's establishment to twenty-four officers and 499 other ranks.|$|E

[...] Baker and his men turned to flee, directly into Prevost's oncoming regulars. [...] The Patriots, already shaken, were quickly overwhelmed by {{the large numbers of}} rangers and Indians appearing in the underbrush.
