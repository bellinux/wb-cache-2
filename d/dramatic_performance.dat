5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on <b>dramatic</b> <b>performance.</b> Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Toyah began a {{relationship}} with Spider Nugent (Martin Hancock) in 1999, which lasted until Hancock's departure in July 2000. The following year, the character {{was the focus of}} one of Coronation Streets most controversial storylines, which saw her beaten and raped by Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). The storyline marked the first time in forty years that the show had included a rape. The storyline was criticised by some former Coronation Street cast members, who thought the producers were using the subject of rape to boost ratings. Taylor decided to leave the show in July 2002 and her character departed on-screen the following year on 5 February 2003. Toyah was well received by critics and Taylor received the Best Young Actor accolade at the Inside Soap Awards and Best <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Performance</b> at The British Soap Awards.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{researchers}} now use {{variants of}} a deep learning recurrent NN called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997.

Google also used LSTM to improve machine translation, Language Modeling and Multilingual Language Processing.

50|$|<b>Dramatic</b> <b>performances</b> {{given in}} Koothambalams, {{known by the}} names of Koothu and Koodiyattam, often used Sanskrit and Malayalam. In Koodiyattam, the clown (vidooshaka) is allowed to use Malayalam while the hero recites slokas in Sanskrit. Tholan, a legendary court poet {{in the period of}} the Kulasekhara kings, is {{believed}} to have started this practice. The language of Kramadeepikas and Attaprakarams, which lay down the rules and regulations for these <b>dramatic</b> <b>performances,</b> is considerably influenced by the composite literary dialect of Manipravalam. Various hagiographies on the life of the Vaishnava saint Ramanuja were in manipravalam.|$|R

25|$|In Of the Standard of Taste, Hume {{argues that}} no rules {{can be drawn}} up about what is a tasteful object. However, a {{reliable}} critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and having extensive experience. Of Tragedy addresses {{the question of why}} humans enjoy tragic drama. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a <b>dramatic</b> <b>performance.</b> There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Sutherland's voice started to decline and her vibrato {{loosened}} to an intrusive extent. However, {{thanks to her}} vocal agility and solid technique, she continued singing the most difficult roles amazingly well. As her vocal security to some extent lessened, paradoxically her dramatic grasp of the theatrical moment heightened. During the 1980s, she added Anna Bolena, Amalia in I masnadieri, and Adriana Lecouvreur to her repertoire, and repeated Esclarmonde at the Royal Opera House performances in November and December 1983. Her last full-length <b>dramatic</b> <b>performance</b> was as Marguerite de Valois (Les Huguenots) at the Sydney Opera House in 1990, {{at the age of}} 63, where she sang Home Sweet Home for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of Die Fledermaus on New Year's Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. According to her own words, given in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2002, her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in Esclarmonde. She considered those performances and recordings her best.|$|E

In order to check these revolutionary impulses, the British Government proceeded to impose the <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Performances</b> Act.
