I had a far from {{spectacular}} game {{and we ended}} up losing. Afterwards, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> have a shower and I could see that Jonsey was very upset... But what right did our coach have to tell the other players, [...] "Don't worry, fellows, you played without a full-back today'.

2500|$|On 6 November 2010 Ledley {{added another}} goal to his tally against Aberdeen {{in a league}} record 9–0 victory. [...] Four days later Ledley was sent off {{for the first time}} in his career when he was red carded for a {{challenge}} on Hearts midfielder Ian Black during a 0–2 defeat at Tynecastle. [...] Ledley publicly defended himself, stating [...] "I couldn’t believe it when the ref sent me off. I thought it was a fair challenge", and added “I spoke to Ian [...] after it and even he told me I got the ball – there was no way <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> intentionally hurt anyone." [...] Manager Neil Lennon also defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson's decision as [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
2500|$|After Don Bradman in {{the batting}} order was his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, a dimulative (5'6") batsman {{who had been}} a great strokemaker before the war and had made his Test debut in England in 1938. He captained the scratch Australian Services cricket team which drew the Victory Tests 2–2 against England in 1945. After the war he took his batting more seriously and was more defensive, though never dull, and he never failed in a series. He had an impish good humour, but this stopped when he walked onto the field and [...] "there is no better team man in Australia". Keith Miller had been a young batsmen before the war better known for playing Australian rules {{football}} in his native Victoria. In the war he was a Flight Lieutenant in the RAAF, and injured his back crash-landing a de Havilland Mosquito, which affected the rest of his playing career. He was the star of the Victory Tests, having decided that [...] "The people of England wanted an escape from the hellish suffering they had experienced for so many years. Those who turned up to watch cricket deserved something better than grim, unentertaining stonewalling, and I was determined to go for runs every time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat". He hit a swashbuckling 185 in 165 minutes for the Dominion XI vs England at Lords with seven towering sixes and became a cricketing star. Miller kept to this philosophy throughout his career, becoming one of the world's most entertaining strokemakers and a magnet for the crowds. Although an all-rounder Miller saw himself as a batsman first and batted in the top order throughout his career, though it suffered as he was often spent from bowling. Ron Hamence was the nearly man of the Australian team, he made his Test debut after his career best 145 vs the MCC and was stranded on 30 not out in their first innings collapse to Doug Wright. He played India in 1947–48 and toured England in 1948, but played only two more Tests as he could not force his way into the strong Australian team.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{he became}} a {{professional}} cricketer Tyson played for Middleton in the Central Lancashire League, Knypersley in the North Staffordshire League, Durham University and the Army. Although invited for trials by Lancashire at Old Trafford he was turned down ‘because he dipped at the knee’, so he qualified for Northamptonshire in 1952 through residence. Tyson made his first class debut against the Indian tourists in 1952, after his first ball the slips moved back an extra five yards and his first wicket {{was that of the}} Test batsman Pankaj Roy for a duck. Tyson's second first class match was against the Australians in 1953. Richie Benaud was told that the unknown Tyson was a bowler fresh out of Durham University who would give them no trouble. They began to revise this estimation when they saw the wicket-keeper take position halfway to the boundary and young Tyson walked over to the sightscreen to begin his run up. The first ball ricocheted off the edge of Colin McDonald's bat to the boundary, the second trapped him lbw before he could play a stroke, the third was a bouncer that flew past Graeme Hole's nose and the fourth was a yorker that clean bowled Hole and sent his stumps cartwheeling over the wicket-keeper's head. In 1954 at Old Trafford Tyson hit the sightscreen with the ball after it bounced once on the pitch. He is one of only four bowlers to have achieved this feat {{in the history of the}} game, the others being Charles Kortright, Roy Gilchrist and Jeff Thomson. and he was given his county cap in the same year, his first full First Class season. Tyson reckoned that he received his Test call up when ex-England captains Gubby Allen and Norman Yardley saw him hospitalise Bill Edrich at Lords. Edrich, a noted hooker of fast bowling, mistimed his stroke due to the speed of the ball and his cheek bone was broken. The MCC were thereby convinced of the speed and hostility of Tyson's bowling and decided to take him to Australia. He was selected to play for England against Pakistan at the Oval in 1954, taking 4–35 and 1–22 and making 3 runs in each innings batting at number eight, but Pakistan won the match by 24 runs thanks to the bowling of Fazal Mahmood. Although he batted at number eleven in league cricket [...] "The Middleton groundsman was a fatalist. He used to start up the roller to refurbish the wicket when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat". Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 [...] "was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat", and he batted at number seven for England. However, this did not develop as much as expected and he reverted to being a lower-order batsman.|$|E
