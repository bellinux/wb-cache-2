40|$|Objective {{assessment}} of animal personality is typically time consuming, requiring the repeated measure of behavioural responses. By contrast, subjective {{assessment of}} personality allows {{information to be}} collected quickly by experienced caregivers. However, subjective assessment must predict behaviour to be valid. Comparisons of subjective assessments and behaviour have been made but often with methodological weaknesses and thus, limited success. Here we test the validity of a subjective assessment against a battery of <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> in 146 horses (Equus caballus). Our first aim was to determine if subjective personality assessment could predict <b>behaviour</b> during <b>behaviour</b> <b>testing.</b> We made specific a priori predictions for how subjectively measured personality should relate to <b>behaviour</b> <b>testing.</b> We found that Extroversion predicted time to complete a handling <b>test</b> and refusal <b>behaviour</b> during this <b>test.</b> It also predicted minimum distance to a novel object. Neuroticism predicted how reactive an individual was to a sudden visual stimulus but not how quickly it recovered from this. Agreeableness did not predict any <b>behaviour</b> during <b>testing.</b> There were several unpredicted correlations between subjective measures and <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> which we explore further. Our second aim was to combine data from the subjective assessment and <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> to gain a more comprehensive understanding of personality. We found that the combination of methods provides new insights into horse behaviour. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the idea of horses showing different coping styles, a novel finding for this species. Â© 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

The neuropsychological examination of patients with FTD poses a methodological problem. In many patients {{it is impossible to}} administer a complete test battery, due to behavioural disturbances inherent to the disease. This study describes the <b>test</b> <b>behaviour</b> of patients with FTD, the number of missing values due to disturbed <b>test</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and its influence on neuropsychological test results.  METHODS—Thirty one patients with probable FTD were administered a neuropsychological test battery including measures of memory, intelligence, and executive functioning. Moreover, patients were rated on a global deterioration scale and a <b>test</b> <b>behaviour</b> scale, constructed for this study.  RESULTS—The more disturbing the <b>test</b> <b>behaviour,</b> the less <b>tests</b> were assessable, leading to many missing values. The most disturbing features were "positive symptoms" of FTD, such as perseveration and stimulus boundedness. The effect of <b>test</b> <b>behaviour</b> was largest for tests measuring executive functions and reasoning capabilities. The replacement of the missing values due to behavioural disturbances by the lowest score also showed the largest effect on tests of executive function and reasoning abilities.  CONCLUSION—Data imputation of missing values due to <b>test</b> <b>behaviour</b> disturbances provides a more differentiated picture of cognitive deficits in FTD. ...|$|R

40|$|Assistance Hearing Dogs provide {{independence}} {{to people with}} a hearing impairment by alerting to household and danger sounds, and provide companionship {{in a range of}} public places. Hearing Dogs experience thorough socialising and training in order to meet high Assistance Dog standards. Present procedures in use by Hearing Dogs For Deaf People, UK involve an 8 months behavioural test, with the aim to predict each dogs’ future training performance. Knowing the predictive validity of this test, with respect to task performance is of great importance. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive validity of 8 month <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> already in use by the UK charity, Hearing Dogs for Deaf People, for performance at 18 months were evaluated on 62 dogs over a two year period. Correlations between the two tests and significant differences in performance were assessed using Spearman’s Rho and Wilcoxon matched pairs tests. The following 13 behavioural factors were analysed: social behaviour with adults, children and dogs, environmental behaviour, recovery rate, adaptability, vocal reactivity, motivation, trainability, frustration, chase, hunt and distraction. Convergent validity of both the 8 and 18 month <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> was further examined where possible using a CBARQ questionnaire completed at 8 and 18 months by the socialisers and trainers of 12 of the dogs. Positive correlations were observed between all behavioural factors with the exception of distractibility and recovery rate, however overall the behavioural tests demonstrated a high sensitivity and a low specificity, signifying a poor predictive validity with respect to task performance. While these results partly reflect the small number of failures in each test, the findings may also be symptomatic of the continued socialising and training that all dogs, irrelevant of pass rates, undergo between the 8 and 18 month <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests.</b> The value of the 8 month test and its individual elements is critically appraised...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how cognitive determinants and emotional determinants, in particular fears and worries, relate to STI <b>testing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A {{survey was conducted}} online among 906 participants aged 16 to 26 years who completed a digital questionnaire about sexuality, sexual health, STI <b>testing</b> <b>behaviours</b> and cognitive and emotional factors potentially influencing <b>testing</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The cognitive factors were specified by an extended health belief model (HBM) and encompassed perceived risk and severity of STIs, perceived {{pros and cons of}} STI testing, and perceived behavioural control over STI <b>testing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Emotional factors referred to fears and worries about STIs and STI testing. All cognitive variables of the extended HBM, as well as fears and worries, were found to be univariately associated with STI <b>testing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In multivariate analysis, perceived behavioural control was found to add to HBM variables. As predicted the relation between fears and worries and STI testing was mediated by cognitive variables, but only the combination of extended HBM variables reduced the association between fears and worries and STI <b>testing</b> <b>behaviour</b> to non-significance; individual cognitive variables did not significantly mediate this association. Results {{of this study suggest that}} emotions influence cognitions in explaining STI <b>testing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Fears and worries affect threat perception as well as evaluation of the behaviour, suggesting that threat appraisal and coping appraisal are intricately related and may not work in parallel as suggested by classic social cognitive models.

40|$|Laboratory {{measures}} of personality traits {{are often used}} to answer both evolutionary and ecological questions involving behavioural variations in the wild within and between populations. However, {{little is known about}} the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different context.

The new test arena contained eight large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration. We found that our new exploration <b>test</b> captured repeatable <b>behaviour</b> in activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or activity.

The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) is the wild progenitor of all domestic chicken breeds and earlier studies present clear morphological, physiological and behavioural differences between domesticated breeds and the non-domesticated red junglefowl. These changes {{may be the}} result of altered gene expression - pleiotropy or linked genes. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate (1) effects of tameness selection on social behaviour towards conspecifics and (2) social behaviour differences between the sexes. Two generations of red junglefowl, P 0 and its offspring F 1, were studied. Both generations were divided into three selection lines (tame, intermediate or fearful), depending on their results in a fear of humans test.  A novel type of social reinstatement test was set up, containing a non-social area without stimulus, and a social area containing a mirror serving as stimulus animals. The social and aggressive behaviours performed towards the mirror were recorded, so was the time spent in the social versus non-social part. An undisturbed <b>behaviour</b> <b>test</b> was performed, as well as a standardized social reinstatement test. The P 0 -females performed significantly more social behaviour (p= 0. 008) at 26 weeks than males in the mirror test, and females also displayed significantly more social (p= 0. 04) and agonistic behaviour (p< 0. 001) than males in the undisturbed <b>behaviour</b> <b>test.</b> The social reinstatement test displayed a significant effect between the selection lines with regards to sociality.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} applications for horse personality assessment, but first {{a reliable and}} valid form of assessment must be developed. The primary aim of this thesis {{was to develop a}} horse personality assessment method and test it for both reliability and validity by relating personality assessments to real-world observations. A 3 D-item rating questionnaire was developed and was named the Horse Personality Questionnaire (HPQ). This was used to assess 61 horses, each by three raters. 71. 2 % of horses and 25 of the items were rated consistently between raters. Principal component analysis (peA) on these data extracted six components that were thought to describe horse personality; Antagonism, Anxiousness, Activity, Protection, Sociability and Inquisitiveness. Personality component scores were found to correlate with horse behaviours recorded in the field, thus demonstrating {{the reliability and validity of}} the HPQ. The HPQ was also used to explore breed differences in horse personality, with 1223 horses from eight different breeds assessed. The results provided strong evide.,nce that horse breeds differ in personality, but those breeds with linked pedigrees or functions were shown to be more alike. These results suggested that personality in horses could be, to some extent, heritable and that humans have selected for different personality types. During the third study predictions of personality <b>behaviour</b> correlations were <b>tested</b> by first assessing 14 horses and then exposing each horse to three <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> (learning, arena and turn-out tests). Of 25 predicted behaviours none were found to be significant. These results did not support previous indications that personality scores could be used to predict behaviour. It was concluded that the <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> used and the predictions made may not have been suitable. The three experiments are discussed in terms of their implications for personality research and the potential applications of the HPQ in the equine industry.

The Dutch Socially Acceptable Behaviour (SAB) -test has been used since 2001 to select against unwanted aggression and fear in specific dog breeds, though much is unknown yet regarding its reliability, validity and feasibility. In this paper the SAB-test is evaluated and the results describe its usefulness for identifying aggression towards humans in dogs. <b>Behaviour</b> <b>test</b> outcomes on 345 dogs (479 records on tests performed indoor and outdoor) scored by the judges of the Dutch Kennel Club were compared to owner reported assessments of their dogs’ <b>behaviour</b> prior to <b>testing.</b> Dogs were labelled aggressive when having bitten a human at least once according to the owner and were diagnosed by the judges as such when attacking at least once during the SAB-test. Aggressive dogs showed significantly more attacks than non-aggressive controls and a Principal Components Analysis of detailed observations on 76 dogs grouped aggressive behaviours like growl, bare teeth, snap, lunge and bite in one dimension, confirming the test's validity. Analysis of 479 test records revealed a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0. 33, 0. 81 and 0. 64, respectively. The specificity could be increased to 0. 93 by raising the threshold for positive test results to at least 2 attacks during the test. The low sensitivity is explained by the decision to classify dogs as aggressive {{on the basis of}} one bite incident only and by a relative weak capacity of the test to detect specific forms of aggression. The reliability of the test was investigated by comparing test outcomes on 133 dogs when tested indoor and outdoor. The accuracy decreased from 0. 67 to 0. 62, but overall the indoor test outcomes were similar to those found outdoors. Scores for aggression and anxiety were significantly higher when dogs were tested {{for the first time in}} the morning than the second time in the afternoon, suggesting desensitization. Salivary cortisol concentrations in 20 dogs were not different in samples taken before and after the test, which oppose severe levels of stress. The SAB-test allows one to evaluate aggression in dogs, but present findings indicate that probably those that behave aggressively in the absence of fear remain undetected. It is recommended to increase the test's usefulness by refining or including new test components that target different forms of aggression. Formulating a risk assessment based on detailed information on a dog's <b>behaviour</b> during <b>testing</b> instead of simply producing a pass–fail judgement will facilitate a purpose specific use of the SAB-test...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of laboratory animal science, increasing {{attention has been given}} to the possible influence of housing and husbandry on the behaviour and welfare of laboratory animals {{as well as on the}} scientific integrity. With the present paper, we aim to contribute to this knowledge by reviewing existing literature on how social factors influence laboratory rodents and non-human primates. We use social ecology in the wild as a starting point to understand experimental studies of these social species. Laboratory studies show that preweaning social experiences, and lack thereof, affect {{the development}} of social skills and capacity to cope with stressful situations in both primates and rodents. Studies of deprivation, of preference and of demand indicate that both rodents and primates are highly motivated to interact with conspecifics. When housed alone, rodents and primates typically show a more ‘anxious’ reaction in <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests,</b> and are more profoundly affected by certain stressors, although there seem to be some differences in how rodent males and females react to different social situations. However, for social housing to be beneficial for the animals, compatible and stable groups are crucial. When forming groups of monkeys in captivity, the age and sex of individuals and their relative age difference, the taxonomic membership of the animals as well as the introductory technique are factors of importance for success. Kinship is also of importance for the compatibility of both rodent and primate groups. Social instability through changes of group composition is apparently stressful, resulting in behavioural and physiological alterations in both rodents and primates. The effects of social conditions around testing have been given much less attention, but several studies show that animals react differently in <b>behaviour</b> <b>tests</b> when tested in group than when tested individually. Altogether, the most commonly used laboratory rodents and primates belong to social species, and their behaviour and welfare are strongly affected by previous and present social environment. Factors such as group composition and stability, rank and previous social experience therefore need to be taken into account both when designing housing systems and when planning experiments and interpreting results...|$|R
