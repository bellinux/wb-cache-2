40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relevance}} of knee-specific subjective measures of outcome to patients {{has not been}} evaluated for cartilage repair procedures. PURPOSE: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify which instrument out of the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> Subjective Knee Form measures symptoms and disabilities most important to postoperative articular cartilage repair patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data were collected from 58 participants of an Internet knee forum via a self-reported online questionnaire consisting of demographic and surgical data, the Tegner activity scale, and 49 consolidated items from the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> Subjective Knee Form. Item importance, frequency, and frequency-importance product were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, the International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> Subjective Knee Form was the highest scoring instrument in all categories. However, 2 of the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales ("function in sport and recreation" and "knee-related quality of life") scored higher on mean importance and frequency-importance product than the overall International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> Subjective Knee Form score. CONCLUSION: The International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> Subjective Knee Form provided the best overall measure of symptoms and disabilities that are most important to this population of postoperative articular cartilage repair patients. This brings into question the validity of using the Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score in shorter-term [...] less than 10 years [...] studies. Issues related to sports activity appear to be highly valued and very pertinent to evaluation of outcomes for this patient group...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complex {{cartilage}} lesions of {{the knee}} including large cartilage defects, kissing lesions, and osteoarthritis (OA) represent a common problem in orthopaedic surgery and a challenging task for the orthopaedic surgeon. As there is only limited data, we performed a prospective clinical study to investigate the benefit of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for this demanding patient population. METHODS: Fifty-one patients displaying {{at least one of}} the criteria were included in the present retrospective study: (1.) defect size larger than 10 cm 2; (2.) multiple lesions; (3.) kissing lesions, cartilage lesions Outerbridge grade III-IV, and/or (4.) mild/moderate osteoarthritis (OA). For outcome measurements, the International Cartilage Society's International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee's</b> (IKDC) questionnaire, as well as the Cincinnati, Tegner, Lysholm and Noyes scores were used. Radiographic evaluation for OA was done using the Kellgren score. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patient's age was 36 years (13 - 61), defects size 7. 25 (3 - 17. 5) cm 2, previous surgical procedures 1. 94 (0 - 8), and follow-up 30 (12 - 63) months. Instruments for outcome measurement indicated significant improvement in activity, working ability, and sports. Mean ICRS grade improved from 3. 8 preoperatively to grade 3 postoperatively, Tegner grade 1. 4 enhanced to grade 3. 39. The Cincinnati score enhanced from 25. 65 to 66. 33, the Lysholm score from 33. 26 to 64. 68, the Larson score from 43. 59 to 79. 31, and Noyes score from 12. 5 to 46. 67, representing an improvement from Cincinnati grade 3. 65 to grade 2. 1. Lysholm grade 4 improved to grade 3. 33, and Larson grade 3. 96 to 2. 78 (Table 1), (p < 0. 001). Patients with kissing cartilage lesions had similar results as patients with single cartilage lesions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ACI provides mid-term results in patients with complex cartilage lesions {{of the knee}}. If long term results will confirm our findings, ACI may be a considered as a valuable tool for the treatment of complex cartilage lesions of the knee...|$|R

40|$|Background: Various {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} to treat articular cartilage lesions, which are plagued by inherent limited healing potential. Purpose: To compare the clinical outcome of patients treated with second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation implants with those treated with the microfracture repair technique at 5 -year follow-up. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Eighty active patients (mean age, 29. 8 years) and grade III to IV cartilage lesions of the femoral condyles or trochlea were treated with arthroscopic second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation Hyalograft C or microfracture (40 patients per group). Patients achieved a minimum 5 -year follow-up and were prospectively evaluated. Results: Both groups showed statistically significant improvement of all clinical scores from preoperative interval to 5 -year follow-up.

The assessment was performed using the International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> form and serial cruciometer readings. Poor outcomes were reported in group 1 for the mean subjective International Knee <b>Documentation</b> <b>Committee</b> score (p < 0. 001), the frequency (p = 0. 005) and intensity (p = 0. 005) of pain, a side-to-side difference in knee laxity (p = 0. 001) {{and the use of}} a four-strand hamstring graft (p = 0. 015).

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study examined the}} degree to which a school principal, faculty, and community achieved shared decision making. Through faculty interviews, observations of meetings, and review of the school's <b>documentation</b> of <b>committee</b> structures, the study investigated strengths and weaknesses in the decision-making process. First, participants defined shared decision making. Next, formal and informal structures which were in place to gather teacher input were examined. Participants noted the kinds of decisions that teachers wanted to make and those that they wanted administrators to make. Changes in the decision-making process over time were a focus of inquiry. The study examined how well the current decision-making process was working. Finally, administrators and staff members discussed how to improve the decision-making process. The school did not share a common definition of shared decision making. The way shared decision making was defined by all stakeholders impacted the perception of how well processes were working. Results showed that there is a need to understand the levels of decision making, as well as which decisions will be shared and which ones will not. In this case, the teachers did not want to spend time meeting if they felt that their input was not going to be used. (Contains 24 references.)

40|$|Recommendations and Guiding Principles as necessary. Section III of the 1999 report, {{entitled}} “Improving Market Practices and Conventions, ” {{focused on}} three broad areas: improvements in documentation policies and practices, {{with a special}} emphasis on timelines; improvements in documentation content, with special attention to close-out and valuation issues and the basis risk arising from inconsistencies in standard forms of industry documentation; and improvements in collateral management practices. The recommendations shared two common goals: to improve a creditor’s {{ability to deal with}} failing counterparties in a timely manner, and to enhance the market’s ability to contain the risks of failures of large, leveraged participants. The 1999 report led to the establishment of the Global <b>Documentation</b> Steering <b>Committee,</b> whose mission is to implement the documentation-related recommendations contained in Section III. In particular, the GDSC’s objective is to carry out the CRMPG’s 1999 mandate by minimizing ”documentation basis risk ” — the risk that market, credit and legal risk will be exacerbated by disparities in documentation — in the over-thecounter markets. Much progress has been made since 1999, but much remains to be done. First, a suite of robust, contractual tools to reduce documentation basis risk has been developed. These tools include recommendations made by the GDSC as part of its documentation harmonization efforts, the development of the Bond Market Association’s Cross-product Master Agreements and the publication of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement and the 2001 ISDA Bridge Agreement.
