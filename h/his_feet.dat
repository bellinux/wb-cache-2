5|$|His bat {{touches the}} turf {{in line with}} the off-stump, but <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> are well clear of the leg stump. He grips the bat near the tip of the handle, and it gives an {{impression}} that the bat is inordinately long.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|The stupid elephant, {{not being}} able to make very much sense of this remark, essayed, after the manner of persons worsted at repartee, to set <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> upon <b>his</b> clever conqueror.

He prays in an atmosphere of complete silence; when he steps back, <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> whole and fully functional, the church is filled with shouts of praise for the saint who has performed this miracle.|$|R

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes.

5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E
