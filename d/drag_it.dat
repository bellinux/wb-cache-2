5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E

25|$|If such {{experiments}} are conducted in moving media (e.g. water, or glass optical fiber), {{it is also}} necessary to consider Fresnel's dragging coefficient {{as demonstrated by the}} Fizeau experiment.

25|$|The main predators {{of fishing}} spiders are birds and snakes. Dragonflies {{have also been}} {{observed}} catching young spiders. Species parasitic on the spiders include a wasp of the Pompilidae family that stings the spider to paralyse it before carrying it off and laying an egg in its abdomen. The larvae of the wasp hatch and proceed to eat the spider from the inside out. One escape technique the spiders use is to disappear beneath the surface tension of the water. However, some wasps counter the disappearing trick by going into the water to sting the spider and <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> out of the water.|$|E
25|$|HMS Penn, with Dales still aboard, was one {{of several}} British destroyers that came {{alongside}} the Ohio to render assistance. The crews made attempts to tow the crippled tanker, before eventually sandwiching it between HMS Penn and HMS Bramham in order to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> along while preventing it from sinking. Seeing that one of the Ohios anti-aircraft guns could be repaired, another survivor from the Santa Elisa, junior third officer Frederick August Larsen, boarded the ship. Dales and four British crewmen volunteered to go with him. Between them, they were successful in bringing the gun back into action.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{began the}} fifth day looking to knock over England's last wicket quickly, and set a modest chase, but Dilley and Emburey were {{determined}} to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> out as long as possible. They remained for close to two hours, add 37 to England's overnight score, but finally succumbed when Hughes bowled a short pitched delivery to Dilley, who could only fend {{the ball into the}} waiting hands of David Boon. He was out for 24, and Emburey had made an excellent 36 not out, England finishing on 359 all out. Whilst it was England's best score of the series so far, it still only left Australia with a target of 117 to win.|$|E
25|$|Retail {{engravers}} mainly use {{two different}} processes. The {{first and most}} common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through {{the surface of the}} material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond <b>drag.</b> <b>It</b> is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} antenna for Orange Harvest was {{the distinctive}} white dielectric 'spark plug' {{carried on the}} upper surface of the Shackleton. This 'spark plug' has often been mis-identified as an insulator for a HF long-wire antenna running to the aircraft's tail. It is actually self-contained, and at a wavelength far shorter than would use long wires. The Shackleton did carry HF antennae, but these were supported by two small metal masts, just ahead of Orange Harvest. The structural fitment for Orange Harvest was a metal plinth built into the fuselage, at approximately the previous dorsal turret position. The large antenna was fastened to this. As the antenna causes significant <b>drag,</b> <b>it</b> was sometimes removed and only the plinth was evident. This was {{more common in the}} 1960s ASW era, rather than the later AEW period.|$|E

25|$|A vector e on a globe on {{the equator}} at point Q is {{directed}} to the north. Suppose we parallel transport the vector first along the equator until at point P and then (keeping it parallel to itself) <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> along a meridian to the pole N and (keeping the direction there) subsequently transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then we notice that the parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and {{is caused by the}} curvature of the surface of the globe. The same effect can be noticed if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. The infinitesimal change of the vector {{is a measure of the}} curvature.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the circles}} are of fairly modest {{dimensions}} and Burl has theorised {{that they could}} have been constructed by a single family. Transporting the massive recumbents was a different matter, however; the fifty-ton recumbent at Old Keig was transported from six miles away and may have needed up to 200 people to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> to its final resting place. The circle at Strichen provided a unique opportunity to test how the recumbents might have been transported. It was incorrectly restored in the 19th century by Lord Lovat, so between 1979–83 it was fully excavated and correctly restored by a team led by Burl, Ian Hampsher-Monk and Philip Abramson. The restoration required the team to move some of the stones, and {{it was found that the}} most efficient non-mechanical means of doing so was to use drag the stones along a slippery path of wet straw using logs as a kind of sledge.|$|E
25|$|Ore {{was brought}} to the surface up a winding shaft outside the coe. The miners' {{equipment}} included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or stows, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|E

As the station constantly lost altitude because of a slight atmospheric <b>drag,</b> <b>it</b> needed to be boosted to a higher altitude several times each year. This boost was generally performed by Progress resupply vessels, although during the Shuttle-Mir programme the task was performed by US Space Shuttles, and, prior {{to the arrival of}} Kvant-1, the engines on the core module could also accomplish the task.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "The Back of Love" [...] on 21 May 1982, the band spent the summer, first playing at the inaugural WOMAD festival, and then playing at various European music festivals. After the summer the band resumed {{recording}} the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales– which had been used for the band's first two albums– and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool. Recording the album was a slow process, de Freitas said, [...] "Porcupine {{was very hard to}} actually write and record [...] Heaven Up Here was pure confidence, we did it really quickly; {{we had a great time}} doing it– but this one was like we had to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> out of ourselves."

500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News, bassist Guy Berryman revealed that the song {{was one of the}} older songs that the band had been working on and that they had to move it to one side from the list of songs that were going to appear in the album. Phil Harvey, the band's manager, urged them to include the track in the album, which led to the band to <b>drag</b> <b>it</b> back to the shortlist. The first verse of the song was taken from an unreleased song named [...] "December", written by frontman Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland in 1997. An early instrumental of the song from the Viva la Vida sessions was leaked into the internet in 2009, it contained an excerp from a previously performed song named [...] "Solid Ground (Until the Water Floats Over)" [...] as the intro, but it was scratched and the song remained unreleased.|$|E
500|$|There were {{difficulties}} {{getting this}} episode {{up to the}} minimum length of an episode and many scenes were added in post-production.

Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row.
