5|$|Having {{realised}} the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax, stipulating that {{the sum of}} all taxes payable per porta could not exceed one florin. The Estates also made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim.|$|E

50|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{the most}} recent {{development}} (1990s-present). Although <b>it's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are less toxic than their predecessors, barbiturates, comparative efficacy over benzodiazepines have not been established. Without longitudinal studies, {{it is hard to}} determine; however some psychiatrists recommend these drugs, citing research suggesting they are equally potent with less potential for abuse.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these, Romans also spent {{their share of}} time in bars and brothels, and graffiti carved into the walls of these buildings was common.

25|$|Due {{to legal}} issues with Universal Pictures, the events from Army of Darkness could not {{specifically}} be {{mentioned in the}} first season. In April 2015, the producers made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted to resolve the issue, and in mid-2016, producer Robert Tabert stated that the rights issue had been solved and that references to Army of Darkness would appear from season two onward.|$|E
25|$|The Barnstormers {{are heavily}} {{covered in the}} Lancaster press and receive a {{significant}} following from Lancaster-area fans, many of whom hail the organization as family-friendly in their planning of events for game nights.

TVS' aims were for a different line of programming in the early evening slots, to win back the 50,000 viewers they claimed were switching over to rivals, due to the poor service provided by Southern.|$|E
25|$|In late February 2006, IAEA Director Mohammad El-Baradei {{raised the}} {{suggestion}} of a deal, whereby Iran would give up industrial-scale enrichment and instead limit its program to a small-scale pilot facility, and agree to import its nuclear fuel from Russia (see nuclear fuel bank). The Iranians indicated that while they would not be willing to give up their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider the compromise solution. However, in March 2006, the Bush Administration made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran.|$|E

Her parents welcome her, although they make <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wish she would establish an independent life of her own.|$|E
25|$|A movie by Lizzie Borden, Working Girls {{affected}} how {{the society}} perceives women in different fields and positions, it also features feminism and topics on capitalism. Working Girls {{is an independent}} production published in 1986 about the daily life of upper class prostitutes in a small Manhattan bordello. The main characters in the story have backgrounds such as graduates from Yale university and Law; the movie makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not forced into the field but chose it themselves. Throughout the film, power dressing was promoted along with the capability of women taking {{control of their own}} future.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Christopher {{discovered}} that a Calgary-based oil company, Talisman Energy, {{had been accused of}} complicity in the rape, bombing, kidnapping, enslavement, and execution of local people while operating in South Sudan. Talisman executives made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were uncomfortable with Christopher investigating the story, and sent a letter to CHED threatening to sue the company for libel if the story was ever reported. After Christopher filed the story the station refused to report it. Christopher attempted to have the story carried by other local media companies, including Global TV and The Edmonton Journal; they refused to run the story.|$|E

25|$|On 15 September 1917, {{shortly after}} promulgating the 1917 code, Benedict XV promulgated the motu proprio Cum Iuris Canonici, which forbade the Roman Congregations from issuing new general decrees {{unless it was}} {{necessary}} to do so, and then only after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and to make <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were elucidating particular canons of the code. This was done so as not to make the code obsolete soon after it was promulgated. The 1917 Code was very rarely amended, and then only slightly.|$|E
25|$|A further {{element of}} this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press {{agencies}} revealed that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia {{to participate in the}} project. JAXA has made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are more likely to join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005. The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.|$|E
25|$|The two {{metropolitan}} county councils {{were subject to}} the legal requirement to make their precept by 10 March. They were also facing their own abolition {{at the end of}} March 1986. Faced with the prospect of immediate legal sanctions if they failed to do set a budget and with no continuing existence, neither were inclined to press their objections to rate-capping. At a meeting of capped councils on 19 February, both made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would set a legal precept on time. South Yorkshire County Council then made it clear publicly that it would fix a budget within the cap, and proceeded to do so at a budget meeting on 7 March.|$|E

The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895. Florence kicked off the meeting by mounting the wagon which was being used as a stage. Her introduction made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.|$|E
25|$|During the lead-up to the 1999–2000 season, the {{selectors}} made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted Adam Gilchrist to {{keep for}} the Test team {{as well as}} the ODI side. Initially, Healy requested that he be allowed to play one more season and then retire, which was refused. He then asked to play the first Test, scheduled for his home ground at Brisbane, as a farewell. This, too, was refused, so he announced his immediate retirement from all forms of the game in a statement released on 28 October 1999. In response to the tremendous public farewells afforded to Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer {{at the end of the}} fifth Test at Sydney in 2006–07, Healy called for long-standing players to have their farewells to the game managed more appropriately than his own.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, Terry Jones {{announced}} {{she would be}} retiring from Point of Grace.
