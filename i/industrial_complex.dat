5|$|Curtiss-Wright left in 1960, {{after which}} a {{succession}} of tenants further contaminated the nuclear reactor facility and its hot cells with radioactive isotopes, including strontium-90 and cobalt-60. The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and <b>industrial</b> <b>complex.</b> The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison. Quehanna Wild Area has many sites where radioactive and toxic waste was buried, {{some of which have}} been cleaned up while others were dug up by black bears and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, a German {{engineer}} {{found that}} the area had suitable clay for the making of faience, and two years later, founded the Mezhyhirya Faience Factory, {{the first one in}} Ukraine, {{at the site of the}} unused monastery. By 1852, the faience factory had become the largest <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> in Kiev. During its existence, the factory produced a variety of crockery and ornamental vases and figurines. In 1884, the faience factory was closed down after it failed to bring any profit.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the game, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> {{may or may}} not be built: Europe and 1941 do {{not allow}} new ones to be built, while Pacific only {{permitted}} the American player to build new <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes,</b> while an optional rule in Classic limited the ability to build <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> to the Axis powers. <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> in Classic and the Nova Games edition may be deployed in any territory held by the player at the start of their turn, while later games restricted placement of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> to territories with certain income values. Once built, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> are not destroyed; they are simply captured.|$|R
50|$|The primary airport {{used for}} the {{transportation}} of passengers and goods is Meadows Field in Bakersfield. Several <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> are located around the airport for easy transportation of goods from warehouses to airplanes. More <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> are planned in the future.|$|R
50|$|In Pacific 1940, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> {{were split}} into minor and major complexes: minor ones limited {{deployment}} to three units per turn, while major ones limited deployment to ten units per turn. Minor complexes may be upgraded to major ones (though {{the total cost}} is slightly more than if major <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> were directly purchased), but major complexes have greater restrictions on their placement (including by upgrading). Furthermore, <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complexes</b> may not be built on island territories in this game.|$|R
5|$|In 1947, an {{explosion}} {{on a ship}} at the Port of Texas City caused fires and destruction throughout the city's <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents. The tragedy caused more than five hundred deaths, more than four thousand injuries, and more than $50 million in damage ($ million in today's dollars). Though the city's growth and prosperity were interrupted, {{the city and the}} business leaders were able to rebuild.|$|E
5|$|In Rochester, NY104 {{passes through}} an {{area known as}} Kodak Park, the large <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> owned by Eastman Kodak that {{occupies}} an entire neighborhood. In {{the middle of the}} complex, NY104 crosses the Rochester and Southern Railroad and the CSX Transportation-owned Charlotte Running Track and intersects the eastern terminus of NY18. Continuing east, NY104 crosses the Genesee River gorge on the Veterans Memorial Bridge. On the opposite bank, it loses the name West Ridge Road and becomes a limited-access highway known as the Keeler Street Expressway.|$|E
5|$|The Young Adult Conservation Corps {{was also}} based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program {{employed}} up to 45young people for local conservation {{projects in the}} state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began a heavy equipment training school at Piper, which is still in operation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> are {{considered}} as {{a major source of}} hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) which include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals, etc. Therefore, the comprehensive monitoring and management of HAPs in the <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> are required. In this study, the basic information of the <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> (e. g., location, area, emission of air pollutants, meteorological conditions, and population) was used as input data for a geographic information system (GIS) software. On the basis of these GIS data, we proposed a systematic method for determining priority <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> for the monitoring of HAPs. We identified 28 priority <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> and classified them into four groups from level 1, whose HAPs should be continuously monitored, to level 4, whose HAPs {{do not have to be}} monitored. Furthermore, the case study of Ulsan was presented to demonstrate the selection procedure for sampling sites. The results of this study can be practically used to establish a long-term plan of the monitoring and management of HAPs. clos...|$|R

25|$|There are {{hundreds}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> in Tabriz's <b>industrial</b> area. Among them is the Iran Tractor Manufacturing Co (ITMCO) {{which is one of}} the biggest <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> in the region. This complex alone has the highest foundry and forging capacity in the Middle East and it is the biggest tractor manufacturer in Iran with several production branches within Iran and other countries. Behind ITMCO there are several other <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> including Mashin Sazi Tabriz Co, Iran Diesel Engine Manufacturing Co (IDEM), Pump Iran, Tabriz Petrochemical Complex, Tabriz Oil Refinery and a couple of industrial regions which include hundreds of small industries.|$|R
5|$|The storyline {{concerns}} Quatermass's {{investigation of}} reports {{of hundreds of}} meteorites landing only in the Winnerden Flats area of the UK. His inquiries lead him to a huge <b>industrial</b> <b>complex,</b> strikingly similar to his own plans for a moon colony. This top-secret facility {{is in fact the}} centre of a conspiracy involving the alien infiltration of the highest echelons of the British Government. Quatermass and his allies must now do whatever is necessary to defeat the alien threat before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military <b>industrial</b> <b>complex.</b> Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{attends a}} lecture at MIT, where the {{testimony}} of Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee, is being presented. Mulder argues against {{other members of the}} lecture over the existence of alien life, claiming that it is a lie created to cover up a program of medical experimentation on civilians run by the military <b>industrial</b> <b>complex.</b> When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E

50|$|Strategic {{bombing was}} altered over the years. Until the revised edition, {{strategic}} bombing caused opposing players {{to lose the}} IPCs they had on hand. The 50th anniversary edition changed this so that <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> were damaged instead. Damaged <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> had less capacity to produce units and can be repaired {{at the cost of}} IPCs.|$|R
50|$|In Copșa Mică {{during the}} {{communist}} period {{there were two}} chemical <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> which polluted the environment heavily with carbon black, heavy metals, and other chemical substances. That's why the area is still {{considered one of the}} most polluted communities in Europe. Fortunately, after 1989 many of the <b>industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> were shut down and the area is slowly recovering.|$|R
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> and what he saw as a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|In Washtenaw County, US12 {{passes through}} Benton {{in a rural}} {{southern}} section of the county. At Saline, the highway enters the suburban edge of the Ann Arbor–Ypsilanti metro area. US12 follows Michigan Avenue northeasterly through Saline and across an interchange with US23 before intersecting I-94 in Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships. US12 leaves Michigan Avenue to follow I-94 at that freeway's exit181; Michigan Avenue continues into downtown Ypsilanti as a city street. I-94/US12 skirts around {{the south side of}} the city and intersects the western end of Business US12 (Bus. US12) at Huron Street south of downtown. The freeway continues around {{the south side of the}} city and rounds the north end of Ford Lake. It is bounded by residential neighborhoods, and it crosses the Huron River on the eastern side of Ypsilanti. Near the Willow Run <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> and airport, US12 separates from I-94 and turns northeasterly along an expressway on the north side of the airport. There are three interchanges, including one for the eastern end of M-17 before US12 crosses into Wayne County and intersects the eastern end of Bus. US12.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943. This was the {{beginning}} of a new war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich’s <b>industrial</b> <b>complex.</b> Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection. He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit the first line of defense against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.|$|E
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island. The highway {{continues}} over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue {{on the eastern}} bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing {{to the east of}} an <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, a one-way street, M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Running {{south along}} the Windlass Freeway, {{parallel}} to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice. The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) and MD 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near the Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with MD 151 (North Point Boulevard). From here, the route continues southeast along the Back River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road. The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the Maryland Transportation Authority at the crossing of a CSX rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) before heading west. The route runs past the Sparrows Point <b>Industrial</b> <b>Complex</b> before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned MD 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance.|$|E

5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an <b>industrial</b> <b>complex</b> on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility.|$|E
5|$|The film reignited {{the debate}} over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of {{creating}} a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of U.S. foreign policy, the military <b>industrial</b> <b>complex,</b> and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.|$|E
