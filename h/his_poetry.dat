5|$|His mysticism is {{informed}} by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in his study of Silesius that <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E
5|$|Poet and {{translator}} Peter McMillan {{says the}} large number of Narihira's poems included in the Kokinshū and later court anthologies is an indicator of the high regard in which <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> was held.|$|E

5|$|Pope, mortified by the {{elevation}} of Cibber to laureateship and incredulous at what he held to be the vainglory of his Apology (1740), attacked Cibber extensively in <b>his</b> <b>poetry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} Dafydd ap Gwilym, one of the {{greatest}} of Welsh poets, was born at Brogynin, Penrhyncoch (at the time in Llanbadarn Fawr parish, and now part of the grouped benefice), early in the fourteenth century, when the parish covered the whole of northern Ceredigion. Dafydd records a number of local place-names in <b>his</b> <b>poetry.</b> He is also known for his connection with Strata Florida, thanks to the story that he was buried there, and to the copying of <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> into Strata Florida manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in <b>his</b> <b>poetry,</b> Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
50|$|His first work Aravata was {{published}} in Sanskriti magazine. Swagat (1969) was <b>his</b> first <b>poetry</b> collection which included sonnets, metrical <b>poetry</b> and geet. <b>His</b> other <b>poetry</b> collections are Soorajno Hath (1983), Alakhna Asawar (1994) and Avajna X-Ray (2000).|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of Morris' death, <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> was known internationally and his company's {{products}} were found all over the world. In his lifetime, he was {{best known as a}} poet, although by the late twentieth-century he was primarily known as a designer of wallpapers and fabrics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats {{was a member of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the {{escalating}} tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding back <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> inspired by the events until 1920.|$|E

50|$|Abdul Matin ‘Matin’ wrote poems on science, philosophy, {{religion}} and ethics.Most of <b>his</b> <b>poetries</b> and articles {{were published in}} ‘Paisa Akhbar’ (founded by Maulana Mahboob Alam).

5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{sticking}} to the formulas of , which remain popular in Japan even today, Bashō aspired to reflect his real environment and emotions in his hokku. Even during his lifetime, the effort and style of <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> was widely appreciated; after his death, it only increased. Several of his students compiled quotations from him about his own poetry, most notably Mukai Kyorai and Hattori Dohō.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came {{to believe}} that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the {{relationship}} between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish <b>his</b> <b>poetry,</b> naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. <b>His</b> <b>poetry</b> often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.|$|E

5|$|Sibelius admired Rydberg {{and often}} set <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> to music, {{including}} the melodrama Snöfrid, Op. 29, and the War Song of Tyrtaeus. The poem Skogsrået {{was first published}} in 1882, and in 1883 Sibelius's future friend, the artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela, illustrated it. In 1888 or 1889, about the time the two met, Sibelius first set Skogsrået for voice and piano. This setting is musically unrelated to Sibelius's 1894-95 treatment.|$|E
5|$|Victor Henry Anderson (May 21, 1917 – September 20, 2001) was an American Wiccan {{priest and}} poet. He was a {{founding}} member of the Feri Tradition, a form of the modern Pagan new religious movement of Wicca which was established in California during the 1960s. Much of <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> was religious in nature, being devoted to Feri deities.|$|E
5|$|Whitman's work {{breaks the}} {{boundaries}} of poetic form and is generally prose-like. He also used unusual images and symbols in <b>his</b> <b>poetry,</b> including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris. He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution. He is often labeled {{as the father of}} free verse, though he did not invent it.|$|E

5000|$|Ibn Ba'ith {{was also}} {{considerably}} Iranicized and {{the elders of}} Maragha praised his bravery and quoted <b>his</b> Persian <b>poetry.</b> [...] <b>His</b> Persian <b>poetry</b> also is an evidence {{of the existence of}} the cultivation of poetry in Persian in northwest Iran (Azerbaijan) {{at the beginning of the}} 9th century.|$|R

5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> was literally blasphemous.|$|E
5|$|From his time, Tulsidas {{has been}} {{acclaimed}} by Indian and Western scholars alike for <b>his</b> <b>poetry</b> and his {{impact on the}} Hindu society. Tulsidas mentions in his work Kavitavali that he was considered a great sage in the world. Madhusūdana Sarasvatī, {{one of the most}} acclaimed philosophers of the Advaita Vedanta tradition based in Varanasi and the composer of Advaitasiddhi, was a contemporary of Tulsidas. On reading the Ramcharitmanas, he was astonished and composed the following Sanskrit verse in praise of the epic and the composer.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>poetry,</b> Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E
50|$|Between 1924 and 1929, Mendes {{published}} his first poems in the Modernist magazines Antropofagia and Verde. <b>His</b> first <b>poetry</b> book, simply called Poemas, {{was published in}} 1930; it won the Graça Aranha Prize. <b>His</b> second <b>poetry</b> book, Bumba-Meu-Poeta, was released shortly afterwards, and in 1933, Mendes published História do Brasil.|$|R
