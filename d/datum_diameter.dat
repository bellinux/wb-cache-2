Values of roughness for different cutting parameters are presented and mathematical dependencies achieve after processing of experimental data have been obtain. Theoretical aspects Worm manufacturing using whirling thread cutting is an efficient process and better results gives the method with inner contact, that assures good conditions for cutting process, [1, 2]. The process utilises lathes and special design devices or special machine-tools {{that have a}} high cost. Because of this reason the utilisation of lathes and special devices frequently is meeting in industrial workshops, [3, 4, 5]. Experimental results The experimental researches {{have been done in}} T. C. M. Department of Iasi “Gh. Asachi” Technical University on a lathe SNA 560 x 1000, with a device made in the department. The rotate movement ns of the device’s knifes is given by the movement of electric motor and the transmission rate of pulley wheels that conduct movement at the device. The pulley diameter is Dpd= 216 mm and because is necessary different turning moments many pulley wheels was used with following diameters: Dp 1 = 188 mm; Dp 2 = 162 mm; Dp 3 = 133 mm; Dp 4 = 92 mm; Dp 5 = 57 mm. Turning movement of device principal axel were: ns 1 = 1241 rot/min; ns 2 = 1070 rot/min; ns 3 = 878 rot/min; ns 4 = 614 rot/min; ns 5 = 376 rot/min. The speed in tool's area that works for <b>datum</b> <b>diameter</b> is given by...|$|E
