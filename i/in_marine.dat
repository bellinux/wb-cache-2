5|$|Although it is {{not known}} with {{certainty}} how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float on the water surface for dispersal.

5|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} and emission of light by a living organism. It {{is a form of}} chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
5|$|Circulatory system: The osmotic {{pressure}} of the hemolymph of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95mOsm. That is much lower value than <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> snails in the subfamily Neritinae.

5|$|Countershading existed <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin {{reveals that}} both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
30|$|The Regional Seas Conventions and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive {{recommended}} that NORMAN should {{take an active}} role in the discussions about CECs <b>in</b> the <b>marine</b> compartment.

According to the stakeholder, NORMAN should also have a role in ensuring improvement of the ability of laboratories to achieve quantification limits (LOQs) in line with toxicologically relevant concentrations <b>in</b> the <b>marine</b> environment.|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>marine</b> and {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part}} of the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, sucking dead or living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx.

5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E

5|$|In the {{geologic}} record, the K–Pg {{event is}} marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K–Pg boundary, which can be found throughout the world <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> and terrestrial rocks.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|Like any organism, {{marine mammals}} are {{susceptible}} to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus.

5|$|River otters often {{reside in}} beaver ponds. Encounters between otters and beavers are not {{necessarily}} hostile. In Idaho, otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The otters may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|E
