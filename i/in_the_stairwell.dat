Notable cut scenes include Michael giving Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) his performance review, Dwight giving Jim advice for his performance review, an extension of Dwight psyching himself up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell,</b> Michael calling Jan's ex-husband and her reaction, and Michael describing the office with a confused metaphor involving organs of the body.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Chris takes {{a shotgun}} from his father-in-law's home and carries {{it to his}} office in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's {{building}} and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, who he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns he shoots her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell.</b> Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate <b>the</b> <b>stairwell.</b> <b>The</b> three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|R
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love of a poor girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell,</b> and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{standard}} gates, the stadium had solid corrugated steel shutters {{at the bottom}} of tunnels that connected the street level, via several flights of steps, to the seating areas above. These shutters were closed as they normally were at every game. Panicked spectators moving down the enclosed stairways pressed those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead against the closed shutters, but this was not visible to the crowd pushing down <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> from behind. <b>The</b> shutters finally burst outward as a result of pressure from the crush of bodies inside. All of those that died were killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> down to <b>the</b> street level, most from internal haemorrhaging or asphyxia. No one who stayed inside <b>the</b> stadium died. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> street, the crowd caused destruction on private property around the stadium.|$|R
40|$|AbstractResearchers at the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{collected}} occupant egress data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> {{of several}} high-rise buildings for potential use in {{quantitative and qualitative}} validation of evacuation simulation tools (Kuligowski and Peacock (2010)). We found this data suitable for establishing occupant initial locations, pre-evacuation time distributions, and other parametric inputs for our simulation code (PEDFLOW). With this data set, {{we were able to}} validate several core behavioral components of PEDFLOW by directly comparing actual versus predicted values for occupant speed on stairs and building total evacuation times.

25|$|An American sentry, Air Force Staff Sergeant Alfredo R. Guerrero, was {{stationed}} atop Building #131. He witnessed the men, recognised the vehicles as a threat, reported it to security, {{and began a}} floor by floor evacuation of the building. His actions are credited with saving dozens of lives. Many of the evacuees were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> when the bomb went off. The stairwell was constructed of heavy marble and was located {{on the side of}} the building away from the truck bomb, perhaps the safest location in the building. For his actions, Guerrero was awarded the Airman's Medal, the highest peacetime award for valour that the U.S. Air Force gives.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} the house was constructed, the heavy bronze doors which grace the foyer (and a similar pair which open from the library to the porte-cochere) cost $14,000. The {{original}} imported rug was designed to match the elaborately molded plaster ceiling. <b>The</b> fretwork panels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> serve as echo chambers for the four keyboard Kimball organ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music room. Slipcovers, which the owner never removed (this is also true for all draperies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mansion), hid the Italian velvet draperies. The massive bronze chandelier, which was designed in Europe, was made in three separate sections. The wall panels were handpainted in themes representative of mythology.|$|R
2500|$|Following the bombing, floors {{that were}} blown out {{needed to be}} {{repaired}} to restore the structural support they provided to columns. The slurry wall was <b>in</b> peril following <b>the</b> bombing and loss of the floor slabs that provided lateral support against pressure from Hudson River water on the other side. The refrigeration plant on sublevel B5, which provided air conditioning to the entire World Trade Center complex, was heavily damaged. After the bombing, the Port Authority installed photoluminescent markings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells.</b> <b>The</b> fire alarm system for the entire complex needed to be replaced because critical wiring and signaling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original system was destroyed. As a memorial {{to the victims of}} the bombing of the tower, a reflecting pool was installed with the names of those who had been killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blast.

25|$|Edward hires {{a private}} investigator, Frank Wilson (Dominic Chianese), to follow her. Frank returns with {{pictures}} of Connie and Paul together, which devastates Edward. Connie's visits with Paul become more frequent, {{to the point that}} she is late to pick up Charlie from school. Following this incident, she realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. Unsuccessfully trying to end the affair over the phone, Connie decides {{it would be best to}} do so in person. She spots Paul with another woman walking down the street as she approaches his neighborhood in her SUV. After following and then confronting Paul, their argument ends in a tryst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> of his apartment building. At the same time, Edward is standing outside Paul's apartment building, where Edward and Connie narrowly miss each other as she leaves out the backdoor. Edward goes to Paul's apartment and confronts him, revealing that he is Connie's husband. Edward asks to come into Paul's apartment, and after Paul lets him in, he gives Edward some vodka and they talk about Connie. Edward asks how Paul and Connie met, and while walking around the apartment, Edward is stunned to see a snow globe by the bed, which he recognizes as a gift he gave to Connie. Paul reveals that Connie gave it to him as a gift. Feeling sick and disoriented, Edward sits down on the bed and Paul asks if he would like some water. Edward suddenly has a mental breakdown and hits Paul with the snow globe, severely fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.|$|E
25|$|Set in {{the parish}} of St Giles—a notorious slum {{district}} that Hogarth depicted in several works around this time—Gin Lane depicts the squalor and despair of a community raised on gin. Desperation, death and decay pervade the scene. The only businesses that flourish serve the gin industry: gin sellers; a distiller (the aptly named Kilman); the pawnbroker where the avaricious Mr. Gripe greedily takes the vital possessions (the carpenter offers his saw and the housewife her cooking utensils) of the alcoholic residents of the street {{in return for a}} few pennies to feed their habit; and the undertaker, for whom Hogarth implies at least a handful of new customers from this scene alone. Most shockingly, the focus of the picture is a woman in the foreground, who, addled by gin and driven to prostitution by her habit—as evidenced by the syphilitic sores on her legs—lets her baby slip unheeded from her arms and plunge to its death <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> of the gin cellar below. Half-naked, she has no concern for anything other than a pinch of snuff. This mother was not such an exaggeration as she might appear: in 1734, Judith Dufour reclaimed her two-year-old child from the workhouse where it had been given a new set of clothes; she then strangled it and left the infant's body in a ditch so that she could sell the clothes (for 1s. 4d.) to buy gin. In another case, an elderly woman, Mary Estwick, let a toddler burn to death while she slept in a gin-induced stupor. Such cases provided a focus for anti-gin campaigners such as the indefatigable Thomas Wilson and the image of the neglectful and/or abusive mother became increasingly central to anti-gin propaganda. Sir John Gonson, whom Hogarth featured in his earlier A Harlot's Progress, turned his attention from prostitution to gin and began prosecuting gin-related crimes with severity.|$|E
25|$|On {{the wall}} of <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> are low relief plaster sculptures of Night and Day after works by the Danish {{sculptor}} Bertel Thorvaldsen. They symbolically divide the night quarters upstairs from the day quarters downstairs. The oak balustrade has turned balusters and brass finials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of lions, because Elizabeth's family coat of arms featured lions. The ceiling is heavily coffered, but there are windows round the top of <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> and a great glass chandelier, so it is very light - <b>in</b> fact <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> is built as a separate tower so as to permit so many windows.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, he {{sold his}} {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Madison and bought two theatres <b>in</b> Renton. <b>The</b> Roxy Theatre, located at 504 S. 3rd Street, was an art-deco landmark, with an eight-sided dome <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and staircases with sweeping chrome railings. Inside the auditorium were art-deco light fixtures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of four-pointed stars, which were able to be dimmed and yet leave enough of a glow to outline the chrome stars on <b>the</b> ceiling. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> there were chandeliers of slim, stately milk glass columns with stacks of little chrome trumpets on top. In more recent years, the Roxy was reopened to run East Indian Cinema, and later, as a church and rental hall.|$|R

500|$|That scene, where Andi {{delivers}} the Book, the mockup {{of the magazine}} in progress, to Miranda's apartment, was, according to the Dengels, who played Miranda's twin daughters, totally improvised. [...] "That was just something we did with Anne and it made the cut," [...] Colleen Dengel told BuzzFeed in 2017. Nevertheless, it took three more days of filming to get the shot of the girls up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> the way Frankel wanted it, a look she believes {{was inspired by a}} similar scene with twin girls in The Shining.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted that}} the episode made {{references}} to previous episodes of the series. The ending, featuring Dwight riding a bicycle on the roof, was positively compared to the third season episode [...] "Safety Training". Adams wrote {{that many of the}} scenes [...] "take characters to corners of the office tied to memories of episode's [...] past", such as Oscar's phone call, which takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> where Dwight pumped himself up for his work review in the second season episode [...] "Performance Review", and Pam climbing up the rooftop access ladder, which is reminiscent of Pam and Jim's first [...] "date" [...] in the second season episode [...] "The Client".|$|E
500|$|Early in 1929, Pflueger met Ralph Stackpole, an art {{professor}} at California School of Fine Arts {{and a former}} student of Mathews, who agreed to sculpt monumental figures for the stock exchange project as well as recommending and supervising other artists. Stackpole wrote later of his experience that [...] "the artists were in from the first. They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building." [...] Pflueger hired nine artists to help decorate the neighboring Stock Exchange Tower at 155 Sansome, and instructed them only to keep their themes light and airy. Diego Rivera was brought with some difficulty from Mexico to paint a two-story mural <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwell</b> between the 10th and 11th floors of the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club (now the City Club). Stackpole himself worked with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone above the tall 155 Sansome entrance, as well as carving two large sculpture groups flanking the Tuscan columns of 301 Pine Street.|$|E
40|$|Collective {{behavior}} {{framework is}} utilized {{to examine the}} evacuation of the World Trade Center complex following the attacks of September 11. Using both first-person newspaper accounts and media reports, the paper focuses on emerging norms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision to evacuate {{as well as the}} evacuation process itself. Three key factors affected the decision to evacuate: (1) social location, (2) the role of leaders, and (3) the level of perceived threat. Helping behavior, the definition of norms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells,</b> and episodes of deviant behavior as emerging norms were all evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evacuation process. Panic was not widely observed during the evacuation of the Twin Towers. Improvements made following the 1993 World Trade Center attack contributed to a more successful evacuation...|$|R
50|$|Since 1953, the THC Building {{has been}} {{rumored to be}} haunted by the ghost of Thomas Cates, its former janitor, who {{died of natural causes}} while working his night shift.

2500|$|He {{is mainly}} remembered for his {{pioneering}} studies and experiments with flying machines, including the working, piloted glider that he designed and built. He wrote a landmark three-part treatise titled [...] "On Aerial Navigation" [...] (1809–1810), {{which was published}} in Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts. The 2007 discovery of sketches in Cayley's school notebooks (held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> archive of the Royal Aeronautical Society Library) revealed that even at school Cayley was developing his ideas on the theories of flight. It has been claimed that these images indicate that Cayley identified the principle of a lift-generating inclined plane as early as 1792. To measure the drag on objects at different speeds and angles of attack, he later built a [...] "whirling-arm apparatus", a development of earlier work in ballistics and air resistance. He also experimented with rotating wing sections of various forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairwells</b> at Brompton Hall.|$|R
