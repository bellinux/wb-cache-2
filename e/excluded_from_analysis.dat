When some packages, like PSPP or MicrOsiris, read in or import the {{original}} data set, the packages will recognize that those values are missing, and do their calculations accordingly. MicrOsiris automatically assigns 1.5 or 1.6 billion to blanks as missing, and these values are <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since {{cells and}} {{especially}} fixed cells tend to stick together, cell aggregates {{have to be}} <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>analysis</b> through a process called doublet discrimination. This is important because a doublet of two G0/G1 cells has the same total content of DNA and thus the same fluorescence intensity as a single G2/M cell. Unless recognized as such the G0/G1 doublets would contribute to false positive identification and count of G2/M cells.|$|E
50|$|The survey {{using this}} method is very {{different}} from the conventional survey that is usually based on reflection seismology. The conventional survey consists of numerous measurements that are spatially very close together and relatively short (often lasting in the order of minutes). The passive seismic survey has much less measurements but they are frequently recorded for days. Local time must be taken into consideration, picking intervals with less human induced noise. Even relatively distant earthquakes are visible in the recorded spectrograms and must also be <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Listwise {{deletion}} is also problematic {{when the}} reason for missing data may not be random (i.e., questions in questionnaires aiming to extract sensitive information). Due to the method, much of the subjects' data will be <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> <b>analysis,</b> leaving a bias in data findings. For instance, a questionnaire may include questions about respondents drug use history, current earnings, or sexual persuasions. Many of {{the subjects in the}} sample may not answer due to the intrusive nature of the questions, but may answer all other items. Listwise deletion will exclude these respondents from analysis. This may create a bias as participants who do divulge this information may have different characteristics than participants who do not. Multiple imputation is an alternate technique for dealing with missing data that attempts to eliminate this bias.|$|E
