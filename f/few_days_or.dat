5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% {{of people will}} recover without treatment within a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed {{to all of these}} medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E

25|$|To {{discourage}} employers {{from breaking}} {{away from the}} bargaining group, unions developed the whipsaw strike. In a whipsaw strike, the union strikes one employer (or just a few employers) in the multi-employer bargaining group. The strike is usually of a short duration (a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> a week at most). The union strikes employer after employer. Strikes may occur one after another and may overlap, or there may be long lulls between strikes. The same employer may be struck repeatedly, with sometimes as little as 24 hours between strikes.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{number of}} {{homeless}} households in England peaked in 2003–04 at 135,420 before falling {{to a low}} of 40,020 in 2009–10. In 2014–15, there were 54,430 homeless households, which was 60 per cent below the 2003–04 peak. The UK has more than 80,000 children in temporary accommodation, a number which increases every year. The official figures for England are that an average of 498 people sleeps rough each night, with 248 of those in London. It {{is important to note that}} many individuals may spend only a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks sleeping rough, and so this number hides the total number of people actually affected in any one year.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic Telegraph Company {{was formed}} in London in 1856 to {{undertake}} to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 27 July 1866, by the ship SS Great Eastern, captained by Sir James Anderson after many mishaps along the way. Earlier transatlantic submarine cables installations were attempted in 1857, 1858, and 1865. The 1858 cable only operated intermittently for a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long transmission lines. An overland telegraph from Britain to India was first connected in 1866 but was unreliable so a submarine telegraph cable was connected in 1870. Several telegraph companies were combined to form the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1872.|$|E

25|$|A {{regulation}} {{dating from}} 2010 renders the island a nature reserve under Norwegian jurisdiction. The {{aim of this}} regulation is to ensure the preservation of a pristine Arctic island and the marine life nearby, including the ocean floor. Landings at Jan Mayen {{can be done by}} boat. However, this is permitted only at {{a small part of the}} island, named Båtvika (Boat Bay). As there is no commercial airline operating at the island, one cannot get there by plane except by chartering one. Admission for landings by a charter plane has to be obtained in advance. Admission to stay on the island has to be obtained in advance, and is generally limited to a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> (<b>or</b> even hours). Putting up a tent or setting up camp is prohibited. There is a separate regulation for the stay of foreigners.|$|E
25|$|While {{the figures}} of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy {{remained}} commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, {{partly as a result}} of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks later. Francis Amasa Walker, Superintendent of the 1870 Census, used census and Surgeon General data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 Census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.|$|E
25|$|Skin lesions of Lyme-like disease. Early {{symptoms}} {{in the first}} four weeks after a tickbite include a rash or red patch that gradually expands over several days. It may get quite large (up to 50mm or more in diameter). This rash is called erythema migrans or EM. It can be difficult to distinguish from an allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} bite. Allergic rashes usually occur within 48 hours of the bite, then fade. EM usually first appears after a delay of 48 hours following the tickbite and gets bigger over a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks. As it expands, EM rash often has a 'target' or 'bullseye' appearance, clearing in the middle with a more obvious red edge. EM can persist for months or years, coming and going in that time. Sometimes many small EM rashes occur. EM may only occur in as few as 20% of persons with Lyme disease.|$|E

25|$|Hitler was {{disappointed}} with Halder's plan and initially reacted by deciding that the German army should attack early, ready or not, {{in the hope}} that Allied unreadiness might bring about an easy victory. Hitler proposed beginning the invasion on 25 October 1939 but accepted that the date was probably unrealistic. On 29 October, Halder presented another plan, Aufmarschanweisung N°2, Fall Gelb, featuring a secondary attack on the Netherlands. On 5 November, Hitler informed Walther von Brauchitsch that he intended the invasion to begin on 12 November. Brauchitsch replied that the military had yet to recover from the Polish campaign and offered to resign; this was refused but two days later Hitler postponed the attack, giving poor weather as the reason for the delay. More postponements followed, as commanders persuaded Hitler to delay the attack for a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks, to remedy some critical defect in the preparations or to wait for better weather. Hitler also tried to alter the plan, which he found unsatisfactory; his weak understanding of how poorly prepared Germany was for war and how it would cope with losses of armoured vehicles were not fully considered. Though Poland had been quickly defeated, many armoured vehicles had been lost and were hard to replace. This eventually resulted in a dispersion of the German effort; although the main attack would remain in central Belgium, secondary attacks would be undertaken on the flanks. Hitler made such a suggestion on 11 November, pressing for an early attack on unprepared targets.|$|E

The RFE broadcast about Siwiec aired in February, March or April [...] (sources vary) that year.
