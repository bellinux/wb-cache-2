5|$|Although not {{recognised}} by {{any major}} <b>kennel</b> clubs, the Russian Spaniel is recognised by the Continental <b>Kennel</b> Club, Federation of International Canines, North American <b>Kennel</b> Club, and Universal <b>Kennel</b> Club International. For recognition by The <b>Kennel</b> Club a breed {{is required to}} apply with names and addresses of UK owners/importers, number of dogs bred in the UK, copies of the pedigrees of UK dogs - at least three generations, it must be recognised in its country of origin and statistics on registration figures in that country, statistics on entries in shows in that country and at international level, any inherited health conditions, when the breed registry was closed, the standard from the country of origin and a brief history and details of any working activities.|$|E

40|$|Canine {{herpesvirus}} (CHV- 1) causes {{neonatal deaths}} {{as well as}} infertility due to embryonal death, abortion and stillbirths in breeding <b>kennels.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against canine herpesvirus in the serum of dogs older than 1 year in breeding <b>kennels</b> in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. A serum neutralization test (SNT) and a newly developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to test the serum samples of 328 dogs in 38 breeding <b>kennels.</b> With SNT as well as ELISA, 22 % of sera were positive (P > 0. 9). Seventeen <b>kennels</b> (45 % of total <b>kennels)</b> each had at least one positive dog on SNT compared with twenty <b>kennels</b> (53 % of total <b>kennels)</b> that each had at least one positive dog on ELISA (P = 0. 6). The prevalence of positive dogs in positive <b>kennels</b> was 42 ± 26 % (n = 17 <b>kennels)</b> for SNT and 39 ± 26 % (n = 20 <b>kennels)</b> for ELISA. Pairwise comparison of <b>kennels</b> showed that the prevalence of SNT positive dogs was similar to the prevalence of ELISA positive dogs (P = 0. 3, n = 38 <b>kennels).</b> Seroprevalence was independent of age, gender or colony size. This study suggests that canine herpesvirus is sufficiently common in breeding dogs in the Gauteng Province of South Africa to pose a threat to neonatal survival and fertility.

5|$|Called simply Cocker Spaniel in the UK, this is {{the breed}} that was {{originally}} recognized by The <b>Kennel</b> Club (KC) in 1892. The American <b>Kennel</b> Club (AKC) recognized the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed in 1946.|$|E
5|$|French Spaniels {{are also}} {{recognized}} by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, and the United <b>Kennel</b> Club. The <b>Kennel</b> Club (UK) and the American <b>Kennel</b> Club do not recognize the French Spaniel, but is recognised by the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association, and can be registered with US dog registries in order to record their registries and compete in associated dog shows, such as the Dog Registry of America, American Canine Association, and America's Pet Registry.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was {{reformed}} {{with the}} aim of seeking <b>Kennel</b> Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United <b>Kennel</b> Club following suit in 1991. The American <b>Kennel</b> Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.|$|E

5|$|The age of {{the modern}} Whippet dawned in 1891 when The <b>Kennel</b> Club granted the breed {{official}} recognition, thus making the Whippet eligible for competition in dog shows, and commencing the recording of their pedigrees. In the United States, the Whippet was recognised in 1888 by the American <b>Kennel</b> Club. Whippets arrived in the United States with mill operators from England, and the first populations were established in Massachusetts. The Whippet is the 55th most popular breed according to the American <b>Kennel</b> Club.|$|E
50|$|In 1905 new <b>kennels</b> and stables {{were built}} at Paudy Lane, Seagrave; these are now listed buildings. The hunt's present-day <b>kennels</b> are at Gaddesby Lane, Kirby Bellars, near Melton Mowbray.|$|R

The hunt's <b>kennels</b> moved to premises in Ashwell parish in 2004 when the former <b>kennels</b> were developed for housing, called Kimball Close after Marcus Kimball, Baron Kimball, former MFH.|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the <b>Kennel</b> Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the <b>Kennel</b> Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the <b>Kennel</b> Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the <b>Kennel</b> Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the <b>Kennel</b> Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the <b>Kennel</b> Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E

50|$|Racing {{was planned}} for every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings; this was common {{practice}} {{at the time and}} before a restriction was introduced as to which nights tracks were allowed to race. The paddock and racing <b>kennels</b> were literally constructed next door to houses in Oxley Road which must have been very noisy for the residents during racing. The greyhounds would only be housed during racing with the resident <b>kennels</b> situated on a 26 acre site called Sykes Holt in the village of Mellor Brook six miles to the east. There were 100 <b>kennels</b> with the addition of rest <b>kennels</b> and exercising accommodation.|$|R

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by The <b>Kennel</b> Club, {{the primary cause of}} death for Fox Terriers was old age, causing 31.8% of reported deaths. The secondary cause was cancer of an unspecified type, which accounted for 22.7% of reports. The average lifespan of a Fox Terrier is around 15 years; however, the <b>Kennel</b> Club survey reported a median age at death of 13 years and 2 months.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) {{bought an}} {{interest}} in the West Ham site and two years later Stamford Bridge trainer Sid Mann switched his runners to West Ham following the closure of the track. During the same year the GRA decided to move all of the greyhounds out of the Clapton and West Ham <b>kennels</b> and put them in their renowned training establishment at Hook <b>kennels</b> in Northaw. The Northaw <b>kennels</b> would now house all trainers from Harringay Stadium, White City Stadium, Clapton and West Ham which brought the estate under considerable pressure. This sale of the West Ham and Clapton <b>kennels</b> brought unease with concerns over the stadia themselves.|$|R

40|$|This ethological study was  {{carried out}} to {{establish}} the occurrence of psychosis in dogs, reared both in-home (as a pet) and in dog <b>kennels.</b> The dogs housed in <b>kennels</b> were reared either individually (as working animals) or in groups (in <b>kennels).</b> All the pet dogs were reared alone in the households. The highest occurrence of psychotic states was encountered in stray dogs housed in <b>kennels</b> and followed by the pet dogs. These states were very rarely observed in individually reared dogs at farms and working dogs. The {{possible explanation is that}} they were submitted to less stressors due to good management at farms and the proper approach {{on the basis of their}} temperaments, i. e. their welfare was at the highest level...|$|R
5|$|Judy was a {{pure-bred}} {{liver and}} white Pointer. She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a boarding <b>kennel</b> used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China. Judy was one of seven puppies to a dog named Kelly owned by a couple from Sussex. At {{the age of three}} months, she escaped and had been kept in a back alley by a shopkeeper until she was six months old. Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the <b>kennel</b> and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the <b>kennel,</b> her mother and siblings were no longer there.|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{arrived in}} the United States {{during the nineteenth century}} and were soon making their way into the family home and the show ring. The American <b>Kennel</b> Club {{recognized}} the breed in 1885. The Pug Dog Club of America was founded in 1931 and was recognised by the American <b>Kennel</b> Club that same year. In 1981, the Pug Dhandys Favorite Woodchuck won the Westminster <b>Kennel</b> Club Dog Show in the United States, the only Pug to have won there since the show began in 1877. The World Champion, or Best in Show at the 2004 World Dog Show held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was a Pug named Double D Cinoblu's Masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International <b>Kennel</b> Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United <b>Kennel</b> Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster <b>Kennel</b> Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kennels</b> in Croxteth Hall Lane {{were built}} in the 1870s and are a Grade II listed building. They were {{designed}} by the Chester architect John Douglas for the 4th Earl of Sefton. The <b>kennels</b> are built in red brick with a patterned roof of blue and green slates. The building is in one storey and has three bays; the left two bays consist of the <b>kennels</b> and the bay on the right is higher with a steeper half-hipped roof.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the apparent digestibility coefficients of a commercial dog food, fecal consistency and behavior of dogs housed in <b>kennels</b> and metabolic cages. Six adult Beagle dogs were distributed in cross-over experimental design, with six replicates per treatment. Dogs were housed in two environments: metabolic cages and in masonry <b>kennels</b> with solarium. Dogs were fed for a five-day adaptation period, and the five following days were used for total feces collection. Dogs behavior was recorded during a 48 -h period, with 10 -min intervals. Apparent digestibility coefficients were not different between treatments. However, dogs housed in metabolic cages produced lower weight and more consistent feces as compared with dogs housed in <b>kennels.</b> Dogs spent most of the time sleeping in both housing systems; however, dogs housed in the metabolic cages slept more than those in <b>kennels.</b> Stress-related behaviors (barking, whimpering, stereotypies, etc) were observed for no longer than 15 minutes per day, and were not different between dogs in <b>kennels</b> or in cages. There is no difference in food digestibility evaluated in dogs housed in metabolic cages or kennels; however, dogs kept in metabolic cages eliminate drier feces and spend more time inactive than those kept in <b>kennels...</b>|$|R
