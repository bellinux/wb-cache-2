5|$|Relative {{to their}} high standards, UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that has become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E
5|$|After Tatum {{resigned}} to coach {{at his own}} alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record. Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had, but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> guard prospect. Breedlove later went on to play {{eight years in the}} NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E
5|$|Despite its <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> lineup, Michigan {{entered the}} tournament as the sixth {{youngest}} {{team in the}} country and the youngest team in the field of 68 teams according to Sports Illustrated, based on weighted minutes played. The game marked Michigan's first NCAA Championship Monday appearance since 1989. Some sources claim 1993 as the school's last appearance, but those results have been vacated by the NCAA due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.|$|E
50|$|The Minstrel Show is {{the second}} studio album by hip hop trio Little Brother. It {{followed}} the critical success of their 2003 debut, The Listening. The album was <b>highly</b> anticipated and <b>touted</b> as a probable breakthrough for the group, even before its release. The title is {{a reference to the}} minstrel shows that were popular in the United States during the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|On April 14, 2006, Mkrtchyan {{became the}} EBU (European) super middleweight chanmpion after {{knocking}} out previously unbeaten Jackson Chanet. His {{first and only}} defence of the title came against David Gogiya that October. Despite being <b>touted</b> <b>highly,</b> ranked number nine {{in the world by}} the WBC and number 7 by the IBF at that point, Mkrtchyan lost the bout to the Russian Former Super Middleweight champion by split decision.|$|R
25|$|In accompaniment {{with its}} rapid growth, Flushing in {{particular}} has witnessed the proliferation of <b>highly</b> competitive businesses <b>touted</b> as educational centers as well as non-profit organizations declaring the intent to educate the community. Some entities offer education in Mandarin, the lingua franca of Mainland China; others profess {{to provide students with}} intensive training in computer and technological proficiency; while still others entice high school students with rigorous preparatory classes for college entrance examinations in mathematics, science, and English literacy.|$|R
5|$|In the 2014–15 season, the Flames, {{assisted}} by 2013 draft pick Monahan and other <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> prospect Johnny Gaudreau, won {{one of their}} final home games against the Los Angeles Kings to clinch their first playoff spot since 2009, which eliminated the Kings from the playoffs. They eliminated the Vancouver Canucks in six games {{in the first round}} of the playoffs (which was their first playoff series win since 2004) but would be eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in five games in the second round.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Williamsport High School, Adenhart was <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> {{as a high}} school prospect until an injury in his final game required Tommy John surgery. He was drafted by the Angels in the 14th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, and began playing in their minor league system after the surgery was a success. He spent three full seasons in the minor leagues before making his major league debut on May 1, 2008. After appearing in three games, Adenhart spent the rest of 2008 in the minor leagues developing his skills, and in 2009 he earned a spot in the Angels' starting rotation.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, he was {{promoted}} from the Class A-Advanced level Tampa Yankees of the FSL to the Double-A level Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Eastern League, {{and then to the}} Triple-A level Columbus Clippers of the International League. Rivera finished the year with a 10–2record in 22starts, although he struggled for Columbus, recording a 5.81ERA in six starts. Beginning the 1995 season with Columbus, he was ranked by sports magazine Baseball America as the ninth-best prospect in the Yankees organization; by contrast, the publication ranked Rivera's <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> cousin Rubén as the second-best prospect in baseball. Mariano's pitching repertoire primarily consisted of fastballs at the time, although he threw a slider and changeup as secondary pitches.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{generally}} negative reviews, the Mysterio-Punk match was <b>highly</b> praised. McNichol <b>touted</b> it as [...] "the {{highlight of the}} night" [...] and praised the wrestlers involved for a [...] "terrific closing sequence". Bishop awarded the match 8.5 out of ten, and stated {{it was one of}} two matches, along with the Tag Team Championship bout, that were not [...] "underwhelming in every aspect". Eck agreed, calling the Punk-Mysterio match the [...] "most compelling match on the card" [...] and stated that the Tag Team Championship match was [...] "well-worked".|$|R
5|$|John Thompson was in {{the midst}} of his tenth season as head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas as the team entered the National Championship game. Before the season, Thompson made {{headlines}} when he signed top recruit, Patrick Ewing over several other top name schools, along with Tony Jones, Ralph Dalton, Elvado Smith, and Bill Martin. Georgetown was named by some voters as the number one team in the nation in the preseason polls due to its <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> recruiting class. The Hoyas' starting line up was: Eric Smith, Eric Floyd, and Fred Brown as guards, Mike Hancock in the forward position, and Ewing at center.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also {{unearthed}} several position players. He signed Charlie Keller, a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> prospect {{playing for the}} University of Maryland. To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} faced {{uncertainty}} relating to {{who would be}} the starting quarterback. While it was expected that Tate Forcier would retain his starting job, the build-up to the season led to a quarterback controversy that turned into a three way battle between Forcier, Denard Robinson, and <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> recruit Devin Gardner. On defense, Michigan installed a new 3–3–5 formation that the coaches hoped would better suit the players currently on the team. Michigan lost several key players from the previous season, including DE Brandon Graham, the 2009 Big Ten defensive Most Valuable Player, RB's Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown, LB Stevie Brown, and CB Donovan Warren. Michigan suffered a severe blow to its defensive secondary during fall practice, as starting CB Troy Woolfolk suffered a dislocated ankle that ended his season before it began.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{played his}} final MLB season in 1951, while <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> outfielder Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York. Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw two no-hitters during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant {{for the third}} {{straight}} year. They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants, four games to two. When their 1952 team took the AL pennant, the Yankees had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In another Yankees–Dodgers matchup, New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title. New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the 1953 World Series, and a Billy Martin base hit that decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row. As of 2016, the 1949–1953 Yankees are the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series; no team since has won more than three in a row.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E
5|$|Babcock's {{first move}} as GM was {{drafting}} centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, {{in a move}} that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick. Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the General Manager search and had concluded {{that as long as the}} managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team. Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract at a reported $10million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal, and the trade eventually cost him his job.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, Curie again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave Curie a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, Curie was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park High School that went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with Curie. According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and Curie was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good with so much at stake. On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated Curie 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{recruiting}} {{class was}} ranked 52nd {{in the nation}} by Scout.com and 38th by Rivals.com. Scout.com rated three recruits as four-star and six as three-star prospects, while Rivals.com rated six recruits each as four-star and three-star prospects. Kenny Tate, who was originally recruited as a wide receiver, was the only four-star prospect to see significant playing time in 2008. Before the season, he was converted to safety, a position that had been attrited by the graduation of former starters Christian Varner and J.J. Justice, and Tate also saw action on special teams. Cornerback Cameron Chism, who saw action in nine games as a reserve, recorded seven tackles on kickoff returns to tie for second on the team in special teams tackles. Tight end Matt Furstenburg saw limited play time on special teams against Delaware and Middle Tennessee, but injured his foot and was awarded a medical redshirt. Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey also sat out the season as a redshirt to recuperate from foot surgery. The other four-star recruits who sat out on redshirt status were wide receiver Kerry Boykins, tight end Devonte Campbell, and defensive tackle Masengo Kabongo. Running back Davin Meggett, the son of former New York Giants star Dave Meggett, was the only true freshman to start a game for Maryland in 2008, {{and he was a}} significant contributor throughout the season. Meggett was not a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> recruit, assessed by Scout.com as a two-star prospect, and his only other scholarship offers were from local-area Division I FCS schools. In 2008, however, he led all ACC freshman with 5.13yards per carry, and Megett finished the season with 457yards and four touchdowns as a reserve.|$|E
25|$|Anderson was a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> young {{prospect}}; in 2008 he {{was ranked}} as the 36th-best prospect in the Major Leagues, and in 2009 he was ranked the top prospect in Oakland's {{system and the}} #7 prospect overall by Baseball America.|$|E
25|$|The Nittany Lions {{also tried}} to show off two <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> freshmen. Justin King, who played both ways in the game, made his first {{contribution}} with a 61-yard run on a reverse. Derrick Williams finished with 38yards on three catches.|$|E
25|$|Playing on a {{team with}} another <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> {{prospect}} Sidney Crosby, Malkin finished his rookie season with 33 goals and 85 points, leading all first-year players and capturing the Calder Trophy as the league's top rookie, the second Penguin to win the award after Mario Lemieux. Malkin was named alternate captain for the Penguins shortly after.|$|E
25|$|Cassell was a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> youngster for the Victorian Bushrangers, but {{injuries}} limited him to just 2 First Class and 3 One Day games. Cassell's {{performances in}} those matches suggested potential, with 7 wickets (at {{an average of}} 22.71) in the Pura Cup and 4 wickets in the ING Cup at 22.50. Cassell played all of his state cricket in the 2002-2003 season.|$|E
25|$|Yashin {{received}} his initial fame {{for being the}} first draft pick {{in the history of}} the expansion Ottawa Senators (2nd overall in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft). After remaining in Russia for the 1992–93 season with the Dynamo Moscow, Yashin arrived in Ottawa for the 1993–94 NHL season, along with Ottawa's other <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> young draft selection, Alexandre Daigle. Yashin soon eclipsed Daigle as the team's brightest young star, scoring 79 points in his rookie season and earning a nomination for the Calder Trophy.|$|E
25|$|During the {{off-season}} preceding the lockout, Tim Thomas made {{his decision to}} sit out the 2012–13 season. General Manager Peter Chiarelli confirmed Thomas' decision. Thomas was first suspended for not reporting to training camp, then his rights were traded to the New York Islanders on February 7. The Bruins decided {{to go with the}} goaltending pair of Tuukka Rask and Anton Khudobin for the season. Meanwhile, <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> prospect Dougie Hamilton was promoted to the main roster after spending a season in the juniors.|$|E
25|$|The Baltimore Ravens {{snapped the}} NFC's three-game winning streak by winning Super Bowl XLVII in a 34–31 nail-biter over the San Francisco 49ers. Super Bowl XLVIII, played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium in February 2014, {{was the first}} Super Bowl held {{outdoors}} in a cold weather environment. The Seattle Seahawks won their first NFL title with a 43–8 defeat of the Denver Broncos, in a <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> matchup that pitted Seattle's top-ranked defense against a Peyton Manning-led Denver offense that had broken the NFL's single-season scoring record.|$|E
25|$|After going 18–15 in 2014–15, {{the first}} time the Rebels failed to win 20 games in a season since 2005–06, the team {{recruited}} <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> prospect Stephen Zimmerman, who helped the Rebels start the 2015–16 season 3–0, their best start since going 8–0 in 2010–11. However, the Rebels failed to capitalize on that start; a 1–5 stretch that included an 0–3 start in Mountain West play led the school to fire Rice on January 10, 2016. His top assistant Todd Simon was named interim head coach {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Russell was the {{starting}} quarterback again at LSU in 2006, beating out Matt Flynn and <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> redshirt freshman Ryan Perrilloux. Before the season began, he changed his jersey number from 4 to 2. He had a productive 2006 regular season, leading the Tigers to a 10–2 record and a BCS Sugar Bowl berth. He threw for 3,129 yards, 28 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He was second in the SEC with 2,923 yards from scrimmage. Russell also won the SEC Offensive Player of the Week award three times during the regular season.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} his release from the Rams, he signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the New York Giants, with a second year player option. Warner started the 2004 season as the Giants' {{starting}} quarterback, winning five of his first seven games, but following a two-game losing streak, <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> rookie quarterback Eli Manning was given the starting job. The Giants had a 5–4 win-loss record {{at the time of}} Warner's benching, finishing at 6–10 overall (going only 1–6 under Manning). Following the season, Warner chose to void the second year of his contract, and thus became a free agent.|$|E
25|$|While {{prior to}} his major league career Winters was being {{compared}} to Christy Mathewson, by April 12, 1920, the Milwaukee Sentinel was comparing him to Ferdie Schupp. The newspaper noted Winters' lack of control on the mound and related him to Schupp, who, like Winters, was a very <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> prospect that initially showed poor control. As Winters did not appear in many games in his rookie season, Schupp too spent {{the early part of}} his career primarily in the dugout. However, by 1917, he blossomed by winning 21 games for the Giants. The newspaper predicted a similar output by Winters.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, Gus Malzahn, Mustain's {{coach at}} Springdale, {{was hired to}} be the new {{offensive}} coordinator at the University of Arkansas; this was widely taken to signal the Razorbacks willingness to shift their offense to adapt to Mustain's style of play. The hiring enabled the Razorbacks to recruit the <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> quarterback. On January 16, 2006, Mustain informed Malzahn of his decision to commit to Arkansas, but only after Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis opted to offer quarterback recruit Jimmy Clausen over Mustain. In addition to Malzahn, Mustain joined six of his high school teammates at Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|The {{next year}} was {{followed}} up {{by a narrow}} championship over Trabzonspor, winning the then record of sixteen Turkish First Football League championships. Fenerbahçe lost the title {{in the last week}} of the 2005–06 season to Galatasaray. Fenerbahçe needed a win, but instead drew 1–1 with Denizlispor while Galatasaray won 3–0 over Kayserispor. Soon after, Christoph Daum stepped down as manager, and was replaced by Zico on 4 July 2006. Zico began his reign by signing two new defenders, <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> Uruguayan international Diego Lugano, and fellow Brazilian Edu Dracena. Zico also signed two strikers, Serbian international Mateja Kežman, and another Brazilian, Deivid.|$|E
25|$|This game {{marked the}} first meeting between Auburn and MAC {{representative}} Buffalo. The Bulls, under head coach and former Nebraska star quarterback Turner Gill, played inspired football against the banged-up Tigers keeping the game close {{until late in the}} third quarter. Auburn played without Kenny Irons and with starting QB Brandon Cox slowed by injuries from the battle against LSU. <b>Highly</b> <b>touted</b> true freshman running back Ben Tate entered the game for Auburn in the fourth quarter and showed Tiger fans a glimpse of the future rushing for 114 yards on seven carries and scoring touchdowns on runs of 42 and 28 yards.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-2000s, the team's {{fortunes}} have improved. Two {{years after}} becoming head coach, Lewis guided the Bengals {{to their first}} winning season and first division title in over a decade. After the acquisition of Andy Dalton as quarterback in 2011, the Bengals had made the playoffs each season until 2016, ranking highly among NFL teams in win totals. The Bengals drafts are also <b>highly</b> <b>touted,</b> leading to a consistency that had long escaped the franchise. However, the team has remained unable {{to win in the}} postseason and have not won a playoff game since 1990.|$|E
25|$|Maryland secured several <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> recruits, and Rivals.com {{rated the}} {{recruiting}} class as 25th in the nation, while Scout.com ranked it 26th in the nation. Scout or Rivals.com four-star prospects included running backs Caleb Porzel and D.J. Adams, defensive lineman De'Onte Arnett, defensive back Travis Hawkins, and offensive lineman Pete White. The class also included eight linebackers, a position which Maryland had heavily recruited {{in order to}} backfill graduated players. Offensive tackle Nick Klemm had originally planned to go to Boston College, but de-committed to sign with the Terrapins after Eagles' head coach Jeff Jagodzinski was fired.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, <b>highly</b> <b>touted</b> but {{unproven}} redshirt sophomore Matt Leinart {{took over}} for Palmer at quarterback. Although his first pass {{went for a}} touchdown in a win over Auburn, the Trojans suffered an early season triple-overtime loss to conference rival California in Berkeley. Nevertheless, Carroll guided the team to wins in their remaining games and they completed the regular season 11–1. Before the postseason, both the coaches' poll and the AP Poll ranked USC number 1, but the BCS—which also gave consideration to computer rankings—ranked Oklahoma first, another one-loss team but one that had lost its own Big 12 Conference title game 35–7, with USC ranked third.|$|E
