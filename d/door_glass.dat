25|$|For 1961 the American line added a four-door station wagon, {{as well as}} a two-door {{convertible}} for {{the first}} time since 1954. It featured a power-operated folding top with roll-down <b>door</b> <b>glass,</b> rather than the fixed side-window frames of the original design. Passenger room increased from five to six.|$|E
25|$|Externally, {{the most}} obvious changes over the SII were the thicker and more {{incorporated}} rubber bumpers with decorative chrome only on the top edge, flush door handles for increased safety, a one-piece front <b>door</b> <b>glass</b> without a separate 1/4 light, a grille with only vertical vanes, reverse lights moved from the boot plinth to the larger rear light clusters and a revised roofline with narrower door frames and increased glass area.|$|E

The GS sedans also {{were the first}} to feature the latest generation of Lexus' SmartAccess keyless system–-adding a push-button start {{for the first time as}} standard.|$|E
500|$|On {{the ground}} floor there is an {{entrance}} door made of cedar set with sidelights and fanlight, with an etching on the <b>door</b> <b>glass</b> saying Olim Periculum Nunc Salus, Latin for [...] "Once Perilous, Now Safe". Above the door is the writing [...] "•A1903D•", stating the year of official lighting. There is also a [...] "ghost door" [...] on the outside which was planned but never completed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} models was reduced from 14 models in 1971 to 9 in 1972. The {{convertible}} was discontinued, and the 4-door hardtops and sedans were replaced with 4-door [...] "pillared hardtops." [...] This was Ford's term for 4-door sedans with frameless <b>door</b> <b>glass.</b> Wagons {{got the same}} frameless <b>door</b> <b>glass</b> and thin [...] "B" [...] pillar as the sedan. [...] All other body styles remained, including the fastback, which Ford continued to dub [...] "SportsRoof". [...] "Torino" [...] remained the base series, but the mid-level Torino 500 was renamed [...] "Gran Torino". The Torino Brougham was reduced to an option package for the Gran Torino, and Torino GT became [...] "Gran Torino Sport." [...] The Torino and Gran Torino were available as a 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan; the Gran Torino Sport was available as a 2-door hardtop and SportsRoof. The station wagon line-up consisted of three models: [...] "Torino," [...] "Gran Torino," [...] and [...] "Gran Torino Squire." [...] The Cobra model was discontinued as the Torino line was refocused toward luxury and de-emphasized performance.|$|E
25|$|Entrances to the {{structure}} were somewhat less varied. Most exterior <b>doors</b> were <b>glass.</b> <b>Door</b> jambs were usually green metal but sometimes made of bronze or steel. Glass and metal canopies protected most doorways.|$|R
25|$|A {{safety glass}} mirror {{is made by}} {{adhering}} a special protective film to the back surface of a silver glass mirror, which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken. This kind of mirror is used for furniture, <b>doors,</b> <b>glass</b> walls, commercial shelves, or public areas.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the last}} Bel Air 2-door sedan was {{available}} in the USA in 1969, Chevrolet introduced a Canadian market-only two door hardtop, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, from 1970-75. [...] Based on the Impala Sport Coupe, this new model featured Bel Air trim {{at a lower price}} than the Impala. [...] Each year through 1975, this model's body followed the design of the contemporary Impala Sport Coupe. [...] The 4-door sedan and station wagon continued in production, identical to the U.S. models. [...] For 1976, the Canadian Bel Air Coupe featured the same body as the Impala Custom Coupe, with the large fixed rear quarter window and frameless front <b>door</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} {{marginally}} shorter than previous models, {{but had a}} heavier, bulker appearance. Three towing packages were optional, each with increasing towing capacity. For law men, there were multiple Police package versions available with engines ranging from the 351 2v to the powerful 460 Police Interceptor. Taxi packages continued to be offered as well. All 1973 full-sized Fords now came with a 351 2v V8-engine and SelectShift automatic transmission as their base driveline. [...] Four-door sedans with metal door frames were replaced with a new [...] "Pillared Hardtop" [...] model which featured a thin [...] "B" [...] post and frameless <b>door</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] This body style was offered together with the traditional pillarless four-door hardtop.|$|E
2500|$|All A-bodies, {{including}} the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated [...] crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, performance {{was on the}} decline due to another federal standard—a new emissions control system. The most notable styling feature of this generation was {{the appearance of the}} fixed opera window, replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year's Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop with frameless <b>door</b> <b>glass</b> as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding roll-over protection that would have ultimately spelled the end of pillarless and convertible bodystyles, a mandate that never materialized.|$|E
50|$|A {{sliding door}} {{is a type}} of door which opens {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. Sliding doors can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of sliding doors such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass doors. Sliding doors are commonly used as shower <b>doors,</b> <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R
25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>doors</b> {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupe—named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless <b>door</b> <b>glass</b> and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting {{a further}} industry-wide {{adoption}} of smaller vehicle designs {{in the interest}} of improved fuel efficiency and emissions compliance, the Thunderbird was redesigned for 1980 on the compact Ford Fox platform, which first appeared only two years prior {{as the basis for the}} Ford Fairmont. Compared to the previous Torino-based Thunderbird and its large [...] wheelbase and [...] overall length, the new Thunderbird lost [...] of wheelbase and [...] in overall length. The squarish styling seen in the previous generation Thunderbird was favored for the new model, but the small car platform resulted in a poor translation with a distinctly upright appearance. Frameless <b>door</b> <b>glass</b> was no longer used; a chrome metal frame was used, making this car more like a two-door sedan. Combined with the poor performing [...] Windsor V8 as a base engine, and a C5 3 speed transmission with 2.26 rear gears, this Thunderbird generation was not well received by the public. The available 5.0L (302 cid) Windsor V8 with the AOD automatic overdrive transmission, coupled with a 3.45 rear end gear, was a welcome alternative to the 255, but with only [...] performance was moderately enhanced. Significantly, though failing to generate any new interest for the Thunderbird, a six-cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird's history in 1981, the [...] Thriftpower Six. For 1982 this was followed up with the replacement of the straight-six with a more modern V6, the 3.8L Essex, which was also now the Thunderbird's standard engine. It came equipped with a Motorcraft 2150 2V carburator. Hurting the Thunderbird's sales performance further, the 302 V8 did not return for 1982, leaving the 255 Cubic inch V8 as the only alternative engine. At 288,638 examples produced between 1980 and 1982, the eighth generation Thunderbird was barely more successful than the final model year of the previous Thunderbird generation. In order to revive the Thunderbird's success, a redesign was needed and Ford would deliver one for 1983.|$|E
