40|$|Selected PCB {{congeners}} (PCB 52, 77, and 153) singly and {{in mixtures}} were spiked and aged in soil microcosms and subsequently planted with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) or poplar (Populus deltoids x nigra DN 34). The planted reactors showed significantly greater reductions in PCB parent compounds {{when compared to}} unplanted systems after 32 weeks, both in single congener exposures and when all three congeners were present in a mixture. There was evidence of reductive dechlorination <b>in</b> both <b>planted</b> and unplanted <b>systems,</b> but higher concentrations of transformation products were observed <b>in</b> the <b>planted</b> <b>systems</b> than the unplanted. Although <b>planted</b> <b>systems</b> resulted <b>in</b> greater biotransformation, this improvement in PCB-reduction was {{not the result of}} plant uptake but rather was due to transformations occurring in the root rhizosphere. Parent PCB congeners were transformed by reductive dechlorination resulting in successively less chlorinated PCB congeners. These dechlorination products accounted for approximately all of the molar mass of parent compound lost. Based on the transformation products, reductive dechlorination pathways are proposed for rhizospheric biotransformation of PCB 52, 77, and 153. Results suggest that PCB 52 transformation proceeds through PCBs 18 and 9 down to monochlorinated PCB 1. Biotransformation of PCB 77 occurs through the intermediaries PCB 35 and 37. The pathway for the rhizospheric transformation of PCB 153 is through PCB 101 and PCB 99. This study provides insight into rhizosphere biotransformation pathways for reductive dechlorination in marginally aerobic,intermittently flooded soil as evidenced by a mass balance on transformation products. Despite the marginally aerobic conditions it is likely that highly reduced microzones existed in the soil particles during flooding and provided the opportunity for reductive dechlorination. <b>In</b> these experiments, <b>planted</b> microcosms with fully developed roots and rhizospheres showed significant reductive dechlorination and greater biotransformation than unplanted reactors. <b>In</b> addition, <b>planted</b> <b>systems</b> that were intermittently flooded had greater transformation of the parent PCB compounds than systems that were not.

These changes include increases in the root/canopy ratio and in the chlorophyll content in addition to changes in the leaf anatomy that ultimately lead to preventing leaf ion toxicity, thus maintaining the water status in order to limit water loss and protect the photosynthesis process. Furthermore, we deal with the effect of salt stress on photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence and some of the mechanisms thought to protect the photosynthetic machinery, including the xanthophyll cycle, photorespiration pathway, and water-water cycle. Finally, we also provide an updated discussion on salt-induced oxidative stress at the subcellular level and its effect on the antioxidant machinery in both salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive plants.

While on the 3 rd day of spray the level of residue was found to decrease (0. 0024 μg g 1 - 1) which accounted for 0. 085 % of the applied dose. In case of higher dose applied, the residue level of chlorpyrifos was 0. 0173 μg g - 1 whereas the level increased to 0. 0237 μg g 1 - 1 on 3 rd day of application.

Food plant species are particularly attractive as hosts for in vitro protein production: the risk of transgene escape and food chain contamination is eliminated using containment facilities, while regulatory approval for oral delivery of drugs may be easier than if non-edible species were used. As <b>in</b> whole <b>plants,</b> proteolysis <b>in</b> cultured <b>plant</b> cells can lead to significant degradation of foreign proteins after synthesis; however, substantial {{progress has been made}} to counter the destructive effects of proteases <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> <b>systems.</b> Although protein secretion into the culture medium is advantageous for product recovery and purification, measures are often required to minimise extracellular protease activity and product losses due to irreversible surface adsorption. Disposable plastic bioreactors, which are being used increasingly in mammalian cell bioprocessing, are also being adopted for plant cell culture to allow rapid scale-up and generation of saleable product. This review examines a range of technical and regulatory issues affecting the choice of industrial production platform for foreign proteins, and assesses progress in the development of <b>in</b> vitro <b>plant</b> <b>systems</b> for biopharmaceutical production...|$|R
