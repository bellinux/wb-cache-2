The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.|$|E

5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep <b>going</b> <b>and</b> create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Arena left DC United {{to coach}} the U.S. men's {{national}} team. Arena's departure {{marked the beginning of}} a downturn in the team's fortunes. While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach Thomas Rongen, lackluster results in 2000 and 2001 led to Rongen's departure and his replacement by Ray Hudson in 2002. The team did not, however, fare much better under Hudson, and Piotr Nowak replaced him {{before the start of the}} 2004 season. The club's first season under Nowak was marred by injuries in the early <b>going,</b> <b>and</b> some players were known to have complained about Nowak's methods. Nevertheless, a strong finish, assisted in large measure by the late-season acquisition of Argentine midfielder Christian Gómez, who helped to propel United into the playoffs as the second seed. There they advanced past the New England Revolution on penalty kicks in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history. United then defeated the Kansas City Wizards to win their fourth MLS Cup. United's attendance record at RFK Stadium is 54,282, in a match against the Tampa Bay Mutiny in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Jadzia confides in Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) {{that she}} feels obligated to pursue Curzon's oath, but Kira warns her about what killing someone will do to her. Kang, likewise, tells Jadzia {{that she is not}} bound by Curzon's oath, but she insists on joining their quest. Kor, as buoyant as ever, is delighted to have her along. Koloth is dismissive, until she shows him her skills with a Klingon bat'leth. Kang refuses to accept her, until she shames him with his own devotion to Klingon honor, and insists that she have the chance to avenge her godson. Before Jadzia can request a leave of absence, Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) confronts her in her quarters, refusing her request before she can make it. Jadzia tells him that she is <b>going</b> <b>and</b> begs him not to make her disobey a direct order. He does not give her {{permission}} to go but does not stop her either.|$|E

5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China <b>going,</b> <b>and</b> who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be <b>going,</b> <b>and</b> she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

5|$|William's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, {{had been}} Prince Regent since 1811 {{because of the}} mental illness of their father, George III. In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second {{in the line of}} succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate {{relatively}} frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered {{only a matter of time}} before he became king. When the Duke of York died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were <b>going,</b> <b>and</b> remaining away for ten days. The King, through the Prime Minister, by now Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, requested his resignation; he complied.|$|E
