5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase <b>environmental</b> <b>friendliness.</b> LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E

25|$|The use of skateboards solely {{as a form}} of {{transportation}} is often associated with the longboard.

25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{also provides}} an arena to test environmentally friendly fuel alternatives, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles. Swapping out materials to create lighter public transportation vehicles {{with the same}} or better performance will increase <b>environmental</b> <b>friendliness</b> of public transportation vehicles while maintaining current standards or improving them. Informing {{the public about the}} positive environmental effects of using public transportation in addition to pointing out the potential economic benefit is an important first step towards making a difference.|$|E
500|$|The {{advantages}} of reusable boosters include simplicity from using only {{one type of}} fuel, <b>environmental</b> <b>friendliness,</b> and lower reoccurring costs. Studies concluded that reusable fly-back boosters {{would be the most}} affordable and the least risky way for European space launch systems to start becoming reusable. These fly-back boosters had the potential to reduce launch costs. However, when other projects, such as Space Shuttle or VentureStar, undertook this objective, they failed to meet their goals. Supporting technologies needed for LFBB construction can be developed within 10 years, and additional launchers can be developed based on fly-back boosters to minimise costs and provide maintenance synergy across multiple classes of launch vehicles. Eventually, the hardware grew too large and the LFBB project was scrapped, with one member of the French space agency (CNES) remarking: ...|$|E
2500|$|Committee chair The Rev. John Sperry, former Anglican Bishop of the Arctic, {{said the}} {{committee}} agreed. [...] "We all felt it represented Northern life."

2500|$|Two {{types of}} ethanol are {{produced}} from corn {{and other plants}} such as sugar cane. The residual product (DDGS) is about 33% of the input stream and is used as livestock feed. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to produce E10 and E85 fuels for automobile vehicles. Its manufacture has created 400,000 jobs in the US and its <b>environmental</b> <b>friendliness</b> is recorded {{in the form of}} reduced gas emissions of 25.3 million metric tons. [...] One bushel of corn can produce 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 17.5lbs of livestock feed and 18lbs of carbon dioxide. It is also reported that every acre of corn ultimately results in reducing [...] of greenhouse gas emission. [...] On account of great demand for ethanol corn is fetching higher prices. This has resulted in farmers increasing acreage under corn by adopting crop rotations between corn and soybeans; the latter crop's production has thus declined. Further more acreage under corn has also been allowed to be increased under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 overriding the act of 1983, which had been fixed at [...]|$|E
