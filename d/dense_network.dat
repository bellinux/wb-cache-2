5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} {{is based}} on a fairly <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of tram and bus routes operated by a municipal company, supplemented by a number of private minibus operators. Local trains connect some of the suburbs. The bulk of the city's historic area {{has been turned into a}} pedestrian zone with rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages; however, the tramlines run within a three-block radius (pictured). The historic means of transportation in the city can be examined at the Museum of Municipal Engineering in the Kazimierz district, with many old trams, cars and buses.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has a <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of towns, where large, {{medium and}} small towns are complementary. The plateau is very densely {{populated}} with about 450 people per km2 {{and the landscape}} continually shows signs of human presence. The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase. In international comparison {{the importance of these}} urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests. In addition the two main centres of Zürich and Geneva are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.|$|E

5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E

40|$|Dissemination {{of common}} {{information}} through broadcasting {{is an integral}} part of wireless network operations such as query of interested events, resource discovery and code update. In this paper, we characterize the behavior of information dissemination in power-constrained wireless networks by defining two quantities, i. e., broadcast capacity and information diffusion rate and derive fundamental limits in both random extended and <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> We find that using multihop relay, the rate of broadcasting continuous stream is Θ(log(n) − α 2) in extended networks; while direct single-hop broadcast is efficient for <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> Furthermore, regardless of the density, information can diffuse at constant speed, i. e., Θ(1) in both extended and <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> The theoretical bounds obtained and proof techniques are instrumental to the modeling and design of efficient wireless network protocols...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of multiresolution module {{detection}} in <b>dense</b> weighted <b>networks,</b> where the modular structure is encoded in the weights rather than topology. We discuss a weighted version of the q-state Potts method, which was originally introduced by Reichardt and Bornholdt. This weighted method can be directly applied to <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> We discuss the dependence of the resolution of the method on its tuning parameter and network properties, using sparse and <b>dense</b> weighted <b>networks</b> with built-in modules as example cases. Finally, we apply the method to data on stock price correlations, and show that the resulting modules correspond well to known structural properties of this correlation network.

40|$|In {{device-to-device}} communications {{timing and}} carrier frequency synchronization {{is crucial for}} guaranteeing efficient communications within <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> A distributed synchronization method without any external reference agent is suitable for these <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> This paper presents hardware validation of a recently proposed distributed synchronization algorithm based on consensus paradigms. Identical synchronization frames are sent from all transmitting nodes, and the synchronization configuration is estimated from these superimposed waveforms. This method greatly simplifies the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing offset (TO) estimation procedure when implemented in hardware. A real-time algorithm is implemented on software defined radios (SDR), and is tested in various configurations to investigate the tracking and accuracy abilities of the algorithm. The hardware tests verified the algorithm as a suitable candidate for synchronization in <b>dense</b> <b>networks,</b> with accurate estimation of the timing and frequency offsets of the transmitting nodes. Its ability to decouple the estimations was also demonstrated with experiments. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R
25|$|The Railway Executive was {{conscious}} that some {{lines on the}} (then very <b>dense)</b> <b>network</b> were unprofitable and hard to justify socially, and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation. However, the general financial position of BR became gradually poorer, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955. The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred to the parent Commission. Other changes to the British Transport Commission {{at the same time}} included the return of road haulage to the private sector.|$|E
25|$|The {{glial scar}} also {{prevents}} neuronal regrowth. Following {{trauma to the}} CNS, axons begin to sprout and attempt to extend across the injury site in order to repair the damaged regions. However, the scar prevents axonal extensions via physical and chemical means. Astrocytes form a <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of gap junctions that generates a physical barrier to axonal regrowth. Further, the astrocytes secrete several growth-inhibitory molecules that chemically prevent axonal extensions. Moreover, the basal membrane component is expected to generate an additional physical and chemical barrier to axonal extensions.|$|E

The Swiss strategy sought to exact a high price from any direct ground attack on Swiss territory. Control of the Alpine crossings remained a cornerstone of the Swiss strategy of neutrality. The <b>dense</b> <b>network</b> of passive and active barriers and large and small fortifications allowed considerable flexibility in the disposition of Swiss forces, and represented an almost optimal scenario of defense in depth.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} source-initiated broadcast session {{traffic in}} an ad hoc wireless network operating under a hard constraint on the end-to-end delay between the source and any node in the network.

We characterize the optimal solution to a closely related problem in massively <b>dense</b> <b>networks</b> using a dynamic programming formulation. We prove that the optimal solution can be obtained by an algorithm of polynomial time complexity O(D^ 2). The solution to the dynamic program indicates that there is a single optimal policy applicable to all massively <b>dense</b> <b>networks.</b> Elaborating on the insights provided by the structure of the problem in massively <b>dense</b> <b>networks,</b> we design an algorithm for finding a solution to the delay constrained minimum power broadcasting problem in general networks.
