40|$|Battery {{electric}} vehicles (BEVs) represent a possible sustainable solution for personal urban transportation. Presently, the most limiting characteristic of BEVs is their short range, {{mainly because of}} battery technology limitations. A proper design {{and control of the}} drivetrain, aimed at reducing the power losses and thus increasing BEV range, can contribute to make the electrification of urban transportation a convenient choice. This paper presents a simulation-based comparison of the energy efficiency performance of six drivetrain architectures for BEVs. Although many different drivetrain and transmission architectures have been proposed for BEVs, no literature was found regarding BEVs equipped with <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (IVTs). The analyzed drivetrain configurations are: single- (1 G) and two-speed (2 G) gear drives, half toroidal (HT) and full toroidal (FT) continuously <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (CVTs), and <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (IVTs) with two different types of internal power flow (IVT-I and IVT-II). An off-line procedure for determining the most efficient control action for each drivetrain configuration is proposed, which allows selecting the optimal speed ratio for each operating condition. The energy consumption of the BEVs is simulated along the UDC (Urban Driving Cycle) and Japanese 10 - 15 driving cycle, with a backward facing approach. In order to achieve the lowest energy consumption, a trade-off between high transmission efficiency and flexibility in terms of allowed speed ratios is required...|$|R
50|$|The Tata Pixel {{is able to}} {{maneuver}} and park in tight spaces due to the zero turn toroidal traction-drive, <b>Infinitely</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmission</b> (IVT), and due to its steering system design. This results in a turning circle radius of 2.6 meters. The steering and the transmission work together so that each wheel is driven independently with inputs from the steering system. By applying reverse drive on a single rear wheel and forward drive on a single front wheel, the car is able to turn almost in its own length.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{manufacturer}} was unfamiliar with automobile technology, {{they were happy}} to incorporate into the design a form of the innovative <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> which {{a few years later}} became a defining feature of DAF cars. [...] Power came from a 125 cc two stroke engine installed at an angle of 7 degrees from the vertical {{in order to keep the}} flat front hood/bonnet low enough for the windscreen to be foldable forwards over it in the manner of a traditional Jeep. [...] The prototype's motor-cycle connections were apparent from the large spoked wheels which might not have survived on a production version of the car.|$|E
50|$|The fixed {{relationships}} of the elliptic cam ring {{are replaced by}} 4 curved surface (cupped) movable pistons located at the 4 sealing areas, at 12,3,6, and 9 o'clock like {{the face of a}} clock. The curvature of each piston rides on a 'hydrodynamic oil bearing' similar to hydroplaning tires in the wet and this virtually eliminates metal-to-metal contact and friction. The first Hydristor achieved almost 95% efficiency overall and the present designs are in the 97+% range. If the 4 pistons are positioned equidistant from the center of rotation, no oil is expressed or accepted by any of the kidney ports. This is called 'neutral'. For a clockwise rotation, if 3 and 9 pistons are moved inward with 6 and 12 moving outward, all moving an equal amount, then a device displacement in proportion to the piston movement is created. If the 6 and 12 pistons were moved in with 3 and 9 moving equally out, then all the oil flows reverse. Since the piston positions are infinitely variable, any possible displacement between zero and + or - maximum displacement can be created. If two such Hydristor units are packaged face-to-face with the 4 port kidney plate between them, an <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> is formed. This transmission can select any ratio in the forward direction and in the reverse direction without the need for any gears.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} that Continuously <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmissions</b> (CVT) and <b>Infinitely</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmissions</b> (IVT) can {{considerably}} improve the locomotion efficiency in legged robot. A CVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied and an IVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied from positive to negative values. However, efficient use of such transmissions in walking applications requires changing the transmission ratio at a minimal energy cost, even at rest, i. e. when the input shaft is not rotating. This contribution proposes a novel CVT and IVT principle which can achieve such ratio variations at rest. The presented CVT is a modified planetary gear, whose planets are conical and mounted on inclined shafts, and whose ring is made of contiguous diabolo-shaped rollers. This configuration enables {{the control of the}} transmission ratio by adjusting the point of contact between the cones and rollers that comprise the ring. A traditional planetary gear system can be added to the CVT to form an IVT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cobots are a {{class of}} robots that use <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> to develop high {{fidelity}} programmable constraint surfaces. Cobots consume very little electrical power even when resisting high forces, and their transmissions are highly power efficient across {{a broad range of}} transmission ratios. We have recently introduced the Cobotic Hand Controller, a haptic display that illustrates the high dynamic range and low power consumption achievable by cobots. In this paper we present models of the rotational-to-linear rolling contact transmissions utilized in the Cobotic Hand Controller. We com-pare their efficiency to fixed ratio gear-trains. We also compare the overall power efficiency of the cobotic architecture to the power efficiency of a conventional electro-mechanical actuation scheme, for both constant and dynamic power flows. The cobotic architecture is shown to be more efficient at frequencies and power levels characteristic of voluntary human motions. I...|$|R
5000|$|A {{subset of}} CVT designs are called <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmissions</b> (IVT or IVTs), {{in which the}} range of ratios of output shaft speed to input shaft speed {{includes}} a zero ratio that can be continuously approached from a defined [...] "higher" [...] ratio. A zero output speed (low gear) with a finite input speed implies an infinite input-to-output speed ratio, which can be continuously approached from a given finite input value with an IVT. Low gears are a reference to low ratios of output speed to input speed. This low ratio is taken to the extreme with IVTs, resulting in a [...] "neutral", or non-driving [...] "low" [...] gear limit, in which the output speed is zero. Unlike neutral in a normal automotive transmission, IVT output rotation may be prevented because the back-driving (reverse IVT operation) ratio may be infinite, resulting in impossibly high backdriving torque; in a ratcheting IVT, however, the output may freely rotate in the forward direction.|$|R
50|$|Fendt's <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> (IVT) {{differs from}} a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) as an IVT can be travelling at 0.0 km/h whilst the transmission is engaged and not in neutral. The IVT/CVT gearbox {{is widely regarded as}} the most fuel efficient gearbox on the agricultural market prompting nearly all other major manufacturers to develop their own system. Manufacturers such as ZF, John Deere and CNH group have also developed very intuitive systems but Fendt's Vario is broadly considered a market leader. Variations can be found on other AGCO tractor brands such Massey Ferguson. The gearbox may be the same however the individual brands have different controls/ joystick and may have different ECU software. The IVT transmissions are extremely popular in the European market and its fuel efficiency puts it in favour of mechanical competitors, however one weakness to the Vario is its power consumption, in comparison to a mechanical transmission, most IVT/CVT gearboxes can lose 10-20 hp in the transmission due to the hydraulic swing pump element of the transmission. The Fendt Vario offers 60 km/h travel speed on its 800 series and 900 series models, this same transmission can also be found in 4000 series JCB tractors. Claas also use the Vario transmission sold under its CMatic brand. Claas use their own control method however it is mechanically identical to that of a Massey Ferguson as Claas use Massey Ferguson transmissions/back end.|$|E

New equations were derived to analyze the frictional power loss of a rack and pinion gear mesh, something which has been missing in gear design literature to date.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the shift {{strategy}} of hydro-mechanical <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission.</b> A computer simulation is carried out to investigate the shift strategy, and the simulation results are verified by the test data. There are four typical working conditions in the continuous shift process, among which the shift process from F 2 (N) to F 3 (P) plays a decisive role in shift quality. The shift strategy based on the physical parameters from F 2 (N) to F 3 (P) is lower engine rotating speed, smaller load torque, lower main circuit pressure, and larger speed valve flow rate. The shift strategy based on the shift time from F 2 (N) to F 3 (P) is to switch the third group of clutches first, then disengage {{the first group of}} clutches, and engage the second group of clutches at last. The results show that the shift quality of hydro-mechanical <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> can be improved greatly by the optimization of physical parameters and shift time...|$|E

25|$|The Insight’s Continuously <b>Variable</b> <b>Transmission</b> (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|R
