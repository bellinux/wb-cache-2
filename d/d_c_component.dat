40|$|Abstract. For x large {{consider}} the electric field, E(t, x) and its temporal Fourier Transform, Ê(ω, x). The <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>component</b> Ê(0, x) {{is equal to}} the time integral of the electric field. Experimentally, one observes that the <b>D.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>component</b> is negligible compared to the field. In this paper we show that this is true in the far field for all solutions of Maxwell’s equations. It is not true for typical solutions of the scalar wave equation. The difference is {{explained by the fact that}} though each component of the field satisfies the scalar wave equation, the spatial integral of ∂tE(t, x) vanishes identically. For the scalar wave equation the spatial integral of ∂tu(t, x) need not vanish. This conserved quantity gives the leading contribution to the time integrated far field. We also give explit formulas for the far field behavior of the time integrals of the intensity...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model is proposed regarding the temperature rise estimation in components installed to electric power distribution networks (e. g. circuit breakers, automatic switches, disconnectors, fuse carriers), during short-circuit faults. The overall short-circuit current waveform and the components' mass and material are considered. The model was applied to a common disconnector of the network and characteristics of the results are plotted according to different forms of the asymmetric part of the short-circuit current waveform and the initial value of the short-circuit <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> current <b>component.</b> The models' response is also investigated {{for a wide range}} of values of the crossing resistance and the component mass. It is convincingly shown that the short-circuit current waveform asymmetric part and component mass significantly affect temperature rise, and calculations of temperature rise which omit the above factors are questionable. An easy to use approximating equation is proposed, which could be considered in the mathematical approach of the phenomenon, according to international standards and facilitate the above <b>components</b> design.

This corona-induced vibration of a transmission-line conductor has become more serious problem owing {{to the rise of}} transmission voltage. The {{purpose of this study is}} to make the mechanism of corona-induced vibration clear. In this experiment, vibration waveform and corona current waveform were recorded. Moreover, photographs of a water drop were taken. By means of those waveforms, a peak value of corona current, vibration amplitude, outbreak frequency of corona current pulse and a phase lag angle between corona current and vibration were measured. The main results are summarized as follows; (1) The occurrence of corona current pulses causes vibration. (2) Corona current pulses are synchronized with vibration. This synchronization promotes vibration. (3) There is a phase lag angle, γ, between corona current and vibration. When γ is near π/ 2,vibration amplitude grows radically with increasing field intensity. Meanwhile, when γ is allowed to come near π by too much field intensity, vibration falls off.

40|$|Reflected light {{microscopy}} of biological material {{has been a}} very difficult task and many different but hardly successful {{attempts have been made to}} get usable images. The main reasons for this state are: weak reflections from the biologically important structures in the object as against strong reflection at its surface; reflections at optical surfaces in the microscope which cause a deterioration of contrast; and the mixing together of reflections from many levels in the object so that the signal coming from the focussed-on level is lost in noise and <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>components.</b> We tried, and successfully, to reverse this situation and to make it possible for the signal to overwhelm spurious and scattered light using double, or, as we call it, tandem scanning. The object is illuminated only in small patches lying in one plane and moving across this plane and only the light reflected from these illuminated patches is allowed to pass into the image plane and participate in image formation. The image consists of points which travel over the image plane and which are geometrical images of the illuminated patches in the focussed-on object plane. To ensure that only the light belonging to these geometrical images be allowed to enter the image, the image plane is covered with an opaque diaphragm having holes in locations exactly corresponding to the locations of the geometrical images of the illuminated object points; this diaphragm travels in concordance with the first scanning and so the complete image of the focussed-on object plane is formed successively. Both scans are performed by a single device, a Nip-kow disc carrying in its annular periphery several ten thousands of holes arranged in Archimedean spirals. The disc is 100 mm in diameter and rotates about 100 rpm driven by an electric motor. On one side the disc is illuminated in a circle 18 mm in diameter, and the light transmitted through several hundred holes and reflected in a mirror system passes a microscope objective which forms the images of the disc holes in the object plane. The light reflected here passes through the same objective and mirror system (one mirror being a 'limitlessly thin* beam splitter) to pass conjugate aperture holes on the observation side of the Nipkow disc. As the disc lies at the intermediate image plane of the objective lens on both its illuminating and observation sides, only light emanating from reflection or fluorescence in the plane of focus can contribute to the image. High contrast images of very thin focussed-on layers are thus formed. The practical arrangements are such that very large specimens can be examined: the specimens for this microscope need not themselves be microscopic...|$|R

At low sound pressure levels, the decrease in receptor potentials caused by c. o. c. b. stimulation was equivalent to decreasing the sound intensity by 9 - 24 dB. C. o. c. b. stimulation usually had a similar effect on the compound action potential of the auditory nerve. The change in inner hair cell membrane resistance during moderate-level sound was measured for sound alone and when sound was accompanied by c. o. c. b. stimulation. Sound alone produced a greater membrane resistance change than sound with c. o. c. b. stimulation, in proportion to the <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> receptor potential during the same conditions. The time course of the c. o. c. b. effect was slow, with 50 - 250 ms required for a full effect and for recovery. The effects of varying the frequency and voltage of electrical stimulation were similar for the <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> receptor potential and for the compound action potential. For sounds of high level and for frequencies well below the characteristic frequency, c. o. c. b. stimulation was less effective in reducing receptor potentials. Frequency tuning curves for the <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> receptor potential taken during intervals of continuous c. o. c. b. stimulation showed decreases in sensitivity primarily in the tip segment of the tuning curve. When no sound stimulus was present, the resting membrane potential was relatively unaltered during c. o. c. b. stimulation. The resting membrane resistance did not change during c. o. c. b. stimulation. Since the c. o. c. b. innervates mainly the outer hair cells, these results strongly suggest that changes in outer hair cell activity can influence the receptor potentials of inner hair cells and thus alter the transmission of acoustic responses to the central nervous system...|$|R

40|$|Intracellular {{receptor}} potentials {{were recorded}} from {{inner and outer}} hair cells in response to low-frequency tones, from the basal, high-frequency region of the guinea-pig cochlea. The receptor potentials recorded from inner hair cells are asymmetrical about the resting membrane potential with the depolarizing phase, which corresponds to rarefaction in sound pressure, exceeding the phase of hyperpolarization {{by a factor of}} about 3. It was found that the relationship between the peak-to-peak voltage responses and sound pressure level could be described by rectangular hyperbolae. When the frequency of the sound stimulus was progressively increased from 100 Hz to 4 kHz, the 'periodic' (a. c.) component of the receptor potential was attenuated with respect to the 'continuous' (<b>d.</b> <b>c.)</b> <b>component.</b> The characteristics of the inner hair cells could be described by two stages of low-pass filtering, with one of the filters having the same corner frequency as the electrical time constants which varied in different cells between 178 and 840 Hz. Receptor potentials recorded intracellularly from two morphologically identified outer hair cells were symmetrical about the resting membrane potential (about - 65 - 70 mV) and had a maximal amplitude of only 5 mV at frequencies and intensities which yield 20 - 30 mV voltage responses from inner hair cells. No <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>component</b> receptor potentials were recorded in response to high-frequency tones. Phase and amplitude measurements were made from receptor potentials from inner hair cells, and from 'cochlear microphonic potentials' which were recorded from the organ of Corti and scala tympani. The phase of depolarization in both potentials was associated with displacement of the basilar membrane towards the scala vestibuli. The phase of the intracellular receptor potentials leads the cochlear microphonic by about 90 degrees and the sound pressure by about 180 degrees at frequencies below 100 Hz. Above this frequency the phase lead progressively declines and at higher frequencies becomes a phase lag. These phase relationships indicate that inner hair cells respond to the velocity of the basilar membrane at frequencies below 200 - 600 Hz, and to its displacement above this, and that the voltage responses of the inner hair cells are limited by their membrane time constants. It is suggested that outer hair cells respond to basilar membrane displacement throughout their frequency range. It is shown that, with respect to frequency, the different growth rates of the cochlear microphonic potentials and inner hair cell receptor potentials, and the dominance of cochlear microphonic potentials in the organ of Corti, result in an effective electrical interaction between inner hair cells and cochlear microphonic potentials...|$|E

On each nonreflexive Banach space X {{there exists}} a {{positive}} continuous convex function f such that 1 /f is not a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function (i. e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive {{if and only if}} each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee’s result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals. A function on a Banach space X is called a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function if it can be represented as a difference of two continuous convex functions (all functions considered in this note are realvalued). Thus the system of all <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on X is the smallest vector space containing all continuous convex functions. Moreover, it is well-known, and not difficult to show, that it is even an algebra and a lattice (see, e. g., [2, III. 2]). While an everywhere defined quotient g/f of two <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on a finite-dimensional Banach space is always <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> (cf. [1, Corollary]), the situation is completely different for infinite-dimensional spaces: by [7, Corollary 5. 7], on each infinite-dimensional Banach space {{there exists a}} positive <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function such that 1 /f is not <b>d.</b> <b>c...</b>|$|R

In chapters 2 and 3, we study the relationship between the isolation phenomenon and the jump operator. We prove in chapter 2 that there is a high <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> e. degree <b>d</b> isolated by a low 2 degree a. We improve this result in chapter 3 by showing that the isolating degree a can be low. Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted {{to the study of the}} pseudo-isolation in the <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> e. degrees. We prove that pseudo-isolated <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> e. degrees are dense in the c. e. degrees, and that there is a high <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> e. degree pseudo-isolated by a low <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> e. degree...|$|R
