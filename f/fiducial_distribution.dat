50|$|Concerning the {{identification}} of the parameters of a distribution law, the mature reader may recall lengthy disputes in the mid 20th century about the interpretation of their variability in terms of <b>fiducial</b> <b>distribution</b> , structural probabilities , priors/posteriors , and so on. From an epistemology viewpoint, this entailed a companion dispute as to the nature of probability: is it a physical feature of phenomena to be described through random variables or a way of synthesizing data about a phenomenon? Opting for the latter, Fisher defines a <b>fiducial</b> <b>distribution</b> law of parameters of a given random variable that he deduces from a sample of its specifications. With this law he computes, for instance “the probability that μ (mean of a Gaussian variable - our note) is less than any assigned value, or the probability that it lies between any assigned values, or, in short, its probability distribution, {{in the light of the}} sample observed”.|$|E
50|$|A {{fiducial}} interval {{could be}} taken {{to be just a}} different name for a confidence interval and give it the fiducial interpretation. But the definition might not then be unique.

40|$|We formalize {{the idea}} of {{probability}} distributions that lead to reliable predictions about some, but not all aspects of a domain. The resulting notion of `safety' provides a fresh perspective on foundational issues in statistics, providing a middle ground between imprecise probability and multiple-prior models {{on the one hand}} and strictly Bayesian approaches on the other. It also allows us to formalize <b>fiducial</b> <b>distributions</b> in terms of the set of random variables that they can safely predict, thus taking some of the sting out of the fiducial idea. By restricting probabilistic inference to safe uses, one also automatically avoids paradoxes such as the Monty Hall problem.

5000|$|In {{statistical}} inference, {{the concept}} of a confidence distribution (CD) has often been loosely referred to as a distribution function on the parameter space that can represent confidence intervals of all levels for a parameter of interest. Historically, it has typically been constructed by inverting the upper limits of lower sided confidence intervals of all levels, and it was also commonly associated with a fiducial interpretation (<b>fiducial</b> <b>distribution),</b> although it is a purely frequentist concept.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to constructing confidence sets for the timing of structural breaks. This approach involves simulating marginal “fiducial” distributions of break dates from the likelihood function through Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods. We compare our proposed approach to asymptotic and bootstrap confidence sets and find that it performs best in terms of producing short confidence sets with accurate coverage rates. Our approach also has the advantages of i) being broadly applicable to different patterns of structural breaks, ii) being computationally efficient, and iii) requiring only the ability to evaluate the likelihood function over parameter values, thus allowing for many possible distributional assumptions for the data. In our application, we investigate the nature and timing of structural breaks in postwar U. S. Real GDP.

By substituting the fiducial EDF for the classical EDF in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramér-von Mises statistics and so forth, randomized statistics are derived, of which the qth quantile and the expectation are chosen as test statistics.

50|$|A simple {{example of}} a {{confidence}} distribution, that has been broadly used in statistical practice, is a bootstrap distribution. The development and interpretation of a bootstrap distribution does not involve any fiducial reasoning; {{the same is true}} for the concept of a confidence distribution. But the notion of confidence distribution is much broader than that of a bootstrap distribution. In particular, recent research suggests that it encompasses and unifies a wide range of examples, from regular parametric cases (including most examples of the classical development of Fisher's <b>fiducial</b> <b>distribution)</b> to bootstrap distributions, p-value functions, normalized likelihood functions and, in some cases, Bayesian priors and Bayesian posteriors.|$|E

The proposed solution is to transform Bayesian and frequentist p values for model assessment into a <b>fiducial</b> <b>distribution</b> across the models.

40|$|Assessments of the {{relevance}} of the kinds of attributes regulated by classifiers, evaluation of parameters of individual reliability, of parameters of reliability of multivariate data clusters relate to the primary problems the decision of which would make it possible to reduce operational expenses of electric power system objects. The lack of specialized software systems, the knowledge-intensiveness of algorithms of calculation needed for the solution of operational tasks determine the predominant application of the intuitive approach. Some factors, such as lack of operating experience and subjectivity of the intuitive approach lead to the essential risk of making the incorrect decision. The article presents analytical methods that make it possible to consider the expediency of classification of multivariate statistical data, to identify the relevant types of signs, to rank the objects in power systems and to form clusters of homogeneous data. The methods function with the aid of calculations of indicators of reliability. The originality of methods consists in application of an fiducial approach. Experimental data are compared to boundary values of a fiducial interval. Statistical functions of <b>fiducial</b> <b>distributions</b> are obtained by imitating modeling of samples of random variables for a series of numbers of random variables samples.

In this paper we evaluate technetium- 99 m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime to magnetic resonance (MR) co-registration for five fully automatic methods. We attached six small fiducial markers, visible in both SPET and MR, to the skin of 13 subjects. No increase in the radius of SPET acquisition was necessary. Distortion of the <b>fiducial</b> marker <b>distribution</b> observed in the SPET and MR studies was characterised by a measure independent of registration and three subjects were excluded on the basis of excessive distortion. The location of each fiducial marker was determined in each modality to sub-pixel precision and the inter-modality distance was averaged over all markers to give a fiducial registration error (FRE). The component of FRE excluding the variability inherent in the validation method was estimated by computing the error transformation between the arrays of MR marker locations and registered SPET marker locations. When applied to the fiducial marker locations this yielded the surface registration error (SRE), and when applied to a representative set of locations within the brain it yielded the intrinsic registration error (IRE). For the best method, mean IRE was 1. 2 mm, SRE 1. 5 mm and FRE 2. 4 mm (with corresponding maxima of 3. 3, 4. 3 and 5. 0 mm). All methods yielded a mean IRE < 3 mm. The accuracy of the most accurate fully automatic SPET to MR co-registration was comparable with that published for PET to MR. With high standards of calibration and instrumentation, intra-subject cerebral SPET to MR registration accuracy of < 2 mm is attainable.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the three-point correlation function (3 PCF) in the squeezed limit by considering galaxy pairs as discrete objects and cross-correlating {{them with the}} galaxy field. We develop an efficient algorithm using Fast Fourier Transforms to compute such cross-correlations and their associated pair-galaxy bias bpg and the squeezed 3 PCF coefficient Qeff. We implement our method using N-body cosmological simulations and a <b>fiducial</b> Halo Occupation <b>Distribution</b> (HOD) and present the results in both the real space and redshift space. In real space, we observe a peak in bpg and Qeff at pair separation of ~ 2 Mpc, attributed {{to the fact that}} galaxy pairs at 2 Mpc separation trace the most massive dark matter halos. We also see strong anisotropy in the bpg and Qeff signals that track the large-scale filamentary structure. In redshift space, both the 2 Mpc peak and the anisotropy are significantly smeared out along the line-of-sight due to Finger-of-God effect. In both the real space and redshift space, the squeezed 3 PCF shows a factor of 2 variation, contradicting the hierarchical ansatz but offering rich information on the galaxy-halo connection. Thus, we explore the possibility of using the squeezed 3 PCF to constrain the HOD. When we compare two simple HOD models that are closely matched in their projected two-point correlation function (2 PCF), we do not yet see a strong variation in the 3 PCF that is clearly disentangled from variations in the projected 2 PCF. Nevertheless, we propose that more complicated HOD models, e. g. those incorporating assembly bias, can break degeneracies in the 2 PCF and show a distinguishable squeezed 3 PCF signal.

We find that the resulting <b>fiducial</b> <b>distribution</b> gives rise to surprisingly good statistical procedures applicable to both one sample and two sample problems.

The proposed fiducial based confidence intervals maintain coverage in situations where asymptotic methods often have substantial coverage problems. Furthermore, the average length of the proposed confidence intervals is often shorter than the length of competing methods that maintain coverage.
