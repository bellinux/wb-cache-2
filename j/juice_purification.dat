40|$|Cane sugar juice purijication is the {{beginning}} ofproduction process in sugar Industry. The aim on this investigation is to remove the amount of TSS of cane sugar juice. fiis research uses Utrafiltration process in separating the TSS in cane sugar juice. One of the main factor tha limit the Ultrafiltration process at various application is fouling on membrane. Fouling on membrane itself is commonly indicated which happen at cane sugar <b>juice</b> <b>purification</b> process with various operation process is counted. Drastic reduction o f a w e s happen at the early minutes of operation (minutes 10 - 60), which is followed by constant flwces amount. This happens because the pores of the membrane which was empty at the begining become closed with filtrated TSS...|$|E
40|$|The chromatographic {{separation}} of sugar from raw juice {{was identified as}} a promising alternative for the current <b>juice</b> <b>purification.</b> Simulated moving bed technology (SMB) was chosen as the most suitable technology {{on the basis of the}} purification, limited degree of dilution and increased sugar yield. An adsorbent was selected which binds sucrose selectively compared to glucose, glutamine and betaine. The binding mechanism on a molecular scale (CH-π interaction) is weak enough to allow for a sensible desorption strategy. An SMB process model was used to evaluate the performance of the adsorbents. Experiments on the laboratory scale were done using micro-filtration and reverse osmosis. SMB experiments were carried out on pilot scale using the selected adsorbent. A temperature swing resulted in a concentration step during adsorption/desorption. This lowers the energy costs for water evaporation prior to the crystallization process. The process is economically feasible when all identified savings are realized. Important issues are the reduction of sugar losses in the total process, a higher sucrose yield in crystallization as a result of a higher purity, and limited operational costs due to prevention of dilution...|$|E
40|$|<b>Juice</b> <b>purification</b> using lime is a {{standard}} established practice in the sugar industry allover the world. In order to remove impurities from juice, the juice is treated mechanically, thermally and chemically. The main compound for chemical treatment is CaO in Association with flocculants (polymers), which precipitate the soluble salts and colloids in the juice as insoluble ones. In Sudan lime is imported {{to meet the demand}} of the growing sugar industry. So, {{the purpose of this study}} could be summarized in the following: 1) To assess the suitability of local lime for juice clarification. 2) To determine the effectiveness of the local lime mixed with polymers (PDADMAC, PAC) for juice clarification. 3) To identify and assess the factors affecting juice clarification. 4) To determine the optimum concentrations and conditions for juice clarification. In order to achieve the above objectives Elgunied Sugar Factory has been chosen to represent the sugar factories in Sudan. After comprehensive comparative study and laboratory research, it was found that the local lime is suitable for clarification process with and without polymers economically and practically. Since the removed turbidity reached 93. 5 %, the removed colour reached 2. 7 % when only the local lime is used in juice clarification, comparatively the imported lime removed 92. 3 % of the turbidity and 16. 4 % of the colour...|$|E
30|$|Sugarcane pressmud is {{the solid}} residue {{produced}} after filtration of sugarcane <b>juice.</b> The <b>purification</b> process separates the juice into a clear juice that {{rises to the}} top and goes for manufacture of sugar, and a mud that collects at the bottom (Gaikwad et al. 1996; Bokhtiar et al. 2001; Sharma et al. 2002). The mud is then filtered to separate the suspended matter, which includes insoluble salts and fine bagasse (Partha and Sivasubramanian 2006; Jamil et al. 2008). The yield of filter cake or pressmud is changeable, from 1 to 7  kg (wet basis) per 100  kg of sugarcane (Singh et al. 2005). With a conventional yield of 2  % and a total manufacture of 1700 million tons in 2009, the world production of fresh filter pressmud can be estimated to be about 30 million tons (Tompe and More 1996 a, b; Yaduvanshi and Swarup 2005).|$|R
40|$|Beet-sugar factory - is a large, well-equipped {{with modern}} technology, {{the company that}} {{operates}} in a continuous circuit. In the technological structure of a sugar factory there are three production divisions: beet processing department, <b>juice</b> <b>purification</b> house and grocery department. In the grocery department of a sugar factory dangerous and harmful factors may encounter while using equipment such as vacuum devices, centrifuges, and crystallizer tank, massecuite distributor, driers and classifiers sugar. The working area of the service of machinery may appear dangerous or harmful factors, which are divided into the following groups: physical, chemical, biological and physiological. To maintain microclimate parameters can be applied general ventilation, in which {{the replacement of the}} warm air to the cold going around the room volume. Heating in the grocery department in the production season is not carried out, since it is sufficient to heat generated by the equipment. In the grocery department uses natural and artificial lighting. In the sugar factory used the following measures to protect against vibration: perform detailed assembly, eliminate defects and looseness of individual parts; way to isolate the transmission of vibrations from the machine to the foundation apply vibration isolators. Widespread use of electrical installations in a sugar factory creates the risk of electric shock to persons. Causes of electrical shocks are often disadvantages of construction and installation of the equipment, its operation is wrong. During drying and transportation of sugar produced by static electricity. To remove the static electricity equipment grounded; also used the increase in humidity; air ionization. To reduce the consumption of fresh industrial water from reservoirs provides for the establishment of the system of working circuits cleaning and maximum reuse of industrial water. Thus, safety and environmental compliance in the grocery department of the sugar beet plant depends on many factors, and needs careful monitoring of these processes...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} {{reducing}} substances {{in the final}} stage of lime - carbon dioxide purification of raw juice is studied in the article. The presence of significant amounts of reducing substances in the juice of the I saturation increases chroma and calcium salts in the purified product. It is actual to apply additional techniques and methods of cleaning of production sugar-containing solutions at {{the final stage of}} lime -carbon dioxide cleaning - II saturation, that will increase the completeness of precipitation of organic and mineral non-sugars, improve the quality of the purified juice, increase the yield of white sugar and improve its quality. The effect filtroperlit as seed material for forming the structure of particles of calcium carbonate precipitate with a larger surface adsorption is studied. The effect of phosphate input for further improvement of the efficiency of adsorption in the <b>juice</b> <b>purification</b> process was also studied. The effect of flow of activated filtroperlit on II saturation filtration speed was studied. It was found out that the more non-sugars are present in the juice, the smaller electrokinetic potential has the surface sediment. Rational consumption of reagents depending {{on the quality of the}} feedstock is calculated. In the process of cleaning the juice of various technological quality, it is necessary to control the reagents flow. It was found out that for cleaning juice of satisfactory technological quality the flow of filtroperlit is 0. 015 - 0. 033 % by weight of juice and 15 % РО 4 3 -. When cleaning the juice obtained from sugar beet of poor quality, it is necessary to increase the filtroperlit flow up to 0. 050 % and phosphate up to 20 %. It is necessary to control permanently the main liming process, the maximum decomposition of reducing substances to obtain thermally stable juice...|$|E
