25|$|Each {{year about}} 8mm of {{precipitation}} (liquid equivalent) {{falls on the}} ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, mostly as snow, which accumulates and over time forms glacial ice. Much of this precipitation began as water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. To a first approximation, {{the same amount of}} water appeared to return to the ocean in icebergs and from ice melting at the edges. Scientists previously had estimated which is greater, ice going in or coming out, called the mass balance, important because a nonzero balance causes changes in global sea level. High-precision gravimetry from satellites determined that Greenland was losing more than 200 billion tons of ice per year, in accord with loss estimates from ground measurement.

25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the austral summer of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable echo sounder, the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of Foehn winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface surveys revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of <b>ice</b> <b>loss</b> suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium.

We reduce the effects of orbit errors by removing long-wavelength deformation signals using conventional InSAR baseline fitting methods.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} that drive the mass imbalance of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) {{is critical to}} the accurate projection of its contribution to future sea level rise. Greenland's <b>ice</b> mass <b>loss</b> has been accelerating recently. Using satellite Earth-gravity and regional climate model data, we show that the acceleration rate of Greenland <b>ice</b> mass <b>loss</b> from 2003 to 2012 is - 13. 9 +/- 2. 0 Gt/yr(2), which results mainly from an increase of meltwater runoff (- 6. 3 +/- 1. 1 Gt/yr(2)) and a decrease of precipitation (- 4. 8 +/- 1. 1 Gt/yr(2)). Before the extreme surface melting in the summers of 2010 and 2012, the decrease of precipitation (- 9. 7 +/- 2. 5 Gt/yr(2)) was a larger contributor to the <b>ice</b> mass <b>loss</b> acceleration than the increase of runoff (- 2. 1 +/- 2. 2 Gt/yr(2)). Furthermore, we show that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is linked to the precipitation decrease during summer, and its recent influence to Greenland is anomalously large possibly due to the change in atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic. These results indicate that inter-annual climate variability is playing {{a significant role in the}} recently observed Greenland <b>ice</b> mass <b>loss</b> acceleration, underscoring the difficulty of projecting future sea level rise based on the recent observations of GrIS mass loss.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage by {{southern}} polar benthos is potentially the largest negative feedback on climate change. Most feedbacks on {{global climate change}} are positive; they exacerbate physical change. The few known strong negative feedbacks, those which reduce physical change, are polar, and include i) broadening existing sinks with sea-ice losses over polar continental shelves, ii) subarctic vegetation growth increases and iii) formation of new sinks where ice shelves collapse. To date, carbon sequestration gains have been recorded around the Antarctic coastal shallows where {{they are likely to}} be offset by fjordic losses associated with sedimentation, and open coast losses through increased iceberg scouring. These feedbacks are complicated by additional positive forcing associated with greater heat absorption from albedo change. In contrast there is no albedo change (negligible sea <b>ice</b> <b>losses)</b> over sub-Antarctic shelves, where rising sea temperatures are likely to increase carbon storage by animals. The continental shelves along polar continent margins and archipelagos are wide, deep and rich in life. Most species known from polar waters live on these shallower shelf regions and it has been observed that they play an increasingly important role in the carbon cycle. Carbon is transported through the system by being fixed in photosynthesis by algae, which are eaten by benthic invertebrates, and then buried when the animal dies. We aim to measure how much carbon is held per unit area of the seabed per year and how this varies in time and space. Teasing apart biological processes in these important geographic regions is vital to our understanding of global carbon capture. One of the biggest sources of error in this regard is understanding the extent to which these feedbacks are effects of climate forcing on sub-Antarctic and Arctic shelf benthos performance. This type of carbon sequestration, termed blue carbon (associated with natural processes), is likely to increase, so long as sea ice and <b>ice</b> shelf <b>losses</b> continue to be sustained. Our research project, titled Antarctic Seabed Carbon Capture Change (ASCCC) has participated in the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) in 2016 and 2017 to address the question ‘How will regional warming influence how much carbon is captured and stored by life on the seabed around Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic?’, from which we plan to estimate increased benthic carbon stored across the southern polar region due to recent <b>ice</b> shelf <b>losses,</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>losses</b> and temperature increases...|$|R
