The temperatures inside the poultry houses were 26 °C (closed), 29 °C (open-sided), 32 °C (closed) and 37 °C (open-sided) for cool and hot seasons, respectively. One-day-old chicks (432 birds) were housed in each closed and open-sided environment for each season. Birds were maintained under 23 hrs light and 1 hr dark cycle and offered ad libitum access water and feed. Broilers in both houses were randomly subjected to four drinking water treatments (9 birds in each 6 replicates/treatment) : 0, 100, 200 and <b>300</b> ppm <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> Feed intake, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio and rectal temperatures were recorded weekly. <b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation at 200 - 300 ppm {{was associated with a}} reduction in rectal temperatures during the hot season. Open-sided house depressed body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (P < 0. 05) during hot season. Compared to the control group, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> improved feed intake, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio by 6 %, 9 % and 3 % (cool season) and 8 %, 11 % and 5 % (hot season).

40|$|Benzene is an {{environmental}} pollutant which consumers mainly ingest via respiratory air. It can also occur as contamination {{in drinking water}} and foods. Benzene is principally emitted from petrol through exhaust gases. The substance is carcinogenic and damages germ cells.

Like all carcinogenic substances for which no toxicological threshold value can be indicated, benzene intake should be minimised and/or avoided as far as possible in line with preventive consumer protection. There is a suspicion that small amounts of benzene may be formed from benzoic acid in non-alcoholic beverages in the presence of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> Benzoic <b>acid</b> and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> are food additives which must be declared on the food.

The research question was: “Is there a significant mean difference between the <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated orange juices?” It is hypothesized that there should be a significant mean difference between the <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated orange juices since the microfluidization and ultrasonication dilute and shear the orange juice by removing and breaking down its particles which may reduce the <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> content. A common titration technique was used to calculate the <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in the orange juices. With the help of the reagents indophenol (blue colored indicator), metaphosphoric <b>acid</b> and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> standard values of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> was collected to use in the formula which is used to determine the <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in the orange juice. By the use of indophenol in the titration, the color of the orange juice solution will turn into pink as the indophenol nullifies the <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> content in the orange juice solution. The volume of indophenol solution will be recorded in order to use in the formula which is to find the amount of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in the orange juice. Moreover, the blank trial and standardization data are recorded to be used in the same formula. The Anova results, P-value and graphical investigation accept the alternate hypothesis which suggests there should be a difference between average <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations of processed and unprocessed juices. The average concentration of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in the fresh orange juice was 4. 82 g/lt, the concentration of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in the microfluidized orange juice was 4. 10 g/lt and the concentration of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in the ultrasonicated orange juice was 3. 00 g/lt. As a result, the experiment results and the Anova test showed that there was a significant mean difference between the concentrations of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated orange juices...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to determine the value of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in overcoming the poor eggshell quality problem {{associated with the use}} of saline drinking water. Laying hens were supplied with either town water or town water supplemented with NaCl, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> or a combination of NaCl and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> Supplementing the drinking water of laying hens with NaCl (2 g/L) significantly increased the incidence of eggshell defects and significantly decreased eggshell quality. Simultaneous supplementation of the saline drinking water with <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (1 g/L) prevented these detrimental effects. This response to <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> was dependent upon concentration. <b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> acted as a preventive rather than a remedial treatment: hens producing eggs with defective shells as a result of receiving saline drinking water failed to show any improvement in eggshell quality or any reduction in the incidence of eggshell defects when the saline water was supplemented with <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> (Key words: drinking water, sodium chloride, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> shell defects, shell quality...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{was focused}} on the effect of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> on sensory and {{analytical}} parameters of white wine during production technology.

40|$|<b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to extend replicative life span of human embryonic fibroblast (HEF). Since the detailed molecular mechanism of this phenomenon has not been investigated, we attempted to elucidate. Continuous treatment of HEF cells with <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (at 200 µM) from 40 population doubling (PD) increased maximum PD numbers by 18 % and lowered SA-β-gal positive staining, an aging marker, by 2. 3 folds, indicating that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> extends replicative life span of HEF cells. <b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment lowered DCFH by about 7 folds and Rho 123 by about 70 %, suggesting that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> dramatically decreased ROS formation. <b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> also increased aconitase activity, a marker of mitochondrial aging, by 41 %, indicating that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment restores age-related decline of mitochondrial function. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry revealed that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment decreased G 1 population up to 12 %. Further western blot analysis showed that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment decreased levels of p 53, phospho-p 53 at ser 15, and p 21, indicating that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> relieved senescence-related G 1 arrest. Analysis of AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites showed that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment decreased AP site formation by 35 %. We also tested the effect of hydrogen peroxide treatment, as an additional oxidative stress. Continuous treatment of 20 µM of hydrogen peroxide from PD 40 of HEF cells resulted in premature senescence due to increased ROS level, and increased AP sites. Taken together, the results suggest that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> extends replicative life span of HEF cells by reducing mitochondrial and DNA damages through lowering cellular ROS...|$|R

The platelets of patients with uraemia, leukaemia, and megaloblastic anaemia had a lower than normal platelet <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> content. In uraemia and megaloblastic anaemia the plasma <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration was normal suggesting that a platelet defect {{may be responsible for}} the low platelet <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> content.

50|$|<b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is found}} in plants and animals where it is {{produced}} from glucose. Animals must either produce it or digest it, otherwise a lack of vitamin C may cause scurvy, which may eventually lead to death. Reptiles and older orders of birds make <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in their kidneys. Recent orders of birds and most mammals make <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in their liver where the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase is required to convert glucose to <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> Humans, other higher primates, guinea pigs and most bats require dietary <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> because the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase catalysing the last step in the biosynthesis is highly mutated and non-functional, therefore, unable to make <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> Synthesis and signalling properties are still under investigation.|$|R
40|$|Neutralised <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is found}} to exert a strong {{bactericidal}} action on Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspended in isotonic phosphate buffer at pH 7. 1. Both the bactericidal and bacteriostatic action of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> are antagonised by magnesium ions. In the absence of complex formation between magnesium and <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> it is concluded that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> acts by competing with the magnesium binding sites in the cell wall, cell membrane or ribosomes. Using the chequer-board titration method the synergistic action of <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> and erythromycin is determined; such a potentiation of erythromycin is also adversely affected by magnesium ions. P. aeruginosa cells, washed and suspended in isotonic phosphate buffer containing <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> became increasingly susceptible to the action of polymyxin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, neomycin and tetracycline. It is suggested that <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> alters the cell surface to render it increasingly permeable to these antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{effect of}} <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> on {{neutrophil}} functions was investigated. The chemiluminescence of isolated neutrophils, stimulated with N-fonnyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylal-anine, latex, lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli, zymosan A, or 4 -phorbol 12 -myristate 13 a-acetate was inhibited up to 99 % by the dose-dependent oxygen radical scavenging activity of 6 mmol/ 1 <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> The chemiluminescence of neutrophils in blood, stimulated with 4 -phorbol 12 -myristate 13 a-acetate, or with zymosan A was inhibited 35 % or 48 %, respectively, by 6 mmol/ 1 <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Ascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> up to 6 mmol/ 1, did not inhibit the release of-N-acetylglucosaminidase and elastase from isolated neutrophils activated by the above stimulatory agents. During neutrophil/nylon fibre interaction <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> reduced the oxygen radical production dose-depend-ently (77 % inhibition of the chemiluminescence response at 6 mmol/ 1 <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid),</b> whereas the adherence was unaffected. Hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase-generated oxygen radicals were scavenged by <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in a dose-dependent manner (99 % inhibition of the chemiluminescence response at 100 μιηοΐ/ΐ <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid).</b> From these results, <b>ascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> can highly be recommended for animal experiments and clinical studies {{in patients with}} trauma, shock and sepsis and for studies to prevent or reduce reperfusion injuries...|$|R
