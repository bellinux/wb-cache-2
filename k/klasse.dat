25|$|Feyenoord {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} clubs in the Netherlands, winning 15 Eredivisie titles, 12 KNVB Cups, and 3 Johan Cruyff Shields. Internationally, it has won one European Cup, two UEFA Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup. The club has played continuously in the top tier of the Dutch football system since gaining promotion to Eerste <b>Klasse</b> (the Eredivisie's forerunner competition) in 1921, more times than any other club in the country, including the likes of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s, Ajax was {{a strong}} {{regional}} power, winning the Eerste <b>Klasse</b> West division in 1921, 1927 and 1928, but could not maintain its success at national level. This changed in the 1930s, with the club winning five national championships (1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1939), making it the most successful Dutch team of the decade. Ajax won its second KNVB Cup in 1942–43, and an eighth Dutch title in 1946–47, the last season the club was managed by Englishman Jack Reynolds, who, up to this point, had overseen all of its national championship successes {{as well as its}} 1917 KNVB Cup win.|$|E
25|$|Ajax {{originally}} {{played in}} an all-black uniform {{with a red}} sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the flag of Amsterdam. When under manager Jack Kirwan, however, the club earned promotion to the top flight of Dutch football {{for the first time}} in 1911 (then the Eerste <b>Klasse</b> or 'First Class', later named the Eredivisie), Ajax were forced to change their colours because Sparta Rotterdam already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.|$|E
25|$|The {{football}} club Wilhelmina {{was founded in}} the pub De Vereeniging (pub owner was Jac. Keizer) on 19 July 1908 and played in blue-sleeved red shirts and white shorts. The club {{changed its name to}} Hillesluise Football Club in 1909 and joined the Rotterdamse Voetbalbond (Rotterdam Football Association). As the league already included a team known as HFC (present-day Koninklijke HFC, based in Haarlem) Hillesluise underwent another name change to become RVV Celeritas. The renamed club took new colours, playing in yellow and black striped shirts and white shorts. Celeritas earned promotion to the National football association in 1912, leading to another name change as another, different Celeritas already played there. The team then took the name SC Feijenoord, after the city district in which the team was founded and again changed uniform; the club adopted the red and white shirts, black shorts and black socks they still wear today. In 1917 Feijenoord were promoted to the 1e <b>klasse</b> (1st division) and moved to the ground Kromme Zandweg.|$|E
25|$|To {{serve the}} need for {{activities}} with Philips employees, the company founded its own football team in 1910: the Philips Elftal. Its ground was the Philips Sportpark, located on the same location as the present day stadium. Financial turmoil and worker strikes led to a quick demise of the team and in 1913, its successor emerged, Philips Sport Vereniging, founded on 31 August. It was the day that Philips organized celebrations and sports competitions {{in light of the}} centennial defeat of the French in the Napoleonic Wars. It was not until 1916, however, that the football department switched its name from Philips Elftal to PSV. Because of World War I, the first possibility to enter a league was in the 1915–16 season. The club's first ever match was a 3–2 defeat against Willem II Reserves on 19 September 1915. The team did achieve promotion that season to a newly created Third Division of the Brabantian FA. Under the guidance of coach Wout Buitenweg, PSV were promoted in 1918 and 1921 as well, eventually reaching the Eerste <b>Klasse.</b> The team was relegated in 1925, but its stint in the Second Division only lasted one year when PSV were promoted again. Since 1926, PSV has always played in the highest possible domestic league.|$|E
