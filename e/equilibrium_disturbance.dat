40|$|Many {{substances}} may be {{the source}} of dizziness or transient <b>equilibrium</b> <b>disturbances</b> due to dysfunction of the CNS or to an impairment of visual or proprioceptive informations. Other agents are responsible for drop of arterial pressure by changing position, including antihypertensive drugs, alpha-blocking agents used in urology, antipsychotics, cyclic antidepressants, vasodilators and nitrates, dopaminergic antiparkinson drugs, sedatives, etc. Only drug with true ototoxic properties will be discussed here, namely substances that are able to damage the inner ear (cochlear or vestibular damage) or the VIII th cranial nerve, causing impairment of equilibrium and/or (most often) hearing. No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.

40|$|Depressive {{disorders}} require {{long-term treatment}} with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. The goal of antidepressant therapy is complete remission of symptoms {{and return to}} normal daily functioning. Studies have shown that achieving remission and continuing antidepressant therapy long after the acute symptoms remit can protect against the relapse or recurrence of the psychiatric episode. Many patients, however, inadvertently or intentionally skip doses of their antidepressant, and even discontinue it, if their symptoms improve or if they experience side effects. Antidepressant discontinuation may {{increase the risk of}} relapse or precipitate certain distressing symptoms such as gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, <b>equilibrium</b> <b>disturbances,</b> and sleep disorders. Documented with all classes of antidepressants, these reactions may emerge within a couple of days, or even hours, after the abrupt discontinuation of an antidepressant with a short half-life. These distressing responses may be mistaken for a relapse or recurrence. It is important to recognize the potential for these sequelae and educate patients about the need to take all antidepressants at the doses prescribed, warning them of the symptoms that may occur if they skip doses or stop their medication too quickly. Antidepressants should be tapered slowly over a period of days, weeks, or even months, depending on the dose, duration of treatment, and pharmacologic properties of the agent, as well as the patient's individual response. This article reviews the risks and reactions associated with discontinuation of antidepressants. It offers guidelines for distinguishing relapse and recurrence from discontinuation responses as well as for prevention and management of the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome...|$|R

Methods: Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly divided into SJ 5 group and SJ 5 plus GB 34 group, and there were 8 volunteers in each group. The volunteers {{in the two groups}} received needling at corresponding points on the right hand or foot respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1. 5 T, GE Corporation) was used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain before and during the needling, and the obtained experimental data in the regional brain were processed and analyzed by the method of region of interest (ROI). Results: The ROI activation induced by needling of SJ 5 or SJ 5 plus GB 34 was all relatively concentrated (activation rate more than 4 or activation point more than 10) on bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. There {{were no significant differences in}} ROI activation rates of brain regions between the two groups. ROI activation points showed that needling at SJ 5 could activate the right cerebellum specifically (P< 0. 05, vs SJ 5 plus GB 34), while needling at SJ 5 plus GB 34 could activate the left parietal and occipital lobes and bilateral basal ganglion more effectively than activate the other brain regions (P< 0. 05, vs SJ 5). ROI activation strength showed that needling at SJ 5 plus GB 34 could more strongly activate the right cerebellum (P< 0. 05, vs SJ 5).

40|$|Coal- and lignite-fired {{power plants}} produce {{significant}} amounts of ashes, which are quite often being used as additives in cement and other building materials. In many cases, coal and lignite present high concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides, such as U- 238, Ra- 226, Pb- 210, Th- 232 and K- 40. During the combustion process, the produced ashes are enriched in the above radionuclides. The different enrichment of the various radionuclides within a radioactive series, {{such as that of}} 238 U, results in the disturbance of radioactive secular equilibrium. An extensive research project for the determination of the natural radioactivity of lignite and ashes from Greek lignite-fired power plants is in progress in the Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens (NED-NTUA) since 1983. This paper presents detailed results for the natural radioactivity, the secular radioactive <b>equilibrium</b> <b>disturbance</b> and the radon exhalation rate of the fly-ash collected at the different stages along the emission control system of a lignite-fired power plant {{as well as of the}} bottom-ash. From the results obtained so far, it may be concluded that Ra- 226 radioactivity of fly-ash in some cases exceeds 1 kBq kg(- 1), which is much higher than the mean Ra- 226 radioactivity of surface soils in Greece (25 Bq kg(- 1)). Furthermore, the radioactivity of Pb- 210 in fly-ash may reach 4 kBq kg(- 1). These results are interpreted in relation to the physical properties of the investigated nuclides, the temperature in the flue-gas pathway, as well as the fly-ash grain size distribution. It is concluded that towards the coldest parts of the emission control system of the power plant, the radioactivity of some natural nuclides is gradually enhanced, secular radioactive equilibrium is significantly disturbed and the radon exhalation rate tends to increase.

40|$|The endless scale illusion, {{obtained}} by cyclically repeating a chromatic scale {{made up of}} Shepard tones, {{has been used in}} a variety of musical works. Music psychology and neuroscience has been interested in this particular psychoacoustic phenomenon mainly for studying the cognitive processes of pitch perception involved. In the present study, we investigated the emotional states induced by the Shepard-Risset glissando, a variant of the Shepard scale. For this purpose we chose three musical stimuli: a Matlab-generated Shepard Risset glissando, Jean-Claude Risset’s Computer Suite from Little Boy, which presents a Shepard-Risset glissando integrated in the aesthetic context of a composition, and an ordinary orchestral glissando taken from the opening of Iannis Xenakis’ Metastasis. Seventy-three volunteers completed a listening experiment during which they rated their emotional response to these stimuli on a 7 -point Likert scale and indicated whether they had experienced a disruption of equilibrium. Personality was also measured with the Five-Factor Model of personality traits. The results show that negative emotions were most strongly evoked during listening to each of the stimuli. We also found that the Shepard-Risset glissando illusion, both within the aesthetic context of a musical composition and on its own, was capable of evoking disruption of equilibrium, frequently leading to the associated feeling of falling. Moreover, generally for the Shepard-Risset glissando illusion, higher negative emotional ratings were given by individuals who had experienced a feeling of disturbance of equilibrium relative to those who had not had this experience. Finally, we found a complex pattern of relationships between personality and the subjective experience of the glissando. Openness to experience correlated positively with positive emotion ratings for the Computer Suite, while agreeableness correlated negatively with positive emotion ratings for the Matlab stimulus. Moreover, results indicated higher (Bonferroni-uncorrected) neuroticism for those who experienced an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>disturbance</b> relative to subjects who did not have this experience during listening to the Computer Suite. These findings suggest that musical paradoxes may be of interest not only for the insights they provide on our perceptual system, but also for the richness of the emotional experience elicited during listening...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: HIV- 1 viral escape in the {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) despite viral suppression in plasma is rare [1, 2]. We describe {{the case of}} a 50 -year-old HIV- 1 infected patient who was diagnosed with HIV- 1 in 1995. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was started in 1998 with a CD 4 T cell count of 71 cells/ìL and HIV-viremia of 46, 000 copies/mL. ART with zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3 TC) and efavirenz achieved full viral suppression. After the patient had interrupted ART for two years, treatment was re-introduced with tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabin (FTC) and ritonavir boosted atazanavir (ATVr). This regimen suppressed HIV- 1 in plasma for nine years and CD 4 cells stabilized around 600 cells/ìL. Since July 2013, the patient complained about severe gait ataxia and decreased concentration. Materials and Methods: Additionally to a neurological examination, two lumbar punctures, a cerebral MRI and a neuropsycological test were performed. HIV- 1 viral load in plasma and in CSF was quantified using Cobas TaqMan HIV- 1 version 2. 0 (Cobas Ampliprep, Roche diagnostic, Basel, Switzerland) with a detection limit of 20 copies/mL. Drug resistance mutations in HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase and protease were evaluated using bulk sequencing. Results: The CSF in January 2014 showed a pleocytosis with 75 cells/ìL (100 % mononuclear) and 1, 184 HIV- 1 RNA copies/mL, while HIV- 1 in plasma was below 20 copies/mL. The resistance testing of the CSF-HIV- 1 RNA showed two NRTI resistance-associated mutations (M 184 V and K 65 R) and one NNRTI resistance-associated mutation (K 103 N). The cerebral MRI showed increased signal on T 2 -weighted images in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Four months after ART intensification with AZT, 3 TC, boosted darunavir and raltegravir, the pleocytosis in CSF cell count normalized to 1 cell/ìL and HIV viral load was suppressed. The neurological symptoms improved; however, <b>equilibrium</b> <b>disturbances</b> and impaired memory persisted. The neuro-psychological evaluation confirmed neurocognitive impairments in executive functions, attention, working and nonverbal memory, speed of information processing, visuospatial abilities and motor skills. Conclusions: HIV- 1 infected patients with neurological complaints prompt further investigations of the CSF including measurement of HIV viral load and genotypic resistance testing since isolated replication of HIV with drug resistant variants can rarely occur despite viral suppression in plasma. Optimizing ART by using drugs with improved CNS penetration may achieve viral suppression in CSF with improvement of neurological symptoms...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} system {{dynamics}} {{implementation of a}} dynamic ecological economics model. Dynamic economic models are often constrained to use functions, such as the Cobb-Douglas function, chosen “conveniently” to allow for analytic solutions. The C-D function, however, suffers from its fixed elasticity that {{does not allow for}} the substitutability between man-made capital and natural capital to change, which is vital for economic sustainability. Using system dynamics removes this constraint and enables more realistic ecological economics models containing functions not amenable to analytic solution. The base model is the natural resource and population growth model developed by Brander and Taylor (1998) that employs a Lotka-Volterra type structure and strictly follows economic theory in all aspects of its formulation. To make the model more realistic and to enable the consideration of critical environmental issues, we discuss and employ model extensions inspired by modern economics theory. One extension is to use a CES production function with a dynamic substitutability parameter that enables the study of long-term sustainability of the modeled economy. The model does not have an analytic solution, necessitating a simulation approach. Importantly, under certain conditions the system dynamics implementation robustly returns to <b>equilibrium</b> after <b>disturbances...</b>|$|R

In semi-enclosed micro-tidal water bodies such as Cockburn Sound, the prime mechanisms driving seiches are changes in wind speed and direction (Luettich et al, 2000).

It has a major impact upon the lives of young people {{and their families and}} represents a significant drain upon the economic and clinical resources of the National Health Service. The research objective of this project was to investigate what might be happening in the minds of young people who self-harm. The project was designed to capture the micro-processes of adolescent self-harm in order to identify significant constructs for the purpose of theory generation and clinical application. It is a grounded theory study of 12 adolescents aged 13 - 16 years old (9 females and 3 males) presenting to hospital after an episode of self-harm. A single interview was conducted after episodes of self-barm and analysed using a narrative and construct based approach. Results: The findings of the project are presented as four cardinal constructs: (1) The Upset; (2) Who Cares? -The Mother-Adolescent relationship; (3) The Telling -Self/Other Relations; (4) Equilibrium Disequilibrium.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{principle}} of competitive exclusion states that, at equilibrium, {{the number of}} competing species which can coexist is no greater {{than the number of}} limiting resources (Hardin 1960). This raises the question of how biological diversity is maintained. Environmental disturbance may prevent an ecosystem from reaching <b>equilibrium,</b> with intermediate <b>disturbance</b> levels promoting high diversity (Connell 1978). If external influences are unimportant, then the intrinsic dynamics of the ecosystem may keep it away from equilibrium, allowing the coexistence of more species than expected (Huisman & Weissing 1999). Here we consider competition for space. Many previous studies of this problem have focussed on two species, with the result that if they differ only in their competitive ability, one species will eventually displace the other (Durrett 1988). In most ecosystems there are many interacting species, and these will have complex networks of competitive relations (Buss & Jackson...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} financial development on economic growth in Nigeria during the period 1986 – 2012. To achieve {{the purpose of this}} research, we estimated the real GDP {{as a function of the}} gross fixed capital formation, financial development (the ratio of private sector credits to GDP), liquidity ratio, and the interest rate. The methods used are: the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) techniques, Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, Johansen cointegration test, error correction technique, and the Granger causality test. The empirical results revealed that: all the variables used are integrated of the same order, I(1); there is evidence of the existence of a long run relationship among the variables used; the normalized cointegration coefficients revealed that financial development affects economic growth negatively in the long run. However, the short run impact of financial development on economic growth is positive. This goes to show that the finance-led growth hypothesis is valid in Nigeria only in the short run. There is also evidence of stability of both long run and short run relationship between the real GDP and financial development in Nigeria and the adjustment process to restore <b>equilibrium</b> after <b>disturbance</b> is effectively slow (6. 50 percent of discrepancies is corrected in each period). Also, causality runs from economic growth to financial development and there is no bi-directional causality between growth and finance which lends support to the demand-leading hypothesis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to re-examine the issue of whether inter-urban housing markets can be {{modelled}} using a set of common economic fundamentals (such as economic growth, employment and the like). This is a timely analysis in view of the current widespread interest in housing markets as a result of the fall-out from the housing sub-prime crisis in the United States. House prices and economic fundamentals within each city are tested for cointegration and, in the event of a cointegrating relationship being found, restriction tests are applied to ascertain whether particular economic fundamentals can be excluded from the long-run equilibrium house price model for that city, and whether the given fundamental contributes to speed of adjustment back to <b>equilibrium</b> once a <b>disturbance</b> has taken place.

30|$|We {{have also}} noted in SHPG that the flow past a {{circular}} cylinder suffers multiple Hopf bifurcations (experimentally shown in [14, 43]) and in [38] for flow inside LDC and flow over cylinder. Hence {{the accuracy of}} reconstruction naturally demands that the target and donor Re’s {{should be in the}} same segments of Fig.  3, as the flow fields are dynamically similar. In Fig.  3, the <b>equilibrium</b> amplitude of <b>disturbance</b> vorticity are plotted as a function of Re for both the flows. The equilibrium amplitude refers to the value of the disturbance quantity, which settles down in a quasi-periodic manner, due to nonlinear saturation after the primary and secondary instabilities. Presence of multiple quadratic segments in Fig.  3, indicates multiple bifurcations originating at different Re’s. Thus, it is imperative that one identifies the target Re in the same segment of donor Re’s for DNS-quality reconstruction for flow past circular cylinder as in SHPG and for flow inside LDC in [17]. In each of these sectors of Re, the flow behaves similarly and the (St, Re)-relation is distinct. It is to be emphasized that the present sets of simulations are performed using highly accurate dispersion relation preserving numerical methods.|$|R
40|$|Modeling the {{determinants}} of long-run, or equilibrium, exchange rates is currently extremely fashionable. 1 In many ways this work has been inspired by recent developments in the time series literature, rather than any new theoretical interest in the {{determinants of}} long-run exchange rates. Nevertheless, this work is interesting since, in summary form, it suggests that sensible long-run relationships can be derived, particularly when the span of the data is increased from the recent floating period to a period encompassing around one hundred years of annual data. 2 By sensible long-run relationships we mean, for example, when a researcher conditions an exchange rate on relative prices she finds that the exchange rate is homogeneous with respect to relative prices and that the adjustment to <b>equilibrium,</b> following a <b>disturbance,</b> takes around eight years to complete. One key problem, though, in extending the data span on an historical basis {{is that it may}} expose the investigated relationship to destabilizing regime changes.

The vascular flora of Heron Island, a small coral cay on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia was, therefore, surveyed at 3 month intervals from September 1990 until December 1993. During this period 57 species were reported for the island, with the number of species present at one time varying from 40 to 53. Six alien species and two native species were reported from the island for the first time. Direct gradient analysis demonstrated a similarity between spring-summer samples and autumn-winter samples, with the pairs of samples being different from each other. Neither the total number of species present at one time nor the proportion of alien species in the flora has increased since 1984, suggesting that the flora has reached <b>equilibrium</b> with the <b>disturbance</b> caused by human activity on the island. A method for estimating the annual rate of species turnover (I) is outlined, and I is calculated for Heron Island and four other islands in the Capricorn-Bunker Group. The low I reported for Heron Island is further evidence for floristic equilibrium being approached on this highly disturbed site...|$|R
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{penetration}} of distributed generation and aggressive {{reactive power compensation}} with modern power electronics may result in the reversal of active and reactive power flows in future distribution grids. The voltage stability of these operating conditions may {{be very different from}} the more traditional power consumption regime. We study the stability characteristics of distribution networks with reversed power flow. After introducing a universal algebraic approach to characterize all the solutions of the power flow equations, we show that new solutions appear in the reversed power flow regime even in the simplest three bus systems. We show that the some of these solutions are stable and the system may exhibit a phenomenon of multistability, where multiple stable equilibria co-exist at the given set of parameters, and the system may converge to an undesirable <b>equilibrium</b> after a <b>disturbance.</b> These predictions are validated with dynamic simulations of two different systems. Under certain conditions the new states are viable and may be characterized by relatively high voltages. Possible approaches towards reactive power/voltage regulation as well as permissible distributed generation capacity in future power systems are proposed and discussed in the end of the paper.

40|$|This study explores {{whether the}} high {{variability}} of vascular plant diversity among alpine plant communities {{can be explained}} by stress and/or disturbance intensities. Species numbers of 14 alpine plant communities were sampled in the Swiss Alps. To quantify the intensity of 13 stress and 6 disturbance factors potentially controlling plant life in these communities, a survey was conducted by asking numerous specialists in alpine vegetation to assess the importance of the different factors for each community. The estimated values were combined in stress- and disturbance-indices which were compared with diversity according to the Intermediate Stress Hypothesis, the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, and the Dynamic Equilibrium Model, respectively. Each of these theories explained a part of the variability in the species richness, but only the Dynamic Equilibrium Model provided a complete and consistent explanation. The last model suggests that community species richness within the alpine life zone is generally controlled by stress intensity. Disturbance and competition seem to play a secondary role by fine-tuning diversity in specific communities. As diversity is primarily limited by stress, a moderation of temperature-related stress factors, as a result of global warming, may cause a shift of the <b>equilibrium</b> between stress, <b>disturbance,</b> and competition in alpine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|It was in 1892 that Lyapunov {{published}} his paper giving his 2 ̆ 2 second method 2 ̆ 2. The basic guiding principle {{was that we}} might be able to know something about the stability of the system from the form of the equations describing it. Specifically, the idea was that it would not be necessary to know the solutions of the equations involved. This is of course very useful since in most cases solutions are extremely difficult or even impossible to find. Lyapunov 2 ̆ 7 s insight was that if a function could be found with, among other properties, a negative rate of change along the solution of the system except in the <b>equilibrium</b> case, then <b>disturbances</b> from the <b>equilibrium</b> solution would return to that solution. (In the equilibrium case, the solution is constant.) The kind of function involved is called a Lyapunov function, and it is defined in such a way that it mimics the energy function. In fact, it was the energy function which originally inspired these ideas. There is an intuitive physical appeal about the assertion that systems that lose energy 2 ̆ 2 fall 2 ̆ 2 to an equilibrium state. And in many cases, the expression for energy ends up being our choice for Lyapunov function. The historical data above can be found in [5]...|$|R
40|$|Rationale : The {{activation}} of the neuroendocrine systems is a basic response to environmental perturbations, which threaten homeostasis. The HPA-axis {{is one of the}} primary effector systems, which functions to minimize deviations from the homeostatic state and help to return <b>equilibrium</b> following a <b>disturbance.</b> It has been well established that products of the HPA-axis can directly inhibit the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) -axis. Consequently, following chronic stressors reproduction is impaired. Method : Animals were exposed to predator scent stress for 15 min. Behaviors were assessed with the elevated plus-maze and acoustic startle response tests, 7 days later. Trauma-cue response, circulating corticosterone and testosterone, and localized brain expression of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptors were subsequently assessed. All data were analyzed in relation to individual behavior patterns. The behavioral effects of testosterone agonist, testosterone receptor antagonist (flutamide), or vehicle-administered systemic one hour before and 7 days after PSS-exposure were evaluated in the same manner. Results : Animals whose behavior was extremely disrupted (EBR) selectively displayed significant down-regulation of AR in the hippocampus compared to animals whose behavior was minimally (MBR) or partially (PBR) disrupted and to un-exposed controls. One-hour pre-exposure treatment with testosterone significantly increased prevalence rates of EBR and increased trauma-cue freezing responses, compared to vehicle controls. In contrast, immediate pre-exposure treatment with flutamide significantly reduced prevalence rates of extreme responders and reduced trauma-cue freezing responses compared to vehicle and testosterone treatments. Moreover, treatment with testosterone 7 days post exposure significantly reduced prevalence rates of extreme responders and reduced trauma-cue freezing responses compared to vehicle and testosterone treatments. Conclusions : The gonadal steroid hormones are actively involved in the neurobiological response to predator scent stress and thus warrant further study as a potential therapeutic avenue for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders...|$|R
40|$|Three {{variants}} of Oldroyd-B model are analyzed for {{stability of the}} base profile in plane Couette flow of dilute polymeric fluid at moderate Reynolds number. The stability to two-dimensional disturbances is analyzed for the linearized problem {{as well as the}} weakly nonlinear flow. We begin with the classical Oldroyd-B model with emphasis on the disturbances with axial wavenumber alpha similar to Re- 1 / 2, where Re is the Reynolds number based on maximum velocity and channel width. For linearly stable flow, the finite amplitude stability is analyzed using the equilibrium flow method, wherein the nonlinear flow is assumed to be at the transition point. For the classical Oldroyd-B fluid, the threshold kinetic energy for the <b>equilibrium</b> wall mode <b>disturbances</b> is found to be higher for the viscoelastic fluid than for the Newtonian fluid. In the second variant, the Oldroyd-B model with additional artificial diffusivity is studied. In this model, the diffusion modes, not present in the classical Oldroyd-B model, are introduced. For large wavenumber disturbances, the diffusion modes become the slowest decaying modes in comparison to the wall modes. The threshold energy for the diffusive Oldroyd-B model is smaller than that for the Newtonian fluid. The third variant of the Oldroyd-B model accounts for the nonhomogeneous polymer concentration coupled with the polymeric stress field. While the base profile is linearly stable for the first two models, the nonhomogeneous Oldroyd-B fluid exhibits an instability in the linear analysis. The ``concentration mode'' becomes unstable when the fluid Weissenberg number exceeds a certain transition value. This mode of instability, driven by the stress-induced fluctuations in polymer number density, renders the uniform polymer concentration profile unstable leading to the well-known phenomenon of flow-induced demixing...|$|R
