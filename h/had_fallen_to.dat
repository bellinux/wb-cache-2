5|$|Trafford Park {{was a major}} {{supplier}} of materiel in the First and Second World Wars, producing the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. At its peak in 1945, an estimated 75,000workers were employed in the park. That number began to decline in the 1960s as companies closed in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. By 1967 employment <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 50,000, and the decline continued throughout the 1970s. The new generation of container ships was too large for the Manchester Ship Canal, {{which led to a}} further decline in Trafford Park's fortunes. The workforce <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 15,000 by 1976, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared from the park.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{founding}} the congregation grew very slowly; by 1908 {{there were still}} only 37 members, and 16 children in the religious school.

5|$|In the 1960s {{employment}} in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. Ellesmere Port and Runcorn at {{the western end of}} the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s. In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements. The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service. By 1976, the workforce <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 15,000, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.|$|E

5|$|The recent strong {{economic}} growth and lower unemployment in the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: unemployment in the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 3.3%. The motorway enabled the development of distribution centres in Telford, and industrial estates such as Hortonwood and Stafford Park have provided employment in the area.|$|E
5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E

Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> Austria.|$|E

In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of a run, in six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Poulton top-scored for Australia with 23 from 28 balls, helping to stabilise the innings after the Australians <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> 2/10. However, she fell at 4/45, bowled by Holly Colvin, and eventually, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>to</b> their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E
