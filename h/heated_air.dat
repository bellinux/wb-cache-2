The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E

25|$|For storing grain in bins, the {{moisture}} of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling.

25|$|A related {{approach}} is the solar updraft tower, which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the <b>heated</b> <b>air</b> up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors. Land acquisition and collector construction costs for updraft towers must be compared to pumping infrastructure costs for downdraft collectors. Operationally, maintaining the collector structures for updraft towers must be compared to pumping costs and pump infrastructure maintenance.|$|E

For {{the first phase of}} the finish drying, product goes into a dryer with multi rows of hot water circulation plates. This phase decreases high rate of moisture and pasteurized the product.

25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a cargo hold with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated {{the air in the}} cargo hold. This <b>heated</b> <b>air</b> had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. When the door between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the passenger cabin.|$|E
25|$|Relative humidity: The {{relative}} humidity of air {{is defined as}} the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the {{relative humidity}} of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the <b>heated</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

25|$|Vietnam in the {{northern}} regions have a humid subtropical climate, with humidity averaging 84% throughout the year. However, because of differences in latitude and the marked variety of topographical relief, the climate tends to vary considerably from place to place. During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the China coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture; consequently the winter season {{in most parts of}} the country is dry only by comparison with the rainy or summer season. During the southwesterly summer monsoon, occurring from May to October, the <b>heated</b> <b>air</b> of the Gobi Desert rises, far to the north, inducing moist air to flow inland from the sea and deposit heavy rainfall. The climate in the southern regions especially Ho Chi Minh City and surrounding Mekong Delta is predominantly Tropical savanna climate with high humidity and a distinct wet and dry season.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort, which is located 150 miles {{south-west}} of Delhi, became one of the world's most efficient cannon foundries mainly due to the abundance of iron ore mines {{in the vicinity of the}} fort. The cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace creating temperatures as high as 2400°F, the <b>heated</b> <b>air</b> would melt the metal. The liquid molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and into a cannon mold in the casting pit. Most of those cannons were massive, mostly 16ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Rajput also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of oxen, the device was used for hollowing out the cannon barrels. When the Mughal war of succession broke out in 1658 Dara Shikoh secured the cannon outpost of Jaigarh Fort until he was defeated and executed by his younger brother Aurangzeb. Later however, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Jai Singh II as the official Mughal Qiladar of Jaigarh Fort according to a Firman, ultimately Jai Singh II is known to have molded the great Jaivana Cannon by utilizing the important foundry and devices inside Jaigarh Fort.|$|E
25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a double-layered casing with an air gap and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of <b>heated</b> <b>air</b> that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E
