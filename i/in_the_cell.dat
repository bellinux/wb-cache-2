Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of major nutrient additions on trace metal uptake (Cd, Se, and Zn) in a coastal diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was investigated. A short-term exposure (5 h) {{was employed to}} measure the concentration factor (ratio of metal concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> to metal concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium) which {{was used as a}} kinetic parameter to quantify the relative rate of metal uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> Following an initial rapid surface sorption, a linear pattern of uptake over time was typical for Cd, Se and Zn, indicating that these metals may have been transported intracellularly during the shortterm exposure period. N addition significantly increased the rates of Cd uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> Although <b>the</b> concentration factor of Zn increased with N addition, statistical analysis indicated that N addition did not significantly affect the rate of Zn uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> Se uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> was independent of N additions, but was lowered with increasing Si concentration. Si addition did not significantly affect Cd and Zn uptake. Similarly, P addition did not influence the rates of metal uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> There was a significant correlation between the rate of uptake of Cd and Zn and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> growth rate. This study demonstrated that water quality brought about by a change in nutrient condition could considerably influence the uptake of metals by marine phytoplankton. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E

5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E

5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane called ion channels.
