To increase the recycling efficiency for these materials, a dismantling tool has been developed. The development process of the dismantling tool was guided by in-depth analysis of the required disassembly time for LCD TVs and laptops. The results of practical experiments demonstrate that the use of the dismantling tool enable to reduce the <b>dismantling</b> <b>time</b> for plastic housing components and PWBs with respectively 36 % and 45 % for LCD TVs...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing waste streams in {{contemporary}} societies. Proper treatment and recovery of WEEE is an important challenge not only because of its content on hazardous substances but also because it contains significant quantities of valuable materials. The pre-processing stage of WEEE recycling plays a major role in the recovery network, in particular when carried out through manual dismantling processes. Dismantling allows components to be separated prior to further treatment. However, recycling organisations usually find this particular stage considerably time-consuming, and hence expensive, since products are not designed to be easily dismantled. One particular waste stream that could reduce dismantling costs through an improved design is the stream of Flat Panel Displays (FPD). However, little detailed data is nowadays available on the dismantling processes, which prevent designing FPD according to the requirements of treatment operators. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method for in-depth analysis of dismantling practices of electronic displays in order to obtain useful data for product design. The method is composed of three stages: (1) study definition, (2) data construction and (3) data analysis. The first stage allows setting out why, how and where the analysis will be performed. The second stage consists in describing dismantling operations in detail to construct a detailed and meaningful dataset. Finally, product indicators are developed and the best and worst design practices from a dismantling point of view are identified. The approach is illustrated through a case study on the manual dismantling of 12 FPD. The sample was dismantled at one of the European recycling facility representatives. Data on the <b>dismantling</b> <b>time</b> spent on each component, operation and tool was obtained. Collected data can be used as empirical evidence to support the development of quantitative ecodesign strategies. Some examples of ecodesign strategies that can significantly reduce the <b>dismantling</b> <b>time</b> of the sample are given. This work opens perspectives on how the quantitative data from the recovery phase obtained within the study can be used in product design...|$|E
30|$|Delays in {{structural}} formwork, {{which account}} for {{a large percentage of}} the critical path (CP) of the structural formwork, have a significant adverse impact on the overall structural formwork, including subsequent processing. Therefore, it is essential to identify and manage the delay factors that can occur in the formwork in advance. However, according to result of survey, it understood that the free-form plane formwork. This delay factor is due to the increased amount of nonstandard formwork, which increases the formwork installation and <b>dismantling</b> <b>time,</b> and also increases the time and cost of making nonstandard formwork. To solve this problem, it is necessary to find ways to reduce the amount of nonstandard formwork when planning the form layout. However, if the number of nonstandard forms is large, one solution might be to shorten the working time by increasing the number of workers. In addition, it is necessary to anticipate the changing quantity of the mold and the time taken for the required amount and to consider these factors beforehand when planning the T/C.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Huge {{amount of}} waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipments (WEEE) or electronic waste (E-waste) has been produced {{every year in}} the world. It consists of valuable and hazardous metals that can be reused or extracted to minimize the environmental impact. This study is focusing on the investigation of recycling potential of e-waste through manual dismantling process and leaching test. The leaching test was conducted by changing the initial pH with constant stirring speed, constant water-sample ratio and in open air. The morphological structures of the solid samples were observed by SEM and the liquid residue was analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). It was found that total time required to dismantle all parts in the waste motor is about 10 minutes and the part that required longest <b>dismantling</b> <b>time</b> was armature windings. The metal elements that were observed are Fe, Mg, Pb and Cr. It was found that the pH of the solution increased with the increasing leaching time. The dissolution of Fe and Pb was high in the early stage of leaching but gradually decreased afterward. The dissolution for Mg and Cr was low throughout the leaching process. It was revealed that the metal elements in e-waste can be dissolved using this method and further investigation to increase the dissolution rate is required to ensure that the method proposed is applicable in industry.

Consequently, the possibility of dismantling vehicle seats separately from the current vehicle dismantling process in order to remove {{a large portion of}} automotive {{shredder residue}} before the shredding process is investigated using an industrial engineering systems approach. In order to understand the structural make-up of the vehicle a thorough disassembly was performed and all operations, part types, weights and material compositions were recorded. Disassembly and <b>dismantling</b> <b>times</b> were calculated using time measurement studies and relationships were identified between process times and seat characteristics. Using this relationship a heuristic complexity based model was developed that relates the product components and connections to the disassembly and <b>dismantling</b> <b>times.</b> This model was then applied to develop a business model to determine the profitability of a vehicle seat dismantling facility. Issues such as government regulations, expenses and potential revenues are discussed to determine the economical viability of vehicle seat recycling...|$|R

40|$|These videos {{are what}} is left {{following}} a failure to develop a net art performance practice grounded in trauma as a conceptual apparatus. I had hoped that this series {{would lead to a}} performance event that would respond to Hal Foster’s contextualization of the Real in contemporary surrealism. Some clarification on my departures from Foster’s ideas are in order, since he is a critical theorist antipathetic towards performance – my intention was to create a piece that contextualizes while <b>dismantling</b> <b>time</b> as a representational stage in which performer’s subjectivity occurs (this has precedence in Dan Graham’s Performer/ Audience/ Mirror), revealing the performer’s agency as something outside of his continuous self-apprehension - traumatically alienated from, rather than integrated with, their psychic economy. I wanted to explore the notion of ideology persisting (in a structural sense) in what most (myself included) internet users take for granted as post-ideological, personalized platforms. My mistake was to protract, rather than make succinct this basic premise: I conceived the performer and mirror as the internet user performing a dialogical relationship with the unary signifiers of his voice on computer screen. Following this, fulfilling my idea of ‘traumatic performance’ soon became a matter of finding a way to draw an antagonistic relationship between this dialogue in real time (the net art event) and subjective time (the performer’s speaking position, as it comes to be represented through the internet), which I found a critical basis in Lacan’s formula of the Hysteric’s Discourse. While I felt I had sustained a consistent attitude towards effect, I felt that I ended up endlessly reproducing what I shall call a space of private epiphanies on certain autobiographical pivot point – the project is marred by a kind of coded expressionism which I feel is besides the point...|$|E

40|$|The authors tested two mini-yarders, one for uphill and {{the other}} for {{downhill}} extraction. The two machines were modern commercial models, offering state-of-the-art yarding technology on a miniature scale and at a much lower cost than required for purchasing a full-size tower yarder. The two units must not be regarded as alternative, but rather as complementary, since they offer different capabilities and advantages. Both machines were tested while harvesting firewood from the thinning of young beech stands in Central Italy. The tests indicated that both units can reach a productivity between 1. 5 and 2. 4 m 3 SMH- 1, including all delays, as well as set-up and <b>dismantle</b> <b>time.</b> Calculated extraction cost ranged between 24 and over 30 € m- 3. The authors calculated a set of regression equations for estimating machine productivity {{as a function of the}} main work conditions. The performance of the studied mini-yarders does not seem much inferior to that achieved by professional light tower yarder under the same work conditions, but the lighter construction of the small-scale units may result in a lower resistance to wear and abuse. In any case, mini-yarders seem ideal for deployment under the typical conditions of small-scale forestry, offering a good solution to wood extraction on steep terrain, competitive with animal and winch logging in terms of productivity, cost and operator comfort. © Steve Harrison, John Herbohn 2009...|$|R
