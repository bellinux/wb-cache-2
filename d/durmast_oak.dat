50|$|Quercus petraea, {{commonly}} known as the sessile oak, Cornish oak, or <b>durmast</b> <b>oak,</b> is a species of oak tree native to most of Europe and into Anatolia and Iran.|$|E
50|$|Centuries-old {{forests of}} beech, spruce, fir, hornbeam, and <b>durmast</b> <b>oak</b> cover {{most of the}} Park. More than half the flora of Bulgaria has been {{identified}} within the Park, and of these, 10 species and 2 subspecies are endemic, and are found nowhere else in the world. Over 130 higher plants and animals encountered in the Central Balkan National Park {{are listed in the}} Bulgarian and the World Red Book of Endangered Species.|$|E
50|$|Avala {{is known}} for its diverse plant life, despite not being a tall mountain. There are over 600 plant species living on the mountain. Some of them are {{protected}} by the law as natural rarities, like certain types of laburnum, box tree, black broom, common holly and martagon lily. The area is also abundant in medical herbs, like the early-purple orchid and belladonna. Almost 70% of Avala is forested. High woods mostly consist of <b>durmast</b> <b>oak,</b> Turkey oak, hornbeam, beech, linden, black pine, black locust and other trees.|$|E
5000|$|Mainly beeches {{and silver}} firs {{grow in the}} deep and damp soil and form a dense canopy [...] For this reason, low {{shrubbery}} is almost entirely absent and only shade tolerant plants like enchanter's-nightshade, arum and woodruff grow there. The {{major part of the}} forest stands on dry and nutrient-poor soil. <b>Durmast</b> <b>oak,</b> field maple and whitebeam, as well as the non-local conifer scots pine are to be found here. In addition, pinnate coralroot, dog's mercury, as well as carex and various orchids, for example bird's-nest orchid and red and white helleborine grow here. Oak and hornbeam forests grow in some places. Ash-alder communities dominate the headwater regions.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} {{constructed}} in 1989 at the Sochi Naval Shipyard, by a team under shipwright Damir S. Shkhalakhov, {{as well as the}} active participation of the future crew members. Ivlia was built from <b>Durmast</b> <b>oak</b> and Siberian larch, the oars are of beech. Technical design of the project was carried out by specialists of the Nikolayev University of Shipbuilding. After processing the available scientific data (ancient illustrations on vases and reliefs, written and archaeological sources) members of the Odessa Archaeological Museum, under the leadership of prof. PhD Vladimir N. Stanko, proposed the building of a bireme since in antiquity it had been the most widely used vessel in the northern Black Sea region.|$|E
50|$|After most {{growth is}} achieved, older {{chestnut}} timber tends to split and warp when harvested. The timber becomes neither as hard nor {{as strong as}} oak. The American chestnut C. dentata served as {{an important source of}} lumber, because that species has long, unbranched trunks. In Britain, chestnut was formerly used indiscriminately with oak for the construction of houses, millwork, and household furniture. It grows so freely in Britain that it was long considered a truly native species, partly because the roof of Westminster Hall and the Parliament House of Edinburgh were mistakenly thought to be constructed of chestnut wood. Chestnut wood, though, loses much of its durability when the tree is more than 50 years old, and despite the local chestnut's quick growth rate, the timber used for these two buildings is considerably larger than a 50-year-old chestnut's girth. It has been proven that the roofs of these buildings are actually <b>Durmast</b> <b>oak,</b> which closely resembles chestnut in grain and color.|$|E
50|$|Kopaonik's flora has a {{large number}} of {{autochthonous}} plant species (Balkan beech, fir, spruce, yew, several kinds of maple, pine and oak). The fauna is also diverse but its concentration varies, depending {{on the quality of the}} habitat. Deciduous forests and native coniferous woodland make up most of the forested land in the park. There are also forests of willow, poplar, common hornbeam, <b>durmast</b> <b>oak</b> and Turkey oak. In total, there are 1,600 plant species in the park, out of which 200 grow only on Kopaonik. It also includes over 200 species of fungi. Special value of Kopaonik in terms of biological diversity is that 11.9% of the high mountain endemic species in the Balkans inhabits the mountain. Endemic species which grow only on Kopaonik include Kopaonik's houseleek, Kopaonik's violet and Pančić's bittercress. Other endemites include sea thrift, Balkan docks (Rumex balcanicus), Pancicia serbica, Blečić's columbine (Aquilegia blecicii), Bosnian marsh orchid, Bulgarian achillea (Achillea bulgarica), Alyssum, aconite and Yugoslav bell (Edrianthus jugoslavicus).|$|E
40|$|The author {{describes}} the Chilopoda associations from the <b>durmast</b> <b>oak,</b> beech and alder forests by the Motomura’s log-linear mathematical model. The Chilopoda associations present a diversity and equitability that is {{close enough to}} the log-linear mathematical model so they can be considered as nomocoenosis in the sense Daget, Lecordier and Leveque (1972) ...|$|E
40|$|Tree {{allometric}} {{relationships are}} likely to be influenced by species tolerance to shade, nutrient availability and plant ontogenetic origin. The aim of this paper was to test to what extent these factors affect the scaling exponents of two allometric relationships in pure, even-aged, canopy-closed forest stands: stem diameter (D) versus stem height (H) and versus stem density (N). Data were collected by tree species (Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea), wood productivity class and reproductive mode (seed origin and sprouting stands) from published forest yield tables. Reduced major axis analysis was used to estimate the slopes of regression lines in the log-log space of H-D and D-N. The scaling exponent of the H-D relationship was significantly larger in birch than in beech stands (0. 897 versus 0. 745), and in low productivity, beech stands as compared with their high productivity counterparts (0. 876 versus 0. 745). However, no significant difference was detected between high stands and coppices of <b>durmast</b> <b>oak.</b> The scaling exponent of the D-N relationship was significantly larger in birch than in beech stands (- 0. 690 versus - 0. 558), in low than in high productivity beech stands (- 0. 694 versus - 0. 558), and in seed origin than in sprouting stands of <b>durmast</b> <b>oak</b> (- 0. 609 versus - 0. 580). We explained these results in terms of plant stem growth strategies and resource availability from a biomechanical perspective. Contrary to certain studies that have reported an invariant scaling relation between stem diameter and density across tree species and communities, but in accordance with other recent studies, we have brought new evidence on species-specific allometric scaling under self-thinning. In addition, we have revealed within-species variance of the scaling exponent of stem diameter-density relationship. </span...|$|E
