The area preparation for construction consisted in filling a layer of sand over peat. Hence, the following characteristic geotechnical conditions of the newly developed areas: high groundwater level and long-term settlement of peat under sand embankment. That is why subsurface structures are protected by a drainage, and drains are installed over pile foundations. One problem developing in the course of drain operation and requiring expensive re-installation activities is clogging of <b>drain</b> <b>filters</b> with fine organic and clay particles carried over by groundwater flow. The article presents the results of a survey of a building erected more than 30 years ago, which suffered from groundwater table rising due to the reduction of drain system's water intake capacity. Clogging of crushed stone cover above the drainpipe resulted in the reduction of the permeability factor. Laboratory surveys were conducted to estimate the reliability of drains with the pipes wrapped in geotextile. Drains with a layer of geotextile surrounding the stone filtering cover were also investigated. To simulate clogging, humus and clay particles were added to the water running through the filtering tube. It turned out that the second geotextile arrangement – around the stone cover with sand backfillingwas the most effective...|$|R

This paper reports an experiment in which model <b>filter</b> <b>drains</b> with or without geotextile sleeves around the slotted drain are challenged with lubricating oil. The textile was a surface-treated non-woven geotextile manufactured from polyester.

A series of simulated 10 - 20 mm rain events over 1 hour were applied and two sample types were collected which either included or excluded any free product. Additional aliquots of oil were added at each rain event. The un-sleeved models were found to release visible free product with the addition of as little as 100 ml of oil per linear meter of drain. For the models with geotextile sleeves there was no such release with as much as 2000 ml per linear metre.

The acidic drainage water from sugar cane fields in an ASS catchment was collected from an open <b>drain,</b> <b>filtered</b> to reduce the transport of large particulates, and passed vertically through a polyethylene tank, which was filled with limestone aggregates (less than or equal 75 mm). This Closed Tank Reactor (CTR) uses the {{principles of}} oxic and anoxic limestone drain systems {{that are designed to}} increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and thereby the alkalinity produced from the dissolution of limestone by metal-laden influent. During a non-continuous 70 day monitoring period, the discharge from the CTR had higher pH, lower acidity and lower metal concentrations compared to the inflow. Under average flow conditions (9 lpm), similar proportions of incoming dissolved aluminium and iron (61 % and 56 % respectively) were retained within the CTR. Two perforated pipes in the base of the CTR were used to flush precipitates from the system under rapid flow conditions (> 50 lpm). The flushing was effective in removing approximately 10 % of accumulated iron but only about 0. 3 % of accumulated aluminium from the CTR.

5000|$|When an area’s {{soils are}} not {{permeable}} {{enough to allow}} water to <b>drain</b> and <b>filter</b> properly, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed.

Otherwise, the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, as demonstrated in a 1983 study. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for storm water to filter into the ground. Microbial populations feed off plant root secretions and break down carbon (such as in mulch or desiccated plant roots) to aggregate soil particles which increases infiltration rates. A five-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. Pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least [...]25 in/hour, however. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.|$|R

The definitive version is available from: [URL] road carriageway and pavement sub-surface of many UK highways are <b>drained</b> by Highway <b>Filter</b> <b>Drains</b> (HFD). These are gravel filled trenches fitted with a porous carrier pipe at the base that convey surface and sub-surface water to an outfall. HFD are typically characterized as free draining upon construction however, over time the voids of the granular medium become filled due to the intrusion of fines washed from the adjacent earthworks or pavement surface. The lack of understanding of the deterioration mechanisms and the absence of a structured fouling characterization limit the assessment of operational and residual HFD life to qualitative or subjective estimation of in-service performance. This extends to maintenance procedures that are predominately reactive. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of HFD performance and drainage media condition assessment. It then presents a method of fouling characterization based on assessment of samples from in service drains. Three fouling scales are thus suggested; the percentage drain fouling, the foulant-aggregate ratio and the free voids ratio. In-service HFD are found to be functioning at an acceptable standard with a limited number of localized failures attributed to highly fouled layers at the surface of the trench. It is proposed that a rational evaluation of a HFD section should employ means other than just visual indicators. The fouling assessment is linked to laboratory permeability tests conducted with different levels of filter material fouling. It is found that the extent, spreading and type of fouling are important to determine how the filter aggregate performs...|$|R

40|$|A {{doctoral}} Thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (Eng. D.) at Loughborough UniversityAcross {{a large part of}} the UK highways network the carriageway and pavement foundations are <b>drained</b> by Highway <b>Filter</b> <b>Drains</b> (HFDs). A HFD is a linear trench constructed either at the pavement edge or central reserve, fitted with a porous carrier pipe at the base and backfilled with an initially highly porous aggregate material. This arrangement enables the swift removal of surface runoff and subsurface water from the pavement system minimising road user hazards and eliminating risk of structural damage to the pavement sub-base. The highly porous backfill filters throughout its operational life fines washed from the pavement wearing course or adjacent land. HFDs have been found to be prone to collecting near the basal sections (pipe) or surface layers contaminants or detritus that causes the filter media to gradually block. The process has been defined as HFD clogging and it has been found to lead to reduced drainage capacity and potentially severe drop of serviceability. O&M contractual agreements for DBFO projects usually propose in-service and handback requirements for all assets included in the concession portfolio. Different performance thresholds are thus prescribed for pavements, structures, ancillary assets or street lighting. Similar definitions can be retrieved for drainage assets in such agreements, and these include HFDs. Performance metrics are defined though in a generic language and residual life (a key indicator for major assets that usually drives long-term maintenance planning) is prescribed without indicative means to evaluate such a parameter. Most of pavement maintenance is carried out nowadays using proactive management thinking and engineered assessment of benefits and costs of alternative strategies (what-if scenarios). Such a proactive regime is founded upon data driven processes and asset specific ageing / renewal understanding. Within the spectrum of road management, maintenance Life Cycle Costs are usually generated and updated on an annual basis using inventory and condition data linked to a Decision Support Tool (DST). This enables the assessment and optimisation of investment requirements and projection of deterioration and of treatment impacts aligned to continuous monitoring of asset performance. Following this paradigm shift in infrastructure management, a similar structured methodology to optimise HFD maintenance planning is desired and is introduced in this thesis. The work presented enables the identification of proactive maintenance drivers and potential routes in applying a systemised HFD appraisal and monitoring system. An evaluation of Asset Management prerequisites is thus discussed linked to an overview of strategic requirements to establish such a proactive approach. The thesis identifies condition assessment protocols and focuses on developing the means to evaluate deteriorated characteristics of in service drains using destructive and non-destructive techniques. A probabilistic HFD ageing / renewal model is also proposed using Markov chains. This builds upon existing deterioration understanding and links back to current treatment options and impacts.

40|$|AbstractRecently, the {{disposal}} of dredged soil has become a worldwide problem. In order to utilize high water content soil material, {{it is essential to}} dewater and increase the soil strength. There are urgent demands for developing an alternative new method to dewater the dredged soils in more economical and environment friendly standpoint. Furthermore, by using adsorption effect of porous material such as granular blast furnace slag, there is possibility to establish purification technology of contaminated soil. In this paper, the siphon method is proposed to dewater the high water content dredged soil with horizontally installed plastic board <b>drain</b> and <b>filter</b> material. In order to investigate the availability and effectiveness of this method, series of tests were conducted to investigate the dewatering behaviour and strength of dredged soil with vacuum and siphon methods by using different materials as filter, such as Toyoura sand, zeolite, granular blast furnace slag. High water content dredged soil can be consolidated by using siphon method with saturated filter material such as Toyoura sand. However, it was impossible to dewater dredged soil by using siphon method with unsaturated porous filter material. The water retention tests of soil by using centrifuge method was performed to clarify the mechanism of preventing consolidation dredged soil. The test cannot find an accurate soil-water retention curve of dredged soil because of volume change. The water retention test by suction method was performed and clarify the mechanism that prevents consolidation dredged soil. The cause that prevents consolidation of dredged soil has been presumes by clarifying the air entry value.

40|$|AbstractThe {{deterioration}} of highway <b>filter</b> <b>drains</b> (HFDs) {{is driven by}} the intrusion of foreign particles within the drainage trench. Being a porous material that offers high water removal capacity at the beginning of its service life, the drainage performance of the backfill can be significantly reduced in time by the introduced fouling material. This poses a serious safety hazard for road users (standing water on the carriageway), and can potentially have an effect in the structural capacity of the pavement. With currently limited approaches to methodically evaluate the physical condition of such assets, the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) offers an effective, non-destructive and continuous way to achieve this at both the project and network level. The laboratory calibration study carried out to support its adoption in a condition assessment system, builds upon the evaluation of a HFD-specific condition index aligned to permeability trials and the extraction of dielectric properties of the granular backfill material at different fouled states. The paper thus discusses what kind of HFD distress information are to be collected (condition data) and how this can be achieved (data collection methods), and defines four distinctive HFD media condition bands (Excellent to Very Poor) based on the proposed free voids ratio (RFV) ranges and extracted relative permittivity values...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea behind}} SuDS {{is to try}} to {{replicate}} the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low environmental impact to drain away dirty and surface water run-off through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses.

The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), rain gardens (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), swales (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), <b>filter</b> <b>drains</b> (gravel filled trench drain), bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other wetland habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.|$|R

Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) present {{a change in}} thinking with regards to drainage; storing water in the urban environment as opposed to rapidly removing it to outflows. The Non-Statutory Standards for SuDS (DEFRA 2015 a) presented a requirement for all developments to integrate SuDS in their design to reduce runoff. This research models the impact on water quantity of combining different SuDS devices to demonstrate their success as a flood management system, as compared to conventional pipe based drainage. The research uses MicroDrainage®, the UK industry standard flood modelling tool which has an integrated SuDS function, to simulate the role of SuDS in a management train. As space is often cited as {{the primary reason for}} rejecting SuDS, determining the most effective technique at reducing runoff is critical. Detention basins were concluded as being highly effective at reducing peak flow (150 l/s when combined with swales), however Porous Pavement Systems (PPS) was nearly twice as effective per m 3, reducing peak flow by up to 0. 075 l/s/m 3 compared to 0. 025 l/s/m 3. This therefore suggests that both detention basins and PPS should be high priority devices when developing new sites, but that no matter what combination of modelled SuDS are installed a reduction in runoff in comparison to conventional drainage can be achieved. A SuDS decision support tool was developed to assist design in MicroDrainage® by reducing the time spent determining the number of SuDS required for a site. The tool uses outputs from MicroDrainage® to rapidly predict the minimum and maximum peak flow for a site, in comparison to greenfield runoff, based on the site parameters of area, rainfall rate, infiltration, combined with the planned SuDS. The tool was underpinned by a model analysis for each site parameter and each SuDS device, which produced r 2 values > 0. 8, with 70 % above 0. 9. This ensured a high level of confidence in the outputs, enabling a regression analysis between runoff and each site parameter and SuDS device at the 99 % confidence level, with the outputs combined to create the tool. The final aspect of the research validated MicroDrainage® to analyse the accuracy of the software at predicting runoff. Using field data from Hamilton, Leicester, and laboratory data for PPS and <b>filter</b> <b>drains,</b> a comparison could be made with the output from MicroDrainage®. The field data created a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0. 88, with <b>filter</b> <b>drains</b> and PPS providing an NSE of 0. 98 and 0. 94 respectively. This demonstrates the success with which MicroDrainage® predicts runoff and provides credibility to the outputs of the research. Furthermore, it offers SuDS specialists the confidence to use MicroDrainage® to predict runoff when using SuDS...|$|R
