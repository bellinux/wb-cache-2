Isabeau died there in 1435. Her death and funeral were <b>documented</b> <b>by</b> Jean Chartier (member of St Denis Abbey) who may well have been an eyewitness.|$|E
5|$|Noticeable musical {{differences}} in the southern type include increased use of interval part singing and {{a greater variety of}} folk instruments. The Celtic and Slavic influences on the group and open-voice choral works of the north yield to a stronger Arabic, Greek, and North African-influenced strident monody of the south. In parts of Apulia (Grecìa Salentina, for example) the Griko dialect is commonly used in song. The Apulian city of Taranto is a home of the tarantella, a rhythmic dance widely performed in southern Italy. Apulian music in general, and Salentine music in particular, has been well researched and <b>documented</b> <b>by</b> ethnomusicologists and by Aramirè.|$|E

At these sessions decisions were made, laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law Ting Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E

The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these Obsidian Cliff and five buildings have been designated National Historic Landmarks. Yellowstone was designated an International Biosphere Reserve on October 26, 1976, and a UN World Heritage Site on September 8, 1978. The park {{was placed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger from 1995 to 2003 due to the effects of tourism, infection of wildlife, and issues with invasive species. In 2010, Yellowstone National Park was honored with its own quarter under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans to}} {{undertake}} a major restoration of Mdina's walls were made in 2006, {{as part of a}} project that also included restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu and the Cittadella. In the case of Mdina, the main focus was to consolidate the terrain, since the city is built on a blue clay plateau which is prone to subsidence. The multimillion-euro restoration was partially financed by the European Regional Development Fund. Works began in early 2008 by the Restoration Unit. The process of restoration was <b>documented</b> <b>by</b> Dr. Spiteri.|$|E
5|$|The fungus, first <b>documented</b> <b>by</b> naturalist John Burton Cleland in {{the early}} 20th century, was {{initially}} assumed to be the close relative Macrolepiota procera, a European species now known to be absent from Australia. Australian mycologist Cheryl Grgurinovic recognized Cleland's collections as a distinct species, officially describing it in 1997. The fungus {{has been referred to}} by several names: M.konradii, M.gracilenta, and M.mastoidea. Else Vellinga showed using molecular phylogenetic analysis that these names refer to European species and were misapplied by Australian authors.|$|E

5|$|U 956 {{was first}} <b>documented</b> <b>by</b> Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the {{inscription}} was legible {{in spite of the}} stone having been split in two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in south-eastern Europe from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had been wrong and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being split in two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Zaimeche further {{observed}} that Islamic agricultural practice was <b>documented</b> <b>by</b> the mediaeval agronomists Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl (11th century) of Toledo {{in his book}} Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them, including leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested, and gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E
