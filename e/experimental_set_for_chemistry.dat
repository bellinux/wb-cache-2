The transition occurs as the disordered hosting material passes from being linear to one with extreme nonlinearity. As the response grows, increased wave interaction causes a modulational unstable quasihomogeneous flow to be superseded by a chaotic and spatially incoherent one. Statistical analysis of high-resolution wave behavior in the turbulent regime unveils the emergence of concomitant rogue waves.

The proposed structure therefore provides an <b>experimental</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> exploring discrete effects in a controlled manner. In particular, we show propagation of breathers that are eventually trapped by discreteness.

For the dynamics of the living, the physics of the matter making up the living is only a partial description of their change over time. The space of possibilities is the missing component, complementary to physics and its associated predictions based on probabilistic methods.

40|$|The {{existence}} of compacton matter waves in binary mixtures of quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices {{and in the}} presence of nonlinearity management, is first demonstrated. For this, we derive an averaged vector discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLSE) and show that compacton solutions of different types can exist as stable excitations. Stability properties are studied by linear analysis and by direct numerical integrations of the DNLSE system and their dependence on the inter- and intra-species scattering lengths, investigated. We show that under proper management conditions, compactons can be very robust excitations that can emerge spontaneously from generic initial conditions. A possible <b>experimental</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> compacton observation is also discussed. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, Physical Review A in pres...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of malignant brain tumors is their extensive tissue invasion, which represents a major obstacle for effective treatment. In this paper we specifically model the invasive behavior of such tumors viewed as complex dynamic biosystems. Based on the spatio-temporal patterns seen in an <b>experimental</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> multicellular brain tumor spheroids we propose an invasion-guiding, dynamical profile of heterotype and homotype attractor substances. We present a novel theoretical and numerical framework for a mathematical tumor model composed of a set of coupled reaction-diffusion equations describing chemotactic and haptotactic cell behavior. In particular, our continuum model simulates tumor cell motility guided by the principle of least resistance, most permission and highest attraction. Preliminary numerical results indicate that the computational algorithm is capable of reproducing patterns similar to the experimentally observed behavior. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

Within {{the premises of}} Two Temperature Model (TTM), explicit expressions of the imaginary part of the Memory Function or generalized Drude scattering rate (1 /τ) are obtained. In the DC limit and in equilibrium case where electron temperature (T_e) is equal to phonon temperature (T), we reproduce the known results (i. e. 1 /τ∝ T^ 4 when T>Θ_BG, where Θ_BG is the Bloch-Grüneisen temperature). We report several new results for 1 / τ where T ≠ T_e relevant in pump-probe spectroscopic experiments. In the finite frequency regime, we find that 1 /τ∝ω^ 2 when ω>ω_BG it is ω independent and also electron temperature independent. These results can be verified in a typical pump-probe <b>experimental</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> graphene. Comment: 5 figures and 2 Table...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{previous}} studies on perceptions of inequality, welfare and risk we investigate {{the structure of}} individuals' rankings of uncertain prospects in terms of risk {{and their relationship to}} individual preferences. We examine three interlinked propositions that are fundamental to the standard economic approach to risk: (i) that rankings by risk are simply the reverse of ranking by preference over distributions with a given mean; (ii) that risk-rankings respect the principle of mean-preserving spreads; (iii) that risk-rankings are independent of whether the individual is personally involved in the gains/losses associated with the uncertain prospects. To do this we use a set of questionnaires implemented through the Virtual Laboratory, a novel <b>experimental</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> the study of normative issues in experimental economics. The results from the questionnaires provide an evaluation of the similitude between individual perceptions of risk and theoretical axioms.

40|$|Source {{synchronous}} links {{for use in}} multi-synchronous networks-on-chip (NoCs) {{are becoming}} the most vulnerable points for correct network operation and must be safeguarded against intra-link delay variations and signal misalignments. The intricacy of matching link net attributes during placement and routing and the growing role of process parameter variations in nanoscale silicon technologies are the root causes for this. This article addresses the challenge of designing a process variation and layout mismatch tolerant link for synchronizer-based GALS NoCs by implementing a self-calibration mechanism. A variation detector senses the variability-induced misalignment between data lines with themselves and with the transmitter clock routed with data in source synchronous links. A suitable delayed replica of the transmitter clock is then selected for safe sampling of misaligned data.
