5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing Angle to crash into the referee, knocking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab Angle and perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted Styles.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E

5|$|The seventh {{match of}} the show pitted Jeff Jarrett against Kurt Angle, with Mick Foley serving as the Special Ringside Enforcer. Jarrett gained a near-fall in the contest when he suplexed Angle {{off the top of}} a turnbuckle. Jarrett then placed Angle in a Figure-Four Leglock {{submission}} hold, which was broken by the referee when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. Angle fought back with a series of consecutive German suplexes, forcing Jarrett against the mat back-first. He then placed Jarrett in his signature Ankle lock submission hold, which Jarrett fought Angle to get released. Angle gained a near-fall by slamming Jarrett back-first against the mat with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver. Afterwards, Angle missed an areial splash from the top of a turnbuckle, when Jarrett moved out of the way. Angle then accidentally hit the referee, knocking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storyline. Jarrett followed by performing his signature Stroke maneuver on Angle, with Foley counting the pinfall attempt before Angle kicked out. Afterwards, Angle hit Jarrett in the groin and then attacked Foley with a steel chair at ringside, before returning to the ring to hit Jarrett with the chair as well. Angle then revived the referee who counted Angle's pinfall attempt before Foley stopped the count by pulling the referee from the ring. Foley then attacked Angle and applied his signature Mandible Claw submission hold. Jarrett followed up by bashing a guitar over Angle's head and covering for a pinfall that Foley counted to win the match at 20 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} late in 1996, now aged 39, {{and beat}} undefeated Bobby Harris. He followed this {{up with two}} more wins before a high-profile fight on HBO with Tongan Samson Po'uha, in 1997. He decked Po'uha several times before knocking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 8th round.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Mysterium Cosmographicum, the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe said the ideas were intriguing but {{could only be}} verified through the observations Brahe himself had been making over the past 30 years. Because he was promised use of these observations by Brahe, Kepler sought <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of 1600. Brahe, however, only gave him the data on Mars.|$|E
25|$|The rematch {{was set for}} April 1963; however, Liston {{injured his}} knee {{swinging}} a golf club and the fight was delayed to July 22, 1963.

He {{finished}} in the top six on ten occasions, eight of them on the podium, and took wins in Britain, Hungary and Australia. The massed Italian contingent helped <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final round, but it was still an impressive achievement, with 182 points scored.|$|E
25|$|De La Hoya took a layoff of 20 {{months before}} signing to fight WBC light middleweight titleholder Ricardo Mayorga (27–5–1). In the buildup to the fight, Mayorga insulted {{everything}} from De La Hoya's sexuality {{to his wife}} and child, but when they fought on May 6, 2006, De La Hoya knocked Mayorga down in the first minute of the fight with a left hook. He knocked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth round to take his tenth world title.|$|E
25|$|Although Baer {{had been}} knocked down only once before in his {{professional}} career (by Frankie Campbell), Louis dominated the former champion, knocking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth round. Unknowingly, Baer {{suffered from a}} unique disadvantage in the fight; earlier that evening, Louis had married Marva Trotter at a friend's apartment and was eager to end the fight in order to consummate the relationship. Later that year, Louis also knocked out Paolino Uzcudun, {{who had never been}} knocked down before.|$|E

25|$|Two end of {{the season}} outings in Formula Three rounded out 1999. At Macau, Yoong went from 23rd on his way to ninth in the first heat before a 12th-place finish in the second to finish seventh overall. In the Korean Formula Three Grand Prix at Changwon, an altercation with a backmarker placed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first race, but the second heat saw a late-race charge from the back to snatch 10th on the final lap but was not {{classified}} overall because of this first heat retirement.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{interest}} in a bout with Khan, Floyd Mayweather {{announced that he would}} fight 30 year old Marcos Maidana (35–3, 31 KOs) on 3 May 2014. On 24 March, Khan decided to fight 32 year old former champion Luis Collazo (35-5, 18 KOs) on the undercard at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Prior to the fight, Collazo han't lost since October 2011. The fight was for the vacant WBA International welterweight title and WBA title eliminator as well as Vacant WBC Silver title. Khan was too fast and too disciplined for Collazo, flooring him in the fourth round and twice in the 10th. The judges scored the fight 117-106, 119-104, 119-104 in Khan's favour. Khan and Collazo both incurred point deductions in round 8. Collazo hit Khan with a low blow while Khan was holding his head down. Collazo's failed approach resulted in a mismatch on the scorecards. Collazo fought with his hands down most of the night, unafraid of Khan, believing Khan had no power and he would eventually knock <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> post fight interview in the ring after the bout, Khan credited his 12 months of boxing training with Virgil Hunter for his success. Khan's purse for the fight was $1.5m while Collazo earned $350,000.|$|E
500|$|Colleen McCullough {{is another}} author who {{incorporates}} both the medieval Achilles' seeking Troilus out in battle {{and the ancient}} butchery at the altar. Her The Song of Troy includes two characters, Troilos and Ilios, who are Priam's youngest children – both with prophecies attached and both specifically named for the city's founders. They are eight and seven respectively when Paris leaves for Greece and somewhere {{in their late teens}} when killed. Troilos is made Priam's heir after Hector's death, against the boy's will. Odysseus's spies learn of the prophecy that Troy will not fall if Troilos comes of age. Achilles therefore seeks <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next battle and kills him with a spear-cast to his throat. In a reference to the medieval concept of Troilus as the second Hector, Automedon observes that [...] "with a few more years added, he might have made another Hektor." [...] Ilios is the last son of Priam to die, killed at the altar in front of his parents by Neoptolemos.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} calling to <b>him</b> <b>out</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open. His mother heard it too.

50|$|Enriquez {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} home in Cerritos, California but hung <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Artesia, California.

500|$|The {{next major}} arc, [...] "Fear and Loathing" [...] (issues 62-67) covers {{a high point}} of John's {{personal}} life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a fortieth birthday party where his friends Ellie, Zatanna, and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of Bushmills whiskey and marijuana. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the National Front, their threats towards Kit, and her leaving {{him to return to}} Ireland. Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life. This remains the case until the King of the Vampires hunts him out, and is poisoned by his demon blood, leaving <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun at dawn, killing him. Following his recovery, the storyline [...] "Damnation's Flame" [...] (Issues #72–77) follows a trip to the US, where Constantine is put into an alternative America by his old adversary Papa Midnite, a Vodun shaman. He is accompanied by the spirit of JFK, who has to hold his brain in place from his infamous wound. He eventually learns how to escape, shortly before running into the First of the Fallen, in the guise of Abraham Lincoln. There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems. Ennis' run ends with [...] "Rake at the Gates of Hell", a story which finally brings together the racism storyline, with riots in Mile End, echoing the real-life Brixton and Broadwater Farm riots in London, the revenge attempt of the First of the Fallen, started in [...] "Dangerous Habits", and the end of John's relationship with Kit Ryan. John's eventual Pyrrhic victory leaves this run with closure, and a relatively clean slate for a new writer to take over.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards Spinks said: [...] "I came {{to fight}} like I said I would. I {{just tried to}} do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round. So I went out and knocked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round. And later I {{found out he was}} fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
