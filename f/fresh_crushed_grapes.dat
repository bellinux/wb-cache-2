40|$|Producing wine {{is a very}} {{important}} economic activity in the province of San Juan in Argentina; it is therefore most important to predict production regarding the quantity of raw material needed. This work was aimed at obtaining a model relating kilograms of <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> to the litres of wine so produced. Such model will be used for predicting precise future values and confidence intervals for determined quantities of <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes.</b> Data from a vineyard in the province of San Juan was thus used in this work. The sampling coefficient of correlation was calculated and a dispersion diagram was then constructed; this indicated a li- neal relationship between the litres of wine obtained and the kilograms of <b>crushed</b> <b>grape.</b> Two lineal models were then adopted and variance analysis was carried out because the data came from normal populations having the same variance. The most appropriate model was obtained from this analysis; it was validated with experimental values, a good approach being obtained...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the quality of hen eggs changes after adding <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> seeds in the compound feed of the hens. Grape seeds are formed as a side product during wine making processes and contain large amounts of biologically active substances and suitable acids, which can improve the feed conversion and subsequently also improve the technological properties of eggs. With processing of grape seeds the effective utilization of crop residues in vineyards comes about. The experiment was conducted in two experimental periods and in each period 100 laying hens were surveyed. They were separated into two groups an experimental and a control one. In the control group the hens were fed with a standard mixture of N 2 feed and in the experimental group there was a supplement of 5 weight percent of <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> seeds in the compound feed. Eggs were collected daily and once every two weeks an analysis of technological properties of eggs was conducted. The results of the experiment showed that the addition of <b>crushed</b> <b>grape</b> seeds containing a biologically active substance did not have a statistically significant effect on the quality and selected technological parameters of eggs...|$|R

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{production}} surplus of grapes {{in the wine}} industry and, at the same time, to meet the growing de- mand of nutritious foods by health-conscious consumers, alternative processes with better sustainability are needed. In the production of colored grape juices for direct consumption, the application of heat on <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> is a possible technology to increase extraction of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds. To achieve this aim, three different thermal treatments were performed on <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> of two different red varieties with peonidin or malvidin prevalence in the anthocyanin profile. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the chem- ical composition and color characteristics of the juices were evaluated to pinpoint the time–temperature combi- nation that allowed the highest extraction of anthocyanins. Furthermore, the modification of skin mechanical properties during thermal treatment and impact of the peonidin/malvidin ratio on juice color were investigated. The use of high temperatures for short times was the most profitable time–temperature combination based on the extraction efficacy, color stability and energetic requirements...|$|R

50|$|Other {{experts think}} tannins are {{the cause of}} RWH. Tannins are the {{flavonoids}} in wine that give its degree of mouth-drying bitterness.

40|$|In this paper, our {{objective}} was to investigate extraction efficiency of polyphenols with antioxidant capacity from two varieties of grapes (white-Muscat Ottonel (MO) and red-Pinot Noir (PN)) using pulsed electric field (PEF). Grapes were harvested in the Crisana Santimreu vineyard in 2015. The grapes were declustered and crushed, and have been divided into three parts. A part was treated in PEF, the second one was homogenized, and then was treated in PEF and the last part remained untreated, representing the control samples. The bioactive compounds, like total polyphenol content and total flavonoid content, were determined by the spectrophotometric method. The antioxidant capacity of the samples was determined by three methods (DPPH, FRAPand TEAC). Our {{results show that the}} application of PEF to the <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> increases the total polyphenol content 2. 28 and 3. 15 times and the total flavonoid content 7. 17 and 5. 29 times for MO and PN, respectively. Also, the antioxidant capacity was significantly increased when it was compared with the control sample. When the treatment in PEF was applied on homogenized grapes both bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity were significantly increased compared to the samples treated in PEF for <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes.</b> In the present research work, we demonstrated that the application of PEF to two different grape varieties significantly increased the level of total polyphenols and flavonoids and also the antioxidant capacity. The application of PEF to homogenized grapes was more efficient...|$|R
40|$|IIn winemaking, {{although}} some {{research has been}} carried out, the practical application is still in an early stage. The cavitation process induced by ultrasounds leads to the breakage of the cells walls, thus facilitates {{the release of the}} cell content in the wine. The aim of this work is to study the effects produced by the ultrasound on <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes,</b> seeds, lees, and wines, in order to verify the possible speeding up of the extraction, the polymerization of the phenolic compounds, and the release of compounds from the yeast cells. After some preliminary tests, an experimental design has been created to optimize the test conditions, like time, amplitude and frequency. After different laboratory activities, recent experience in the cellar with a prototype have confirmed the possibility of using ultrasound for a short time (3 - 5 minutes) as a pre-treatment on <b>crushed</b> red <b>grapes</b> for the extraction of polyphenols and on <b>crushed</b> white <b>grapes</b> for the extraction of aromas. The treatment on the lees has confirmed the possibility of shortening the time of aging on the lees. Also good results have been reached in young red wines using the ultrasound to promote a positive tannin evolution. Experiences are ongoing to create an industrial plant for treatment with ultrasound in cellar, with variable flow rates between 50 and 300 hL/h; we are also being studied further applications in other stages of the winemaking process...|$|R
50|$|A {{wine press}} is a device used to extract juice from <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> during wine making. There {{are a number}} of {{different}} styles of presses that are used by wine makers but their overall functionality is the same. Each style of press exerts controlled pressure in order to free the juice from the fruit (most often grapes). The pressure must be controlled, especially with grapes, in order to avoid crushing the seeds and releasing a great deal of undesirable tannins into the wine. Wine was being made at least as long ago as 6000 BC; in 2011, a wine press was unearthed in Armenia with red wine dated 6,000 years old.|$|R
50|$|Semi-carbonic {{maceration}} is the winemaking technique where grapes are {{put through}} {{a short period}} of carbonic maceration, followed by conventional yeast fermentations. This is the process used in the production of Beaujolais nouveau wines. To an extent, most wines were historically treated to some form of semi or partial carbonic fermentation (as noted in history section above) with the amount dependent on the shape and size of the vessel that the grapes were stored in prior to crushing. The deeper the vessel, the greater the proportion of grapes that could be exposed to an anaerobic environment caused by the release of carbon dioxide from the <b>crushed</b> <b>grapes</b> on the bottom.|$|R
