5|$|The <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{relies on}} {{the memory of the}} would-be predator; a bird that has once {{experienced}} a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{examined}} either coping strategies or defence mechanisms; however, few have considered both. This research examined age differences {{in the type of}} <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and coping strategies that people employ. In addition, gender differences, personality, and environmental variables were taken into account. The three age groups used in this study included: 17 - 23 year olds, 40 - 47 year olds, and 63 - 70 year olds. The youngest participants used significantly less mature <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and significantly more immature <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> than the middle-aged and the oldest group. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in maturity of <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> between the middle-aged and the oldest group. In contrast, there were no age differences revealed for effectiveness of coping strategies people employ. One further interesting finding was that people with a higher purpose in life were more likely to use mature <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This research concludes that when developing theories on stress, psychologists might benefit from considering both <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and coping strategies...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{relationship}} between <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> coping strategies, palliative attitude, and the well-being of caregivers in palliative care units, who are confronted with death, suffering, and pain. They use many different defence mechanisms; however, studies linking their coping strategies and <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are rare. This study uses a quantitative and qualitative design and is based on 18 caregivers (nurses) in 2 palliative care units in Belgium. <b>Defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are tested through a semi-structured interview, TAT, and DSQ- 60. Coping strategies are evaluated through a semistructured interview, COPE, and WCQ. To maximize our global approach, coping strategies and <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are associated with measures of wellbeing and palliative attitude. We determined that <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and coping strategies should not be seen as obstacles to professional practices. Palliative caregivers are more likely to adopt “mature” and “mental inhibition and compromise formation” <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as well as “emotion-focused” and “problem-focused” coping strategies. <b>Defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are more unconscious and constitute appropriate answers in extreme emotional situations. Coping strategies allow for more conscious processes of adaptation to the environment of palliative care units. This study shows positive relationships between different <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and coping strategies, palliative attitudes, and caregivers’ well-being. Institutions should improve the conditions for group exchange and for caregivers’ individual introspection so that caregivers develop adapted capacities to cope with anxiety. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism</b> by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and attachment styles in paranoid ideation through a cross-sectional design with sequential recruitment of subjects. Methods. Five hundred and fifty non-clinical subjects were recruited from university students. A psychometric protocol comprising paranoid ideation scale of Symptoms Check List (SCL- 90 -R-Par) to identify paranoid ideation, Defence Style Questionnaire (DSQ- 40) to evaluate <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to measure attachment styles was then administered. Results. We found a significant predictive value of immature <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (Â®= 0. 48; p< 0. 0001) and preoccupied attachment style (Â®= 0. 25; p< 0. 0001) in the paranoid ideation. Moreover, subjects reporting a preoccupied or fearful attachment style showed higher levels of paranoia. Conclusions. This study revealed that paranoid ideation is mainly characterised by immature <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> A clear insecure attachment style associated with paranoia was also found. The assessment of paranoid ideation should therefore consider the role of attachment style and <b>defence</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as an integral part during the diagnostic and therapeutic processes...|$|R

5|$|Isopoda is {{an order}} of {{crustaceans}} that includes woodlice and their relatives. Isopods live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of jointed limbs on the thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen {{that are used in}} respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers, or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fishes. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism</b> or to conserve moisture.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. In tests, P. schultzi is killed in 1.7% of pursuits and injured but not killed in 5.3%, P. labiata is killed in 2.1% and injured but not killed in 3.9%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is killed in 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia bleeds and may sometimes loses one or more legs. Spiders' palps and legs break off easily when attacked, Portia′s palps and legs break off exceptionally easily, which may be a <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism</b> to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

25|$|Plants {{responded to}} fungal {{colonisation}} in different ways, {{depending on the}} fungus. The rhizoids of Nothia displayed three responses to fungal infestation: the hyphae of some (mutualistic) colonists were encased by plant cell walls; other (parasitic) fungi were met with typical host responses of increased rhizome cell size; while yet other fungi solicited an increase in thickness and pigmentation of cell walls. Once inside a plant cell, fungi produced spores, which are found in decaying plant cells; the cells may have decayed as a <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism</b> to prevent the fungi from spreading.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} has many defense {{mechanisms}} against pathogens, {{one of which}} is humoral immunity. This <b>defence</b> <b>mechanism</b> produces antibodies (large glycoproteins) in response to an immune stimulus. Many cells of the immune system are required for this process, including lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells) and antigen presenting cells. These cells coordinate an immune response upon the detection of foreign proteins (antigens), producing antibodies that bind to these antigens. In normal physiology, lymphocytes that recognise human proteins (autoantigens) either undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) or become non-functional. This self-tolerance means that lymphocytes should not incite an immune response against human cellular antigens. Sometimes, however, this process malfunctions and antibodies are produced against human antigens, which may lead to autoimmune disease.|$|E

40|$|The Firmicutes {{constitute}} a phylum of bacteria {{that can be}} found in a wide variety of habitats, from soil to the gastrointestinal tract of animals, where they have to thrive in complex communities.
