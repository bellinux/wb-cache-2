40|$|Abstract: Failure to risk-adjust <b>estimates</b> of <b>profits,</b> from central-bank foreign {{exchange}} intervention or from private speculation, can have large {{effects on the}} <b>estimated</b> <b>profits,</b> including changing signs. Many choices arise in deciding how to adjust profits for risk. The time period over which a market model is fit has mixed effects on calendar-year profits; variations in profits across calendar years {{is much more important}} than the period over which the market model is fit. In some cases, but not in all, results are sensitive to whether a U. S. stock market index is used or a world market index. For non-U. S. central banks or private speculators, the relevant market index might be denominated in USD, but alternatively might be denominated in a foreign currency. For the Swedish central bank, <b>estimated</b> <b>profits</b> decline importantly if an index measured in USD is used instead of an index measured in SEK. In estimating market models where beta is conditioned on some measure of intervention, likely candidates are intervention or cumulative intervention; the first has an effect for one or a few days, the second has long-term effects. Estimates show that the choice can make an important difference, though the effects are not all one way...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} intensified international competition on industry profits in six European Union (EU) countries. The paper uses two methods to <b>estimate</b> industry <b>profits.</b> The traditional method uses accounting data to obtain a measure of gross price-average cost margins. The second method directly estimates markups of price over marginal cost using new empirical techniques. Import competition is found to have disciplined market power, regardless of the method used to <b>estimate</b> industry <b>profits.</b> From {{the analysis of the}} markups, there is evidence that this is due mainly to intra-EU import competition. The evidence for export discipline is much weaker. ...|$|R
