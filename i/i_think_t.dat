5000|$|In 2008, {{following}} his success on Rockstar: INXS, Casey and fashion industry veteran, Marla Zegart, founded the Silver Elements collection. This collection features silver jewelry and accessories. Zegart {{is a fan}} of Casey and, on a whim, approached him after a show and [...] "told him he had a great sense of style, and asked him if he would think of doing something together." [...] She says of Casey: [...] "You know, {{there are a lot of}} celebrities who just attach their name to something but Marty is co-designer on this. It’s not just his name. He’s an integral part of the design process, the ideas; he’s very involved; he’s part of every single piece." [...] All purchases support the [...] "Marty Casey Elements of Nature Fund," [...] which plants trees in conjunction with American Forests “Global Releaf” Ecosystem Restoration Project. The founding piece is the Trees Dog Tag necklace, named for the original song he first performed live on Rockstar: INXS. [...] The collection has expanded to include not only jewelry and watches, but high end accessories such as leather bags, sunglasses, scarves, and even a photo frame.Marty describes the Silver Elements Collection:The strength of the line is that it’s keeping the tie between fashion and music. When I have the opportunity to play music, I don’t necessarily want to be just in a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>t</b> of it more as a performance, you know? You want to get up there and do this performance and you want to dress the part too; wear something unique to make yourself stand out, and when Marla came to me with the idea of beginning the line, she really understood that.You like to stand out and do unique things and make something that’s completely your own. But really, the key for us is having the music being so connected to the jewelry because that’s our niche; that’s where we fit in, why we’re different.Not many people are necessarily doing this. A well known singer and performer may have a designer line, but it’s usually not tied into their music at all. It’s tied into their name but not necessarily to what they’re about and who they are and what their music is about. So really fusing those and keeping those so tight; that’s the foundation of the line.When we release a new piece, we have a piece of unreleased music that goes along with it too. I think that’s really where we’re having the most fun- thinking about how the piece ties into the music. That, and working with the community and people who back the line.It’s more than the fan base. I mean, a lot of people we’ve gotten to know personally, and they’ve become a part of our lives. It’s kind of tying everybody in closer and closer and bringing it together, and I think having a charity at the root of it- It not only makes us feel good to know that we’re doing something, but it’s kind of nice knowing that there’s this real passion behind the line. It’s not all commerce- there’s really some good being done.” ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{carried out}} the {{experiments}} with th e newly devised Jikeikai Artificial Kidney (Blood Cleaner) 2 times on normal dogs and 4 times on uremic dogs. These have the purpose that the apparatus is applied to animals safely and to decide the efficiency and the conditions for removal of nonprotein nitrogen from the blood. The apparatus was used in these experiments, namely a modified type of Blood Cleaner, devised by one of our members, Dr. Kushimoto, and that the principle is applied to Electro-dialysis technique by direct current. The dialyzing surface area is only 33 cm 2 and the membrane is made of cellophane. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>t</b> h at the apparatus will be used clinically in the near future. Principal results were summarized as follows. 1) This apparatu s permitted safe application to animals for a maximum time of 4 hours. 2) The efficiency of this apparatus, consisted in the capacity to remove about 10 mg/d 1 nonprotein nitrogen hourly on uremic dogs (17 - 20 kg). 3) It was possible to increase to 20 - 30 V olt (potential gradient 4. 3 - 6. 6 Volt/cm) and to l 000 m A current (current density 30 mA/cm 2) 4) Adequate blood flow was 1 0 0 - 200 cc/min. 5) Bath fluid amounts to abo u t 41 during dialysis of 3 hours. 6) Bath fluid pH was possible to adjust 7. 4 always by a d ding N aH 2 PO 4. 7) Leucocytes and thrombocytes decreased, and mononuclear l e ucocytes increased on hemogram during dialysis. 8) Bloodp H d i d not show any change, but blood CO 2 content decreased after dialysis. 9) Heparin Dose It was possible to prevent clotting and hemolysis by giving initially 3 mg/kg of Heparin intravenously and additional 2 mg/kg hourly...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{acquisition}} of long-distance questions and the principles of Universal Grammar that govern them (Chomsky 1981; 1986). The questions under investigation are all ones in which a Wh-phrase is moved from an embedded clause, leaving a Wh-trace at the extraction site. Using an elicited production methodology, it is demonstrated that even three-year-old children readily produce a variety of long-distance questions. The methodology is refined to probe children 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of two principles that constrain production of long-distance questions. One principle governs wanna contraction, prohibiting contraction across a Wh-trace in extracting from infinitival clauses, as in (1). The second principle, the Empty Category Principle (ECP), restricts extraction from {{the subject of a}} tensed embedded clause, ruling out questions like (2) with an overt complementizer (that) :^ (1) *Who do you wanna help you? (cf. Who do you want to help you?) ^ (2) *Who do you think that 2 ̆ 7 s in the box? (cf. Who do you think is in the box?) ^ Another methodology, the Truth Value Judgment task, supplements the data from elicited production by studying a constraint that restricts the meanings that can be assigned to long-distance questions. This constraint of 2 ̆ 2 Strong Crossover 2 ̆ 2 prohibits Wh-movement over a pronoun with the same index, ruling out a bound interpretation of the pronoun, as indicated in (3) :^ (3) *Who i does he <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>t</b> i has a hat? (cf. Who i thinks he i has a hat?) ^ The findings were that children adhered to the constraints on wanna contraction and Strong Crossover. In extracting from tensed clauses, however, several children consistently produced ungrammatical questions like (2), in apparent violation of the ECP. Other non-adult questions like (4) appeared. I call these 2 ̆ 2 medial-Wh 2 ̆ 2 questions. ^ (4) Who do you think who 2 ̆ 7 s in the box?^ To explain the problematic data, I explore several current formulations of the ECP. A version by Rizzi (1990) is seen to provide a unified explanation of children 2 ̆ 7 s exceptional questions of both kinds. In this framework, these questions are not interpreted as ECP violations but, rather, as attempts by children to preserve the ECP. In sum, the findings support the view that, by three, children have mastered long-distance movement questions and the constraints that apply to them. ...|$|E

500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Ted</b> may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|R

60|$|Once more I had {{an author}} for whom I {{could feel a}} {{personal}} devotion, whom I could dream of and dote upon, and whom I could offer my intimacy in many an impassioned revery. <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>T.</b> B. Macaulay would really have liked it; I dare say {{he would not have}} valued the friendship of the sort of a youth I was, but in the conditions he was helpless, and I poured out my love upon him without a rebuff. Of course I reformed my prose style, which had been carefully modelled upon that of Goldsmith and Irving, and began to write in the manner of Macaulay, in short, quick sentences, and with the prevalent use of brief Anglo-Saxon words, which he prescribed, but did not practise. As for his notions of literature, I simply accepted them with the feeling that any question of them would have been little better than blasphemy.|$|R
5000|$|Joyce Eng of TV Guide {{said that}} she'd prefer Ted {{not to have}} ended up with Robin, but [...] "as I {{consider}} the romantics that co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas are, it's obvious they would bring this long, winding love story full circle back to the person Ted {{wanted to be with}} when we met him. And The Mother — excuse us, Tracy — is reunited with her first true love, Max, too." [...] Though the Mother served as a [...] "cheap plot device" [...] to a degree, Eng said that [...] "Ted's time with her also taught him nothing lasts forever, nothing's perfect. And he needs to move on with his life, but that doesn't make his relationship with The Mother any less important. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> the <b>Ted</b> of 2005 would've done the same." ...|$|R
