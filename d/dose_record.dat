40|$|A large measles {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} Quebec, Canada, in 2011. Although {{nearly two-thirds of}} the cases occurred in only two health districts, a mass vaccination campaign targeting all Quebec elementary and high school students without valid two-dose history was undertaken to prevent future outbreaks. We compared rates of non-vaccination and age at first measles vaccine dose among students in the two most-affected districts {{and the rest of the}} province and estimated the improvement in overall student measles immunity due to the mass school-based vaccination campaign. Data were extracted from the provincial vaccination registry for students in kindergarten to grade 11 during the 2011 / 2012 school year. A telephone survey was conducted in three sub-groups: students whose first measles vaccine <b>dose</b> <b>recorded</b> in the vaccination registry was received during the 2011 school vaccination campaign; students with no <b>dose</b> <b>recorded</b> in the registry whose parents refused receipt during the school campaign; and students with no <b>dose</b> <b>recorded</b> in the registry and no information about parental consent/refusal during the school campaign. Neither the prevalence of being non-vaccinated nor a younger age at first pediatric dose were higher in the two most-affected districts versus the rest of the province. The school campaign vaccinated nearly 8 % of all students including 7 % who previously received at least one dose. Before the outbreak, 3 % of students were not vaccinated and one-third of these (1 %/ 3 %) were vaccinated during the campaign. The campaign likely increased the absolute school population immunity by just 1. 7 %. The concentration of measles cases in the two most-affected health districts during the large Quebec outbreak is not explained by more students who were unvaccinated or who had received their first vaccine dose at a younger age.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} was aimed at {{evaluating}} the occupational exposure of nursing staff in charge of inpatients undergoing 131 I therapy during 11 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The exposure situa-tions were classified according to a questionnaire answered by three nursing attendants, correlating the pro-cedures with activities, distances and {{amount of time in}} the iodotherapy room. <b>Records</b> of received <b>doses</b> by two types of dosimeters were evaluated over two subsequent periods. In both periods the nursing atten-dants received instructions about radiological protection. RESULTS: In usual situations, their amount of time in the iodotherapy room was in compliance with the standard time established by the service. In unusual situations, where the patient needed assistance for mobility, the exposure period was above the standard. However, this exposure occurs casually (only one or two times a year). During the period between 1993 and 1999 (dosimetric films) there were ten <b>dose</b> <b>records,</b> all of them at record level. From 2000 to 2003 (ther-moluminescent dosimeters) ten <b>dose</b> <b>records</b> were also obtained, with only one of them at the investigation level.

40|$|Objectives: Contemporary dental {{radiology}} {{offers a}} wide spectrum of imaging methods but it also contributes to an increase in the participation of dental radiological diagnosis in the patient’s exposure to ionizing radiation. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the absorbed doses of the brain, spinal column, thyroid and eye lens for patients during panoramic radiography, cephalometric radiography and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Material and Methods: The thermoluminescent dosimetry and anthropomorphic phantom was used for measuring the doses. The 15 panoramic, 4 cephalometric and 4 CBCT exposures were performed by placing high-sensitivity thermoluminescent detectors (TLD) in 18 anatomical points of the phantom. Results: The maximum absorbed <b>dose</b> <b>recorded</b> during performed measurements corresponds to the point representing the brainstem and it is 10 mGy. The <b>dose</b> value <b>recorded</b> by the TLD placed in the thyroid during CBCT imaging in relation to the panoramic radiography differs by a factor of 13. 5. Conclusions: Cone beam computed tomography, in comparison with panoramic or cephalometric imaging technique, provides higher radiation doses to the patients.

40|$|Background: Protection {{of nuclear}} {{medicine}} unit employees from hazards of the ionizing radiation {{is a crucial}} issue of radiation protection services. We aimed to assess {{the severity of the}} occupational radiation exposure of technicians performing scintigraphic examinations at the Nuclear Medicine Department, Central Teaching Hospital of Medical University in Łódź, where thousands of different diagnostic procedures are performed yearly. Materials and Methods: In 2013 the studied diagnostic unit has employed 10 technicians, whose exposure is permanently monitored by individual dosimetry. We analyzed retrospective data of quarterly doses in terms of Hp(10) dose equivalents over the years 2001 - 2010. Also annual and five-year doses were determined to relate the results to current regulations. Moreover, for a selected period of one year, we collected data on the total activity of radiopharmaceuticals used for diagnostics, to analyze potential relationship with <b>doses</b> <b>recorded</b> in technicians performing the examinations. Results: In a 10 -year period under study, the highest annual <b>dose</b> <b>recorded</b> in a technician was 2 mSv, which represented 10 % of the annual dose limit of 20 mSv. The highest total dose for a 5 -year period was 7. 1 mSv, less than 10 % of a 5 -year dose limit for occupational exposure. Positive linear correlation was observed between total activity of radiopharmaceuticals used for diagnostics in the period of three months and respective quarterly doses received by technicians performing examinations. Conclusions: Doses received by nuclear medicine technicians performing diagnostic procedures in compliance with principles of radiation protection are low, which is confirmed by recognizing the technicians of this unit as B category employees.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} to examine the specific issue {{of the potential for}} unrecorded neutron dose for Hanford workers, particularly in comparison with the recorded whole body (neutron plus photon) dose. During the past several years, historical personnel dosimetry practices at Hanford have been documented in several technical reports. This documentation provides a detailed history of the technology, radiation fields, and administrative practices used to measure and <b>record</b> <b>dose</b> for Hanford workers. Importantly, documentation has been prepared by personnel whose collective experience spans nearly the entire history of Hanford operations beginning in the mid- 1940 s. Evaluations of selected Hanford radiation <b>dose</b> <b>records</b> have been conducted along with statistical profiles of the <b>recorded</b> <b>dose</b> data. The history of Hanford personnel dosimetry is complex, spanning substantial evolution in radiation protection technology, concepts, and standards. Epidemiologic assessments of Hanford worker mortality and radiation dose data were initiated in the early 1960 s. In recent years, Hanford data have been included in combined analyses of worker cohorts from several Department of Energy (DOE) sites and from several countries through the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Hanford data have also been included in the DOE Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource (CEDR). In the analysis of Hanford, and other site data, the question of comparability of <b>recorded</b> <b>dose</b> through time and across the respective sites has arisen. DOE formed a dosimetry working group composed of dosimetrists and epidemiologists to evaluate data and documentation requirements of CEDR.
