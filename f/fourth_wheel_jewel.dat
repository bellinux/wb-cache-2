50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional <b>jeweled</b> bearings to <b>wheels</b> that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> bearings, <b>jeweling</b> minute <b>wheel</b> bearings, and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|R
50|$|More highly jeweled watches add jewels {{to other}} pivots, {{starting}} with the pallet fork, then the escape <b>wheel,</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> third wheel, then finally the center <b>wheel.</b> <b>Jeweling</b> like this to the third <b>wheel</b> adds eight <b>jewels,</b> giving 15 jewels in total. Jeweling to the center wheel adds two more giving 17 jewels in total. Thus, a 17 jewel watch {{is considered to be}} fully jeweled.|$|R
50|$|The center wheel {{drives the}} pinion {{of the third}} wheel, and the third wheel drives the pinion of the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel.</b> In watches with the seconds hand in a {{subsidiary}} seconds dial, usually located above the 6 o'clock position, the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> is geared to rotate once per minute, and the second hand is attached directly to the arbour of this wheel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> - In clocks {{and watches}} {{with the second}} hand in a subdial on the face, this turns once per minute, and the shaft {{projects}} through the face and holds the second hand. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> also turns the escape wheel pinion. Many clocks don't need this wheel, because of their slower moving escapements, and in these the third wheel drives the escape wheel directly.|$|R
50|$|Recumbent four-wheel cycles {{have the}} same general {{advantages}} of tricycles. For quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle. More wheels introduce more weight and more complexity. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> is only of the most benefit to the single-seat rider when going off-road. When two and sometimes four riders want to ride together in a sociable configuration the four-wheel recumbent cycle is a viable option.|$|R

50|$|Additional jewels beyond 17 {{are used}} to either add cap jewels, or to jewel the {{mainspring}} barrel of the watch. Watches with 19 jewels, particularly those made by Elgin and Waltham, will often have a jeweled mainspring barrel. Alternatively a 19 jewel watch will have additional cap jewels on the escape <b>wheel.</b> 21 <b>jewel</b> watches commonly have cap jewels on both the pallet fork and escape <b>wheel.</b> 23 <b>jewel</b> watches will have a jeweled barrel and fully capped escapement. The timekeeping value of jewels beyond 17 for a time-only movement is often debated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method for the signature analysis of mechanical watch movements. Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected. A number of demonstration examples are included.

50|$|Wheel train: A {{gear train}} that transmits {{the force of}} the power source to the escapement. Large gears known as wheels mesh with small gears known as pinions. The wheels in a typical going train are the centre wheel, third <b>wheel,</b> and <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel.</b> A {{separate}} set of wheels, the motion work, divides the motion of the minute hand by 12 to move the hour hand and in watches another set, the keyless work, allows the hands to be set.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 Zenith {{introduced}} a watch with a redesigned gear train where the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was at the}} center of the movement, and so could drive a center seconds hand directly. The minute wheel, which had previously been at the center of the movement, was moved off center and drove the minute wheel indirectly. Any fluttering due the indirect gearing is concealed by the relatively slow movement of the minute hand. This redesign brought all the train gearing between the plates and allowed a thinner movement.|$|R

The tape was finally viewed on the <b>fourth</b> <b>Wheel</b> of the Worst episode which premiered on RedLetterMedia's website on February 28, 2014. It was voted [...] "best of the worst." ...|$|R
5000|$|Then they {{considered}} burlesque. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called [...] "wheels") supplied {{a new show}} every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the Columbia Wheel, the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was [...] "clean"; a <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed {{to be the next}} Florenz Ziegfeld.|$|R
50|$|Breguet {{realised}} {{that this}} problem (more serious {{at the time}} because of the rather poorer oils then available) could be removed {{and many of the}} advantages of the detent escapement retained if an impulse were given in both directions of the balance. In order to do this he geared two escape wheels together, one escape wheel driven by the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> of the wheel train, which in turn was geared to and drives a second escape wheel. A pivoted detent swings freely between them and locks each escape wheel in turn on a coaxial set of locking teeth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the Great Wheel {{was also}} {{designed}} by Hewes. The {{challenge was to}} increase the head of water acting on the wheel while using the same volume of water. It was achieved by sinking the wheel pit to {{below the level of}} the river and taking the tail race through a tunnel a kilometre downstream to rejoin the Bollin at Giant's Castle. This gave a head of 32 ft acting on the 32 ft diameter suspension wheel- which is 21 ft wide. The Great Wheel operated from 1818 to 1871 when the mill pool had silted up, and then to 1904.|$|R

50|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> also {{drives the}} escape {{wheel of the}} lever escapement. The escape wheel teeth {{alternately}} catch on two fingers called pallets on {{the arms of the}} pallet lever, which rocks back and forth. The other end of the lever has a fork which engages with an upright impulse pin on the balance wheel shaft. Each time the balance wheel swings through its center position, it unlocks the lever, which releases one tooth of the escape wheel, allowing the watch's wheels to advance by a fixed amount, moving the hands forward. As the escape wheel turns, its tooth pushes against the lever, which gives the balance wheel a brief push, keeping it swinging back and forth.|$|R
5000|$|Reliant {{also made}} a small 3-wheeled {{commercial}} vehicle called the Reliant TW9, later sold by other companies as the Ant (and, like the Robin, licence-built in Greece by MEBEA [...] ), which was a chassis and cab, onto which a custom rear body was fitted to create any type of commercial vehicle, a road sweeper, a flat back, a van, a milk float and hydraulic lifting rear bed version were common fitments. Also as a fifth <b>wheel</b> (actually <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel)</b> articulated tractor unit was created to pull large trailers. It was often used by public utility companies or more commonly sold to councils, where its ability to negotiate narrow alleyways was a big advantage.|$|R
50|$|By 1833, Deanston was {{powered by}} four large water wheels - {{the first two}} small wheels were reconstructions of the {{original}} Adelphi Mill wheels and the third wheel was called Samson. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> (named Hercules) measured 36 ft 6in in diameter, was of 300 horse power, and was the largest waterwheel in Europe and the second largest in the world. Original footage of these colossal wheels in operation was recently unearthed and can now be viewed at the distillery. The wheels were dismantled in 1949 and replaced by a more efficient hydro-turbine and steam electricity generating plant, which currently provides enough energy {{for all of the}} distillery's requirements, as well as producing a surplus which is sold back to the National Grid.|$|R
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the cannon pinion, which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the <b>fourth</b> rotor <b>wheel</b> to be a reflector wheel. Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} correlate the engine service performance of cast Vitallium turbine buckets with standard laboratory metallurgical data. Data were obtained from four I- 40 turbine wheels of Timken alloy with cast Vitallium buckets. In order to accelerate bucket deterioration, the turbine wheels were subjected to 20 -minute cycles consisting of 5 minutes at idle and 15 minutes at rated speed. A bucket broke on the first wheel during cycle 22 after 7 hours and 20 minutes. The broken bucket was replaced and during the third cycle after the replacement a second bucket broke after a total running time of 8 hours and 12 minutes, The first bucket failure on the second wheel occurred during cycle 29 after 9 hours and 28 minutes; no further failure occurred during 66 additional cycles. Total running time on this wheel was 31 hours and 40 minutes. The third wheel was run for 229 cycles (76 hr and 20 min, total running time) without a. failure. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> was operated for 105 cycles (35 hr, total running time) without a failure. Examination of the bro?en buckets indicated that the failures were probably due to fatigue, Massive eutectic areas that existed near the trailing edge probably contributed to the low fatigue strength...|$|R
50|$|On Sunday Morning Prost's Ferrari had {{a rather}} {{dramatic}} blowup in the warmup, and the Frenchman had to start the race in the spare car. The start was very eventful with Patrese getting away well and with Mansell aggressively chopping {{across the front of}} Senna. Unimpressed, he tried to retake Mansell going into the first turn but Nigel held his line and then proceeded to sweep underneath Berger to grab second at the second corner. After lap 1 the order was Patrese, Mansell, Berger, Senna, and Alesi. Mansell seemed content to shadow Patrese until lap 18 when he slipstreamed past his teammate on the main straight and proceeded to pull away. Things were looking well for Williams until Mansell came in for his stop on lap 29 and things went horribly wrong. The right rear tyre men got confused and one mechanic raised his hand when the other had not gotten the wheel perfectly on. Mansell set off down the pitlane but his tyre did not want to comply, the tyre fell off and the frustrated Englishman was left stranded {{in the middle of the}} pit lane with three wheels. The team ran out and put a <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> on the car, breaking many rules in the process.|$|R

This work was considerably aided by the capturing of the short signal code books from German submarine U-559 by men from HMS Petard.|$|R
50|$|For the 14th {{round of}} the season in Europe, Frentzen took his first pole in 2 years, ahead of Coulthard and Häkkinen. At the start, Frentzen led Häkkinen and Coulthard into the first corner. There was a slight drizzle after 15 laps, and unlike others, Häkkinen pitted for wets. This was too early, and he lost {{a lot of time and}} had to pit again for dries. He rejoined a lap down. Irvine was stuck for 30 seconds on three wheels during his fuel stop, when his team couldn't find the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel.</b> With a half of the race gone, Frentzen was leading Coulthard and Ralf. Frentzen's race cruelly ended with an {{electrical}} failure just after his first stop. It started raining by then, and new leader Coulthard spun off and retired. This gave the lead to Ralf until he suffered a puncture, which dropped him to fifth. On the wet track, Fisichella inherited the lead, only to spin off himself and retire. The next leader was Johnny Herbert in the Stewart. The track dried out and Herbert won, ahead of Jarno Trulli's Prost and Rubens Barrichello's second Stewart. Late in the race, Irvine made a mistake while running sixth, and gave sixth to Häkkinen, who then went on to pass Marc Gené for fifth. Häkkinen thus took a two-point lead over Irvine going into the last two races.|$|R
