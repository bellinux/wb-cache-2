Analysis of over 400 interviews with 44 Gypsy Traveller students, their parents and teachers over a 5 -year period identified several pull and push factors that impact on secondary school engagement and retention. Of these, cultural dissonance (a result of conflicting expectations between home and school) and social <b>exclusion</b> <b>feature</b> strongly. Students who relied on maladaptive coping strategies to deal with psychosocial stress associated with cultural dissonance and social exclusion tended {{to drop out of}} school early. These maladaptive strategies are referred to here as fight (physical and verbal retaliation and non-compliance), flight (self-imposed exclusion) and playing white (passing identity by concealing or denying one's heritage). Those who were retained in school to the age of 16 displayed more adaptive strategies such as cognitive re-framing, developing social support networks and adopting a bicultural identity. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{applicability}} of the 1998 consensus diagnostic criteria for the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) with the recently proposed diagnostic criteria of the International bvFTD Criteria Consortium (FTDC). METHODS: We reviewed each individual item in the 1998 and FTDC criteria in 30 patients with bvFTD followed in a memory clinic (including 2 with the C 9 orf 72 gene repeat expansion). RESULTS: All patients fulfilled the FTDC criteria (40 % possible, 60 % probable bvFTD) but only 66. 7 % fulfilled the 1998 criteria. One of the C 9 orf 72 expansion carriers did not fulfill the 1998 criteria. This discordance was always due to the presence of <b>exclusion</b> <b>features</b> in the 1998 criteria, the most common being spatial disorientation and early severe amnesia. CONCLUSION: The new FTDC criteria are less restrictive and hence more sensitive for the diagnosis of bvFTD...|$|R
40|$|Pollution {{control is}} {{necessary}} {{with the advancement}} of modern manufacturing industry as various forms of industrial wastes are generated. Adsorption has been considered a safer and less expensive approach for the remediation of environmental damage caused by the release of heavy metal ions, toxic dye molecules or harmful gases. Ordered mesoporous carbon materials are ideal as adsorbents due to their characteristic features including a high surface area, an interlinked pore system with uniform and accessible pores, a tuneable pore wall framework with different functional groups, {{as well as physical}} and chemical stability. In particular, uniform ordered mesoporous spheres have great potential for practical applications in dynamic adsorption. The traditional nanocasting approach to synthesize monodisperse carbon spheres involves complex, time-consuming procedures which present difficulties in industrialising the process while the conventional aerosol approach results in polydisperse size distribution, irregular pore sizes and small particle sizes (sub- to a few micrometers). In recent times, the microfluidic jet spray drying technique has been introduced for the synthesis of uniform mesoporous carbon microspheres. However, the characteristics of this class of material and its potential applications have not been fully understood. The main aim of this research was to investigate the ordered mesoporous carbon spheres synthesized from this spray drying technique as promising adsorbents for environmental applications. First, the selective adsorption of the mesoporous spheres in binary dye mixtures was investigated based on the adsorption rate and equilibrium capacity in comparison with that of mesoporous thin film and activated carbon. The results showed that the spherical particles preferentially removed the smaller dye molecule from the mixture, and that the nano sieve layer {{on the surface of the}} sphere gave rise to this size <b>exclusion</b> <b>feature.</b> Secondly, the functionalisation of the mesoporous carbon spheres was investigated using a mild oxidant at different durations and temperatures as well as a strong oxidant at different concentrations. Based on the study of the pore evolution, mesostructural stability and surface functionalisation, it was found that the treated samples showed higher adsorption of aniline as compared to the pristine sample. In summary, the findings from these two studies demonstrate the favourable adsorption characteristics of the mesoporous carbon spheres obtained from the unique spray drying technology. In other words, the size exclusion effect on the surface of the sphere resulted in the favourable adsorption as did the tuneable carbon framework for improved interaction with guest molecules. While the adsorption experiments from both studies were conducted in batch condition, this study has broader implications in the application of continuous column adsorption. This research thus opens the possibility for the fast and scalable synthesis of a new class of carbon adsorbent for environmental application...|$|E

40|$|Research {{associated}} with prisons and schools tends {{to focus on}} the connection between educational failure and the onset of offending. This research takes a different perspective by exploring whether school prepares men for prison per se. This focus emerged from the researcher's professional practice as a prison teacher. She completed induction interviews with over 200 prisoners and information from those conversations appeared to indicate {{that there may be a}} direct relationship between inmates' school and prison experiences. Observations in prison further suggested prisoners may constitute a community of practice who share a habitus and cultural capitals. To examine these themes in more detail, life histories were collected from eleven former prisoners for this doctoral thesis. The life history data was explored through Bowles and Gintis’ Correspondence Principle (1988), Bourdieu’s Reproduction through Education (1990), and Lave and Wenger’s Community of Practice (1991). Findings indicate that the former prisoners experienced a unique schooling on the margins of the mainstream school population. Segregations and various <b>exclusions</b> <b>featured</b> heavily and educational content was low.

40|$|Based on {{the recent}} {{literature}} and collective experience, an international consortium developed revised guidelines for the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The validation process retrospectively reviewed clinical records and compared the sensitivity of proposed and earlier criteria in a multi-site sample of patients with pathologically verified frontotemporal lobar degeneration. According to the revised criteria, 'possible' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia requires three of six clinically discriminating features (disinhibition, apathy/inertia, loss of sympathy/empathy, perseverative/compulsive behaviours, hyperorality and dysexecutive neuropsychological profile). 'Probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia adds functional disability and characteristic neuroimaging, while behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 'with definite frontotemporal lobar degeneration' requires histopathological confirmation or a pathogenic mutation. Sixteen brain banks contributed cases meeting histopathological criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia at presentation. Cases with predominant primary progressive aphasia or extra-pyramidal syndromes were excluded. In these autopsy-confirmed cases, an experienced neurologist or psychiatrist ascertained clinical features necessary for making a diagnosis according to previous and proposed criteria at presentation. Of 137 cases where features were available for both proposed and previously established criteria, 118 (86) met 'possible' criteria, and 104 (76) met criteria for 'probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In contrast, 72 cases (53) met previously established criteria for the syndrome (P< 0. 001 for comparison with 'possible' and 'probable' criteria). Patients who failed to meet revised criteria were significantly older and most had atypical presentations with marked memory impairment. In conclusion, the revised criteria for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia improve diagnostic accuracy compared with previously established criteria in a sample with known frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Greater sensitivity of the proposed criteria may reflect the optimized diagnostic <b>features,</b> less restrictive <b>exclusion</b> <b>features</b> and a flexible structure that accommodates different initial clinical presentations. Future studies {{will be needed to}} establish the reliability and specificity of these revised diagnostic guidelines. © 2011 The Author...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFeature {{modeling}} {{is widely}} used to capture and manage common-alities and variabilities in software product lines.

Feature cardinalities are usually considered to apply in either a local or global scope. However, we have identified that these interpretations are insufficient to capture the variability of cloud environments.

To evaluate our approach we conducted an analysis of relative cardinalities in four cloud computing providers. In addition, we developed tools for reasoning on feature models with relative cardinalities and performed experiments to verify the performance and scalability of the approach. The results from our study indicate that extending feature models with relative cardinal-ities is feasible and improves variability modeling, particularly in the case of cloud environments...|$|R

We introduce a fabric tensor that, by combining the coordination number and fabric anisotropy, allows for a simple tensorial representation of the fabric states by means of Mohr circles. We discuss the way low-order fabric is induced by homogeneous shearing. Finally, a model will be introduced for the evolution of fabric states with the strain-rate tensor. This model predicts the existence of a steady state, which provides in this way a geometrical interpretation of the critical state as a " saturated " or " jammed " state, and an exponential evolution of the fabric variables during transients. It also predicts the range of accessible fabric states and an upper bound on the fabric anisotropy. By means of numerical simulations, we show that this model works under complex loading paths...|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to dealing with}} software requirements volatility is to define product families instead of single products. In earlier papers we have developed an algebra of such families that, roughly, consists in a more abstract view of and-or trees of features as used in Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis. A product family is represented by an algebraic term over the feature names; it can be manipulated using equational laws such as associativity or distributivity. Initially, only "syntactic" models of the algebra were considered, giving more or less just the names of the features used in the various products of a family and certain interrelations such as mandatory occurrence and implication between or mutual <b>exclusion</b> of <b>features,</b> without attaching any kind of "meaning" to the features. While this is interesting and useful for determining the variety and number of possible members of such a family, it is wholly insufficient when it comes to talking about the correctness of families in a semantic manner.

In these models, the features of a family are requirements scenarios formalised as pairs of relational specifications of a proposed system and its environment. However, the paper is just intended as a proof of feasibility; we are convinced that the approach can also be employed for different semantic models such as general denotational or stream-based semantics...|$|R
