Health hazards associated with PERC included {{central nervous system}} depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. <b>Dry</b> cleaning <b>machine</b> types included first generation transfer <b>machines,</b> second generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> vented <b>machines,</b> third generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> nonvented <b>machines,</b> fourth generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> nonvented <b>machines</b> with secondary vapor control, and fifth generation dry to <b>dry</b> nonvented <b>machines</b> with secondary vapor control and <b>drum</b> monitors. <b>Dry</b> cleaning <b>machines</b> evolved over time from the first through fifth generations, becoming safer with each successive generation. The manual transfer of clothing required with transfer machines was eliminated with <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> <b>machines.</b> The development of nonvented <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> <b>machines</b> utilizing refrigerated condensers led to considerable solvent savings and PERC emissions reduction. Residual PERC present in the machine cylinder {{at the end of}} the dry cycle was reduced via a refrigerated condenser plus carbon absorber in dry to <b>dry</b> nonvented <b>machines</b> with secondary vapor control. Fifth generation machines were essentially fourth generation machines in which the vapor concentration in the machine drum was monitored. The current OSHA permissible exposure limit for PERC was an 8 hour time weighted average exposure of 100 parts per million (ppm). Only fourth and fifth generation machines were able to keep worker exposures below the OSHA maximum peak of 300 ppm. Important machine design features included a dry to dry design, primary and secondary vapor control systems, a drying sensor that monitored solvent recovery, and a door locking mechanism for the loading and unloading door of the <b>dry</b> cleaning <b>machine.</b> The retrofitting of refrigerator condensers or carbon absorbers was a less expensive option to buying new equipment.

Such materials have great demand in aerospace industry, marine industry, {{and nuclear power}} plants. It is particularly used in the hot sections like engines, because of their high strength and corrosion resistance at high temperature and pressure but they are the most difficult to machine materials. Their high strength possesses large amount of heat generation while machining, which reduce life of tool. Strain rate sensitivity, work hardening and precipitation hardening of material leads to more tool wear. Surface integrity obtain while machining of superalloys is poor. Poor surface finish and high residual stresses are the main causes of failure of these material components. Cutting fluid apply at high pressure in chip forming zone.

Special attention was paid to some important mycotoxin producing species. As drying temperatures and retention time in the drum are essential, the <b>drum</b> <b>drier</b> must be equipped with an effective control unit. Two different control systems were tested.

Using MGT, a retention time of 10. 5 min and a temperature of 64 ºC killed 99 % of the yeast propagules and 98 % of the filamentous fungi. Moisture contents were reduced to about 12 %.

The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with compressed air cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic compressed air cooling than those with compressed air cooling and <b>dry</b> <b>machining.</b> The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic compressed air cooling and a thicker chip with compressed air cooling compared to <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic compressed air compared with <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic compressed air than that with compressed air and <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic compressed air on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both compressed air and cryogenic compressed air reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.
