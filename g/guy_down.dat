These races saw almost no action and the down force package was criticized by the many fans.

The sessions were held at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco, California from July 15 to July 29, 1976. The song was recorded direct to ½-inch two-track stereo tape. Waits and Howe decided to record on a two-track console to ensure the song did not sound overproduced. Howe later commented that [...] "jazz is more about getting a good take, not about having a lot of tracks to mix." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} premiered in January 2013. [...] The video kicks off with Kramer {{lying on a}} couch: her hair is messy, she’s curled up under a blanket {{and it looks like}} she hasn’t gotten a lot of sleep lately. As she sings the first few frames of the song, she starts to {{daydream}} about the series of events that brought her to where she is now. In her flashback, Kramer finds herself at a bonfire party where she first meets a guy that she probably should have stayed away from. Shortly after they lock eyes, someone behind him says something that doesn’t go over well. Kramer’s new love interest turns around and knocks the other <b>guy</b> <b>down,</b> pouncing on top of him and pummeling him in the face until a few other party-goers pull him off. After the fight, Kramer cuddles up with this bad boy by the fire, sharing a few pulls from his bottle of whiskey. They go back to her trailer together where they share a hot and heavy night. It gets cut short when a cop breaks in the door and cuffs Kramer’s new boyfriend. He gets hauled away in a police car while she looks on, heartbroken.|$|E
5000|$|Individuals {{known to}} have {{witnessed}} the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20-25 minutes. Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout; however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straight {{from the beginning of}} the bout when he had replied to Wong's traditional handshake offer by pretending to accept the handshake, but instead turning that hand into a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, he had nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee's [...] "unusually winded" [...] condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter. According to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee however, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, [...] "The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this <b>guy</b> <b>down</b> to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up".|$|E

We recorded everything in his house. I did six songs there, and I did the seventh song yesterday in Kansas City. I want to send it to Ross and see what he thinks. It's fucking amazing to work with Ross Robinson. He's truly a muse. He's a super muse. He brought a lot of shit out of me. Wes was staying in Ross's house for a while as I was doing this. He came and played on damn near everything. He was trying to get some music out. I happened to be the <b>guy</b> <b>down</b> there trying to get some music out so we got some music out together. We're trying to get it all together so it can be the best for the fans. It's totally different from anything Tech N9ne. It has elements of Tech N9ne because it's me. I'm going to be rapping and singing and shit. I hope everybody takes to it." ...|$|E
