50|$|A floor sink {{is a type}} of <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> {{primarily}} used as {{an indirect}} waste receptor. It is generally deeper than a standard <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> and can have a full or partial grate, or no grate as required to accommodate the indirect waste pipes. It usually has a dome strainer in the bottom to prevent splash-back. The body material can be epoxy coated or enameled cast iron, stainless steel, or PVC. Floor sinks are found in commercial kitchens and some hospital applications.|$|E
50|$|A <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> {{should always}} have a {{strainer}} secured over it to prevent injury, entry of foreign objects, or introduction of unwanted pests into the facility. However, if the strainer is not smooth enough, hair and other objects can still get stuck in it, clogging the drain.|$|E

50|$|Basement <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> {{that connect}} to {{sanitary}} sewers {{need to be}} filled regularly to prevent the trap from drying out and sewer gas from escaping into the basement. The drain trap can be topped up automatically by the condensation from air conditioners or high-efficiency furnaces. A small tube from another downpipe is sometimes used to keep the trap from drying out. Health Canada advocates the use of special radon gas traps for <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> that lead to soil or to a sealed sump pump. In areas where storm and sanitary sewers are combined, {{and there is the}} risk of flooding and sewage backing up, backwater valves in all basement drains may be mandated by code and definitely are recommended even if not mandated.|$|R

50|$|Sanitation {{drainage}} {{was through}} a closed system {{leading to a}} sewer apart from the hill. The queen's megaron contained {{an example of the}} first water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.|$|E
50|$|Water heaters {{potentially}} can explode {{and cause}} significant damage, injury, or death if certain safety devices are not installed. A safety device called a temperature and pressure relief (T&P or TPR) valve, is normally fitted {{on the top}} of the water heater to dump water if the temperature or pressure becomes too high. Most plumbing codes require that a discharge pipe be connected to the valve to direct the flow of discharged hot water to a drain, typically a nearby <b>floor</b> <b>drain,</b> or outside the living space. Some building codes allow the discharge pipe to terminate in the garage.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies workers determined that two {{lactic acid bacterium}} isolates, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C- 1 - 92 and Enterococcus durans 152 (competitive-exclusion bacteria [CE]), which were originally obtained from biofilms in <b>floor</b> <b>drains,</b> are bactericidal to Listeria monocytogenes or inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes both in vitro and in biofilms at 4 to 37 °C. We evaluated the efficacy of these isolates for reducing Listeria spp. contamination of <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> of a plant in which fresh poultry is processed. Baseline assays revealed that the mean numbers of Listeria sp. cells in <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> sampled on six different dates (at approximately biweekly intervals) were 7. 5 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 8, 4. 9 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 3, 4. 4 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 2, 4. 1 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 4, 3. 7 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 1, and 3. 6 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 6. The drains were then treated with 107 CE/ml in an enzyme-foam-based cleaning agent four times in 1 week and twice {{a week for the}} following 3 weeks. In samples collected 1 week after CE treatments were applied Listeria sp. cells were not detectable (samples were negative as determined by selective enrichment culture) for drains 4 and 6 (reductions of 4. 1 and 3. 6 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2, respectively), and the mean numbers of Listeria sp. cells were 3. 7 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 8 (a reduction of 3. 8 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2), < 1. 7 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 1 (detectable only by selective enrichment culture; a reduction of 3. 3 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2), and 2. 6 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2 for drain 3 (a reduction of 2. 3 log 10 CFU/ 100 cm 2). However, the aerobic plate counts for samples collected from <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> before, during, and after CE treatment remained approximately the same. The results indicate that application of the two CE can greatly reduce the number of Listeria sp. cells in <b>floor</b> <b>drains</b> at 3 to 26 °C in a facility in which fresh poultry is processed...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> is a {{plumbing}} fixture that is {{installed in the}} floor of a structure, mainly designed to remove any standing water near it. They are usually round, but can also be square or rectangular. They usually range from 2 to 12 in; most are 4 in in diameter. They have gratings that are made of metal or plastic. The floor around the drain is also sloped to allow the water to flow to the drain. Many residential basements have one or more floor drains, usually near a water heater or washer/dryer. Floor drains can also be found in commercial basements, restrooms, kitchens, refrigerator areas, locker/shower rooms, laundry facilities, and near swimming pools, among other places.|$|E
50|$|Detectives soon {{discovered}} Haigh’s record of theft and fraud and searched the workshop. Police found Haigh’s attaché case containing a dry cleaner’s receipt for Mrs. Durand-Deacon’s coat, and also papers {{referring to the}} Hendersons and McSwans. The workshop in Sussex rented by Haigh did not contain a <b>floor</b> <b>drain,</b> unlike the workshop he had rented at Gloucester road in London. He therefore disposed of the remains by pouring out the container on a rubble pile {{at the back of}} the property. Investigation of the area where the sludge was poured, by pathologist Keith Simpson, revealed 28 pounds of human body fat, part of a human foot, human gallstones and part of a denture which was later identified by Mrs Durand-Deacon's dentist during the trial.|$|E
50|$|A {{trench drain}} (also channel drain, line drain, slot drain, linear drain or strip drain) is a {{specific}} type of <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> containing a dominant trough- or channel-shaped body. It is used for the rapid evacuation of surface water or for the containment of utility lines or chemical spills. Employing a solid cover or grating that is flush with the adjoining surface, this drain is commonly made of concrete in-situ and may utilize polymer- or metal-based liners or a channel former to aid in channel crafting and slope formation. Characterized by its long length and narrow width, the cross-section of the drain {{is a function of the}} maximum flow volume anticipated from the surrounding surface. Channels can range from 1 in to 2 feet in width, with depths that can reach 4 ft.|$|E

5000|$|Water leakage: Top-loading {{machines}} are {{less prone to}} leakage, because simple gravity can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top. True front-loading machines require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out. This seal may leak and require replacement. However, many current front-loaders use so little water {{that they can be}} stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level. Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a solenoid valve getting stuck in the open position.|$|E
50|$|On Monday 23 January 2006 {{there was}} an {{explosion}} accident at the National Museum in the Silver Room, which was caused by methane leaking into a broom cupboard from the drainage through dried <b>floor</b> <b>drain</b> and lit by a spark from the power distribution cabinet in the cleaning closet. There were two possible sources for the methane; a leak from a gas pipe under the nearby Museokatu street, or gas that developed on its own in the sewer. Later, police investigations found the cause to be a gas pipe leak. http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/Kansallismuseon+r%C3%A4j%C3%A4hdyksen+syyn%C3%A4+maakaasuvuoto/1135218807492.

50|$|Andrew took {{a couple}} side trips out of Hanoi to the former Imperial city of Hue and a smaller city called Hoi An, where he learned of the still-living {{delicacy}} called Gaping Fish, which is exactly as it sounds. He spent time with fellow travelers, enjoying their company over the locals for the time being. He pushed hard on his bike, fighting sickness, into Qui Nhon. He spent a hellish exhausted night in a hotel that was less than hygienic. “The day’s exhaustion falls on me like a boulder. The room is stale with mildew. I open the window shutters to let in some air, then go into the bathroom to mix a bath with the complimentary thermos of hot water. This makes about two gallons of tepid water. A rat pokes its head up the <b>floor</b> <b>drain.</b> I put a bucket over it” (305). His stay at the hotel was highlighted by a nearly crippling sickness, but a local pharmacy got him up and biking again. In Nha Trang Andrew reconnected with a man named Cuong, who {{changed his name to}} Calvin to sound more Western. Calvin’s confessions of feelings of inferiority as a nation left both Andrew and himself depressed, and suddenly Andrew’s journey took on a different purpose. “Phan Thiet, the town of my birth, the end of my journey, lies only a few hours’ ride away, but the marching drums that have driven me onward for a year now have abruptly quieted. An unexpected lull. The finish line seems unimportant, secondary, symbolic” (337).|$|E
50|$|A trap primer (or {{trap seal}} primer) is a {{plumbing}} device or valve that adds water to traps. The water seals in traps {{are needed to}} prevent sewer gases from entering buildings, but because this water is exposed to the air, it is subject to evaporation over time in infrequently used <b>floor</b> <b>drains,</b> leading {{to the release of}} sewer gas into the environment. The trap primer mitigates this problem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to maintain the water seal indefinitely.|$|R
