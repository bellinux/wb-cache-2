5|$|In {{his search}} for a new career Thorpe applied unsuccessfully for the posts of {{administrator}} of the Aldeburgh festival, and race relations adviser to the Greater London Council. His attempts to restart a career in television also came to nothing. In February 1982 it was announced that he was to become director of the British section of Amnesty International, but the appointment was opposed by many of the organisation's membership, and after a month of controversy Thorpe withdrew from the post. He kept his position as chairman of the political committee of the United Nations Association, but in 1985 the progression of Parkinson's disease, which had first been diagnosed in 1979, led to the curtailment of most of his public activity. He continued to live in North Devon, and in 1987 accepted the honorary presidency of the North Devon Liberal Democrat association, formed after the Liberal–SDP merger. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> return to parliament via a life peerage in the House of Lords, but although friends lobbied on his behalf, the merged party's leadership refused to recommend him. Within the party generally, feelings towards him warmed, and when he attended the 1997 annual conference he received a standing ovation.|$|E
25|$|Chief Waramaug watched sadly as {{once more}} his daughter's health began to fail and her usually happy {{disposition}} to turn morose under mounting waves of despondency. Perhaps, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{bring her back}} from the brink of deep depression if he could only interest her in a young man of her own race. So, unknown to Lillinonah, Waramaug arranged a marriage for her with Eagle Feather, one of the brightest, most promising braves in the Pootatuck tribe. Surely, such a fine youth as he, could give Lillinonah something to live for.|$|E
25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E

50|$|In {{his later}} years, Fillmore felt so young that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be {{physically}} immortal, {{as well as}} believing that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be the reincarnation of Paul of Tarsus. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore were vegetarians.|$|R
25|$|Jo Grant (now Jo Jones) {{returned}} in two episodes {{of the fourth}} series of The Sarah Jane Adventures in Death of the Doctor (2010), meeting her replacement companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) for the first time, and subsequently the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith). The two attend {{a memorial service for}} the Doctor, but later learn aliens faked his death in order to steal the TARDIS using Jo and Sarah Jane's memories. Jo is still married, and travels with her grandson Santiago (Finn Jones); she is envious of Sarah Jane for having had several Doctor encounters since her departure, but has herself led a fulfilling life travelling the world promoting humanitarian and ecological causes. After returning her to London, the Doctor discloses to Jo that he secretly visited her at a time <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be dying.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E
500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which {{we had to have}} approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E
60|$|The {{only one}} from whom <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have cause to fear treachery {{was the man}} whom he had dropped with a thigh wound, and he was careful to keep {{beyond the reach of}} any sudden sword-thrust from that fellow.|$|R
60|$|He led {{her back}} through the crowd; and {{as he did so}} he {{perceived}} that Sir Harry's eyes were fixed upon him. He did not much care for that. If he could carry his Cousin Emily, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> carry the Baronet also.|$|R
5|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} A. McMullen {{noted that}} Kehoe had stopped {{working on his}} farm altogether {{for most of the}} preceding year, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be planning suicide. Kehoe had given him one of his horses about April 1927, but McMullen returned it for this reason.|$|R
2500|$|According {{to police}} {{interviewing}} Poplawski while imprisoned, he believed Mayhle to be faking his death, and so shot him again. He {{told police that}} he planned for police to kill him, but {{changed his mind and}} surrendered, hoping he could write a book in prison. Interviewers described Poplawski as unremorseful with a [...] "cold demeanor". [...] In the hours after the standoff ended and during interviews with detectives, Poplawski bragged about his actions, telling them <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have killed as many as five officers.|$|E
2500|$|Izzard is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of the Labour Party. In September 2011, he declared his ambition to stand for the party {{in the future as}} an MP, MEP, or Mayor of London, announcing an intention to stand for the London mayoral election in 2020. When asked on comedy panel show The Last Leg why <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be elected, he replied [...] "Boris Johnson". He is also a republican, believing that Britain should have a democratically elected head of state. He has stated that he is a social democrat, not a socialist.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2012, Krekar {{confirmed}} in the Oslo District Court {{that he had}} issued a twenty-page fatwa against Halabjaee.***** The fatwa was sent to several hundred Islamic scholars around the world. While Krekar said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be able to [...] "guarantee the safety" [...] of Halabjaee, Krekar confirmed that his fatwa [...] "implies" [...] that it is [...] "permissible" [...] to kill Halabjaee in Oslo or anywhere else. Krekar compared Halabjaee to Theo van Gogh, the film director who was killed by an Islamist in the Netherlands in 2004.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew that}} Sergeant Corney would say many things which he himself did not believe, if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> thereby <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{strengthen}} my courage for the terrible ordeal {{which was probably}} before us; therefore his words of cheer had less weight than might otherwise have been the case.|$|R
60|$|When he {{descended from}} the gig <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> as well leave his bag there. The sombre-looking servant in black clothes who opened the door made no inquiry on the subject; and, therefore, he merely told his Jehu to drive into the yard and wait for further orders.|$|R
50|$|Rain-in-the-Face died in {{his home}} at the Bullhead Station on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota after a lengthy illness. On his deathbed he reputedly confessed to a missionary that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have killed Custer, {{shooting}} him from so close as to leave powder marks upon his face.|$|R
2500|$|Bill was {{enthusiastic}} about his experience; {{he felt it}} helped him eliminate many barriers erected by the self, or ego, that {{stand in the way}} of one's direct experience of the cosmos and of God. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD [...] we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going — well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, May 23, 1946, a 21-year-old ex Army Air Force B-24 machine-gunner by {{the name}} Ralph B. Baumann told Los Angeles police that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been the Phantom. [...] "I've been in a coma; running from something. Maybe murder. I want to clear it up. If I didn't kill five people in Texarkana, I want {{to settle down and}} be a stunt man in Hollywood. I'm happiest when I'm living in danger." [...] Previously, he had gone to the Los Angeles Examiner and told a reporter, [...] "I want to sell you some murder {{information}}. I know who and where the Texarkana Killer is. Give me $5 and let me have an hour's start and I'll put the information in a sealed envelope." [...] The reporter called the police after reading: On a certain day in March, I was in a Texarkana theater watching a Pathé news picture of war. When a party of persons acted wise and said [...] "overacting" [...] it kind of got me. I followed them home. I killed them within a period of three days.|$|E
2500|$|Westfall notes that, in {{the early}} modern period, the “word 'friend' carries special connotations within a context of patronage; {{authorities}} on patronage distinguish what they call instrumental friendship from emotional friendship… [...] Galileo's [...] "friends" [...] in Venice appear to have understood that the [...] "friendship" [...] entailed {{the use of their}} connections and influence on his behalf. In all of Galileo’s attempts to rise up the ladder of Patronage, one of his connections, Sagredo, would write him words that Westfall considers “ne would be hard pressed to find a better example of the language of patronage.” Westfall writes, “Sagredo, who was clearly tiring of the exercise, wanted to be sure that Galileo understood he had fulfilled his duty as a patron [...] ‘Since I have already satisfied abundantly enough the friendship I hold for you, the obligations to you which I acknowledge, and the favor and help that true gentlemen try to extend to the qualified who deserve it,’ <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> now honorably desist.” [...] Westfall also provides fantastic evidence directly from the mouth of Galileo as to the importance of Patronage to himself ...|$|E
6000|$|Reginald {{wished to}} learn more but hardly knew how to ask the father questions. Yet, {{as he had been}} trusted so far, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be trusted altogether. [...] "I must own," [...] he said, [...] "that I think that Mr. Twentyman would hardly be a fit husband for your daughter." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Harding promised. He did {{not exactly}} know {{what there was}} to be explained, or why Dr. Grantly's mind should not be disabused of the mistake into which he had fallen, but {{nevertheless}} he promised. He owed some reparation to his daughter, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> best make it by obedience.|$|R
60|$|But {{this did}} not suit Mr. Gibbs. He {{had a very strong}} desire to reach the waters of the little lake, because he knew that at their bottom lay the telegraphic cable which he had been obliged to abandon, and <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be able to raise this cable and re-establish telegraphic {{communication}} with Cape Tariff and New Jersey.|$|R
60|$|Peter said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{feel better}} if he went for a walk.|$|E

60|$|Pierston considered. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{have left}} the key with his elder servant, whom he had {{believed}} he could trust, especially as the cellar was not well stocked.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Prendergast did {{not wish}} to be confronted at present with Matthew Mollett. Such a step might or might not be {{desirable}} before the termination of the interview; but at the present moment <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> probably learn more from the two women as they were than he would do if Mollett were with them.|$|R
6000|$|But Paul Montague had {{certainly}} not come {{there with the}} intention of discussing Melmotte's affairs, nor could he afford to lose the opportunity which chance had given him. He was off with one love, and now <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be on with the other. 'Hetta,' he said, 'I am thinking more of myself than of her,--or even of Felix.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had written}} {{him at the}} {{beginning}} of the war, telling him of her wish to get out to the front, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that now <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be able to help her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever {{can that}} fellow be up to?" [...] asked the boy of himself. For the instant <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be mistaken, {{and that the}} form was that of some wild beast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be feard, Aunt Hagar," [...] {{said the}} oldest of the men, [...] "I spoke to Mas'r Thomas 'bout it, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> manage to sell you in a lot both together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then here stand I a free man, {{and right}} gladly will I enter thy household," [...] said Little John, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> find some merry jest, should he enter the Sheriff's service.|$|E
60|$|Then the Sheriff called Robin to him, {{not knowing}} {{him in his}} butcher's dress, and made him sit close to him on his right hand; for he loved a rich young prodigal--especially when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> lighten that prodigal's pockets into his own most worshipful purse. So he made much of Robin, and laughed and talked with him more than {{with any of the}} others.|$|R
60|$|Then, thought Mr Maguire, the Balls {{must have}} {{got hold of}} the heiress, and not the Mackenzies, and my battle must be fought at the Cedars, and not here. Still, as <b>he</b> was there, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{possibly}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> obtain some further information; {{and this would be}} the easier, if, as appeared to be the case, there was enmity between the Gower Street family and their relative.|$|R
6000|$|Carter {{stumbled}} {{toward the}} taffrail {{and in the}} first step he made came full against somebody who glided away.
