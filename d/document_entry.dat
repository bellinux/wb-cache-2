50|$|During {{the past}} four years, MAP’s {{trajectory}} has radically changed. Rather than serving as a provider of primary sources to restricted academic audiences, MAP set out to become a research institution with the mission of actively generating scholarly discourse and embracing disparate dimensions of scholarly experience. At {{the center of this}} operation has been MAP’s online platform, BIA, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Fully online since 2013, BIA provides access to an unparalleled range of digitized early modern material. As of 2015, this material comprises over 24,000 transcribed documentary records, 18,000 biographical entries, 87,000 geographical and topographical tags, and over 300,000 digitized images from 292 volumes of the Mediceo del Principato. Aside from providing a faster and more user-friendly interface for <b>document</b> <b>entry,</b> BIA has enabled scholars from all over the world, not only to view digitized images of archival documents, but also to enter transcriptions, provide scholarly feedback, and exchange comments in designated forums, all within BIA’s academic community of over 2400 international scholars, students, and enthusiasts who daily engage with one another, with the ever-increasing number of uploaded digitized documents, and with the staff and fellows of the Medici Archive Project.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research to be pursued {{is to develop a}} schema for representing raster-digitized (scanned) documents, The representation is to retain not only the spatial structure of a printed document, but should also facilitate automatic labeling of various components, such as text, figures, subtitles, and figure captions, and allow the extraction of important relationships (such as reading order) among them. Intended applications include (1) data compression for document transmission and archival, and (2) <b>document</b> <b>entry,</b> with out rekeying, into editing, formatting, and information retrieval systems...|$|E

" We disentangle the many swaps and leases between networks in order to measure owned route miles versus route miles shared with other carriers. Entry appears much more moderate when these shared miles are not counted. Preemption strategies can lead to excessive entry, and we find evidence for preemptive behavior regarding total miles (including swaps and leases) but less for preemption regarding owned miles. We conclude that entry was excessive only with regard to swaps and leases, but not with regard to the physical building of the networks. ...|$|E

For a symmetric entry case, {{the size of the}} separation zone appears to mildly depend on Reynolds number in the acceleration phase, but is roughly Reynolds number independent in the deceleration phase. For the asymmetric entry case, the separation zone was larger and appeared to grow somewhat during the deceleration phase. The separation zones for both entry geometry cases remain relatively small throughout the cycle. This is different from what would be observed in all-laminar, oscillator flows and is probably due to the high turbulence of the flow, particularly during the deceleration phase of the cycle...|$|E
40|$|IDA (Intelligent Document Analysis) is a modular {{software}} system, which assists {{to automate}} paper <b>document</b> <b>entry.</b> IDA {{consists of the}} following components: layout analysis, preclassification, OCR interface, fuzzy string matching, text categorization, lexical, syntactical and semantic analysis. The system {{has been applied to}} a variety of tasks: Presorting of forms, reports and letters, index extraction for archiving and retrieval, text column analysis in real estate register documents, in-house mail distribution, and classification of business letters by text content. This paper presents an overview of the architecture and applications of the system. Therefore focus of attention techniques have been developed to limit OCR evaluation to few regions of interest. 2 Architecture of the system IDA has a modular and open architecture with three main components, layout analysis, OCR, and content analysis.

40|$|This Technical Report {{describes}} a <b>document</b> <b>entry</b> system {{that supports the}} automatic insertion of documents with arbitrary types into a multimedia database. The documents conform to the international standards of SGML and HyTime. This is achieved by instantiating objects in the database to represent the document components. These are persistent objects that can be queried and retrieved using a query interface. To achieve this goal, the database has to be queried dynamically to retrieve meta-information about the document structure. A generic meta type system was designed to model such meta-information. This type system consists {{of a number of}} built-in types that model the characteristics common to SGML document components. Whenever support for a new class of documents is added to the system, meta types modeling the characteristics specific to this class are dynamically generated and added to the meta type system. To insert documents conforming to this class into the database, two system [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} use of a personal digital library system, UpLib. The system consists of a full-text indexed repository accessed through an active agent via a Web interface. It is suitable for personal collections comprising {{tens of thousands of}} documents (including papers, books, photos, receipts, email, etc.), and provides for ease of <b>document</b> <b>entry</b> and access as well as high levels of security and privacy. Unlike many other systems of the sort, user access to the document collection is assured even if the UpLib system is unavailable. It is “universal ” in the sense that documents are canonically represented as projections into the text and image domains, and uses a predominantly visual user interface based on page images. UpLib can thus handle any document format which can be rendered as pages. Provision is made for alternative representations existing alongside the text-domain and image-domain representation, either stored or generated on demand. The system is highly extensible through user scripting, and is intended {{to be used as a}} platform for further work in document engineering. UpLib is assembled largely from open-source components (the current exception being the OCR engine, which is proprietary) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDigital {{curation}} is {{the global}} concept that includes {{all aspects of}} work on digitized and born digital cultural objects: from <b>document</b> <b>entry</b> to data description or indexing, storage, dissemination, and long-term preservation. It is an expanding activity, whose rules and best practices are not globally defined yet. The BnF has chosen to rely on observations {{on the ground to}} understand how its staff, faced with the urgent need to collect and preserve a fast-growing digital heritage, is developing new tasks and skills. A dedicated group called ORHION, a French acronym for Observatory of Organizations and Human Resources under Digital Influence, has launched a series of studies on professional identities that are particularly affected by the increasing shift to digital activities. It has so far completed its analysis of two subjects: metadata curation and digital entries. In order to assess the BnF's practices, ORHION also relies on other institutions' experiences. It has for instance organized a workshop on web archive curation during this year's general assembly of the International Internet Preservation Consortium, in May 2014. This paper focuses on the findings of these three use case analyses: the switch from cataloguing to metadata management for description and access; the processes and agents involved in digital entries; and the organization, skills and training of web curating teams. Based on these three experiences, this paper seeks to identify some key trends in digital curation: the notion of digital collection itself is not obvious and needs to be rethought; professional identities are challenged by the apparition of new tasks and the emergence of new actors; stakeholders struggle to understand their own roles and responsibilities in more complex treatment channels. Training staff and sharing the workload between the first pioneers {{and the rest of the}} teams are necessary to involve all professionals in digital curation...|$|E

The book belongs to the genre of instructional manuals, marketed for the growing business and middle classes of late 16th century England, and was extremely popular, going into as many as ten editions by 1635, and becoming the most influential correspondence manual of its time.

Ciseri identifies two likely candidates for the allegorical programme, Jacopo Nardi and Marcello Virgilio Adriani, and a theme that offered parallel evocations of Imperial Rome the heavenly Jerusalem.
