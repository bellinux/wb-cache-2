5|$|Solar {{energy is}} radiant light and {{heat from the}} Sun that is <b>harnessed</b> using a range of ever-evolving {{technologies}} such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a large}} {{geothermal}} field at Yangbajain <b>harnessed</b> by generating units that deliver 25,181 kilowatts {{to the city of}} Lhasa to the south.|$|E
5|$|In the 1900s Barney held early {{gatherings of}} the salon {{at her house}} in Neuilly. The {{entertainment}} included poetry readings and theatricals (in which Colette sometimes performed). Mata Hari performed a dance once, riding into the garden as Lady Godiva on a white horse <b>harnessed</b> with turquoise cloisonné.|$|E
50|$|Sled dog <b>harnesses</b> vary {{depending}} on whether the dog is hauling freight or racing. <b>Harnesses</b> come in three main types: the freight <b>harness,</b> the H-back <b>harness,</b> and the X-back <b>harness.</b> Dog sports are growing and more types of <b>harnesses</b> are being developed, including the Y-back style and guard or distance <b>harness.</b> This type of <b>harness</b> is quickly becoming a favorite for those who enjoy skijoring.|$|R
50|$|<b>Harnesses</b> also vary {{according}} to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly: Training <b>harness</b> for beginners,Pax <b>harness</b> for tandem passengers that often also doubles as a training harness,XC <b>Harness</b> for long distance cross country flights,All round <b>harness</b> for basic to intermediate pilots,Pod <b>harness,</b> which is for intermediate to pro pilots that focus on XC.Acro <b>harnesses</b> are special designs for acrobatic pilots,Kids tandem <b>harnesses</b> are also now available with special child-proof locks.|$|R
50|$|Doctor Octopus has {{possessed a}} total of three {{different}} <b>harnesses</b> during his career: the original titanium <b>harness,</b> a more powerful adamantium <b>harness,</b> and a carbonanium <b>harness</b> with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium <b>harnesses</b> were both destroyed in the Lethal Foes of Spider-Man miniseries.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can also}} introduce toxic substances into nontoxic honey produced from nontoxic nectar. Microorganisms in honey can convert {{some of the}} sugars in honey to ethanol. This process of ethanol fermentation is intentionally <b>harnessed</b> to produce the alcoholic beverage called mead from fermented honey.|$|E
5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs {{would often}} have to do {{everything}} from ploughing a field to carrying a farmer to market or driving a family to services on Sunday. When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were <b>harnessed</b> for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{offers a}} very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves, tides, {{salinity}} differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be <b>harnessed</b> to generate electricity. Forms of 'green' marine energy include tidal power, marine current power, osmotic power, ocean thermal energy and wave power.|$|E
50|$|Putting <b>harness</b> on a {{horse is}} called <b>harnessing</b> or <b>harnessing</b> up. Attaching the <b>harness</b> to the load is called putting to (British Isles) or {{hitching}} (North America). The order of putting on <b>harness</b> components varies by discipline, but when a horse collar is used, it is usually put on first.|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{climbing}} warrant particular features for <b>harnesses.</b> Sport climbers typically use minimalistic <b>harnesses,</b> some with sewn-on gear loops. Alpine climbers often choose lightweight <b>harnesses,</b> perhaps with detachable leg loops. Big Wall climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body <b>harnesses</b> for children, whose pelvises {{may be too}} narrow to support a standard <b>harness</b> safely. These <b>harnesses</b> prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body <b>harnesses</b> {{when there is a}} chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest <b>harnesses,</b> which are used only in combination with a sit harness; this combination provides the same advantages as a full body <b>harness.</b> However, test results from UIAA show that chest <b>harnesses</b> can put more impact on the neck than sit <b>harnesses,</b> making them slightly more dangerous to use.|$|R
5000|$|A kite <b>harness</b> {{comes in}} seat (with leg loops), waist or vest types. The <b>harness</b> {{together}} with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. By hooking in, the <b>harness</b> takes most of the strain of the kite's pull off of the rider's arms, and spreads it across {{a portion of his}} body. This allows the rider to do jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist <b>harnesses</b> are by far the most popular <b>harnesses</b> among advanced riders, although seat <b>harnesses</b> make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider and vest <b>harnesses</b> provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite <b>harnesses</b> look similar to windsurfing <b>harnesses,</b> but are actually much different; a windsurfing <b>harness</b> used for kiteboarding is likely to break very quickly, which could result in injury and/or gear loss.|$|R
5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was <b>harnessed</b> in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E
5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a {{slightly}} smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of <b>harnessed</b> oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{technologies}} are characterized as either passive or active {{depending on the}} way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be <b>harnessed</b> at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily {{to the use of}} solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than Geothermal power and Tidal power, derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|The racing <b>harness,</b> {{like the}} show <b>harness,</b> is a breastcollar <b>harness.</b> Horses are hitched {{to a very}} {{lightweight}} two-wheeled cart, called a sulky. Most race <b>harnesses</b> incorporate a running martingale and an overcheck. Sometimes <b>harness</b> racing horses are raced with an [...] "open" [...] bridle, {{one that does not}} have blinkers. Specialized equipment, called pacing hobbles, are added to the <b>harness</b> of race horses who pace in order to help them maintain their gait.|$|R
5000|$|Physically smaller {{systems that}} are built many times may use a cable <b>harness.</b> A {{full-sized}} to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable <b>harness.</b> This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable <b>harnesses.</b> <b>Harnesses</b> can be inserted into to their equipment as an assembly. Cable <b>harnesses</b> that are reused many times, like automobile wiring <b>harnesses,</b> are created with automated machinery.|$|R
50|$|Full-body <b>harness,</b> the {{combination}} of a sit <b>harness</b> and a chest <b>harness</b> which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of <b>harness</b> normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations.|$|R
5|$|The first {{documented}} {{tourist facilities}} in Death Valley were {{a set of}} tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast Borax turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the Furnace Creek Inn and resort. The spring at Furnace Creek was <b>harnessed</b> to develop the resort, and as the water was diverted, the surrounding marshes and wetlands started to shrink.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum energy}} dissipation from Gulf Stream by turbines {{is in the}} range of 20-60GW. One idea, which would supply the equivalent power of several nuclear power plants, would deploy a field of underwater turbines placed 300 meters (980ft) under the center of the core of the Gulf Stream. Ocean thermal energy could also be <b>harnessed</b> to produce electricity using the temperature difference between cold deep water and warm surface water.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet <b>harnessed</b> rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E
40|$|Quadratic <b>harnesses</b> are {{typically}} non-homogeneous Markov processes with time-dependent state space. Using an appropriately defined affine transformation {{we show that}} all bridges of a given quadratic <b>harness</b> can be transformed into other standard quadratic <b>harnesses.</b> Conversely, each such bridge is an affine transformation of a standard quadratic <b>harness.</b> We describe quadratic <b>harnesses</b> that correspond to bridges of some Levy processes. We determine all quadratic <b>harnesses</b> that may arise from stitching together a pair of q-Meixner processes...|$|R
50|$|The STABO harness/rig was a machine-stitched, {{skeletonized}} <b>harness,</b> {{very similar}} to that of a standard parachute <b>harness.</b> The <b>harness</b> webbing was made of heavy duty nylon, identical to the type used in the manufacture of parachute <b>harnesses.</b> The STABO rig served two main functions: it was itself an extraction <b>harness</b> and also served as the base for the operator's load bearing equipment in the field. Later versions of the STABO <b>harness</b> were made in small, medium and large sizes.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} <b>harness</b> loom-one where any one <b>harness</b> or combination of <b>harnesses</b> was lifted while the other <b>harnesses</b> remained stationary. This type of loom {{is known as a}} rising shed loom, and examples include the table loom, dobby loom or the Jack loom. The other method used in <b>harness</b> looms is where some <b>harnesses</b> are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected <b>harnesses</b> because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed loom. Counterbalance and countermarch looms are of this second type.|$|R
5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo write that Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise trope (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice themselves for Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; while the two characters are <b>harnessed</b> together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite, and zinc. Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped. Geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has <b>harnessed</b> more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{jet engine}} {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been working}} a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet <b>harnessed</b> rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of}} the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
50|$|A {{full-body}} <b>harness</b> is {{the combination}} of a sit <b>harness</b> and a chest <b>harness</b> which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of <b>harness</b> normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations, and also commonly used by small children instead of a sit <b>harness</b> which is easier to slip out of.|$|R
5000|$|Electrical/Electronic: Total wiring <b>harness</b> systems, KSK (customer-specific wiring <b>harnesses),</b> LWL (fiber-optic cables), night design, interior/ceiling/door/seat/main/audio/engine and cockpit wiring <b>harnesses,</b> pre-fuse concepts, power management, ambient lighting.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from these}} <b>harnesses,</b> {{there are also}} caving and {{canyoning}} <b>harnesses,</b> which all serve different purposes. For example, a caving <b>harness</b> is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points. Releasing the maillon from these attachment points loosens the <b>harness</b> quickly.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, {{he participated}} in Operation Mount Hope III, during which U.S. forces {{recovered}} a crashed Soviet-made Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter in Chad. Company E of the 160th deployed to N'Djamena, Chad via C-5 Galaxy. Once in Chad the company flew two CH-47 Chinooks 490 nautical miles at night, {{without the use of}} navigational aids, to the crash site. Once at the crash site the crews <b>harnessed</b> the crashed Hind to a Chinook via sling-load. During the returning flight both Chinooks performed an air-to-air refuel with a C-130; and later endured a sandstorm before returning with the Hind.|$|E
5|$|In foreign affairs, Walter {{negotiated}} with Scotland in 1195 {{and with the}} Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed Northumbria, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but {{relations between the two}} countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard's reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the English lords Roger Mortimer and William de Briouze expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing a concern that the Welsh lord Rhys ap Gruffydd would strike back across the border. In 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by William Fitz Osbern. FitzOsbern was an orator who <b>harnessed</b> the discontent of the poor residents of London against high taxes. His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter's orders.|$|E
5|$|The coaster's seven trains {{double the}} {{capacity}} of the traditional El Loco ride from 4 seats per train to 8 seats per train. The trains are articulated {{in such a way that}} the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the head rest. These speakers are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are <b>harnessed</b> to the ride through the use of lap bars. The front of each car features a pulsing LED Green Lantern logo while the back of each car features the Green Lantern oath. All of these operational and thematic characteristics are new for this type of ride and were developed specifically for this coaster.|$|E
5000|$|A strap-on dildo (also strap-on, strapon or dildo <b>harness)</b> is a dildo {{designed}} to be worn, usually with a <b>harness,</b> during sexual activity. [...] <b>Harnesses</b> and dildos are made {{in a wide variety}} of styles, with variations in how the <b>harness</b> fits the wearer, how the dildo attaches to the <b>harness,</b> as well as various features intended to facilitate stimulation of the wearer or a sexual partner.|$|R

50|$|A parrot <b>harness</b> or bird flight <b>harness</b> may {{enable a}} tame pet or {{companion}} parrot {{to be taken}} outdoors, but some parrots may dislike wearing a <b>harness</b> and bite at it. Parrots that are <b>harness</b> trained from {{a very young age}} may accept them willingly, but more often, parrots must be very carefully and gradually accustomed and trained to wear a <b>harness.</b> Care must be taken that the parrot does not feel threatened. Properly trained parrots often appear to enjoy wearing their <b>harnesses</b> if they associate them with going outdoors; some owners report their birds will bring their <b>harnesses</b> to them when they want to go outside.|$|R
