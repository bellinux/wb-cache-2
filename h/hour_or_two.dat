5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down for an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E

50|$|The {{theoretical}} examination lasts 5 {{hours and}} consists of three questions. Usually these questions involve more than one part. The practical examination may consist of one laboratory examination of five <b>hours,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> which together take up the full five hours.|$|R
25|$|Several {{states also}} allow victims' {{families}} and relatives {{selected by the}} prisoner to watch executions.

60|$|When Moran {{relieved}} him, Jimmy felt worn out. He had {{had only}} an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two’s</b> sleep {{after a day}} of exhausting work; his breakfast had consisted of a morsel of stale, cold fish, hurriedly torn with his fingers from the lump in the pan; and they had had no opportunity for cooking dinner.|$|R
50|$|The town is well placed, {{within an}} <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> {{drive from the}} west coast of Eyre Peninsula but still close enough for a day trip to the Gawler Ranges.

25|$|Preparation for Easter {{begins with}} the season of Great Lent. In {{addition}} to fasting, almsgiving, and prayer, Orthodox Christians cut down on all entertainment and non-essential worldly activities, gradually eliminating them until Great and Holy Friday, the most austere day of the year.

50|$|The first {{journeys}} from {{end to end}} of {{the newly}} completed line, dubbed the Transindochinois ("Trans-Indochinese"), generally took about 60 <b>hours,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days and three nights. This decreased to about 40 hours by the late 1930s, with trains travelling at an average speed of 43 kph mph. Trains were generally pulled by French Pacific or Mikado locomotives, and included dining cars and sleeping cars (voitures-couchettes).|$|R

25|$|Remaining {{on their}} boards, the pounded sheets are taken outside to dry. Drying times vary due to weather {{conditions}}. On dry and sunny days, this can take an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> but in humid conditions {{it can take}} days. If the dried sheets are to be sold wholesale, they are then simply bundled. If to be sold retail, the edges are then trimmed with a blade.|$|E
25|$|Cricket is {{also played}} in several {{different}} shortened forms, designed to pack as much action as possible into an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> enabling them to be played as a single contest in an evening, or {{as a series of}} multiple contests between different teams that cover the entire day. Such forms have evolved since the 1980s, and take cricket an additional step beyond one-day cricket. Most forms will resemble twenty-twenty cricket in nature, although shorter formats with reduced numbers of players, typically 6-aside or 8-aside, are also common for tournament play.|$|E
25|$|When {{the police}} left without their prisoners, the {{fighting}} {{stopped for a}} few moments. The truce lasted only an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> as fighting resumed near The Tombs, supposedly brought about {{by a group of}} women from the Five Points who had provoked the Dead Rabbits into attacking the Bowery gangs. Bringing reinforcements, the participants were estimated at between 800 and 1000, armed with bludgeons, paving stones, brick bats, axes, pitchforks, and other weapons. Several hundred other criminals also arrived in the area, mostly burglars and thieves, who were not affiliated with either side and simply took the opportunity for looting. Residents and store owners all along the Bowery were forced to barricade their buildings and protect themselves with pistols and muskets.|$|E

60|$|It was blazing {{hot that}} afternoon, {{and the wide}} plain lay {{scorching}} under a pitiless glare. Thorne was not sorry when the Farquhar homestead with its encircling sea of wheat took shape ahead.

25|$|On December 14, 2015 at {{approximately}} 15:45 the Spence suffered a sudden 25 degree list to starboard while in towing the Guantanamo Bay Express barge from a shipyard in Cartahena, Columbia {{where it had}} recently been overhauled and repaired to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to resume its normal resupply mission. The crew, unable to correct the list and fearing that the vessel would sink, abandoned ship by coming alongside the barge and jumping over to its deck. At around 17:30 the tug, still tethered to the barge with three 1,600 ft. tow lines, sank below the surface. An <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, the crew heard three sharp bangs which {{are assumed to be}} the tow lines breaking as the tug sank beyond the length of the tow lines on its way to settling to the bottom 11,500 feet below the surface. The crew were rescued by the coast guard cutter Decisive early in the morning of December 15.|$|E
25|$|Towards 1:00 pm, in {{the thick}} mix of gun smoke and fog {{covering}} the field, the king was separated from his fellow riders and suffered multiple shots. A bullet crushed his left arm below the elbow. Almost simultaneously his horse suffered a shot to the neck that {{made it hard to}} control. In the mix of fog and smoke from the burning town of Lützen the king rode astray behind enemy lines. There he sustained yet another shot in the back, was stabbed and fell from his horse. Lying on the ground, he received a final, fatal shot to the temple. His fate remained unknown for some time. However, when the gunnery paused and the smoke cleared, his horse was spotted between the two lines, Gustavus himself not on it and nowhere to be seen. His disappearance stopped the initiative of the hitherto successful Swedish right wing, while a search was conducted. His partly stripped body was found an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, and was secretly evacuated from the field in a Swedish artillery wagon.|$|E
25|$|In June 1880, {{while the}} Republican Convention was in session in Chicago, former General and President Grant {{and his family}} were living in Galena. After being persuaded by his wife and {{political}} friends to stand for a nomination and run for office a third time, he finally consented. Grant would come down town in the morning on a daily basis and would spent an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> with Judge Rowley, now an old friend and former comrade, at his office, and would often talk about his recent tour around the world. During the convention Rowley's office would receive many telegrams, and while Rowley and others would receive them with great interest, Grant showed little, until one arrived with some descending news about an old trusted friend, Elihu B. Washburne, also on the list of presidential nominations. Washburne, now a competitor of Grant, was withdrawing his support and making disparaging statements about Grant, which ultimately ended their long friendship. While Grant received the news in his usual calm manner, Rowley and others, however, were very outspoken with their denunciation of Washburne.|$|E

Late dinner, and singing or chat in the evening. Mathews has really all the will, {{as well as the}} talent, to be amusing. He {{confirms}} my idea of ventriloquism (which is an absurd word), as being merely the art of imitating sounds at a greater or less distance, assisted by some little points of trick to influence the imagination of the audience--the vulgar idea of a peculiar organisation (beyond fineness of ear and of utterance) is nonsense.|$|R
25|$|On {{assessing}} Greenwichs strength, the frigate kept {{close to}} the squadron, which then came up and attacked, action commencing at 9 a.m. when Diadème opened fire. For the next twelve hours Greenwich was constantly engaged with one or other of the French ships. Roddam still hoped to carry his plan of capturing one of them into execution, and assembled his men {{in an attempt to}} board the 64-gun Éveillé, but several of her consorts bore up and opened fire, damaging Greenwichs rigging and leaving her unmanageable. Roddam gathered his officers together, and told them that though they had no hope of winning against such a superior force, if any man could point out the admiral's flagship, he hoped to engage her and fight on for another <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> His officers, among whom was Lieutenant James Wallace, pledged to follow their captain, but pointed out that they had done all in their power to defend their ship. At 9.30 p.m., Roddam agreed to surrender his ship, as further resistance would only cause further casualties among his men.|$|E
500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, {{and if you go}} there for an <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E
