The film opened nationally on July 30, 1957 and peaked at #7 on the Variety National Box Office Survey, staying on the chart for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|When the Cuban Missile Crisis {{erupted in}} October 1962, Kennedy {{chose not to}} consult with Diefenbaker before making {{decisions}} on what actions to take. The US President sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as {{to the content of}} the speech that Kennedy was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack of consultation {{and the fact that he}} was given less than two hours advance word. He was angered again when the US government released a statement stating that it had Canada's full support. In a statement to the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy's word. When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> alert status anyway, and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it. The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Kennedy's actions were widely supported by Canadians. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.|$|E

[...] "I'm not {{pitching}} for the Cy Young", Zito said. [...] "I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to the World Series." [...] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager Lou Piniella said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, [...] "It would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> young man who pitched for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but [...] has won 21 games and he competes well." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song on Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, her second Thanksgiving television special which aired on ABC on November 28, 2013. She had invited singer Elton John as special guest star for the performance. After {{a performance of}} John's 1974 single [...] "Bennie and the Jets", the duo started singing [...] "Artpop". They were seated opposite {{to each other on}} piano, and Gaga was ornamented in a dress made of Coca-Cola cans. During the chorus, they were joined by The Muppets who aided with background vocals. Chris Willman from Billboard called John as the best guest performer of the special. Maricela Gonzales from Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the performance, saying that although she did not understand the message behind the song, [...] "hat is clear is that Gaga and Elton John belong together. I'm serious, I want to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> show." ...|$|E

I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn was a hero to me ... He had a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try {{to inform the public}} about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he {{was a bit of a}} hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E
500|$|Yet, Cornell and White {{soon found}} {{themselves}} {{on opposite sides}} of a battle that would in the end lead to the creation of Cornell University. In 1863, the legislature had granted the proceeds of the land grant to the People's College in Havana (now Montour Falls), with conditions that would need to be met within a certain time frame. Because the Morrill Act set a five-year limit on each state identifying a land grant college, and it seemed unlikely that the People's College would meet its conditions, the legislature was ready to select a different school. [...] Initially, Cornell, {{as a member of the}} Board of Trustees of the New York State Agricultural College at Ovid, wanted half the grant to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> school. [...] However, White [...] "vigorously opposed this bill, on the ground that the educational resources of the state were already too much dispersed". He felt that the grant would be most effective if it were used to establish or strengthen a comprehensive university.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Hidden Place", which {{features}} a soprano section and strings, [...] "over {{the top of a}} warm, intimate melody". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH felt the track was reminiscent of Homogenics [...] "Hunter", but less focused on the beats. NME called it progressive folk, while Drowned in Sound wrote it was electro. Björk sings about [...] "how two people can create a paradise just by uniting", as she intones: [...] "I'm so close to tears/And so close to/Simply calling you up/And simply suggesting/We <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> hidden place". [...] "Cocoon" [...] is [...] "based around an exploratory bassline and beats that sound like fingertips on skin". Discussing the glitch nature of the track, Björk said, [...] "when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it's faulty, you're entering a mystery zone where you can't control it". Lyrically revolving around making love, the song alternates between metaphors like [...] "Who would have known/That a boy like him/Would have entered me lightly/Restoring my blisses", and explicit lines such as [...] "He slides inside/Half awake, half asleep" [...] and [...] "Gorgeousness/He's still inside me". According to Michael Cragg of The Guardian, the song [...] "best represents the album's sense of heavy-lidded, post-coital hibernation". Björk sings a breathy, [...] "whispered, near-cracking falsetto" [...] on the track.|$|E

I guess I had to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> place {{to get to this}} one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|While at Yale, Fitzpatrick {{proved himself}} to be an {{innovator}} {{in track and field}} by inventing a new pole-vaulting technique. [...] Dr. R.G. Clapp, who later spent 40 years as an athletic trainer and coach at the University of Nebraska, trained as a pole vaulter under Fitzpatrick in 1897. [...] Clapp recalled that Fitzpatrick came to Yale with a [...] "new idea on gripping the pole." [...] Fitzpatrick [...] "advocated sliding the lower hand up the pole to meet the upper hand at the takeoff instead of the prevailing system of taking off with the hands spread." [...] Clapp was the first pole-vaulter to take up Fitzpatrick's suggestion, and the two worked together on coordinating the other essentials of the vault with the hand slide. [...] In 1898, after perfecting the technique, Clapp set a world record in the pole-vault (11 feet, 10½inches) that stood for six years. [...] Clapp later wrote:"Credit should be given where credit is due and, {{while it is true that}} Keene Fitzpatrick and I were jointly responsible for this development which revolutionized valuting, the major credit should <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> polished Irish gentleman, who was one of the finest sportsmen I have ever known and who was so highly regarded at University of Michigan, Yale, and Princeton universities and by all of the track coaches and athletes of yesteryears." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer and I think she was eager {{for me to go}} into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People said to my mother, 'Are you letting that girl <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> awful place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
