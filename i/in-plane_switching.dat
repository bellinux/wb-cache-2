25|$|<b>In-plane</b> <b>switching</b> is an LCD {{technology}} that aligns the liquid crystals {{in a plane}} parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation. This requires two transistors for each pixel instead of the single transistor needed for a standard thin-film transistor (TFT) display. Before LG Enhanced IPS was introduced in 2009, the additional transistors resulted in blocking more transmission area, thus requiring a brighter backlight and consuming more power, making this type of display less desirable for notebook computers. Currently Panasonic is using an enhanced version eIPS for their large size LCD-TV products as well as Hewlett-Packard in its WebOS based TouchPad tablet and their Chromebook 11.|$|E

50|$|IPS (<b>In-plane</b> <b>switching)</b> is {{a screen}} {{technology}} for liquid crystal displays (LCDs). It {{was designed to}} solve the main limitations of the twisted nematic field effect (TN) matrix LCDs in the late 1980s. These limitations included strong viewing angle dependence and low-quality color reproduction. <b>In-plane</b> <b>switching</b> involves arranging and switching {{the orientation of the}} molecules of the liquid crystal (LC) layer between the glass substrates.

40|$|Abstract An <b>in-plane</b> optical <b>switch</b> was {{designed}} by incorporating a micromirror with a rotational comb drive. The comb drive is capable of both actuation and angular position sensing. The optical switch measures 2. 0 mm in diameter and can perform in-plane reflection of up to 90 ° at 30 V. The system is mechanically overdamped, having a rise time for scanning of 7. 0 ms and a natural frequency of 88 Hz. Given the high scanning range at low voltage, if rotational scanning at low frequency is desired (< 45 Hz), the rotational comb drive is an excellent candidate for combined actuation and sensing. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} design and the RF {{performances}} of two- terminals <b>in-plane</b> RF <b>switches</b> based on dioxide vanadium (VO 2) -phase transition material. The VO 2 material undergoes a thermally-driven metal- insulator transition showing a resistivity variation up to five orders of magnitude as the material changes between its insulator and metallic states. We realized inline RF switches integrating VO 2 patterns of different lengths (3 to 20 m) and investigated their switching properties for both thermal and electrical actuation. For a thermally actuated 3 -m length VO 2 pattern switch we measured an off-state capacitance of 7. 7 Ff and an on-state resistance of ~ 2 , with a cut-off frequency higher than 10 THz...|$|R

The micro-ball lens array is batch-fabricated with the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technique and batch-assembled onto the platform. The out-of-plane optical switch consists of a self-latching vertical mirror on a suspension diaphragm. It can reduce the large motion space required for <b>in-plane</b> optical <b>switches.</b> The optical platform design enables control of {{the distance between the}} fiber, micro-ball lens and out-of-plane optical switch and increases their coupling efficiency. An electrostatic driving voltage is used to actuate the optical switch. Not only does this fabrication process provide an accurate coupling distance, it also reduces the micro-assembly cost...|$|R

40|$|The helical flexoelectro-optic effect shows {{interesting}} <b>in-plane</b> electro-optic <b>switching</b> behavior due to flexoelectric coupling with applied electric fields. Previous {{understanding of}} the behavior has been generally based on an analytic approach that makes certain assumptions about the uniformity of the helical structure and the induced tilt angle under field application. Here we remove these assumptions and develop a perturbative approximation to describe the structure in more detail. We also use a numerical method to investigate the behavior in regimes where the perturbative approach is inappropriate. The impact of variation in elastic constants and dielectric anisotropy is investigated. We find that dielectric behavior in particular can lead to substantial differences between the tilt angle obtained here and those obtained using previous analytic models...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a versatile variable field module (VFM) with capability of both field and angular dependent measurements up to 1800 Oe for scanning probe system. The magnetic field strength is changed {{by adjusting the}} distance between a rare earth magnet and the probe tip and is monitored in-situ by a built-in Hall sensor. Rotating the magnet allows the field vector to change from the horizontal to vertical direction and {{makes it possible to}} do angular dependent measurements. The capability of the VFM system is demonstrated by degaussing a floppy disk media with increasing magnetic field. Angular dependent measurements clearly show the evolution of magnetic domain structures, with a completely reversible magnetic force microscopy phase contrast observed when the magnetic field is rotated by 180.

50|$|<b>In-Plane</b> <b>Switching</b> was {{developed}} by Hitachi Ltd. in 1996 to improve on the poor viewing angle and the poor color reproduction of TN panels at that time. Its name comes from the main difference from TN panels, that the crystal molecules move parallel to the panel plane instead of perpendicular to it. This change reduces the amount of light scattering in the matrix, which gives IPS its characteristic wide viewing angles and good color reproduction.|$|E
40|$|Step-induced antiferromagnetic (AFM) {{uniaxial}} anisotropy {{and its effects}} on the exchange coupling have been systematically investigated in the epitaxial Fe/CoO bilayers on a MgO(001) vicinal surface. X-ray magnetic linear dichroism measurements proved that the atomic steps induced a strong in-plane AFM {{uniaxial anisotropy}} in the CoO film. We found that the thermal activation induced <b>in-plane</b> 90 degrees <b>switching</b> of CoO AFM in-plane spins. The competition among the step-induced AFM anisotropy, the interface exchange coupling, and thermal activation generate a novel multiple in-plane spin reorientation transition of the Fe magnetization, which can further provide new insights on the exchange coupling in FM/AFM systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{the quest}} to develop spintronic logic, it was {{discovered}} that magnetoelectric switching results in lower energy and shorter switching time than other mechanisms. Magnetoelectric (ME) field due to exchange bias at the interface with a multi-ferroic (such as BiFeO 3) is well suited for 180 degree switching of magnetization. The ME field is determined by the direction of canted magnetization in BiFeO 3 which can point at an angle to the plane, to which voltage is applied. Dependence of switching time and the threshold of ME field on its angles was determined by micromagnetic simulations. Switching occurs by formation of a domain wall {{on the side of the}} nanomagnet on top of BFO and its propagation to the rest of the magnet. For <b>in-plane</b> magnetization, <b>switching</b> occurs over a wide range of angles and at all magnitudes of ME field above threshold. For out-of-plane magnetization failure occurs (with an exception of a narrow range of angles and magnitudes of ME field) due to the domain wall reflecting from the opposite end of the nanomagnet.

Polarization switching by an applied field is a complex phenomenon which depends on the initial domain ordering, defect concentration, electrical boundary conditions and charge screening. Injected free charge may also to be used to reversibly <b>switch</b> <b>in-plane</b> polarized domains. We show that the interaction between the initial domain order and the bulk screening provided by very low energy electrons switches the polarization without the collateral radiation damage which occurs when employing a beam of high energy electrons. Polarization switching during charge injection adds a new dimension to the multifunctionality of ferroelectric oxides...|$|R
50|$|Several other {{variations}} and modifications {{have been}} used in order to improve performance in certain applications. <b>In-Plane</b> <b>Switching</b> displays (IPS and S-IPS) offer wider viewing angles and better color reproduction, but are more difficult to construct and have slightly slower response times. Vertical Alignment (VA, S-PVA and MVA) offer higher contrast ratios and good response times, but suffer from color shifting when viewed from the side. In general, all of these displays work in a similar fashion by controlling the polarization of the light source.|$|E

50|$|The {{twisted nematic}} effect (TN-effect) was a main {{technology}} breakthrough that made LCDs practical. Unlike earlier displays, TN-cells {{did not require}} a current to flow for operation and used low operating voltages suitable for use with batteries. The introduction of TN-effect displays led to their rapid expansion in the display field, quickly pushing out other common technologies like monolithic LEDs and CRTs for most electronics. By the 1990s, TN-effect LCDs were largely universal in portable electronics.

The Blue Phase mode can make its own alignment layers, eliminating the need for any mechanical alignment and rubbing processes. This reduces the number of required manufacturing steps, resulting in savings on production costs. Additionally it has been claimed that Blue Phase panels would reduce the sensitivity of the liquid crystal layer to mechanical pressure which could impair the lateral uniformity of display (e.g. luminance, chromaticity).|$|E

40|$|Recent angle {{resolved}} photoemission spectroscopy {{measurements on}} strong spin-orbit coupled materials have shown an <b>in-plane</b> orbital texture <b>switch</b> at their respective Dirac points, {{regardless of whether}} they are topological insulators or "trivial" Rashba materials. This feature has also been demonstrated in a few materials (Bi_ 2 Se_ 3, Bi_ 2 Te_ 3, and BiTeI) though DFT calculations. Here we present a minimal orbital-derived tight binding model to calculate the electron wave-function in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. We show that the orbital components of the wave-function demonstrate an orbital-texture switch in addition to the usual spin switch seen in spin polarized bands. This orbital texture switch is determined by the existence of three main properties: local or global inversion symmetry breaking, strong spin-orbit coupling, and non-local physics (the electrons are on a lattice). Using our model we demonstrate that the orbital texture switch is ubiquitous and to be expected in many real systems. The orbital hybridization of the bands is the key aspect for understanding the unique wave function properties of these materials, and this minimal model helps to establish the quantum perturbations that drive these hybridizations...|$|R

Combined with the Zeeman splitting, {{this leads to}} a singlet-triplet crossing, which can be observed as a pronounced jump in the magnetization at in-plane fields of a few Tesla, and perpendicular fields of the order of 10 Tesla for typical self-assembled dots. We use harmonic potentials to model the confining of electrons, and calculate the exchange J using the Heitler-London and Hund-Mulliken technique, including the long-range Coulomb interaction. With our results we provide experimental criteria for the distinction of singlet and triplet states and therefore for microscopic spin measurements.
