40|$|Spread Spectrum {{clocking}} is {{an established}} approach to mitigate electromagnetic interference (EMI) of digital circuits, by intentionally sweeping the clock frequency. In {{this way the}} energy of each clock harmonic is spread over a larger bandwidth, thereby reducing {{the peak of the}} <b>interfering</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This paper describes an highly flexible all digital spread spectrum clock generator (SSCG) realized with a standard-cells design flow. The developed circuit supports discontinuous frequency modulation profiles (with improved EMI reduction capability) and features reduced output jitter, due to delay interpolators and digital compensation of delay path asymmetries. The proposed SSCG is ideally suited for complex system on chips applications, having programmable spreading parameters, frequency synthesis capability and reduced recovery time to support local standby modes. The SSCG is implemented in bulk 28 nm CMOS technology, presents a maximum working frequency of 3. 3 GHz and less than 3. 2 psrms output jitter. The measured peak level reduction of the clock power spectrum, at 1. 0 GHz output frequency, is 27. 0 dB with a 10...|$|E

In this context, a fast simultaneous UV-VIS spectrometer quantification method was developed for an antibiotic dual drug system. Particular challenges arose from <b>interfering</b> <b>spectra,</b> as well as different solubility and stability of the drugs. The test system used here consists of the antibiotics Minocycline and Rifampin, which are used as an antibiotic combination approach in {{a growing number of}} device applications, such as impregnation of venous or urethral catheters. Two suitable wavelengths for this test system were identified. At a wavelength of 475 nm only Rifampin shows an absorption maximum, which was used to determine the concentration of Rifampin in the mixture. At 245 nm both antibiotics have a local extremum, a maximum for Minocycline, and a minimum for Rifampin. The developed UV-VIS spectrometer method for Rifampin and Minocycline dissolved in Sörensen buffer showed good results for small concentrations of Minocycline. For stability tests, a mixture of both antibiotics (1 : 1) was stored at 37 °C for up to 144 h in NaCl solution (0. 9 %), and in Sörensen buffer, respectively. At defined time points, UV-VIS spectra were recorded, and feasibility of this quick simultaneous quantification method for these two widely used antibiotics was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Virtualizing {{wireless}} networks has {{the potential}} to improve resource usage efficiency (system capacity) through spec- trum sharing while allowing for isolation between users and customization of applications [9]. In most work related to wireless network virtualization, the sharing of spectrum is considered at the level of chunks of frequency that do not <b>interfere.</b> Such <b>spectrum</b> sharing, where service provider SPA can use the spectrum allocated to SPB when SPB does not use it, results in multiplexing gains improving the resource usage (see for example, [12]). We argue that shar- ing radio resources that are a function of geography and signal strength, rather than slices of spectrum is also possi- ble. When we consider sharing of radio resources, the trans- mit power, the interference, and the usage scenario (capa- bilities/needs of devices) become important in determining what can be shared. In this paper, the potential gain from sharing such radio resources while using MIMO for combat- ing interference and exploiting spatial degrees of freedom is investigated in a two service provider collaboration scenario. The metric used is the capacity of the system (with a large cell and a small cell) as a function of separation distance, transmit power, cell range, and various MIMO settings.

40|$|The {{infrared}} sensors task of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL's) Remote Spectroscopy Project (Task B of Project PL 211) {{is focused}} on the science and technology of remote and in-situ spectroscopic chemical sensors for detecting proliferation and coun-tering terrorism. Missions to be addressed by remote chemical sensor development in-clude detecting proliferation of nuclear or chemical weapons, and providing warning of terrorist use of chemical weapons. Missions to be addressed by in-situ chemical sensor development include countering terrorism by screening luggage, personnel, and shipping containers for explosives, firearms, narcotics, chemical weapons, or chemical weapons residues, and mapping contaminated areas. The science and technology is also relevant to chemical weapons defense, air operations support, monitoring emissions from chemi-cal weapons destruction or industrial activities, law enforcement, medical diagnostics, and other applications. Sensors for most of these missions will require extreme chemical sensitivity and selectiv-ity because the signature chemicals of importance are expected to be present in low con-centrations or have low vapor pressures, and the ambient air is likely to contain pollutants or other chemicals with <b>interfering</b> <b>spectra.</b> Cavity-enhanced chemical sensors (CES) that draw air samples into optical cavities for laser-based interrogation of their chemical content promise real-time, in-situ chemical detection with extreme sensitivity to specified target molecules and superb immunity to spectral interference and other sources of noise. PNNL is developing CES based on quantum cascade (QC) lasers that operate in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR - 3 to 5 microns) and long-wave infrared (LWIR - 8 to 14 mi-crons), and CES based on telecommunications lasers operating in the short-wave infrared (SWIR - 1 to 2 microns). All three spectral regions are promising because smaller mo-lecular absorption cross sections in the SWIR are offset by the superior performance, ma-turity, and robustness of SWIR lasers, detectors, and other components, while the reverse is true for the MWIR and LWIR bands. PNNL's research activities include identification of signature chemicals and quantification of their spectroscopy, exploration of novel sensing techniques, and experimental sensor system construction and testing. In FY 02, experimental QC laser systems developed with DARPA funding were used to explore continuous-wave (cw) CES in various forms culminating in the NICE-OHMS technique [1 - 3] discussed below. In FY 02 PNNL also built an SWIR sensor to validate utility of the SWIR spectral region for chemical sensing, and explore the science and engineering of CES in field environments. The remainder of this report is devoted to PNNL's LWIR CES research. During FY 02 PNNL explored the performance and limitations of several detection tech-niques in the LWIR including direct cavity-enhanced absorption, cavity-dithered phase-sensitive detection and resonant sideband cavity-enhanced detection.

The crown ether samples were prepared by miximg with the reagents (some inorganic and organic salts and glycine) or being supported on the support materials (diatomite and glass supports) in a 1 : 10 ratio by weight as the samples for testing. The pure crown ethers and their mixtures were tested by the programmed temperature direct insertion probe mass spectrometer. The effects of the reagents and support materials on the peak maximum temperature (Tm) and the spectra of the crown ethers were studied. The results Tm of the crown ethers to increase significantly, and glycine and ammonium salts <b>interfered</b> the <b>spectra</b> of the crown ethers. The effect of sample size and "concentration" on Tm of the crowns also was investigated. The bigger sample size caused the Tm to be higher. No significant effect of the "concentration" on Tm was observed.

40|$|Ultra {{wideband}} (UWB) {{communication systems}} refers to systems whose bandwidth is many {{times greater than}} the “narrowband” systems (refers to a signal which occupies only small amount of space on the radio spectrum). UWB can be used for indoor, communications for high data rates, or very low data rates for substantial link distances because of the extremely large bandwidth, immune to multi-path fading, penetrations through concrete block or obstacles. UWB can also used for short distance ranging whose applications include asset location in a warehouse, position location for wireless sensor networks, and collision avoidance. In order to verify analytical and simulation results with real-world measurements, the need for experimental UWB systems arises. The Institute of Communications Engineering [IANT] has developed a low-cost experimental UWB positioning system to test UWB based positioning concepts. The mobile devices use the avalanche effect of transistors for simple generation of bi-phase pulses and are TDMA multi-user capable. The receiver is implemented in software and employs coherent cross-correlation with peak detection to localize the mobile unit via Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA) algorithms. Since the power of a proposed UWB system’s signal spread over a very wide bandwidth, the frequencies allocated to multiple existing narrowband systems may <b>interfere</b> with UWB <b>spectrum.</b> The goal of the filters discussed in this project is to cancel or suppress the interference while not distort the desired signal.

If we known the interference tones then it may be removed using a simple notched filter. Herein, we chose an adaptive filter so that it can adjust the interference tone automatically and cancel.

40|$|AbstractEnabling the {{implementation}} of top down proteomic techniques within clinical workflows requires {{a dramatic increase in}} sensitivity. It has been previously demonstrated that electrospray ionization (ESI) becomes more efficient with decreasing volumetric flow rates at the emitter. Therefore, narrow inner diameter (I. D.) columns used in front-end chromatographic separations yield increased sensitivity. However, the smaller cross-sectional area of a narrow I. D. column places a larger fraction of the eluent in fluid communication with the electrode within the high voltage union that facilitates electrospray ionization (ESI), leading to increased oxidation of solution-phase proteins. Oxidation of proteins alters their chemical state of the protein, complicates data analysis, and reduces the depth of proteome coverage attained in a typical top-down proteomics experiment. Excessive protein oxidation results in poor deconvolution and exact mass calculations from MS 1 <b>spectra,</b> <b>interferes</b> with peak isolation for MS/MS fragmentation, and effectively reduces sensitivity by splitting ion current. All of these factors deteriorate top down mass spectral data quality, an effect that becomes more pronounced as column diameter decreases. Artificial protein oxidation can also mislead investigations of in vivo protein oxidation. All of these effects are accentuated in comparison to bottom up proteomics due to the increased probability of having oxidizable residues within a particular species with increasing mass. Herein, we describe a configuration (which we term “Low Protein Oxidation (LPOx) ”) for proteomics experiments created by re-arranging liquid chromatography (LC) plumbing and present its application to artificial protein oxidation and show a marked improvement in detection sensitivity. Using a standard mixture of five intact proteins, we demonstrate that the LPOx configuration reduces protein oxidation up to 90 % using 50 μm I. D. columns when compared to a conventional LC plumbing configuration with 50 μm I. D. column. As a proof-of-concept study, at least 11 distinct proteoforms of serum Apolipoprotein A 1 were detected with the LPOx configuration.

Autism spectrum disorders are an important health and educational problem affecting many areas of daily living, (CDC, 2012; Cermak, S., et al, 2010). Over 80 percent of children diagnosed with autism demonstrate sensory modulation symptoms and related behaviors such as sensory seeking, sensory avoiding, self-stimulation, etc, (Kintwell, et al, 2011; Ben-Sasson, et al, 2009; Tomchek 2 ̆ 6 Dunn, 2006). ^ There is some beginning evidence found in the literature that sensory processing of children on the autism <b>spectrum</b> <b>interferes</b> with their daily routines (Nadon, et al, 2011; Stein, et al, 2011 / 2012; Schaff, et al, 2011), and there is a paucity of research which addresses the impact sensory processing has on the daily routine of eating. This study will contribute to this expanding body of knowledge. ^ Eating difficulties are a frequent problem for children on the autism spectrum (Nadon, et al, 2011; Schreck 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2006) which impacts their physical health (Lukens 2 ̆ 6 Linscheid, 2008), their functioning in the family (Schaff, et al, 2001) and their functioning in educational settings (Koenig 2 ̆ 6 Rudney, 2010). This study assesses the differences in sensory processing and eating problem behaviors between two groups of children, aged 5 - 12 years, those identified on the autism spectrum (N= 34) and those typically developing (N= 34). ^ Data was collected through parent and child questionnaires that assessed sensory processing and eating behaviors (BAMBI, Short Sensory Profile, Sensory Eating Checklist, and Touch Inventory for Elementary-Aged Children). Results of the t test, anovas and correlation analyses revealed statistically significant differences on all measures between both samples (p 3 ̆c. 001) and demonstrated a moderate to strong positive correlation between eating problem behaviors and sensory processing difficulties with correlation coefficients ranging from. 548 -. 947. This study provides preliminary data supporting the connection between sensory processing difficulties and eating difficulties in children with autism. It is important to identify these difficulties because with increased identification, improved and informed support and treatment can be provided for the children and their families. ...|$|R

With modern {{communication}} systems moving towards Cognitive Radios (CRs) to better utilize the available spectrum, spectrum sensing {{is a key}} enabling functionality that allows the detection of primary users and <b>interferes</b> to support <b>spectrum</b> sharing. Spectrum sensing can also be useful in security applications that require {{a certain degree of}} RF spectrum awareness. In addition, it can be used for built-in self-test like transmitter tuning by measuring the output spectrum to allow spur reduction and digital predistortion. To be useful, the spectrum scanners used for sensing should be able to handle large blockers and detect weak signals at the same time. Thus both good linearity and high sensitivity are desired. In addition, these scanners need to be highly programmable and selective while incurring a low power cost. In this research we have addressed the issues that plague traditional spectrum scanners by using the recent technique of Filtering by Aliasing (FA). The FA-based spectrum scanner is a passive structure that uses simple but linear, periodically time-varying (LPTV) RC circuits. This LPTV circuit is shown to provide a high spurious-free dynamic range, precise resolution bandwidths while still consuming very low power. In this dissertation, the FA technique is briefly explained, and the design considerations and implementation of a spectrum scanner IC that achieves excellent linearity and low power as compared to state-of-the-art designs is presented. In addition, a theoretical analysis of some of the limiting factors of the passive LPTV scanner is presented together with some circuit and/or signal-processing solutions.

I delineated therefore in a Paper the Perimeter of the Spectrum FAP GMT, and in trying the third Experiment of the first Part of this Book, I held the Paper so that the Spectrum might fall upon this delineated Figure, and agree with it exactly, whilst an Assistant, whose Eyes for distinguishing Colours were more critical than mine, did by Right Lines [Greek: ab, gd, ez,] &c. drawn cross the Spectrum, note the Confines of the Colours, that is of the red M[Greek: ab]F, of the orange [Greek: agdb], of the yellow [Greek: gezd], of the green [Greek: eêthz], of the blue [Greek: êikth], of the indico [Greek: ilmk], and of the violet [Greek: l]GA[Greek: m].

Let GM be produced to X, that MX may be equal to GM, and conceive GX, [Greek: l]X, [Greek: i]X, [Greek: ê]X, [Greek: e]X, [Greek: g]X, [Greek: a]X, MX, to be in proportion to one another, as the Numbers, 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 9/16, 1/2, and so to represent the Chords of the Key, and of a Tone, a third Minor, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth Major, a seventh and an eighth above that Key: And the Intervals M[Greek: a], [Greek: ag], [Greek: ge], [Greek: eê], [Greek: êi], [Greek: il], and [Greek: l]G, will be the Spaces which the several Colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) take up.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown hyperspectral imaging {{to be a powerful}} tool to distinguish carbonate phases with slight compositional differences on quarry cliff faces. The traditional remote sensing set 5 up uses an optimal short distance between the hyperspectral camera mounted on a tripod and a quarry wall characterized by a planar, mostly unweathered surface. Here we present results of a modified workflow geared to the application of ground 5 based hyperspectral imaging of rough and weathered cliff faces in order to map large scale dolomite bodies from a distance of up to several kilometres. The goal {{of the study was to}} determine unique spectral properties of fracture 5 controlled dolomite bodies in order to be able to distinguish them from a dolomitic host rock. In addition, the impact of weathering on carbonate phases and thus, the modification of the spectral signature between altered and unaltered carbonates is assessed. The spectral analysis is complemented by ICP 5 AES measurements of the spectrally measured powders. Furthermore, we examined the detection limits and characterisation potential of dolomite bodies from hyperspectral images captured at varying distances from cliff faces in the study area. Hyperspectral images of 10 natural cliffs distributed across the Central Oman Mountains were obtained with a Push broom scanner system. The high resolution of 5. 45 nm (288 bands in total) enabled the visualization of small 5 scale changes in the near infrared continuous spectrum of all present lithofacies types. The determination of dolomite bodies of varying sizes (metre to hundreds of metres) on natural cliffs was achieved with the hyperspectral mapping approach and mapping results have been tested with the position of visually defined dolomite bodies on field panoramas. Spectra of natural cliffs contain a strong absorption peak indicative for iron which is absent in spectra of unweathered sample powders. However, ICP 5 AES analysis of powders revealed relatively low contents of iron of 12392 ppm. The strong peaks in field images are interpreted as linked to intensive weathering associated with the precepitation of goethite, hematite, specularite and manganese as well as intensive dedolomitization. Dedolomitization is indicated by calcitic spectra derived from the dolomite bodies. The spectral difference of laboratory and field <b>spectra</b> <b>interferes</b> significantly the application of laboratory spectra of powdered samples for the identification of dolomite bodies in the field. Furthermore, the process of late dedolomitization puts an additional challenge on the determination of dolomite bodies. Due to these strong spectral variations between laboratory and field spectra, we recommend that the mapping approaches should not solely rely on spectral algorithms but also consider normal light field panoramas and representative outcrop analysis. We also note that the quality of resolution is too low for the determination of small 5 scale variations of diagenetic phases at distances larger than 4 km. However, when the limitations mentioned are taken into account, hyperspectral imaging proves to be a powerful tool that helps in the determination of the distribution of diagenetic phases, even in challenging conditions...|$|R
