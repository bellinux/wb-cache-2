5|$|Many early sources {{gave the}} {{scientific}} {{name of the}} dusky shark as Carcharias (later Carcharhinus) lamiella, which originated from an 1882 account by David Starr <b>Jordan</b> <b>and</b> Charles Henry Gilbert. Although <b>Jordan</b> <b>and</b> Gilbert referred {{to a set of}} jaws that came from a dusky shark, the type specimen they designated was later discovered to be a copper shark (C. brachyurus). Therefore, C. lamiella is not considered a synonym of C. obscurus but rather of C. brachyurus. Other common names for this species include bay shark, black whaler, brown common gray shark, brown dusky shark, brown shark, common whaler, dusky ground shark, dusky whaler, river whaler, shovelnose, and slender whaler shark.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} was described twice by three American ichthyologists: as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr <b>Jordan</b> <b>and</b> Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and as Trygon brevis by Samuel Garman in Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. <b>Jordan</b> <b>and</b> Gilbert's account {{was published in}} May while Garman's was published in October, making dipterurus (feminine dipterura) the correct name as it was published first. However, when Garman synonymized the two in 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis, leading to long-standing confusion. Both Dasybatus and Trygon were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis, but many authors still listed D.brevis in place of or in addition to D.dipterura. Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray (D.hawaiensis) with D.dipterura in 1913, which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation.|$|E
