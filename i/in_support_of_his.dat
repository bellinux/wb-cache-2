5|$|William {{excluded}} George {{from active}} military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence {{until after the}} deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.|$|E
5|$|William, {{moving quickly}} <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own claims, had already seized Negroponte. Gradenigo and his Venetians {{attacked}} {{and took the}} city, but William responded by sending his nephew the baron of Karytaina, Geoffroy de Bruyères, who recaptured Negroponte and launched devastating raids in Euboea. Venice then laid siege to the city, which dragged on for thirteen months until its defenders capitulated in early 1258. An Achaean counterattack was repulsed by Venetian infantry sallying forth and defeating the famed Achaean cavalry before the city's walls.|$|E
5|$|During the hiatus, the Loaded members {{continued}} to work on various projects. Reading formed the group The Disciples (that later became The Chelsea Smiles) with Christian Martucci, Todd Youth, and Howie Pyro. Rouse would release another album with Alien Crime Syndicate, titled Ten Songs in the Key of Betrayal, who went on the perform as Tommy Stinson's backing band <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> solo album Village Gorilla Head. Following the tour, Rouse joined Vendetta Red, replacing previous bassist Michael Vermillion, on their tour in support of their latest album Sisters of the Red Death. However, they disbanded in March 2006, with Rouse and former Vendetta Red members Zach Davidson and Leif Andersen, {{as well as local}} drummer Ben Libay, forming the group Sirens Sister. They released one album in 2006, before Rouse left the group in 2007. Squires re-joined The Long Winters, having been a member prior to joining Loaded, playing with the group for less than a year before departing.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive {{and member of the}} U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat. In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.|$|E
5|$|McKagan first formed Loaded {{to be his}} touring band <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{unreleased}} {{solo album}} Beautiful Disease. The first lineup included Michael Barragan (formerly of Plexi), Dez Cadena (formerly of Black Flag), and Taz Bentley (formerly of The Reverend Horton Heat). The band disbanded {{before the end of}} 1999. After working on new material with drummer Geoff Reading, Loaded was reformed in 2001, adding guitarist Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the line-up, though both were briefly replaced by guitarist Dave Kushner (Velvet Revolver, formerly of Wasted Youth and Electric Love Hogs) and bassist George Stuart Dahlquist (formerly of Asva and Burning Witch) in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{believed}} he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, {{in keeping with the}} customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end.|$|E

5|$|The Metamorfosis World Tour was a {{worldwide}} concert tour by Guatemalan singer–songwriter Ricardo Arjona <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thirteenth studio album, Independiente.

The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates at American, Argentinian and Chilean venues, and received a positive critical response. The show was designed for a revolving stage, with Arjona performing while the scenery changed with the songs being performed. Four changes of scenery were developed: a two-floor apartment, a bar, a circus and a theatre. The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} part resentful of the French king's {{previous}} support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would {{have been expected to}} take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefitting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.|$|E
5|$|In 1161 Chesney became {{embroiled in}} a dispute with St Albans Abbey, {{resulting}} from his efforts to enforce his right, as bishop, to supervise religious houses within his diocese. Although Pope Alexander III sent a papal bull to England ordering the case to be heard {{by a panel of}} two bishops, King Henry II felt that the papal order infringed on his royal rights and had the case decided at the royal court instead. In 1155–1156 St Albans had secured papal privileges from the English Pope Adrian IV, who had previously been a monk there, that exempted the abbey from diocesan supervision, and it was these privileges that Chesney challenged. Chesney secured not only the papal bull but a royal commission to investigate the rights of the abbey {{as they were in the}} time of King Henry I. The final disposition of the case took place in 1163, at a royal council at Westminster, where the abbey produced both the papal privileges and a forged charter of Offa of Mercia in support of their case. As Chesney was unable to produce any documents <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own position, the king and council told the bishop that they favoured the abbey's cause. The king also ruled that the abbey was a royal proprietary church, and thus had special exemptions. In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the abbey compensated the bishopric with some land in return for the bishop renouncing his claims.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} independence and {{sovereignty of the}} Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960. Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991. The armed forces are {{under the direction of}} the Minister of the Interior and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} {{supported}} by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England. When Sir Walter Raleigh was released from imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish. Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish. On Raleigh's return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain. James's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, especially after his Protestant son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's Rhineland home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son-in-law. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick, and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Sir Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment, which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. Urged on by the Duke of Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.|$|E
