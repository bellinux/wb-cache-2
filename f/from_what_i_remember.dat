Anyway, for your own {{peculiar}} and crack-brained reasons, you don't want this business, and I say at once you can't want it less than I do.

6000|$|There was {{certainly}} {{very much in}} this to provoke Mrs. Crawley. It was not only that she knew well that her cousin would give ample and immediate attention, and lend himself thoroughly to the matter without any idea of payment,--but {{that she could not}} quite believe that her husband's humility was true humility. She strove to believe it, but knew that she failed. After all it was only a feeling on her part. There was no argument within herself about it. An unpleasant taste came across the palate of her mind, as such a savour will sometimes, from some unexpected source, come across the palate of the mouth. Well; she could only gulp at it, and swallow it and excuse it. Among the salad that comes from your garden a bitter leaf will now and then make its way into your salad-bowl. Alas, there were so many bitter leaves ever making their way into her bowl! [...] "What I mean is, Josiah, that no long explanation will be needed.

6000|$|... "I {{have never}} heard any one who {{fulfilled}} my ideal of an orator. [...] Grattan would have been near it, but for his harlequin delivery. Pitt [...] I never heard.

Canning [...] is sometimes very like one. Windham I did not admire, though all the [...] world did; it seemed sad sophistry. Whitbread was the Demosthenes of [...] bad taste and vulgar vehemence, but strong, and English. Holland is [...] impressive from sense and sincerity. Lord Lansdowne good, but still a [...] debater only. Grenville I like vastly, if he would prune his speeches [...] down to an hour's delivery.

5000|$|It {{just kind}} of culminated into this. When I {{wanted to do a}} full on metal album, I wanted to bring in more heavy metal {{influences}} and more progressive rock stuff. I don't know how old you are, but I assume we are about the same age. You probably have some musical gems that you stored in your memory that you grew up with. They probably sound greater in your head than if you went and listened to the album again. It is that memory and emotion you have from that type of music. Without trying to duplicate it musically, I have been wanting to create a similar atmosphere and feeling <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> back then. It is very much a historical feel. For me personally, a great part of music is the way music builds up into something; those small seconds where everything is perfect. It gives you a religious feeling. I just want to use that energy and put that into it as well. I did this more than thinking of genre terms and technical terms in writing the album.|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note provides {{background information}} regarding the control dewar secondary vacuum container. The secondary vacuum container has it's origin with the CDP control dewar design. The name secondary vacuum container replaced the CDP term 'Watt can' which was named after Bob Watt (SLAC), a PAC/DOE review committee member who participated {{in a review of}} CDP and recommended a secondary vacuum enclosure. One of the most fragile parts of the control dewar design is the ceramic electrical feed throughs located in the secondary vacuum container. The secondary vacuum container is provided to guard against potential leaks in these ceramic insulating feed throughs. The secondary vacuum container has a pumping line separate from the main solenoid/control dewar insulating vacuum. This pumping line is connected to the inlet of the turbo pump for initial pumpdown. Under normal operation the container is isolated. Should a feedthrough develop a small leak, alternate pumping arrangements for the secondary vacuum container could be arranged. The pressure in the secondary vacuum container should be kept in a range that the breakdown voltage is kept at a maximum. The breakdown voltage is known to be a function of pressure and is described by a Paschen curve. I cannot find a copy of the curve at this time, but <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> the breakdown voltage is a minimum somewhere around 10 - 3 torr. Ideally the pressure in the secondary vacuum can should be kept very low, around 10 E- 6 or 10 E- 7 torr for maximum breakdown voltage. If however a leak developed and this was not possible, then one could operate at a pressure higher than the minima point...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ten {{plants that}} having been groundbreaking {{drugs in the}} past century that were all derived from plants. I chose to do my project on this topic because of my family’s history with natural medicine. In 1999 my mother was diagnosed with Bile Duct cancer and the doctors gave her only a couple of weeks to live. The doctors recommended chemotherapy and radiation, but the results seemed negative for the situation. After some extensive research, my parents found St. Georges Medicinal Wellness Center located in the tiny village of Bad Aibling, Germany. This hospital along with offering traditional medicine techniques for cancer like chemotherapy and radiation, also offered medicinal wellness as an individualized health care. The hospital refers to the program as an integrative cancer therapy concept. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> from the times that I was fortunate to travel to the clinic, she would get a round of chemotherapy followed by a natural medicine, homeopathic remedy, or massage therapy. Although ultimately my mother lost her battle with cancer, she surpassed the doctor’s expectations of several weeks to over seven years. I truly believe that the natural medicine treatments in combination with the western medicine that were used at this clinic added valuable years to her life. In my research I identified ten plants that I believed had the largest impact on modern medicine. The plants that I decided had the largest impact are as followed: Digitalis for atrial fibrillation, Yew for solid tumor cancer, Catharanthus for Leukemia, Camptotheca for soft tissue cancers, Poppy for pain management, Cinchona for Malaria, Podophyllum for Genital Warts, Saw Palmetto for prostate issues, Black Cohosh for menopause, and flaxseed for cholesterol. This project provided information to show that plants continue to {{play a significant role in}} holistic medicine. They also provide the chemical building blocks for new drugs. From my research I have concluded that plants will continue to play a role in drug design for years to come...|$|E
