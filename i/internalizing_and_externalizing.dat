40|$|The {{relationship}} between cohesion and {{flexibility in the}} foster family and the foster child's psychosocial functioning was examined. Psychosocial functioning was conceptualized as <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems, <b>and</b> social skills. The sample consisted of 90 foster children aged 3 to 12, whose foster parents volunteered {{to participate in a}} PMTO-programme. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form (TRF), Caregiver- Teacher's Report Form (C-TRF), and teacher- and parent versions of Social Skills Rating System (SSRS). Cohesion and flexibility were measured with Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES III). On average the foster children scored above the norms for <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems. Better social skills were related to fewer total, <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems. There was no association between cohesion and flexibility in the foster family <b>and</b> the child's <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems, however a higher degree of cohesion was related to better social skills. The results indicate that foster family cohesion may be an important factor in the social functioning for the foster children...|$|R

Childhood family violence (physical and psychological parental violence), current extrafamily violence (bullying and dating violence), and family structure were taken into account. A sample of 278 adolescents (mean age: 14. 2) were recruited in three public schools located in low to high socioeconomic areas. Participants were in the 7 th, 8 th, and 9 th grades, and each completed a self-administered questionnaire. Frequency of current psychological violence {{is about the same}} for each parental figure.

50|$|Researches {{have often}} {{conducted}} studies {{to determine whether}} membership to a clique produces positive or negative development. In one 4-year study of 451 children from age nine to twelve, Miranda Witvliet along with Pol A. C. van Lier, Mara Brendgen, Hans M. Koot, and Frank Vitaro examined longitudinal associations between clique membership status and <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> problems during late childhood. In this quasi-experiment the researchers aimed to discover if clique membership status was linked to increases in children's psychopathology. Children from five different elementary schools in northwestern Quebec, Canada were the participants of this particular study. In the study, clique membership status was identified through social network analysis, and peer nominations {{were used to assess}} <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> problems. The study used the program Kliquefinder to identify clique membership status through social network analysis. Through use of behavioural descriptions on the Pupil Evaluation Inventory (PEI), peer nominations of externalizing and internalizing behaviors were obtained.|$|E

40|$|Background Children {{with reading}} disabilities {{are at risk}} for {{developing}} psychosocial problems more than children without reading disabilities. Some research indicates that children with reading disabilities have more <b>externalizing</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>internalizing</b> problems, while other research indicates that both have the same amount of psychosocial problems. Previous research has divided results about the difference between boys and girls in reporting psychosocial problems. Present research with a sample of Dutch dyslectic children shows that parents of dyslectic children report more anxiety, depression and mood problems than non-dyslectic children do. Aims This study examined prevalence of psychosocial problems in children with reading disabilities. Psychosocial problems are divided in <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> problems in 10 to 12 aged children. Differences in problems between girls and boys are also investigated. Sample Participants were 115 Dutch males and females from several elementary schools. Methods Participants completed the Youth Self Report questionnaire, which measures psychosocial problems, <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized.</b> Results There is no mean difference between children with reading disabilities and children without reading disabilities. Dyslectic children report more rule-breaking behaviour than non-dyslectic children do. Conclusions This study shows that children with reading disabilities report as much psychosocial problems than children without reading disabilities do. There is no difference found between boys and girls in reporting psychosocial problems...|$|R

50|$|Although these maladjusted, {{detrimental}} cliques {{can develop}} among adolescents of either gender, those based on aggression and delinquency {{are more often}} observed in males.

50|$|Schwartz et al. (1998) {{investigated}} {{the role of}} victimization {{in the development of}} children’s behavior problems, focusing on both <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> problems. They hypothesized that higher levels of victimization would lead to increased level of behavioral problems. Child behavior was reported by teachers and parents, measured using the Child Behavior Checklist, and peer victimization was measured using peer nomination. Indeed, they found that peer victimization in middle childhood was associated with behavioral maladjustment on both a concurrent and prospective basis. Additionally, externalizing behaviors were more strongly associated with victimization than were internalizing behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Next {{to genetic}} exposures, {{a wide variety}} of {{environmental}} exposures are being studied as well, such as nutrition,, urbanicity, stressful life events, and bullying. In contrast to genetic studies, the investigation of environmental exposures of psychiatric problems face the question of reverse causality. E.g., experiencing social stress might cause depression, however, being depressed might also worsen relationships with others and thus cause social stress. Finding an association between the occurrence of an environmental exposure and a disorder could be the result of either or both situations.Multiple strategies exist in psychiatric epidemiology to assess the direction of causality. One possibility is measuring the exposure and outcome multiple times. Researchers can then analyze how much a change in psychiatric symptoms {{can be attributed to the}} exposure at a previous time point, but also whether changes in the exposure can be predicted by previous symptom levels (cross-lagged model). Such a model was e.g. applied to the study of <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> psychological problems and stressful life events. Both, psychiatric problems as well as life events, were measured multiple times during grade 7,8,9,10 and 12. The researchers observed that stressful life events precede both <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> psychological problems, but appear to be also the result of experiencing such symptoms. An alternative approach is the use of twin studies, because discordance between monozygotic twins suggests environmental effects.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinction}} is made between <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or depression. Internalizing behavior {{has been found}} in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel. Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others. Just as externalizing behaviors are observed outside of school, such behaviors also observed in schools.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} moderating effects of gender, grade level, and {{ethnicity}} on the associations between violence exposure <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>internalizing</b> symptoms <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> behavior <b>and</b> to explore whether such relationships persist over time. Method: A survey of adolescents' exposure to violence, <b>internalizing</b> symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> behavior {{was administered to}} 2 cross-sectional samples of 6 th, 8 th, and 10 th graders (N= 2, 748 in 1994 and 2, 600 in 1996) in an urban school system. Approximately 1, 100 adolescents participated in both surveys and served as the longitudinal sample. Results: Structural equation models indicated that violence exposure was closely associated with both externalizing behavior (r= 0. 74 - 0. 79) <b>and</b> <b>internalizing</b> symptoms (r= 0. 36 - 0. 38). The strength of association was similar across gender and ethnic groups. However, violence exposure was more closely related with internalizing symptoms for younger adolescents than their older counterparts. The longitudinal analysis suggested that exposure to violence reported at time 1 was related to adolescents' <b>internalizing</b> symptoms <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> behavior 2 years later. Conclusions: These results document {{high levels of violence}} exposure for urban youths and ind icate links to a range of psychiatric symptoms and indicators of poor adjustment. Such findings carry implications for direct clinical work with young people, as well as for program development and public policy...|$|R

Conventional treatments for the same populations produced insignificant change. Applying MDT, the CBCL <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> scales declined by an average of about 35% and the STAXI total anger expression decreased by a similar margin (37%).

50|$|Group {{membership}} {{has been found}} to have both negative and positive associations with behavior problems. Gender differences have been consistently observed in terms of <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> behavior problems. Girls reported more internalizing behaviors such as depression, and boys reporting more externalizing problems. However, by providing a sense of security and peer acceptance, group membership may reduce the tendency to develop internalizing problems such as depression or anxiety. A lack of group membership is associated with behavior problems and puts adolescents at a greater risk for both externalizing and internalizing problems However, the need to belong may sometimes result in individuals conforming to delinquent peer groups and engaging in morally questionable activities, such as lying or cheating.|$|E

While sexual abuse may affect preschool children, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge regarding its short-term correlates, namely regarding internalized symptomatology due to the few available self-report measures. This study aims to (a) contrast self-reported symptomatology in a group of sexually abused preschoolers and a group of non-abused children, and (b) provide preliminary data on the psychometric properties of the adapted French version of the PRESS. Results indicate that children in the sexual abuse group (n = 59) show higher levels of self-reported depressive symptoms than children in the comparison group (n = 66). Caregivers described sexually abused preschoolers as displaying more <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> behavior problems than their non-abused peers...|$|R

He deconstructs critical childhood experiences that reinforced patriarchal norms, followed by experiences with family and in places of scholarship where he began to grapple with his role as an oppressor. Sexism in general is addressed, and the author expresses a need for men to acknowledge <b>and</b> confront their <b>internalized</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalized</b> sexism. This issue becomes particularly complex with Black American men who may feel systemically powerless. To eradicate sexism in the Black American community, Black American men must redefine their ideas about male identity.

50|$|The {{results of}} these studies show a strong need for {{intervention}} programs, specifically in-school programs. Though most schools punish bullying through disciplinary action, the frequency of bullying and victimization remains high. Thus, newer, more effective strategies must be implemented. Such programs should not only focus on punishing the bully, but should also focus on the victim. Victims should be taught to use healthier coping strategies instead of <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> their feelings. One intervention program focuses on bullying prevention in positive behavior support (BP-PBS). BP-PBS is designed to, {{in a series of}} steps, teach students how to treat each other respectfully, as well as teach ways to minimize social reinforcement of bullying behaviors in order to improve the school atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The CBCL {{also uses}} a {{normative}} sample to create standard scores. These compare the raw score {{to what would}} be typical compared to responses for youths of the same gender and similar age (the school-aged version splits the age groups into 6-10 years and 11-18 years). The standard scores are scaled so that 50 is average for the youth's age and gender, {{with a standard deviation}} of 10 points. Higher scores indicate greater problems. For each syndrome, <b>Internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Externalizing</b> problem scales, and the total score, scores can be interpreted as falling in the normal, borderline, or clinical behavior. Any score that falls below the 93rd percentile is considered normal, scores between the 93-97th percentile are borderline clinical, and any score above the 97th percentile are in the clinical range.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} {{with children in}} their early school years suggested that there are emotional and behavioural benefits to being bilingual. In the same study, the findings show that monolingual children, in particular non-English monolingual children, display more poor behavioural and emotional outcomes in their school years. The non-English monolingual children had {{the highest level of}} externalizing and internalizing behaviourial problems by fifth grade(around 10-11 years of age), even though the children were all measured to have similar levels of <b>internalizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>externalizing</b> behaviourial problems at the start. In contrast, the fluent bilingual and non-English dominant bilingual children were found to have the lowest level of these behaviourial problems.
