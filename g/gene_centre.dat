A survey of the grapevine genetic resources present in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Russian Federation and Ukraine which took place from 2003 to 2007 in the scope of the project “Conservation and Sustainable Use of Grapevine Genetic Resources in the Caucasus and Northern Black Sea Region” was funded by the government of Luxembourg and managed by Bioversity.

40|$|In {{photosynthesis}} in chloroplasts, {{two related}} regulatory processes balance {{the actions of}} photosystems I and II. These processes are short-term, post-translational redistribution of light-harvesting capacity, and long-term adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry initiated by control of chloroplast DNA transcription. Both responses are initiated by changes in the redox state of the electron carrier, plastoquinone, which connects the two photosystems. Chloroplast Sensor Kinase (CSK) is a regulator of transcription of chloroplast <b>genes</b> for reaction <b>centres</b> of the two photosystems, and a sensor of plastoquinone redox state. We asked whether CSK is also involved in regulation of absorbed light energy distribution by phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex II (LHC II).

40|$|Background: Activation induced deaminase (AID) mediates class switch {{recombination}} {{and somatic}} hypermutation of immunoglobulin (Ig) <b>genes</b> in germinal <b>centre</b> B cells. In order to regulate its specific activity {{and as a}} means to keep offtarget mutations low, several mechanisms have evolved, including binding to specific cofactors, phosphorylation and destabilization of nuclear AID protein. Although ubiquitination at lysine residues of AID is recognized as an essential step in initiating degradation of nuclear AID, any functional relevance of lysine modifications has remained elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report functional implications of lysine modifications of the human AID protein by generating a panel of lysine to arginine mutants of AID and assessment of their catalytic class switch activity. We found that only mutation of Lys 22 to Arg resulted in a significant reduction of class switching to IgG 1 in transfected primary mouse B cells. This decrease in activity was neither reflected in reduced hypermutation of Ig genes in AID-mutant transfected DT 40 B cell lines nor recapitulated in bacterial deamination assays, pointing to involvement of post-translational modification of Lys 22 for AID activity in B cells.

40|$|Pluripotency {{is defined}} as the {{capacity}} to differentiate into cells from each of the three primary germ layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. This is a property of cells located in the inner cell mass (ICM) of preimplantation blastocysts and in the epiblast layer of postimplantation, presomite embryos. Preimplantation and postimplantation pluripotency can be captured indefinitely in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) respectively. Preimplantation pluripotency in ES cells is regulated by a network of <b>genes</b> <b>centred</b> on three transcription factors (TFs) Oct 4, Sox 2 and Nanog. Oct 4 and Sox 2 form a mutually-reinforcing circuit and cooperatively stimulate transcription of downstream genes, including Nanog. All three TFs are expressed in EpiSCs and in the postimplantation epiblast. Functional studies established a role for Oct 4 and Nanog in the specification of ICM cell identity, and a role for Oct 4 in the maintenance of postimplantation pluripotency. Although the role of Sox 2 in preimplantation ICM cells is unclear, it is critical for the establishment of egg cylinder following implantation and indispensable for ES cell pluripotency. However, despite the presence of Sox 2 in postimplantation pluripotent cells the role of Sox 2 in postimplantation pluripotency is unknown. In this thesis the role of Sox 2 in the regulation of postimplantation pluripotency was examined. In contrast to the situation in the preimplantation ICM, Sox 2 and Nanog are expressed in opposing gradients in the gastrulation-stage postimplantation epiblast, with Sox 2 highest anteriorly and Nanog highest posteriorly. Interestingly the posterior epiblast of neural-plate (NP) -staged embryos was shown not to be pluripotent. Furthermore, forced expression of Sox 2 but not Oct 4 in this region rescued pluripotency. The ability of Oct 4 to reinstate pluripotency in the somitogenesis-stage embryo is limited to Sox 2 -positive tissues. This strongly suggests that coexpression of Sox 2 and Oct 4 is important for establishing postimplantation pluripotent identity. Sox 2 HIGH cultured EpiSCs were not positively correlated with NanogHIGH cells. This reciprocal relationship emerged during the transition from ES cells to EpiSCs in culture. Using mutant cells with reduced levels of Sox 2 or Nanog, Sox 2 positively influences Nanog but Nanog negatively influences Sox 2 expression post-transcriptionally. The negative influence of Nanog on Sox 2 protein level was confirmed using doxycycline-inducible Nanog overexpressing EpiSCs. This negative relationship indicates that the regulation of Sox 2 expression is different in postimplantation pluripotency and that Nanog may negatively regulate Sox 2 on the protein level in the posterior epiblast. Sox 2 is expressed at a lower level in EpiSCs than ES cells and the significance of this was further investigated by microarray transcription profiling using cells in which a fluorescent reporter (tdTomato) was knocked in to the Sox 2 gene. Sox 2 - tdTomatoHIGH cells cultured in LIF/FCS/GMEMβ correlate with an undifferentiated cell identity and Sox 2 -tdTomatoLOW cells are associated with non-neural differentiation. Interestingly the global profile of ES cells and EpiSCs that share similar Sox 2 -tdTomato signal are non-identical. This suggests that Sox 2 has different roles in different pluripotent states. ES cells with enforced Sox 2 expression were unable to enter the EpiSC state, while ES cells with lowered Sox 2 levels were inefficient in neural differentiation. Therefore, levels of Sox 2 are critical for cell fate decisions. Strikingly, given the apparent requirement for Sox 2 during Oct 4 -induced reinstatement of post-implantation pluripotency, deletion of Sox 2 had no effect on the maintenance of EpiSC pluripotency. This is likely due to the presence of redundant Sox factors and indeed Sox 3 is able to rescue the Sox 2 -null phenotype in ES cells. Taken together, these results suggest the hypothesis that postimplantation pluripotency is maintained by multiple Sox factors, while Nanog negatively regulates Sox 2 post-transcriptionally to repress neural specification in the posterior epbilast. The positive influence of Sox 2 on Nanog protein level suggests a possible negative feedback loop to balance the proneural and pluripotent properties of Sox 2 in postimplantation pluripotency...|$|R
