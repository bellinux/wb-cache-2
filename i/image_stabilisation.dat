40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} near collision course engagements between a Cessna 172 R aircraft and a ScanEagle UAV carrying a custom built vision-based sense-and-avoid system. Vision-based systems are an attractive solution for the sense-and-avoid problem because of size, weight and power considerations. We present post flight test analysis that shows our detection system successfully detecting an approaching Cessna aircraft in all 15 flight test encounters at ranges greater than 1500 m, with no false alarms events. Moreover, this paper characterises the <b>image</b> inter-frame <b>stabilisation</b> required to achieve acceptable detection performance, and compares a range of stabilisation techniques for achieving this type of stabilisation precision. Our analysis illustrates that the <b>image</b> inter-frame <b>stabilisation</b> requirements are demanding, suggesting that images must be stabilised in real-time at 9 Hz to within 2 pixels between consecutive frames. We present performance comparisons between stabilisation using GPS/INS, IMU-only and image-based techniques...|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{exposure}} time in free-hand photography {{can be enhanced}} even more also for fast lenses, if the camera is equipped with an <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> system. In 2014 Panasonic introduced the fastest lens with in-built stabilisation, the Leica Nocticron 42.5 mm f/1.2, which in the meantime even can be operated with dual <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> (Dual I.S.), provided that the camera body has an additional stabilising system at the image sensor, too.|$|E

50|$|The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX8 is {{a digital}} rangefinder-styled mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera {{announced}} by Panasonic on July 16, 2015. The camera features a newly developed 20 megapixel sensor - previously the highest resolution in Micro Four Thirds cameras was 16 megapixels. The camera's ISO range touches 25600 {{and it can}} capture continuous frames at up to 8 frames per second. One major new feature introduced in the camera is “Dual IS”, the camera 5 axis <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> gets synchronised, when available, with lens based <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation.</b> The camera also records 4K video.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Nikon filed a {{suit against}} Sigma, alleging it had {{violated}} patents relating to Nikon's [...] "Vibration Reduction" [...] <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> technology. In 2015, the suit ended through settlement, with no details disclosed.|$|E
50|$|InvenSense also {{provides}} Optical <b>Image</b> <b>Stabilisation</b> for Smartphone cameras, which {{are important to}} detect hand movements and reduce shake in photographs. InvenSense's compact gyroscope was designed to provide antishake features on the smallest camera phones.|$|E
50|$|Of further note is the <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> system, which {{according}} to CIPA standard has been improved from 3.5 to 4.5 stops in effectiveness since the K-3. The manufacturer further states that autofocus has been improved.|$|E

50|$|The Pentax Optio I-10 is {{a digital}} premium compact camera {{announced}} by Pentax on January 25, 2010.

5000|$|Introduction of a lens with {{a minimum}} F number of 2.8, {{compared}} to 2.0 in other G series cameras. Although slower, this lens introduced improvements such as optical <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation,</b> a higher zoom range (6×), and a macro mode that would focus as close as 1 cm. The lens would also retract completely into the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Also, Movie Maker's {{interface}} was redesigned in the Windows Live version to use {{a ribbon}} toolbar similar to Office 2007; it also added features such as [...] "Auto Movie" [...] {{and the ability to}} export videos directly to DVDs and YouTube. Certain advanced features were also removed from the software, such as <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> and the ability to record voice-overs.|$|E
5000|$|This {{camera is}} known for its Leica lens with [...] "Mega OIS" [...] optical <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation.</b> It has a 12x optical zoom, often said to be equal to a 400 mm lens, which can stay f/2.8 for the entire zoom range. There are full manual {{controls}} too, making this camera popular with prosumers. Optional lenses are available to double the focal length or for wide-angle view.|$|E
50|$|In this case, i.e. {{with the}} same {{luminous}} flux within the lens, the illuminance quadracially decreases and the luminous intensity quadratically increases with the image size. Therefore, all systems detect the same luminances and the same exposure values in the image plane, {{and as a consequence}} of this the equivalent exposure indexes are different {{in order to get the}} identical shutter speeds (i.e. exposure times) {{with the same}} levels of motion blur and <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Portrait {{photographer}} Bing Putney, {{writing an}} opinion for SLR Lounge ahead of having tested the lens, {{suggested that the}} Zeiss Batis Sonnar T* 2.8/135mm, given its introductory price, should be a stop faster to realistically compete with the Sony 70-200mm f/2.8 G Master or Sigma 135mm f/1.8 DG HSM Art, while also admitting that the Sigma lacks <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation,</b> which the Zeiss has, and requires an adapter to be used on Sony cameras.|$|E
5000|$|DigitalCameraInfo.com {{says the}} Pentax X-5 may be [...] "the most {{comfortable}} ultrazoom ever" [...] (to hold), and lauds its [...] "half-sized price tag". However, {{it also suggests}} that the X-5's <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> is ineffective at longer focal lengths, and criticises the lack of controls on the lens barrel, which puts focus adjustment under automatic or camera-menu control. In closing, the reviewer requests that Pentax should [...] "stick with that K-5 body shape no matter what".|$|E
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} the lens, British photographer and blogger Keith Cooper concluded that"At appreciably less cost than the EF-S 10-22, the 10-18mm surprised me with its build quality and optical performance. The <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> adds to its general purpose usefulness and partly {{makes up for}} its relatively restricted aperture.... Distortions are well under control, and when suitable correction profiles arrive, the lens {{will be more than}} adequate for serious use if you were looking to photograph property for example..." ...|$|E
50|$|For the {{rear-facing}} camera, the OnePlus 3 has a 16 MP f/2.0 Sony IMX 298 sensor, {{with both}} optical <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> and electronic <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation.</b> It {{is capable of}} 4K video at 30fps, and 720p slo-mo video at 120fps. Further, it includes support for shooting RAW images, allowing greater control of the image to the user. The front camera is a 8 MP f/2.0 Sony IMX179 sensor, with 1080p at 30fps video and fixed focus.One new feature to the OnePlus 3 is Dash Charge. It is a custom version of OnePlus' parent company's (OPPO Electronics) VOOC Charging. The feature is {{made possible by the}} processor, which has Quick Charge 3.0 support. According to the company, the battery can achieve a 60% or more charge within 30 minutes. This is accomplished by doing all the power transforming required for direct input to the battery in the power brick supplied, not within the phone itself, reducing heat on the device. Additionally, the power brick can contain larger, dedicated electronics, whereas any power processing on a phone has to use smaller and cooler equipment, reducing the speed of charging.|$|E
50|$|M.Zuiko Digital lenses {{are offered}} as {{exchangeable}} lenses for the Micro Four Thirds system (MFT). The ED 300 mm f/4 IS Pro is available since 2016.

It is the first Olympus M.Zuiko lens and the only Olympus M.Zuiko prime lens with an in-built <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> (end of 2016). Its weight is somewhat above one kilogramme, which allows easy transport and facilitates free-hand shooting.|$|E
5000|$|Photozone {{described}} it as [...] "sharp and contrasty" [...] and [...] "far more harmonious than any other similar lenses we tested to date" [...] with [...] "virtually silent" [...] autofocus, but remarked that it has very high lateral chromatic aberration at the extremes of the zoom range, high barrel distortion at the wide end, <b>image</b> <b>stabilisation</b> that at 2 stops is less effective than other brands, and genre-typical air pumping whose effects could have been mitigated with a weather-sealed design.|$|E
50|$|The Ricoh WG-M1 is {{a rugged}} digital compact camera {{announced}} by Ricoh on September 10, 2014.
