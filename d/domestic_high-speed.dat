5|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>high-speed</b> {{services}} on High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern. Having been in planning since 2004, a preview {{service of the}} British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as Javelins, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes for the service to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, {{was a factor in}} London's successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras. Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of , for timetabling purposes a 10% lower speed is assumed. These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units.|$|E

5|$|This {{station was}} rebuilt as Ashford International {{during the early}} 1990s for {{international}} services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms {{to the north of}} station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station are off to one side rather than going through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A <b>high-speed</b> <b>domestic</b> service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|R

5|$|Some {{international}} railway {{services to}} Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, {{such as the}} Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Paris, Brussels and European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel. The first <b>high-speed</b> <b>domestic</b> trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London. There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|International {{services}} {{started on}} 8 January 1996. Before {{the completion of}} High Speed 1 in November 2007, twelve Eurostar trains a day called, heading to Paris (7 trains) or Brussels (5). However this number was reduced because of the opening of Ebbsfleet International station to 2 or 3 trains to/from Paris and a daily service to Disneyland Paris. A direct train for Brussels was reinstated in 2009. From May 2015 a service to Marseille runs up to five times a week. Seasonal Ski trains also run at weekends in the winter months to Bourg-Saint-Maurice in the French Alps. It is not permitted to use Eurostar services for domestic journeys to and from London; however, a <b>high-speed</b> <b>domestic</b> service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the {{awarding}} of the Integrated Kent franchise, Southeastern undertook to provide services according to two phases of service level commitments (SLC): SLC1, the immediate level of services; SLC2, the mix of services to be provided once <b>high-speed</b> <b>domestic</b> services began over HS1, scheduled for December 2009. In the latter service mix, a net reduction of services over the 'classic' (i.e. non-HS1) routes was envisaged. However the SLRUS concluded that, owing mainly to the growth in traffic, the overall level of services over the classic routes be broadly retained. By {{the time of}} RUS publication, this had been agreed by DfT and Southeastern as regards the Hayes, Sidcup, Bexleyheath, Greenwich and Chislehurst slow lines. The timetable will still need to be revamped to accommodate the HS1 services from Medway and east Kent.|$|R

50|$|Southeastern {{introduced}} a full timetable of <b>domestic</b> <b>high-speed</b> services branded Southeastern Highspeed over High Speed 1 between London St Pancras and Ashford International on 13 December 2009, although public preview services {{had been running}} since 29 June 2009. High-speed trains use High Speed 1 calling at Stratford International and Ebbsfleet International. Trains from London to the Medway towns and Faversham leave the high-speed line at Ebbsfleet and continue via the North Kent line through Gravesend, Strood, Rochester. A limited peak hour service now also operates between St Pancras and Maidstone West via Ebbsfleet and Strood.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 1970s onward, {{gradually}} {{more and more}} Trans-Europe Express trains were replaced by other trains giving a similar kind of service but also carrying 2nd class. Business travellers used air travel more and more. In 1979 DB completely restructured the network {{with the coming of}} the new national InterCity services, resulting in successively fewer TEE services and more InterCity services in the course of time. The introduction of the TGV service in France in 1981, and its subsequent expansion, along with expansion of high-speed rail lines in other European countries led to still more TEEs' being replaced by <b>domestic</b> <b>high-speed</b> trains.|$|E
5000|$|Authorities in the United States {{maintain}} various {{definitions of}} high-speed rail. The definitions range from rail services with top speeds of 110 mph to 150 mph or higher by the United States Department of Transportation {{which is an}} entity in the executive branch, while the United States Code, which is the official codification of Federal statutes, defines them as the rail services with [...] "reasonably expected to reach sustained speeds of more than 125 miles per hour". A legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, used different terms to clarify the confusion by defining the rail services with top speeds less than 150 mph to be higher-speed rail. There is no current train service in the United States which meets all of the <b>domestic</b> criteria for <b>high-speed</b> rail. Amtrak's Acela Express is classified as [...] "higher-speed rail" [...] in the Congressional Research Service report {{by virtue of being}} on shared tracks, whereas page 5 of that report also requires dedicated tracks to be classified as [...] "very high speed rail".|$|R
40|$|Huge {{economic}} losses are being sustained due to large-scale unauthorised downloading, generated by widespread confusion about copyright {{law in the}} online world. This UK report examines online consumer behaviour in the UK and its potential impact on business and government policy. It is {{the first piece of}} research to look at evidence from across the copyright industries and across all age ranges. The report has two further objectives: 	To inform a SABIP workshop at which a selected group of attendees with a direct interest in the issue will consider the implications of consumer behaviour on IP and make recommendations for further areas of SABIP research; 	To highlight any further SABIP research that is required to ensure that all agencies of Government have the fullest understanding of the issues. Copycats? Digital Consumers in the Online Age is thus a preliminary piece of research. It is unique in three respects Â  	Â It represents an independent, systematic and evidence-based approach to the subject; 	It analyses a wide range of research across academic disciplines and content industries, and it includes some new case study material; 	It covers the most recent developments, up to April 2009, a fact that is critical in this fastchanging environment. Â  Key findings The world of the digital consumer is an environment, indeed a series of âeco-systemsâ, subject to rapid change; change that means many predictions {{about the future of the}} Internet and digital convergence (and how these are âconsumedâ) made even two, and certainly five and ten years ago seem quaintly dated â a fact that should be held in mind as predictions are made for the future of not just âDigital Britainâ, but also the âDigital Worldâ. Within ten years we have seen the widespread <b>domestic</b> use of <b>high-speed</b> broadband and multichannel (and often High Definition) digital television with the facility to time-shift, copy and view programmes on other devices, and to upload these files to websites such as YouTube; the arrival of wi-fi in the high-street, the library, the office, university and the home; the rapid expansion of open source and Creative Commons publishing; at least four iterations of file-sharing technologies; the birth of mainstream blogging as a broad social phenomenon; the arrival of social media as a significant medium of authorship, sharing, and communication; the shift by the younger digital consumer towards the mobile phone as not just an aural communication tool, but also a medium for text messaging, music and video consumption, and as a gateway to post messages, photographs and other types of content to social media websites. Most recently the large expansion in use of âmicrobloggingâ, to websites such as the text-based Twitter and the image-based Tumblr, has once again surprised many who suspected these services were a fad. Finally, the recent successful launch of the BBCâs authorised programme-streaming service, iPlayer (41 million downloads in December 2008; eight million in Christmas week according to the Guardian, 2009), and the music streaming service, Spotify (â which makes available around 15 million songs, either without payment but with aural advertising or without advertising for Â£ 9. 99 a month and had one million users signed-up within one month according to Media Week, 2009) has demonstrated that new forms of business models may be possible in the world of âfree thingsâ. Unsurprisingly, the literature review we undertook does not grasp the enormity and the speed of these changes. Each impacts centrally on intellectual property. The challenge for IP policy makers is to judge and, where possible, measure the changing social behaviours and attitudes brought about by the myriad rapidly evolving technologies and networks of the digital revolution, and map this against their economic, political and social objectives. We believe this cannot yet be achieved, as the conditions being established by the Internet, digital convergence and the imminent âDigital Britainâ final report are not fully understood.
