Noise is adisturbance to the human environment that is escalating at such a high rate that it will become a major threat to thequality of human lives. The present study provides an evaluation of noise pollution in Bistrita. The measurements weremade with the 2250 Controller <b>Integrating</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Meter</b> (Bruel & Kjaer). Equivalent noise levels (L eq) weremeasured in 9 points (each point measured during 30 min). The measurements realized in different spots indicated thatthe highest values of the continuous equivalent acoustic level (L eq) appear on the 1 st and 2 nd category roads, where theheavy traffic is intense. The most noise-polluted points in Bistrita were Auto bridge and Han Road crossing: CaleaMoldovei - Năsăudului St. - 1 Decembrie (intense traffic). The highest recorded Leq values were between 83 - 84 dB(A). The evolution of the traffic volume values in Bistrita is continuously increasing and there is a higher expectationfor state and local government to reduce noise levels. The Directive on Environmental Noise (2002 / 49 /EC) developed anew framework for noise policy, based on shared responsibility between the EU, national and local level, and includingmeasures to improve the accuracy and standardisation of data to help improve the coherency of different actions. Inorder to reduce the noise pollution it is necessary to diminish the noise level at the sources and to apply a combinationof strategies that include noise barriers, lower vehicle noise levels and better urban planning...|$|E

5000|$|Until 2003 {{there were}} {{separate}} standards for exponential and linear <b>integrating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meters,</b> {{but since then}} IEC 61672 has described both types. The classic exponential meter was originally described in IEC 123 for 'industrial' meters followed by IEC 179 for 'precision' meters. Both of these were replaced by IEC 651, later renamed IEC 60651, while the linear integrating meters were initially described by IEC 804, later renamed IEC 60804. Both IEC 60651 and 60804 included four accuracy classes, called [...] "types". In IEC 61672 these were reduced to just two accuracy classes 1 and 2. New in the standard IEC 61672 is a minimum 60 dB linear span requirement and Z-frequency-weighting, with a general tightening of limit tolerances, {{as well as the}} inclusion of maximum allowable measurement uncertainties for each described periodic test. The periodic testing part of the standard (IEC61672.3) also requires that manufacturers provide the testing laboratory with correction factors to allow laboratory electrical and acoustic testing to better mimic Free field (acoustics) responses. Each correction used should be provided with uncertainties, that need to be accounted for in the testing laboratory final Measurement uncertainty budget. This makes it unlikely that a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> designed to the older 60651 and 60804 standards will meet the requirements of IEC 61672 : 2013. These 'withdrawn' standards should no longer be used, especially for any official purchasing requirements, as they have significantly poorer accuracy requirements than IEC 61672.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational noise {{exposure}} can be monitored directly by personal sampling or indirectly, by area sampling. Personal sampling {{is performed using}} an <b>integrating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> worn by the worker while performing his/her job. When area sampling is used, measurements {{need to be made}} in all locations where a typical worker stays while performing his/her tasks; the respective partial lengths of exposure need to be accurately monitored, and the time-weighted average sound level of the measured noise levels must be calculated. OBJECTIVES: Current regulations identify three different thresholds, corresponding to different types of action, but they do not propose any standard criteria to decide whether a threshold has been exceeded. Defining standard procedures to assess occupational {{noise exposure}} and identifying such thresholds is crucial. METHODS: Using empirical data collected in the field, the effects are illustrated of the number of sampling locations and of the partial lengths of exposure on area sampling measurements, and the effects of duration of noise exposure on both area and personal samplings. RESULTS: When dealing with area samplings, an accurate definition of both sampling locations and partial lengths of exposure is crucial. When arbitrary decisions are taken in selecting sampling locations and/or establishing partial lengths of exposure, spatial changes in noise level and operator' displacements while performing his/her tasks may affect results. Sampling for less than the duration of noise exposure is the major contributor to measurement error, particularly under conditions of unpredictable variation in noise level. In fact, as noise level in the non-monitored time fraction is unknown, measurement error cannot be determined. We estimate that, even under the most favorable circumstances, sampling should last not less than 40...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated noise annoyance, awareness and practice among {{the workers in}} two steel factories in UAE. The study involving 468 steel workers randomly selected. Noise exposure was estimated using the <b>integrated</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter.</b> A structured interview questionnaire {{was used to assess}} the noise annoyance, awareness and practice of workers towards the noise. The results showed that about 89 % of the workers exposed to a daily Leq above the permissible level which is 85 dB (A) and 45 % of them had never used any hearing protection devices. About 58 % of the workers experienced a moderate or high degree of noise annoyance. Only 4. 1 % and 1. 9 % of the workers aware about the health effects of noise and the methods of prevention respectively and awareness was positively associated with noise exposure. Few workers (13. 2 %) used the hearing protection devices during the working time. Thus workers within both factories are at high risk of developing noise annoyance, and other related ailments due to excessive occupational expo-sure to noise, and non-use of hearing protection devices. There was an association between noise annoyance and noise level and any one of them could influence the workers to use the hearing protection devices. There is a need to have a hearing conservation program in both factories one of its main components is education to raise the awareness of workers about noise hazards and methods of prevention. Finally, the factor noise annoyance should be incorporated into all future studies on the use of hearing protection devices...|$|R

Its function; however,remain the same, {{not only as}} a place for prostrations, but more so as a community centre and a symbol of Islam. Basic elements and spaces such as prayer hall, ablution, minaret, minbar and mihrab; for example, are common features in any mosque. Mihrab, a component of Qibla wall marks the Qibla direction. Functionally, it positions the Imam who recites during congregations. It form and design helps the Imam to have khusyu’ in prayer. Mihrab should also function acoustically. This research was carried out with the objectives to review the level of acoustic performance in selected mosques and to evaluate the design and acoustic performance of the mihrabs. Initial survey of 37 traditional mosques in Malaysia, built between 1728 - 1830, has concluded that the mosques are either square or rectangular in plan with clear Mihrab visibility from the main entrance. Mihrab’s form vary from having circular niche with flat ceiling to rectangular shaped with slanting ceiling and semi-circular concaved niched forms.

40|$|Noise in {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the risk factors {{to be taken into account}} in the assessment of the health and safety of workers; in particular, it is known that the tractor is a source of high noise. The Italian Low Decree 81 / 2008 defined the requirements for assessing and managing noise risk identifying a number of procedures to be adopted at different noise levels to limit workers exposure. This paper concerns the analysis of the noise risk arising from the use of a tracklaying tractor during field operations carried out in the vineyard. The objective of this study was to evaluate the noise level that comes close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor measuring the values of equivalent <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (Leq(A)) and peak sound pressure (LCpk). We considered four options related to the same tractor coupled with the following tools to perform some farming operations: rototilling, chisel plough, flail mowers and vibro farmer.

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to mechanical vibration {{may represent a}} significant risk factor for exposed workers in the agricultural sector, with particular reference to the operators driving tractors. Also noise in agriculture {{is one of the}} risk factors {{to be taken into account}} for the evaluation of workers health and safety. In particular, one of the major sources of discomfort for the workers operating a tractor is the noise to which they are subjected during work. In Italy, Law Decree 81 / 2008 has defined the obligations of vibration and noise assessment and risk management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of {{exposure to}} whole-body vibration for the operator driving a tracklaying tractor working in vineyard orchard and the noise level close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor. The experimental tests were performed using six different tracklaying tractors, 40 - 51 kW power, coupled with the same rototilling machine model BF 160 by Celli (Forlì, Italy). For the evaluation of whole-body vibration we referred to ISO 2631 - 1 : 2008 standard. The tests for noise evaluation were performed in compliance with the standards ISO 9612 and ISO 9432. During the tests we used the porta-ble vibration analyzer HD 2070 by Delta OHM, Italy, that is able to perform spectral analysis and statistics simultaneously on three channels, and a precision <b>integrating</b> portable <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> class 1, model HD 2110 L by Delta OHM, Italy.
