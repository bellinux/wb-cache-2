In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar <b>energy</b> <b>collection,</b> and electric heating.

500|$|The {{concept of}} the Dyson sphere {{was the result of}} a thought {{experiment}} by physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson, when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the total energy output of the Sun. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a shell) designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but focused only on issues of <b>energy</b> <b>collection,</b> on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star.

In lepton accelerators, this measurement is made difficult due to various damping mechanisms.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the <b>energy</b> balanced data <b>collection</b> problem in WSNs, aiming {{to balance the}} energy consumption among all the sensor nodes in the data propagation process. <b>Energy</b> balanced data <b>collection</b> can potentially save energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime, and hence it has many practical implications for WSN design and deployment. The traditional hop-by-hop transmission model allows a sensor node to propagate its packets in a hop-by-hop manner towards the sink, resulting in poor energy balance for the entire network. To address the problem, we apply a slice based energy model, and divide the <b>energy</b> balanced data <b>collection</b> problem into inter- and intra-slice energy balance problems. We then propose a novel Inter-slice Mixed Transmission strategy and an Intra-slice Forwarding technique to address each of the problems. Finally, we design an Energy-balanced Transmission Protocol (ETP) to combine both techniques to achieve total energy balance in data collection. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that, while ETP achieves <b>energy</b> balanced data <b>collection,</b> the network lifespan is increased by 10 times and the network delay is decreased by more than 70 % compared to the hop-by-hop transmission in a general square area WSN...|$|R
