5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> and industrialization, Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained distinct from the other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is chiefly {{a product}} of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E
5|$|Chuck Baldwin was {{initially}} a Democrat, but changed his party affiliation to Republican in 1980. In the 1970s, he founded Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida, which President Ronald Reagan recognized for <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> and influence. As a Republican, Baldwin headed the Florida branch of Moral Majority, which promoted social conservatism. He also hosted {{a radio show}} called Chuck Baldwin Live, which focused on conservative issues. It made its national radio debut on the Genesis Communications Network in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. <b>Its</b> <b>growth</b> was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era. An editor of The Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that {{he was a member of}} the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a {{settlement}} at Northallerton since Roman times, however <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> in importance began in the 11th century when King William II gifted land to the Bishop of Durham. Under the Bishop's authority Northallerton became an important centre for religious affairs. It was also a focus for much conflict in subsequent years between the English and the Scots, most notably the Battle of the Standard, nearby in 1138, which saw losses {{of as many as}} 12,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{can have}} both {{beneficial}} and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend {{large amounts of}} energy along their paths, and produce devastation.

5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain <b>its</b> <b>growth,</b> and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb <b>its</b> <b>growth,</b> a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Salford's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} {{its status as a}} Royal caput and the {{judicial}} seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire, to which it lent its name. It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in about 1230, making Salford a free borough. During the early stages of <b>its</b> <b>growth,</b> Salford was of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester, although most contemporary sources agree that since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed.|$|E
5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and <b>its</b> <b>growth</b> had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing {{at the time of its}} death.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the growing cardistry community, Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014, called Cardistry-Con. The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways. The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. <b>Its</b> <b>growth</b> {{has been associated with}} its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which tend to make the art more transparent and available to all who are interested.|$|E
