40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the partial and generic {{uniqueness}} of block term tensor decompositions in signal processing. We present several conditions for generic uniqueness of tensor decompositions of multilinear rank (1, L 1, L 1), [...] ., (1, LR, LR) terms. Our proof {{is based on}} algebraic geometric methods. Mathematical preliminaries for this dissertation are multilinear algebra, and classical algebraic geometry. In geometric language, we prove that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not tangentially weakly defective. We also give conditions for partial uniqueness of block term tensor decompositions by proving that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not defective. The main result is the following. For a tensor Y belong to the tensor product of three complex vector spaces of dimensions I, J, K, we assume that L 1, L 2, [...] ., LR is from small to large, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to J, and J <b>is</b> strictly <b>bigger</b> than LR. If the dimension of ambient space is strictly less than IJK, then for general tensors among those admitting block term tensor decomposition, the block term tensor decomposition is partially unique {{under the condition that}} the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, and I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2; it has infinitely many expressions under the condition IJK is strictly less than the sum from L_ 1 ^ 2 to L_R^ 2; it is essentially unique under any of the following there conditions: (i) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2, J, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR (ii) R is 2, I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 (iii) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR, J <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 LR, the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R...|$|R

25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna <b>is</b> <b>big,</b> or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E

Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and Douglas, AZ was discovered. It was sophisticated with hydraulic equipment and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three corridos have been written about this tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Many birds nest {{close to}} human habitations {{and some have}} been {{specially}} encouraged. Nesting white storks have been protected and held in reverence in many cultures. Nest boxes are often used to encourage cavity nesting birds. The nesting of peregrine falcons on tall buildings has captured popular interest. Colonial breeders produce guano which is a valuable fertilizer. The saliva nest of the edible-nest swiftlet is used to make bird's nest soup, long considered a delicacy in China. Collection of the swiftlet nests <b>is</b> <b>big</b> business: in one year, more than 3.5 million nests were exported from Borneo to China, and the industry was estimated at $1 billion US per year (and increasing) in 2008. While the collection is regulated in some areas (at the Gomantong Caves, for example, where nests can be collected only from February to April or July to September), {{it is not in}} others, and the swiftlets are declining in areas where the harvest reaches unsustainable levels.|$|E

High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship <b>is</b> <b>big</b> enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

25|$|Valdobrev rose to {{prominence}} in the early 1990s, mainly with his hit songs, which made him extremely popular and gained him idol status on the Bulgarian music scene, twice being awarded as best male artist at the National Music Television ceremonies. Despite that he never quit his acting career and took part in numerous performances which have spanned {{a wide variety of}} genres from classical to contemporary drama, and from popular comedies to alternative, non-commercial projects, all staged by the most prominent Bulgarian directors on the most significant theatre stages. At that time Valdobrev gradually entered the world of film and theatre music and since 1992 has gone on to enjoy composing the original scores for more than 70 stage performances and 20 feature and documentary movies, winning many plaudits and awards for his work. In 2000 he received the Golden Rose film award for debut for the Dog's Home original movie soundtrack featuring Arabel Karajan. In 2008 he composed the music for Stefan Komandarev's highly acclaimed film The World <b>is</b> <b>Big</b> and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner, a Bulgarian-German co-production with Miki Manojlovic in the lead role, which won a considerable number of international awards and reached the Short List of The Academy Awards 2010 for Foreign Language film.|$|E
25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct transfer {{system in which}} the winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race <b>is</b> <b>big</b> enough, the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative {{system in which the}} qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put a premium on consistency while the Transfer System was a little closer to luck, both good and bad for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the transfer system. The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Valdobrev was {{approached}} by director Stefan Komandarev to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, Dog's Home. Valdobrev composed both the film score and the words and music for six songs, performed {{by some of the}} most prominent contemporary alternative rock bands. The released Original Soundtrack was actually the first ever released Bulgarian movie soundtrack. It {{turned out to be a}} great success. The pilot single Is it me, or is it not? performed by Stefan Valdobrev and featuring his friend and colleague Arabel Karajan became one of the film songs classics. The film’s score earned Valdobrev the Golden Rose for a film debut at the 2000 National Film Awards ceremony. Two years later Komandarev and Valdobrev teamed up again in Komandarev’s second documentary film Alphabet of Hope. Their collaboration resumed with the director’s 2009 hit The World <b>Is</b> <b>Big</b> and Salvation Lurks Around the Corner, based on the best-selling novel by the German author Ilija Trojanow and featuring Miki Manojlovic in the lead role. Both the film and the soundtrack were very successful. The film received numerous international awards and nominations, reaching the Oscars' Foreign Language Films' Shortlist. During the same period Valdobrev started to span his work on mainly European projects. Since 2008 he has provided the music for fiction and documentaries like the Czech films Kulicky (2008), Killing the Czech Way (2010) and Love in the Grave (2012), the Norwegian Can You Talk? (2011) and the Slovenian State of Shock (2011). In 2013 he started to create the score for the Bulgarian National Television series The Ungiven, a somber drama that tells the story of the saving of 48,000 Bulgarian Jews in the years of the Second World War.|$|E
