25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks back over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} 11,042, {{the fourth largest}} in Gibbs Stadium history, saw the Terriers end the Mountaineers Division I leading winning streak at 17 games, 42–31. The Terriers outgained the Mountaineers 431 to 320 in total yardage with running back Kevious Johnson {{accounting}} for 104 rushing yards. Armanti Edwards, starting {{in his first game}} since the Michigan win, re-injured <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the second half. Trey Elder replaced Edwards and threw for 105 and rushed for 33 yards. Senior wide receiver Hans Batichon had a career-high six receptions for 93 yards. The only other bright spot for the Mountaineers was CoCo Hillary's 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was {{swinging}} his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} poorest matches in WrestleMania history.|$|E
60|$|He strolled along blithely, {{casting a}} glance over <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dusty cloud which {{hung over the}} Seamew as he went. It was virgin soil to him, and he thirsted for adventure.|$|R
50|$|The {{competing}} {{dates for}} Thanksgiving are parodied in the 1942 film Holiday Inn. In the film, a November calendar appears on which an animated turkey jumps {{back and forth}} between the two weeks, until he gives up and shrugs <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> audience.|$|R
60|$|Infinitely {{delighted to}} be {{relieved}} from {{the fear of the}} guitar, Willie hunted all who would play into another room; whence they were to be summoned, one by one, back to the drawing-room by the showman, Mr. Ferrars, who shrugged <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> task, but undertook it, and first called for Mrs. Kendal.|$|R
25|$|In 1183 Balian and Baldwin {{supported}} Raymond against Guy of Lusignan, {{husband of}} Amalric's elder daughter Sibylla {{and by now}} regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of leprosy. The king had his 5-year-old nephew Baldwin of Montferrat crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, {{in an attempt to}} prevent Guy from ascending. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was Balian himself—a notably tall man—who carried the child Baldwin V on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the eight-year-old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to Antioch. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Adorno {{reversed}} his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came {{second to the}} development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present an Habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title The Construction of the Aesthetic. At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like [...] "anxiety," [...] "inwardness" [...] and [...] "leap"—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the venia legendi in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.|$|E

60|$|Tito {{might have}} been excused for shrugging <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} before him, {{but he was not}} naturally impatient; moreover, he had been bred up in that laborious erudition, at once minute and copious, which was the chief intellectual task of the age; and with Romola near, he was floated along by waves of agreeable sensation that made everything seem easy.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> Yarmouth <b>the</b> {{door was}} {{snatched}} open, {{and there was}} a confusion of shouting and running; a swarm of humanity, clamouring, attached itself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carriage doorway, which was immediately blocked by a stout man who heaved a leather bag in front of him as he cried in German that here was room for all. Faces innumerable--hot, blue-eyed faces--strained to look over <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shocked girl and the amazed Siegmund.|$|R

[...] It {{is at this}} point where the cat tries to one-up his captor by wrapping a TNT stick inside the steak. The result is only a small blast in the dog's stomach, which the embarrassed dog apparently misinterprets as gas and excuses himself. He smacks the cat (off-screen) for forgetting the gravy yet again.|$|R
60|$|He looked upward, over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little {{cluster of}} farm-buildings and cottages, and the gray stone church.|$|E
60|$|The Jew {{walked to}} the door: looking over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boy as he went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.|$|E

60|$|Shoulder-high {{beside him}} hung the {{photogravure}} {{that had already}} saved his life once. Why not again?

The glass shattered full upon the ancient's crown, the man's head went through the picture, and the frame settled over <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same instant Barney Custer leaped across the bed, seized a light chair, {{and turned to face}} his foe upon more even turns.|$|R

5000|$|In his {{preface to}} Das Kapital Vol. 1, Marx writes [...] "The {{country that is}} more {{developed}} industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future".

Marx comments that [...] "if, however, the German reader shrugs <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> condition of the English industrial and agricultural labourers, or in optimist fashion comforts himself {{with the thought that}} in Germany things are not nearly so bad, I must plainly tell him, [...] "De te fabula narratur !
