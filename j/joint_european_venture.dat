The blade pressure instrumentation, the experimental equipment used, the test procedures applied, and the scope of the test matrix conducted are briefly explained. Typical test results are presented in this report verifying the expected high data quality and consistency.

A comprehensive set of simultaneous aerodynamic and acoustic pressure data as well as dynamic and performance data were measured for the standard rotor (NACA 23012 mod) with rectangular blade tips. The primary objective of this experimental study was to generate an extensive airload and acoustic data base for code validation, to examine {{the relation between the}} blade pressure characteristics and the acoustic radiation, and as a further objective to obtain initial detailed information on blade-tip vortex trajectories and blade positions during blade-vortex interactions. This report describes the instrumented model rotor, the Modular Wind-tunnel Model (MWM) test stand, the aerodynamic and acoustic data acquisition systems, and the scope of the test matrix and of test conduction. Moreover, the measurement techniques used to visualize the interacting vortex flow and to determine blade deflection and incidence at the blade tip are briefly outlined. Selected test results are presented in this report which is accompanied by a number of appendices and enclosures wherein the experimental results are documented in full.

500|$|When Burhop {{took charge}} of the Bubble Chamber Group at University College in 1967, he was quick to grasp the {{advantages}} of heavy liquid bubble chambers for studying neutrino interactions, and steered the group towards participation in <b>joint</b> <b>European</b> <b>ventures,</b> using the Gargamelle. The group's discovery of neutral currents in 1973 was a milestone {{on the road to the}} theoretical unification of electromagnetism with the weak force. [...] In 1974 and 1975, with the help of Robert R. Wilson, the director of the Fermilab in the United States, an international team from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under Burhop's leadership carried out a search for a new particle, the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963. He had suggested that neutrino interactions could create short-lived (perhaps as low as 10−14 s) particles that could be detected with the use of nuclear emulsion. Experiment E247 at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10−13 s. A follow-up experiment WA17 with the SPS confirmed the existence of the [...] (charmed lambda baryon), with a flight time of 7.3±0.1 x 10−13s.|$|R
