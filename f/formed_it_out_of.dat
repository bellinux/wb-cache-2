500|$|The Bezen Perrot ( [...] , [...] ) was a Breton collaborationist force {{founded on}} 11 November 1943, during the German {{occupation}} of France. It {{was led by}} Célestin Lainé who <b>formed</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Lu Brezhon, a Breton separatist militia. During {{the course of the}} World War II it participated in anti-partisan operations {{under the direction of the}} German Sicherheitsdienst. Following the German defeat in Operation Overlord it was evacuated into Germany, where it dissolved in the aftermath of the German capitulation. Part of the group including Lainé managed to evade arrest, while others were imprisoned or executed in the post war pursuit of wartime collaborators. Bezen Perrot left a legacy of brutality, hampering future attempts to form an independent Breton state.|$|E

6000|$|We {{drove to}} the inn that Sterne has immortalised, or one at least that bears the same name, and found English comfort united with French cookery and French taste. After all, I {{do not know why}} I may not say French comforts too; for in many respects they surpass their island {{neighbours}} even in this feature of domestic comfort. It is a comfort to have a napkin even when eating a muffin; to see one's self entire in a mirror, instead of edging the <b>form</b> into <b>it,</b> or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> sideways; to drink good coffee; to eat good côtelettes; {{and to be able to}} wear the same linen for a day, without having it soiled.

50|$|During {{its early}} years, {{the party was}} {{involved}} in petitioning the imperial administrative bodies and British politicians demanding more representation for non-Brahmins in government. When a diarchial system of administration was established due to the 1919 Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, the Justice Party took part in presidential governance. In 1920, it won the first direct elections in the presidency and formed the government. For the next seventeen years, <b>it</b> <b>formed</b> four <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the five ministries and was in power for thirteen years. It was the main political alternative to the nationalist Indian National Congress in Madras. After it lost to the Congress in the 1937 election, it never recovered. It came {{under the leadership of}} Periyar E. V. Ramaswamy and his Self-Respect Movement. In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice Party into the social organisation Dravidar Kazhagam and withdrew it from electoral politics. A rebel faction that called itself the original Justice Party, survived to contest one final election, in 1952.|$|R
60|$|On the rocks, that {{overhung}} the mills, {{the gentlemen}} paused, and conversed {{for quite a}} quarter of an hour. The distance prevented Maud from discerning their countenances; but she could perceive the thoughtful, and as she fancied melancholy, attitude of the major, as, leaning on his fowling-piece, his lace was turned towards the Knoll, and his eyes were really riveted on the loop. At the end of the time mentioned, the young soldier shook hands hastily and covertly with his companions, hurried towards the path, and descended <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, following the course of the stream. Maud saw him no more, though her father and Mr. Woods stood on the rocks quite half an hour longer, catching occasional glimpses of his <b>form,</b> as <b>it</b> came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shadows of the forest, into the open space of the little river; and, indeed, until the major was within a short distance of the spot where he was to meet the Indian. Then they heard the reports of both barrels of his fowling-piece, fired in quick succession, the signals that he had joined his guide. This welcome news received, the two gentlemen returned slowly towards the house.|$|R
40|$|Genetics {{has reached}} certain {{conclusions}} {{as to the}} nature of the germ-material that have an important bearing on the interpretation of the localization of the hereditary elements that influence development. Most of the genetic information has come from a study of the inheritance of the characters of adult animals and plants, but it is not without significance to find that the same conclusions can be derived from a study of the characters shown by embryos and larval <b>forms.</b> <b>It</b> would be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place here to give the evidence for Mendel's theory of heredity, but its conclusions can be drawn upon and its principles illustrated by the inheritance of larval and embryonic characters. The most complete evidence comes from the caterpillars of the silkworm moth (Bombyx mori), especially from the work of two Japanese investigators, Toyama and Tanaka. Many races of silkworms are cultivated. The caterpillars show racial differences, especially in their color markings and in the color and shape of the cocoons. The heredity of more than a dozen different types of caterpillars and of several kinds of cocoons has been worked out. In addition, the color of the eggs and young embryos enclosed in the egg have furnished important evidence of "maternal inheritance," as has also the number of broods produced each year...|$|R

Established in 2012, <b>it</b> <b>formed</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an International Research Project titled Topographies of the Obsolete, set up by Bergen Academy of Art and Design, Norway; and focused on the disused ceramics factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Spode Works. The aim of the research is to deepen and develop our understanding of the post-industrial landscape with specific reference to the industrial ruin. Through a series of residencies and workshops, a cross-disciplinary group of artists and researchers from a range of international art institutions, set out to explore the socio-economic histories, industrial architecture and production remains of the former Spode Works. The results of the research were exhibited and published during the British Ceramics Biennial in September 2013 and Seconds, in the Lace Market Gallery in March 2014. This exhibition at Bonington Gallery was the first showing of newly generated outcomes, with a subsequent exhibition taking place at Sheffield Hallam SIA Gallery in Winter 2016.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} an {{ensemble}} {{of the writings}} of Elizabeth von Arnim which, when examined intratextually as well as intertextually, reveals an interanimation of her life with her text: this includes her life as lived; her life as imagined and her life as written. The thesis shows how these distinctions collapse in her writing. The literary theoretical concept of "the author as dead" is therefore limited, in this case, {{within the context of}} the interanimation and the perceived trajectory of self definition that <b>it</b> <b>forms</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth von Arnim's writing. The importance of Elizabeth von Arnim as Author will be argued as having significant implications towards her life long quest for felicity and, more specifically, female-centred, felicitous space. The interanimation of the three distinctions involving her life and text is explored within the context of Elizabeth von Arnim's major thematic concern: that of female-centred space. The thesis compares and contrasts the ability of Elizabeth von Arnim, together with her female protagonists, to create, protect, and maintain female-centred space. While Elizabeth von Arnim is popularly known as a romance writer, this thesis explores and reveals her work to be a deliberate and consistent ironic subversion of patriarchal institutions and their ideologies, including the social construction and ideology of romantic love that was central and embedded in Elizabeth von Arnim' s culture and affirmed in the romance genre...|$|R

Recent NTU fine art graduates who participated in the original Spode project were in residence during the exhibition: Ciaran Harrington and Christine Stevens. Throughout the Returns exhibition, researchers from the project led a series of discussion workshops. Each session was intended for a small group of invited speakers and participants who considered a specific area emerging from the concerns uncovered in Returns’ research through practice. The discussions took the form of presentations, group conversations and practical activities. Their aim was to bring together professionals and practitioners to reflect upon three particular points of focus: Digging through Dirt: Archaeology past, present, precious and unwanted - Wednesday 11 February Artists will have your Ruin: Regeneration through the arts - Wednesday 18 February Ruins of Craft: Lost art of making - Wednesday 25 February </p...|$|R
