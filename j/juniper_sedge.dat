50|$|In North America, alvars provide {{habitat for}} birds such as bobolinks, eastern meadowlarks, upland sandpipers, eastern towhees, brown thrashers and loggerhead shrikes whose habitat is declining elsewhere. Rare plants include Kalm's lobelia (Lobelia kalmii), Pringle's aster, <b>juniper</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex juniperorum), lakeside daisy (Hymenoxys acaulis), ram's-head lady's-slipper (Cypripedium arietinum) and dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris). Also {{associated}} with alvars are rare butterflies and snails.|$|E
5000|$|The Lagoons Nature Reserve {{is formed}} {{from the wind}} and tides on the dunes. Cork oaks, <b>junipers,</b> pines, <b>sedges,</b> cattails and {{thickets}} are, among others, some of the species that we can find. These lakes also form {{an important part of}} the migratory routes of birds, because in them tend to pause in their long journeys. It is an area with varied flora and fauna where besides birds and flora must emphasize hedgehogs and chameleons.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the last}} ice age most of the {{vegetation}} in the Riding Mountain region was eliminated, and it remained this way after the retreat of the glaciers 12,500 years ago. The Riding Mountain upland and surrounding plains and Manitoba Escarpment were mostly carved in the Tertiary era, but the ice sheets of the Pleistocene period modified the drainage and appearance of the land. Only the movement of {{the last ice}} sheet in this period left a visible effect on the features of the region. About 11,500 years ago a spruce dominated forest began to emerge in its place, with some of the vegetation being ash, <b>juniper,</b> <b>sedges,</b> buffaloberry, and trembling aspen. After this time the climate was dry, and [...] the percentage of spruce decreased. During the Holocene climatic optimum up until 6500 years ago the amount of herbs, shrubs and grasses in the park increased. At the end of this time beaked hazelnut appeared and the amount of bur oak increased, with the climate becoming cooler and moister. Up to 2,500 years ago the amount of grassland species in general decreased and boreal forests migrated into the Riding Mountain region. It was at this moment that ecosystems began to resemble those of today, with species such as tamarack, fir, alder, pine and spruce becoming more common. Several streams that run through the park have headwaters in Riding Mountain's lakes. Clear Lake's water comes from underground springs rather than from streams.|$|R
