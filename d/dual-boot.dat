In physical dimensions, the device would measure at 64 x 9 x 124mm.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that because Microsoft and Google had both implemented policies which effectively ban the certification of devices which <b>dual-boot</b> both Android and Windows, the Transformer Book Duet would be cancelled, and Asus would pull its similar all-in-one desktops from the market. Both companies had reportedly {{objected to the}} concept of dual-OS devices of this nature as early as January 2014. Prior to CES, an analyst believed that Microsoft was discouraging manufacturers from releasing such devices because they would dilute Windows 8 and Windows Phone's software ecosystem (which Microsoft was reportedly planning to unify). He also speculated that Microsoft would penalize OEMs by forfeiting discounts on Windows licenses and refusing to provide them with financing for marketing. Additionally, even though Android is an open source operating system that is freely available, Google's application suite is proprietary, and can only be licensed for devices which are approved by the company. This would prevent such devices from including access to Google Play, Android's primary application store.|$|E

5000|$|Boot Camp {{does not}} help users install Linux, and does not provide drivers for it. Most methods for <b>dual-booting</b> with Linux on Mac rely on manual disk partitioning, {{and the use of}} an EFI boot manager such as rEFInd.|$|R
25|$|The {{use of the}} x86 {{architecture}} allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, {{and opens}} {{the possibility of using}} the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a <b>dual-boot</b> setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to switchers, since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.|$|E

2500|$|OLPC's {{dedication}} to [...] "Free and open source" [...] was questioned with their May 15, 2008, announcement that large-scale purchasers would be offered {{the choice to}} add an extra cost, special version of the proprietary Windows XP OS developed by Microsoft alongside the regular, free and open Linux-based operating system with the SugarLabs [...] "Sugar OS" [...] GUI. Microsoft developed {{a modified version of}} Windows XP and announced in May 2008 that Windows XP will be available for an additional cost of 10 dollars per laptop. James Utzschneider, from Microsoft, said that initially only one operating system could be chosen. OLPC, however, said that future OLPC work would enable XO-1 laptops to dual boot either the free and open Linux/Sugar OS or the proprietary Microsoft Windows XP. Negroponte further said that [...] "OLPC will sell Linux-only and <b>dual-boot,</b> and will not sell Windows-only [...] ". OLPC released the first test firmware enabling XO-1 <b>dual-boot</b> on July 3, 2008. This option did not prove popular. As of 2011, a few pilots had received a few thousand total <b>dual-boot</b> machines, and the new ARM-based machines do not support Windows XP. No significant deployment purchased Windows licenses. Negroponte stated that the dispute had [...] "become a distraction" [...] for the project, and that its end goal was enabling children to learn, while constructionism and the open source ethos was more of a means to that end. Charles Kane concurred, stating that anything which detracted from the ultimate goal of widespread distribution and use was counterproductive.|$|E
50|$|Multi-booting is {{the act of}} {{installing}} multiple operating systems on a computer, {{and being able to}} choose which one to boot. The term <b>dual-booting</b> refers to the common configuration of specifically two operating systems. Multi-booting may require a custom boot loader.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{computer}} with multiple operating systems per storage device is a <b>dual-booting</b> computer that stores both Windows and Linux on the same disk drive. In this case a multi-booting boot loader is necessary. Also, the disk must be partitioned to give each operating system its own partition on the disk drive.|$|R

5000|$|Limited {{availability}} of widely used commercial applications (such as Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word). This {{is a result}} of the software developers not supporting Linux rather than any fault of Linux itself. Sometimes this can be solved by running the Windows versions of these programs through Wine, a virtual machine, or <b>dual-booting.</b> Even so, this creates a chicken or the egg situation where developers make programs for Windows due to its market share, and consumers use Windows due to {{availability of}} the programs.|$|R

50|$|While the {{different}} NTFS versions {{have a certain}} degree of both forward and backward compatibility, there are certain issues when mounting newer NTFS volumes containing persistent shadow copies in older versions of Windows. This affects <b>dual-booting,</b> and external portable hard drives. Specifically, the persistent shadow copies created by Windows Vista on an NTFS volume are deleted when Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 mount that NTFS volume. This happens because the older operating system does not understand the newer format of persistent shadow copies. Likewise, System Restore snapshots created by Windows 8 are deleted if they are exposed to a previous version of Windows.|$|R

5000|$|While the {{different}} NTFS versions {{are for the}} most part fully forward- and backward-compatible, there are technical considerations for mounting newer NTFS volumes in older versions of Microsoft Windows. This affects <b>dual-booting,</b> and external portable hard drives. For example, attempting to use an NTFS partition with [...] "Previous Versions" [...] (a.k.a. Volume Shadow Copy) on an operating system that does not support it will result in the contents of those previous versions being lost. A Windows command-line utility called convert.exe can convert supporting file systems to NTFS, including HPFS (only on Windows NT 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51), FAT16 and FAT32 (on Windows 2000 and later).|$|R
50|$|Critics of Linux on {{the desktop}} have {{frequently}} argued that limited availability of native versions of top-selling video games on the platform holds adoption back, sometimes ignoring the fact that developers of games, not the Linux Foundation, are responsible for supporting the operating system. This creates a chicken or the egg situation where developers make games for Windows due to its market share as well as driver support, and gamers use Windows due to availability of games. As of September 2015, the Steam gaming service has 1,500 games available on Linux, compared to 2,323 games for Mac and 6,500 Windows games. Additionally one can either run the games through Wine, a virtual machine, or <b>dual-booting.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{computer}} with one operating system per storage device is a <b>dual-booting</b> computer that stores Windows on one disk drive and Linux on another disk drive. In this case a multi-booting boot loader is not strictly necessary because the user can choose to enter BIOS configuration immediately after power-up and make the desired drive first in the boot-order list. However, {{it is more convenient}} to have a multi-booting boot loader on one of the drives, set BIOS once to always start booting from (i.e., load the boot loader from) that drive, and then allow the user to choose an operating system from that boot loader's menu. No special disk partitioning is necessary when each operating system has its own dedicated disk drive.|$|R
