5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the <b>gazelle,</b> hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. <b>Gazelle</b> hunters also used hawks to gouge out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gazelles,</b> i. e. firms showing {{rapid growth}} {{over a long}} period of time, have a strong impact on {{national}} economic development; that is why they are widely studied in the developed countries. The purpose of this article is to present the results of the first empiric study of <b>gazelles</b> in Russia. The number of <b>gazelles</b> in this country is higher, while their relative contribution to GDP growth is lower, than in the Western countries. <b>Gazelles</b> are the only type of middle and large Russian firms with positive long-term dynamics of employment. They are also the active agents of technological imitation and innovation processes. The rapid growth of Russian <b>gazelles</b> tends to follow an exponential law.

40|$|As schumpeterian {{creative}} {{destruction is}} increasingly popular, {{this leads to}} focus on high-growth firms. These firms have been called <b>gazelles</b> by Birch. Among the SME employing 20 to 250 workers in 1993 and still alive in 2003, the top 5 % {{of the distribution of}} growth - henceforth called <b>gazelles</b> - multiply their employment by 5 in 10 years. They create as many jobs as the 50 % creating jobs at a more moderate rate (the other 45 % loss jobs). <b>Gazelles</b> growth is uneven: half of their ten-year growth is concentrated on only one year. <b>Gazelles</b> defined {{on the basis of their}} growth between 1993 and 1998 do not create any more jobs on the following period, between 1998 and 2003. External growth, including mergers and acquisitions, accounts for a big part of <b>gazelles</b> growth: according to their size, <b>gazelles</b> belong more often to a group. Between 1998 and 2001, period of strong growth, external growth accounts for one half of the growth of the <b>gazelles.</b> Every industry, even those in relative decline, has some <b>gazelles.</b> <b>Gazelles</b> in low growth industry grow mainly by external growth, which seems to correspond to a concentration process, possibly defensive.

5|$|The German naval {{contingent}} (numbering four, {{compared to}} the United Kingdom's eight) followed the British lead in operational terms. On 11 December 1902, the <b>Gazelle</b> boarded the old gunboat Restaurador in the port of Guanta. The gunboat was towed at anchor and put into service by the German Captain-Lieutenant Titus Türk with crew members of the <b>Gazelle</b> as SMS Restaurador. On 23 February 1903 was the return to Venezuela, where the ship was by the extent of repair work {{in a much better}} condition than the removal.|$|E

5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's <b>gazelle,</b> Thompson's <b>gazelle</b> and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{assigned}} to overseas service, <b>Gazelle</b> {{participated in the}} Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03. She returned to German waters in 1904, and served with the fleet until 1914. She was employed as a coastal defense ship after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. She served in this role until the night of 2526 January 1916, when she struck a mine off Cape Arkona. The Navy deemed <b>Gazelle</b> not worth repairing and reduced her to a mine storage hulk, a role she retained {{through the end of}} the war. In August 1920, she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{species in}} the park with special {{conservation}} status are the northern spotted owl, California mountain kingsnake, tailed frog, Del Norte salamander, northern goshawk, olive-sided flycatcher, little willow flycatcher, Siskiyou <b>gazelle</b> beetle, and Pacific fisher. Five at-risk bat species {{are found in the}} cave: Townsend's big-eared bat, and the long-eared, fringed, long-legged, and Yuma myotis.|$|E
50|$|The Sudan cheetahs are {{carnivorous}} {{and mostly}} feed on herbivorous animals, such as Grant's <b>gazelles,</b> Cape hares, guineafowls and large animals like hartebeests, plains zebras and Barbary ostriches on few occasions. The Soemmerring's <b>gazelles</b> {{are the most}} preferable prey. However, lack of Soemmerring's <b>gazelles</b> in the Sudan cheetah's region caused near extinction in Sudan.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gazelles</b> {{have often}} been {{dispatched}} to support and protect UN international missions, such as the 1992 intervention in the Bosnian War. In addition to performing land-based operations, French <b>Gazelles</b> have also been frequently deployed from French naval vessels. In April 2008, witnesses reported up to six French <b>Gazelles</b> reportedly firing rockets upon Somali pirates during a major counter-piracy operation. During the 2011 military intervention in Libya, multiple <b>Gazelles</b> were operated from the French Navy's amphibious assault ship Tonnerre; strikes were launched into Libya against pro-Gadhafi military forces.|$|R

5|$|From 1865 to 1867, British {{authorities}} {{rounded up}} {{supporters of the}} Irish Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship <b>Gazelle</b> and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued {{to many of the}} imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system.|$|E
5|$|One {{of these}} was Brigadier General Frederick Lance of the 19th Lancers, and his wife, Gladys, {{returned}} to Britain with two Salukis from Sarona, where he was stationed during the post-war occupation. The Lances were both keen hunters, and rode with their pack of dogs, including both Salukis and terriers, to course jackal and Dorcas <b>Gazelle</b> whilst stationed in the desert. They imported a male, called Sarona Kelb, who became an influence on the breed in the West.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division {{replaced}} the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain Campaign {{with the goals}} of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul. In late November the 5thDivision established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau. The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay {{at the base of the}} <b>Gazelle</b> Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas. By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the <b>Gazelle</b> Peninsula by the Australian force's aggressive patrolling. The 5th Division suffered 53fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign. After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong, which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} midden selection and use by mountain <b>gazelles</b> Gazella gazella in central Saudia Arabia {{and the implications}} of middens (dung piles) for the conservation of this species. Specifically, we tested poachers 2 ̆ 7 claims that mountain <b>gazelles</b> are easy to kill because midden use was predictable and conspicuous. We found that midden selection in mountain <b>gazelles</b> is non-random, with middens typically located {{at the base of the}} most conspicuous and largest trees, although the choice of midden sites is also influenced by tree species. Middens clearly have olfactory importance; the majority of mountain <b>gazelles</b> that visited middens were observed sniffing the ground. Mountain <b>gazelles</b> visit middens at night, which corroborates poachers 2 ̆ 7 claims that the animals are easily hunted at night through spotlighting. Although the use of open habitats that are accessible to automobiles makes <b>gazelles</b> vulnerable to hunting and being run down, our data suggest that midden use is also an attribute that makes <b>gazelles</b> susceptible to hunting. Poachers can locate <b>gazelles</b> because of middens 2 ̆ 7 predictable locations, as they are placed at prominent landmarks, are visually conspicuous as large dung piles, and are visited at night, which allows the animals to be found through spotlighting. Other taxa that use predictable and prominent landmarks, or communicate through visually conspicuous methods could also be susceptible to poaching...|$|R
25|$|The Royal Navy's <b>Gazelles</b> entered {{service in}} December 1974 with 705 Naval Air Squadron, Culdrose, to provide all-through flying {{training}} {{in preparation for}} the Lynx's service entry. A total of 23 <b>Gazelles</b> were ordered for Culdrose. Army-owned AH.1s also entered service with 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron (3 CBAS) of the Royal Marines and later, the Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) of the Fleet Air Arm, where they operated as utility and reconnaissance helicopters in support of the Royal Marines. The 12 <b>Gazelles</b> for 3 CBAS had entered service in 1975, by which time, there were 310 <b>Gazelles</b> on order for the British military.|$|R
5|$|The Australian advance was {{hampered}} by shortages of shipping, aircraft and communications, which limited operations to brigade-strength only. In January 1945 the 36th Battalion was dispatched from Cape Hoskins to Ea Ea {{on the north}} coast of New Britain by barge, and began sending out company-sized patrols; they subsequently reached Watu Point, in Open Bay, {{at the base of}} the <b>Gazelle</b> Peninsula by April. The Australian forces also advanced along the south coast of the island, and began securing the Waitavalo–Tol area in late February, with engineer support enabling the crossing of the Wulwut River. Several clashes followed around Mount Sugi as the Australians fought to gain control of several heavily defended ridges overlooking Henry Reid Bay. Heavy rain and flooding hampered their efforts, but by April the Australians had secured Wide Bay and had effectively hemmed the Japanese into the <b>Gazelle</b> Peninsula, where they were able to be contained for the remainder of the campaign. This enabled the Allies to focus their attention elsewhere, such as Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The Gazelle-class cruisers {{served in}} various {{capacities}} after their commissioning. Most of them {{served with the}} fleet reconnaissance force, though several served on foreign stations as well. <b>Gazelle</b> served abroad in 19021904, Thetis in 19021906, Niobe in 19061909, and Arcona in 19071910. Nymphe was also used as a training ship for naval cadets {{in addition to her}} fleet scout role, and Undine served as a gunnery training ship.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a <b>gazelle,</b> can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|Blackbuck bear a close {{resemblance}} to <b>gazelles,</b> and are distinguished mainly {{by the fact}} that while <b>gazelles</b> are brown in the dorsal parts, blackbuck develop a dark brown or black colour in these parts.|$|R
50|$|Thomson's <b>gazelles</b> are {{dependent}} on short grass. Their numbers are highly concentrated {{at the beginning of}} the rains since the grass grows quickly. They follow the larger herbivores, such as plains zebras and blue wildebeests as they mow down the tall grasses. Then, the <b>gazelles</b> spread out more. In the wild, Thomson's <b>gazelles</b> can live 10-15 years. Their major predators arecheetahs, which are able to attain higher speeds, but <b>gazelles</b> can outlast them in long chases and are able to make turns more speedily. This small antelope-gazelle can run extremely fast, from 80 km/h, to 96 km/h (60 mph) and zigzag, a peculiarity which often saves it from predators. Sometimes they are also chased by leopards, lions and hyenas, but the <b>gazelles</b> are faster and more agile; these predators attack especially the young or infirm individuals. They can also be devoured by crocodiles and pythons, and their fawns are sometimes the prey of eagles, jackals, and baboons. A noticeable behaviour of Thomson's <b>gazelles</b> is their bounding leap, known as stotting or pronking, used to startle predators and display strength.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to forming a merged men's team, the Guildford <b>Gazelles</b> Ladies team was also formed at this time. The <b>Gazelles</b> recently secured top {{place in the}} 2015-16 Women's NC South East West 1 league.|$|R
5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba. A {{different}} version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib ("Gift to the Rider"), to the Banu Azd people {{when they came to}} pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the <b>gazelle,</b> and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E
5|$|As Allied {{intelligence}} {{regarding the}} Japanese was still uncertain, Ramsay, who officially assumed {{command of the}} forces on New Britain on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began sending out patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both {{the northern and southern}} coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the <b>Gazelle</b> Peninsula. The AIB also continued to operate in the area, passing information to the 5th Division. The Japanese lacked information on the movements of Allied forces in New Britain, and only learned of the change in command from Australian radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the <b>Gazelle</b> Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
25|$|Grant’s <b>gazelles</b> are {{generally}} mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats {{seems to be}} the determinant of their diets. The Grant's <b>gazelle's</b> diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the browsed plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, <b>gazelles</b> move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat red oats and small, tough plants, which are avoided by the other ungulates. This allows the <b>gazelles</b> to survive in the brush during the dry season. Grant’s <b>gazelles</b> eat mainly dicotyledons during the dry season and grass in the wet season.|$|R
50|$|Currently, large {{populations of}} dorcas <b>gazelles</b> {{are found in}} the Negev and the Arava, with other large populations in Sudan, Iraq, and the {{southern}} part of the eastern desert of Egypt. In Israel, only 1000-1500 <b>gazelles</b> remain.|$|R
50|$|Most {{species of}} <b>gazelles</b> have been hunted for food {{over the course}} of history. Soemmerring's <b>gazelles</b> are very understudied due to their small numbers. In parts of their former range they are extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.|$|R
