60|$|The casual glimpses {{which the}} {{ordinary}} population bestowed upon that wondrous world of sap and leaves called the Hintock woods {{had been with}} these two, Giles and Marty, a clear gaze. They had been possessed of its finer mysteries as of commonplace knowledge; {{had been able to}} read its hieroglyphs as ordinary writing; to them {{the sights and sounds of}} night, winter, wind, storm, amid those dense boughs, which had to Grace a touch of the uncanny, and even the supernatural, were simple occurrences whose origin, continuance, and laws they foreknew. They had planted together, and together they had felled; together they had, with the run of the years, mentally collected those remoter signs and symbols which, seen in few, were of runic obscurity, but all together made an alphabet. From the light lashing of the twigs upon their faces, when brushing through them in the dark, they could pronounce upon the species of the tree whence they stretched; from the quality of the wind's murmur through a bough they could in like manner name its sort afar off. They knew by a glance at a trunk if its heart were sound, or tainted with <b>incipient</b> <b>decay,</b> and by the state of its upper twigs, the stratum that had been reached by its roots. The artifices of the seasons were seen by them from the conjuror's own point of view, and not from that of the spectator's.|$|E

Sometimes they whiled away the hours on the Esplanade, breathing its pensive sentiment of neglect and <b>incipient</b> <b>decay,</b> and pacing up and down over the turf athwart the slim shadows of the poplars; or, with comfortable indifference to the local observances, sat in talk on the carriage of one of the burly, uncared-for guns, while the spider wove his web across the mortar's mouth, and the grass nodded above the tumbled pyramids of shot, and the children raced up and down, and the nursery-maids were wooed of the dapper sergeants, and the red-coated sentry loitered lazily to and fro before his box. On the days of the music, they listened to the band in the Governor's Garden, and watched the fine world of the old capital in flirtation with the blond-whiskered officers; and on pleasant nights they mingled with the citizen throng that filled the Durham Terrace, while the river shaped itself in the lights of its shipping, and the Lower Town, with its lamps, lay, like a nether firmament, two hundred feet below them, and Point Levis glittered and sparkled on the thither shore, and in the northern sky the aurora throbbed in swift pulsations of violet and crimson. They liked to climb the Break-Neck Steps at Prescott Gate, dropping from the Upper to the Lower Town, which reminded Mr. Arbuton of Naples and Trieste, and took Kitty with the unassociated picturesqueness of their odd shops and taverns, and their lofty windows green with house-plants. They would stop and look up at the geraniums and fuchsias, and fall a thinking of far different things, and the friendly, unbusy people would come to their doors and look up with them. They recognized the handsome, blond young man, and the pretty, gray-eyed girl; for people in Quebec have time to note strangers who linger there, and Kitty and Mr. Arbuton had come to be well-known figures, different from the fleeting tourists on their rounds; and, indeed, as sojourners they themselves perceived their poetic distinction from mere birds of passage.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 A glaze {{storm of}} {{exceptional}} severity {{was seen in}} the Corvallis area, January, 1942. The weight of ice that accumulated in the crowns of young-growth Douglas-fir trees caused widespread top breakage in many stands lying in the broad path of this storm. Early research on this phenomenon showed the majority of trees damaged in 1942 became infected with the wood rotting fungus, Fomes cajanderi Karst. Measurements of <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> extension made in 1978 were combined with similar measurements taken in 1953 and 1963. Analysis of these data indicated that the fungal growth rate from the point of break downward slowed over the 36 -year interval since breakage. Only small amounts of decay from the point of break upward were observed. Relationships between tree characteristics and the level of <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> were also investigated. Diameter of the stem broken in 1942 was found to be correlated with the extent of <b>incipient</b> <b>decay.</b> Trees with larger breaks were consistently associated with greater amounts of decay in all three data groups. Foresters should find this information useful in developing management strategies for young Douglas-fir stands containing high percentages of top-broken trees...|$|E

40|$|Tree {{assessment}} methodologies, {{currently used}} to evaluate the structural stability of individual urban trees, usually involve a visual analysis followed by measurements of the internal soundness of wood using various instruments that are often invasive, expensive, or inadequate for use within the urban environment. Moreover, most conventional instruments do not provide an adequate evaluation of decay that occurs in the root system. The intent of this research was to evaluate the possibility of integrating conventional tools, currently used for assessments of decay in urban trees, with the electronic nose–a new innovative tool used in diverse fields and industries for various applications such as quality control in manufacturing, environmental monitoring, medical diagnoses, and perfumery. Electronic-nose (e-nose) technologies were tested for the capability of detecting differences in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by wood decay fungi and wood from healthy and decayed trees. Three e-noses, based on different types of operational technologies and analytical methods, were evaluated independently (not directly compared) to determine the feasibility of detecting <b>incipient</b> <b>decays</b> in artificially-inoculated wood. All three e-nose devices were capable of discriminating between healthy and artificially-inoculated, decayed wood with high levels of precision and confidence. The LibraNose quartz microbalance (QMB) e-nose generally provided higher levels of discrimination of sample unknowns, but not necessarily more accurate or effective detection than the AromaScan A 32 S conducting polymer and PEN 3 metal-oxide (MOS) gas sensor e-noses for identifying and distinguishing woody samples containing different agents of wood decay. However, the conducting polymer e-nose had the greater advantage for identifying unknowns from diverse woody sample types due to the associated software capability of utilizing prior-developed, application-specific reference libraries with aroma pattern-recognition and neural-net training algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and chemical composition of beech wood exposed for 30 and 120  days to white-rot fungi Abstract: The effects of exposing specimens of Oriental beech [Fagus sylvatica subsp. orientalis (Lipsky) Greu-ter and Burdet] to the white-rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq. : Fr.) Kummer and Trametes versicolor (L. : Fr.) Pilát strain 325 {{have been studied}} concerning the mechanical {{properties and}} chemical composition in terms of carbohy-drates, cellulose, and lignin. Biological decay tests were carried out {{in accordance with the}} EN 113 standard speci-fications for 30 and 120 days. P. ostreatus had nearly the same deteriorating effects on the mechanical properties and chemical composition as that caused by T. versicolor. High and significant correlations were found between some mechanical properties with chemical components; for instance, the correlation coefficient (R 2) between impact bending and carbohydrate content was about 0. 96. The changes of components influence the various mechanical properties to a different degree. <b>Incipient</b> fungal <b>decay</b> caused severe changes for impact bending and carbohydrate loss. Several other properties declined at 120 -day exposure time, such as the hardness, compres-sion strength parallel to grain, and cellulose and lignin losses...|$|R
40|$|A new {{laboratory}} technique {{to simulate the}} initiation of wood decay and to assess the effects of <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> on material properties is described. Douglas-fir heartwood specimens were exposed to brown-rot (Postia placenta and Gloeophyllum trabeum) fungi for various periods. Bendlng properties were determined by nondestructive and destructive tests, and chemical composition of specimens was analyzed. Weight losses of 1 to 18 % were linearly related to strength losses of 5 to 70 %. Wood strength loss by brown-rot fungi was also closely related to degradation of hemi-cellulosic components. Hemicellulose sidechains, such as arabinose and galactose, were degraded in the earliest stages of decay; main-chain hemicellulose carbohydrates, such as mannose and xylose, were degraded in the later stages. Changes in glucose content, a measure of residual cellulose, were minimal. Our technique was effective for establishing and assessing brown-rot decay...|$|E
30|$|On sheared {{plane of}} sound wood, peeling out of {{secondary}} wall of tracheid has been observed, called “flags” by Côté and Hanna [13]. The peeling out of tracheid is usually {{observed in the}} earlywood region. The peeling out of tracheid was observed in the specimen with high shear strength in this study (Fig.  5). As shear strength was decreased, size of fragment of tracheid seemed to be smaller and its appearance frequency of fragment seemed to be lower. In addition, specimens with considerable small shear strength showed no fragment of tracheid caused by peeling out (Fig.  9). The size and appearance frequency of fragment of tracheid may depend {{on the extent of}} decay. The extent of decay, which includes <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> to significant decay, could be evaluated by investigation of fragment of tracheid. Therefore, the shape of failure surface was quantitatively evaluated by the surface roughness.|$|E

Brown-rot starts to become significant in the outer cell wall regions (middle lamellae, primary cell walls, and the outer layer of the secondary cell wall S 1). This pattern was detected even in a sample with non-detectable mass loss. Most significant during <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> was the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, i. e. depolymerisation of wood polysaccharides and the degradation of pectic substances.

30|$|Numerous {{studies that}} are based on the biological, {{biochemical}} and mechanical viewpoints [3 – 11] have been performed on the wood deterioration by brown-rot fungus. Especially, because the strength deterioration of decayed wood may largely affect safety of timber structures, estimation of degree of deterioration has been performed on partially decayed wood. Methods applied in such studies to date are the pin-penetration depth [5, 6], acoustic emission [7, 8], infrared spectra [9, 10], and X-ray microdensitometry [11]. However, the values obtained by those were influenced by moisture content and distribution of decay. Thus, these methods need non-decayed specimens with same condition. In addition, methods of detection of <b>incipient</b> stages of <b>decay</b> are limited. Detection of the decayed part of wood, estimation of decay degree of wood, and evaluation of the residual strength of decayed wood are desired.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Infection {{courts for}} {{microorganisms}} invading white fir heartwood {{were determined to}} be primarily branches and basal wounds. Of 11 hymenomycetes isolated from infected trees, only four: Echinodontiurn tinctorium, Phellinus chrysoloma, Pholiota adiposa, and Hericium abietis were of major significance in terms of frequency of infection and damage caused. Two or more hyrnenomycetous fungi were commonly isolated from a single decay column. Where this occurred decay was more extensive than that caused by a single hymenomycete. Hericium abietis was a common associate of F. tinctorium and other hymenomycetes. Decay columns in white fir were typically cylindrical in shape and had three distinct zones of discoloration and deterioration. These included advanced, <b>incipient</b> and early <b>decay.</b> The progression of decay stages horizontally across the grain and vertically at the lower and upper ends of columns was from the advanced zone at the center through <b>incipient</b> to early <b>decay</b> to sound wood. Results of cultural isolation of microorganisms from the decay zones indicated that a succession of microorganisms occurs as decay progresses in white fir heartwood. Bacteria were the primary organisms isolated from the early decay zone. A consistent microflora of bacteria and fungi was isolated from the incipient and advanced stages of decay. Bacteria apparently are the initial colonizers of heartwood followed by the fungi. The hymenomycetous fungi responsible for causing 173 of the 513 decay columns were either unidentifiable in culture or in most cases they were not isolated. These decay columns were small, the causal fungi appeared to have died or become inactive. Limiting factors {{are thought to be}} competition by other microorganisms or unfavorable air or moisture conditions accompanying healing of infection courts. Non-hymenomycetes identified included: Phialophora fastigiata and Phialophora spp., Cladosporium herbarum, Gliocladium roseum, and Rhinocladiella atrovirens. No successional pattern was detected among those identified. Most bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. A few Bacillus species were found. Species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from decay in 31 white fir trees distributed among 16 areas. Evidence of N 2 - fixation by these bacteria was initially obtained by acetylene reduction then confirmed by use of 15 N 2 and by total nitrogen analyses. Bacteria fixing N 2 were associated with the major decay fungi during all stages of attack on the white firs. High populations (1 O^ 5 to 10 ^ 6 /ml expressed sap) of N 2 -fixing bacteria were associated with the early and <b>incipient</b> stages of <b>decay</b> caused by P. chrysoloma and H. abietis, but not E tinctorium Population data are considered preliminary because of the limited sample. Many of these bacteria were identified as typical or atypical isolates of Enterobacter agglomerans, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae and Kiebsiella pneurnoniae. Identifications based on phenotypic properties were confirmed by percent guanine plus cytosine base composition analyses of selected isolates. Phenotypic properties of many N 2 -fixing bacteria did not conform with published descriptions. Since most differences were negative responses none of the aberrant strains were considered new species. Two methods were developed for estimating defect in standing white fir trees in southwestern Oregon (1) Defect percentages of gross merchantable volumes (Scribner and International board-foot and cubic-foot) are tabulated by d. b. h and age. Then constant defect percentages are added for various indicators. Multiple regression equations used to derive the indicator defect percentage tables are given. (2) Average length deductions below and above various indicators are given along with flat percentage factors for hidden defect. The first method was considered to be the most accurate and objective. Statistical analysis indicated that the first method can be used to estimate defect in white fir in three cover types in which this species occurs in southwestern Oregon...|$|R
40|$|A {{selective}} lignin-degrading fungus, Ceri oriopsis subvermispora, can degrade lignin without intensive damage ofcellulose. We {{have demonstrated}} that extracellular lipid peroxidation by manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) occurred in the selective white rot by C. subvermispora. At an <b>incipient</b> stage ofwood <b>decay,</b> this fimgus produced MnP and large amounts of unsaturated and saturated long chain fatty acids, leading the generation ofradicals [1]. Moreover, ceriporic acid B (1 -nonadecene- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid), an extracellular metabolite produced by C subvermispora, inhibits the generation of cellulolytic and ligninolytic hydroxyl radicals [2]. These observations suggest that extracellular enzymes and low molecular mass metabolites play key roles in the selective lignin degradation. However, the selectivity by C. subvermispora changes in various culture conditions [3 - 4]; thereby it has remained to be elucidated what factors are required for the selective lignin degradation. In the present study, we investigated degradation patterns of wood cell wall components, activity of ligninolytic enzymes, and production of metabolites, such as fatty acids and ceriporic acids by C. subvermispora under various conditions. On wood meal cultures, the selectivity of lignin degradation under low nitrogen condition was much higher than in high nitrogen media. The significant lignin loss was found when both high MnP activity and decrease in accumulated linoleic acid were concomitantl...|$|R

Polyclonal-labeled latex particles were applied near {{one end of the}} polyester assay substrate. The resulting test strip was dipped into extracts from wood blocks inoculated with various wood decay fungi.

Moreover, makino bamboo contained less hemicellulose than moso bamboo {{with or without}} epidermis. In conclusion, {{the results indicated that}} EPT and SHT contributed to reduce cellulose contents. These findings were similar to those reported that hemicellulose had low thermal stability and coursed most degradation by heat treatment. Pyrolysis of hemicellulose would reduce cellulose content, thus undermining the strength of lignocellulosic material [10, 23]. The possible reason for this phenomenon might due to hemicellulose is one kind of plant cell-wall polysaccharides, which linked to lignin by covalent bonds and interconnected together with cellulose by physical intermixing. Previous studies also have demonstrated a relationship between the degradation of hemicellulose components, such as arabinose and mannose, and wood strength losses. The significant reduction in strength observed during <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> is, therefore, to be due to hemicellulose decomposition [25].|$|E

Upon reading Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield (hereafter referred to as The Vicar, 1766), one cannot resist an impression that {{this is especially true}} of the work. What strikes us is a pervasive atmosphere of harmony between man and nature and a keen sense of poetry to be enjoyed heartily in the characters' daily life. These are reflected in the narration by Primrose the protagonist and Anglican clergyman.

40|$|Background: Predicting future {{risk for}} oral diseases, {{treatment}} need and prognosis are tasks performed daily in clinical practice. A large {{variety of methods}} have been reported, ranging from clinical judgement or "gut feeling" or even patient interviewing, to complex assessments of combinations of known risk factors. In clinical practice, there is an ongoing continuous search for less complicated and more valid tools for risk assessment. There is also {{a lack of knowledge}} how different common methods relates to one another. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if caries risk assessment (CRA) based on clinical judgement and the Cariogram model give similar results. In addition, to assess which factors from clinical status and history agree best with the CRA based on clinical judgement and how the patient's own perception of future oral treatment need correspond with the sum of examiners risk score. Methods: Clinical examinations were performed on randomly selected individuals 20 - 89 years old living in Skåne, Sweden. In total, 451 individuals were examined, 51 % women. The clinical examination included caries detection, saliva samples and radiographic examination together with history and a questionnaire. The examiners made a risk classification and the authors made a second risk calculation according to the Cariogram. Results: For those assessed as low risk using the Cariogram 69 % also were assessed as low risk based on clinical judgement. For the other risk groups the agreement was lower. Clinical variables that significantly related to CRA based on clinical judgement were DS (decayed surfaces) and combining DS and <b>incipient</b> lesions, DMFT (<b>decayed,</b> missed, filled teeth), plaque amount, history and soft drink intake. Patients' perception of future oral treatment need correlated to some extent with the sum of examiners risk score. Conclusions: The main finding was that CRA based on clinical judgement and the Cariogram model gave similar results for the groups that were predicted at low level of future disease, but not so well for the other groups. CRA based on clinical judgement agreed best with the number of DS plus incipient lesions...|$|R

However, you have most beneficently, from of old, given me free licence for it. Other benefits, unacknowledged as yet, have I continued to receive from you: I think I've been silent even since before your so cheering (about yourself) letter from Ashville, followed, {{a few days before}} I left town (which I did five days ago), by your still more interesting and important one (of May 3d) in answer to mine dealing (so tentatively!) with the question of my making plans, so far as complicatedly and remotely possible, for going over to you for 6 or 8 months. There is--and there was when I wrote--no conceivability of my doing this for a year at least to come--before August 1904, at nearest; but it kind of eases my mind to thresh the idea out sufficiently to have a direction to tend to meanwhile, and an aim to work at. It is in fact a practical necessity for me, dès maintenant, to know whether or no I absolutely want to go if, and when, I can: such a difference in many ways (more than I need undertake to explain) do the prospect of going and the prospect of not going make. Luckily, for myself, I do already (as I feel) quite adequately remain convinced that I shall want to whenever I can: that is [if] I don't put it off for much more than a year--after which period I certainly shall lose the impulse to return to my birth-place under the mere blight of <b>incipient</b> senile <b>decay.</b> If I go at all I must go before I'm too old, and, above all, before I mind being older. You are very dissuasive--even more than I expected; but I think it comes from your understanding even less than I expected the motives, considerations, advisabilities etc., that have gradually, cumulatively, and under much study of the question, much carefully invoked light on it, been acting upon me. I won't undertake just now to tell you what all these reasons are, and how they show to me--for there is still plenty of time to do that. Only I may even at present say that I don't despair of bringing you round in the interval (if what is beyond the interval can realise itself) to a better perception of my situation. It is, roughly--and you will perhaps think too cryptically--speaking, a situation for which 6 or 8 months in my native land shine before me as a very possible and profitable remedy: and I don't speak not by book. Simply and supinely to shrink--on mere grounds of general fear and encouraged shockability--has to me all the air of giving up, chucking away without a struggle, the one chance that remains to me in life of anything that can be called a movement: my one little ewe-lamb of possible exotic experience, such experience as may convert itself, through the senses, through observation, imagination and reflection now at their maturity, into vivid and solid material, into a general renovation of one's too monotonised grab-bag. You speak of the whole matter rather, it seems to me, [...] "à votre aise"; you make, comparatively, and have always made, so many movements; you have travelled and gone to and fro--always comparatively!--so often and so much. I have practically never travelled at all--having never been economically able to; I've only gone, for short periods, a few times--so much fewer than I've wanted--to Italy: never anywhere else that I've seen every one about me here (who is, or was, anyone) perpetually making for. These visions I've had, one by one, all to give up--Spain, Greece, Sicily, any glimpse of the East, or in fact of anything; even to the extent of rummaging about in France; even to the extent of trudging about, a little, in Switzerland. Counting out my few dips into Italy, there has been no time at which any [...] "abroad" [...] was financially convenient or possible. And now, more and more, all such adventures present themselves in the light of mere agreeable luxuries, expensive and supererogatory, inasmuch as not resolving themselves into new material or assimilating with my little acquired stock, my accumulated capital of (for convenience) [...] "international" [...] items and properties. There's nothing to be done by me, any more, in the way of writing, de chic, little worthless, superficial, poncif articles about Spain, Greece, or Egypt. They are {{the sort of thing that}} doesn't work in at all to what now most interests me: which is human Anglo-Saxonism, with the American extension, or opportunity for it, so far as it may be given me still to work the same. If I shouldn't, in other words, bring off going to the U.S., it would simply mean giving up, for the remainder of my days, all chance of such experience as is represented by interesting [...] "travel"--and which in this special case of my own would be much more than so represented (granting the travel to be American.) I should settle down to a mere mean oscillation from here to London and from London here--with nothing (to speak of) left, more, to happen to me in life in the way of (the poetry of) motion. That spreads before me as for mind, imagination, special, [...] "professional" [...] labour, a thin, starved, lonely, defeated, beaten, prospect: in comparison with which your own circumgyrations have been as the adventures of Marco Polo or H.M. Stanley. I should like to think of going once or twice more again, for a sufficient number of months, to Italy, where I know my ground sufficiently to be able to plan for such quiet work there as might be needfully involved. But the day is past when I can [...] "write" [...] stories about Italy with a mind otherwise pre-occupied. My native land, which time, absence and change have, in a funny sort of way, made almost as romantic to me as [...] "Europe," [...] in dreams or in my earlier time here, used to be--the actual bristling (as fearfully bristling as you like) U.S.A. have the merit and the precious property that they meet and fit into my ("creative") preoccupations; and that the period there which should represent the poetry of motion, the one big taste of travel not supremely missed, would carry with it also possibilities of the prose of production (that is of the production of prose) such as no other mere bought, paid for, sceptically and half-heartedly worried-through adventure, by land or sea, would be able to give me. My primary idea in the matter is absolutely economic--and on a basis that I can't make clear to you now, though I probably shall be able to later on if you demand it: that is if you also are accessible to the impression of my having any [...] "professional standing" [...] là-bas big enough to be improved on. I am not thinking (I'm sure) vaguely or blindly (but recognising direct intimations) when I take for granted some such Chance as my personal presence there would conduce to improve: I don't mean by its beauty or brilliancy, but simply by the benefit of my managing for once in my life not to fail to be on the spot. Your allusion to an American [agent] as all sufficient for any purpose I could entertain doesn't, for me, begin to cover the ground--which is antecedent to that altogether. It isn't in the least a question of my trying to make old copy-rights pay better or look into arrangements actually existing; it's a question--well, of too much more than I can go into the detail of now (or, much rather, into the general and comprehensive truth of); or even than I can ever do, so long as I only have from you Doubt. What you say of the Eggs (!!!), of the Vocalisation, of the Shocks in general, and of everything else, is utterly beside the mark--it being absolutely for all that class of phenomena, and every other class, that I nurse my infatuation. I want to see them, I want to see everything. I want to see the Country (scarcely a bit New York and Boston, but intensely the Middle and Far West and California and the South)--in cadres as complete, and immeasurably more mature than those of the celebrated Taine when he went, early in the sixties, to Italy for six weeks, in order to write his big book. Moreover, besides the general [...] "professional" [...] I have thus a conception of, have really in definite view, there hangs before me a very special other probability--which, however, I must ask you to take on trust, if you can, as it would be a mistake for me to bruit it at all abroad as yet. To make anything of this last-mentioned business I must be on the spot--I mean not only to carry the business out, of course, but to arrange in advance its indispensable basis. It would be the last of follies for me to attempt to do that from here--I should simply spoil my chance. So you see what it all comes to, roughly stated--that the 6 or 8 months in question are all I have to look to unless I give up the prospect of ever stirring again. They are the only [...] "stir" [...] I shall ever be able to afford, because, though they will cost something, cost even a good bit, they will bring in a great deal more, in proportion, than they will cost. Anything else (other than a mere repeated and too aridly Anglo-American winter in Florence, perhaps, say) would almost only cost. But enough of all this--I am saying, have said, much more than I meant to say at the present date. Let it, at any rate, simmer in your mind, if your mind has any room for it, and take time, above all, if there is any danger of your still replying adversely. Let me add this word more, however, that I mention August 1904 very advisedly. If I want (and it's half the battle) to go to the West and South, and even, dreamably, to Mexico, I [could not] do these things during that part of the summer during which (besides feeling, I fear, very ill from the heat) I should simply have to sit still. On the other hand I should like immensely not to fail of coming in for the whole American autumn, and like hugely, in especial, to arrive in time for the last three or four weeks of your stay in Chocorua--which I suppose I should do if I quitted this by about mid-August. Then I should have the music of toute la lyre, coming away after, say, three or four Spring weeks at Washington, the next April or May. But I must stop. These castles in Spain all hang by the thread of my finding myself in fact economically able, 14 months hence, to face the music. If I am not, the whole thing must drop. All I can do meanwhile is to try and arrange that I shall be. I am scared, rather--well in advance--by the vision of American expenses. But the [...] "special" [...] possibility that shines before me has the virtue of covering (potentially) all that. One thing is very certain--I shall not be able to hoard by [...] "staying" [...] with people. This will be impossible to me (though I will, assuredly, by a rich and rare exception, dedicate to you and Alice as many days as you will take me in for, whether in country or town.) Basta! ...|$|R
40|$|Water {{absorption}} in wood {{in service}} {{is of great}} importance both because of the resulting dimensional changes of the wood {{and because of the}} risk of deterioration by microorganisms at wood moisture content levels above 20 %. Due to the strong position of wood as a constructional material in Norway, wood–water relationships are of major commercial importance. The effects of different surface treatments on water absorption in wood have been extensively studied, but the effects of wood with different properties in combination with different coatings are not as well documented. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of surface treatments and wood properties on liquid water absorption in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Scots pine log sections and cladding boards of both species have been subjected to study, as well as small decay test specimens in Scots pine and Robinia pseodoaccacia. In the process, different methods for analysis have been evaluated and the mechanisms behind water absorption, particularly in Norway spruce wood, have been studied. A procedure in accordance with a European standard but with substantially prolonged exposure times was used for liquid water exposure of cladding specimens, while a spraying rig was used for cyclic wetting and drying of log sections. An unforeseen fungal attack on several of the Scots pine log sections posed some challenges in the design of the log section experiment and interpretation of the results. On the other hand, it gave the opportunity to study the effect of <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> on liquid water uptake compared to effects of coatings and crack orientation. It also facilitated a test of an ultrasonic measurement apparatus for dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) on detection of <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> in specimens of large dimensions. The weight of the specimens was recorded regularly during the experiments, and modelling of the resulting curves was done in order to describe the moisture absorption and/or desorption in each specimen. The emphasis was on finding models that both gave close fits to the data and generated parameters that were few in number and easy to interpret. The development of water absorption in Scots pine log sections during cyclic wetting and drying was studied using a mechanistic growth model. The model did not fit perfectly to the data, both due to the way the measurements were done and to the nature of water uptake in partly uncoated wood. Two parameters derived from the model were useful in evaluating the effect of surface coatings, <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> and crack directions. Liquid water absorption in uncoated Norway spruce cladding specimens was modelled in two distinct phases, one governed by both diffusion and capillary flow and one governed by capillary flow alone. This was shown to describe the absorption in uncoated Norway spruce specimens satisfactorily. The parameters derived from the models (apparent diffusion coefficient and rate of void filling degree) were found useful in evaluating the effects of wood properties. If the relative performance of combinations of surface treatments and wood substrates with different properties are of interest, rather than analytical evaluation of the physical processes involved in water absorption, analyses of single measurements of the amount of absorbed water were shown to give sufficient information. The resulting moisture content was shown to give valuable information regarding the performance of the different wood types. The European standard procedure evaluated in this part of the study can be used to evaluate the combined effect of wood substrates and coatings, provided that the exposure time is prolonged. The permeability to water was higher in waterborne than in solvent-borne coating during wetting of cladding specimens. Regarding Scots pine log specimens, wood tar caused less accumulation of water than film-forming coatings did. Upwards-facing cracks caused faster absorption than downwards-facing cracks, but surface treatment had a larger effect than crack orientation. <b>Incipient</b> <b>decay</b> caused substantially increased water absorption, overriding both surface treatments and crack orientation. Ultrasonic dynamic MOE measurements were found to give valuable information regarding early decay detection, both in log section specimens and in small decay test specimens. Moisture conditions and temperature have to be taken into consideration in experimental planning if this measurement method is to be used. Transversal measurements on Scots pine log sections were not successful, possibly because of the mode of action of the decay fungus in question. Wood properties were shown to affect liquid water absorption both in coated and in uncoated cladding specimens. In coated specimens, the effect of differences between slow-grown and fast-grown Norway spruce was not statistically significant after short-term exposure (72 hours) but was very important after long-term exposure (4 weeks or more). Coated cladding specimens of slow-grown spruce absorbed larger amounts of water than those of fast-grown spruce, but this did not cause correspondingly larger moisture contents. When Scots pine heartwood was included the effect of wood type could be seen already after 72 hours. In uncoated Norway spruce larger effects of wood properties were found on capillary flow than on apparent diffusion, and heartwood proportion had larger effect than density. No effect from annual ring width was found, but origin (growth site) had significant effect when wood properties were accounted for. Thus, the good reputation slow-grown Norway spruce has as a cladding material is probably more due to large heartwood content than to high density or narrow annual rings...|$|E
40|$|Fungal stain {{in value}} added {{hardwood}} {{has resulted in}} the loss {{of millions of dollars in}} downgraded timber over the past few years in Victoria (Vinden 1994). The causes of fungal stain in Victorian hardwoods, particularly Eucalyptus regnans and Eucalyptus delegatensis, were determined at J. L. Gould Sawmill in Alexandra, Victoria. Systematic sampling of the logs in the log pile under sprinklers revealed a complex ecological niche of fungi, many of which are capable of causing stain. Further studies on logs with <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> identified Penicillium glabra as the fungus potentially responsible for the yellow stain and Ophiostoma sp. as the fungus potentially responsible for the black stain. A mill audit pinpointed areas in the processing procedure in need of improvement. Log storage times must be radically reduced and storage facilities must be improved to provide an environment that does not encourage fungal growth. A study concentrating on the moisture content of logs in the log pile also revealed the need for an improved water sprinkling system. Proposals to counter the stain problem include improving control measures, implementation prophylactic treatment after log sawing, and further research into biological control in the log pile.

40|$|A wood decay {{detecting}} instrument, Rotfinder® {{was evaluated}} for its accuracy, {{sensitivity and specificity}} in detecting decay in standing trees. Five hundred trees were measured in three different stands with Rotfinder at three heights in the stems. The trees were felled and sectioned, and {{presence or absence of}} decay was observed for each section. Wood samples were taken from every section and their wood density and moisture content was measured. Rotfinder accuracy of detecting both decayed and healthy trees was 82. 7 %. The highest sensitivity was obtained at stump height (55. 9 %). Advanced decay was detected in the 71 % of cases while <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> was detected in the 23 % of cases. Rotfinder has a scale from 0 to 10 which indicates an increasing degree of probability of decay. Rotfinder values higher than 4 indicated more than 90 % of probability of finding decay. Rotfinder successful detections (true positives and true negatives) and Rotfinder failures (false positives and false negatives) were compared in terms of moisture content, wood density and N, C, Mg, Ca, K, Na and Mn concentration. True positives had higher moisture content in reaction zone and decay, higher density in reaction zone and higher concentration of calcium and sodium of reaction zone than false negatives. Relationship between Rotfinder values and wood characteristics were studied, and the potassium concentration showed the highest correlation with Rotfinder values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most of the cross-arms of the 275 KV and 123 KV {{transmission}} lines in Malaysia and certain countries are using hard wood especially from chengal species. Due to natural weathering this wooden cross-arms is degraded and decayed. For safety reason {{there is a}} need for a simple, light, and accurate non-destructive decay detection. In this project the microwave reflection technique and ultrasonic method which is based on the transit time have been developed for in-situ measurement. In this study, we categorize the decay on the wood into three stages of decays namely severely decay, <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> and sound wood. In microwave method these stages can be related to the amount of water that can be absorbed by weathered wood and secondly on the wood density at particular moisture content especially at environmental moisture content. This method managed to detect inner decay up to 2 cm from the surface of the wood. In ultrasonic method, an investigation has been done to find suitable method of measurement, especially detection of decay under the metal block. Appling this detection system the transit times along l-l direction for sound wood, incipient wood, and cracked wood fall under the ranges of 100 µs to 200 µs, 200 µs to 500 µs, and above 500 µs respectively.

40|$|In Norway spruce, a {{fungistatic}} {{reaction zone}} {{with a high}} pH and enrichment of phenolics is formed in the sapwood facing heartwood colonized by the white-rot fungus Heterobasidion parviporum. Fungal penetration of the reaction zone eventually results in expansion of this xylem defense. To obtain information about mechanisms operating upon heartwood and reaction zone colonization by the pathogen, hyphal growth and wood degradation were investigated using real-time PCR, microscopy, and comparative wood density analysis of naturally colonized trees with extensive stem decay. The hyphae associated with delignified wood at stump level were devoid of any extracellular matrix, whereas <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> {{at the top of}} decay columns was characterized by a carbohydrate-rich hyphal sheath attaching hyphae to tracheid walls. The amount of pathogen DNA peaked in aniline wood, a narrow darkened tissue at the colony border apparently representing a compromised region of the reaction zone. Vigorous production of pathogen conidiophores occurred in this region. Colonization of aniline wood was characterized by hyphal growth within polyphenolic lumen deposits in tracheids and rays, and the hyphae were fully encased in a carbohydrate-rich extracellular matrix. Together, these data indicate that the interaction of the fungus with the reaction zone involves a local concentration of fungal biomass that forms an efficient translocation channel for nutrients. Finally, the enhanced production of the hyphal sheath may be instrumental in lateral expansion of the decay column beyond the reaction zone boundary...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to 1) develop a relatively quick staining procedure that would detect <b>incipient</b> <b>decay</b> by color differentiation under fluorescence, 2) quantitatively assess the amount of decay present with the use of an image analyzer, and 3) re/ate loss in strength at various decay levels to staining for the presence of decay. The fluorochrome stain acridine orange was used to stain nondecayed and decayed wood sections from end-grain wafers and small beams of Southern yellow pine (Pinus spp.) and Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco]. A. 02 % solution of acridine orange pH 6. 0 was best for Southern yellow pine; a pH 8. 0 was best for Douglas-fir. Staining the sections for two hours and washing them for 24 hours provided the best color differentiation between decayed and non-decayed areas. In wood with little or no weight loss (less than 3 %), the springwood cells appeared bright green under fluorescence with traces of yellow-orange. As weight loss increased, more yellow and orange became evident. The latewood and ray cells fluoresced a yellow-orange most of the time regardless of percent weight loss. The computer image analyzer detected the green and orange as different gray levels, the green registering a lighter shade than the orange. However, due to inherent anatomical features of wood and the dulling of fluorescence when a slide has been exposed to the illumination source {{for an extended period of}} time, this method is not practical. Modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR) and fiber stress at the proportional limit (FSPL) decreased significantly with increased weight loss. MOR was most affected sustaining a strength loss greater than 50 % with a 3 % weight loss in pine. Linear regression analyses of MOE and MOR vs. specific gravity indicated a relationship between these two variables and also a significant difference in the strength property means of the nondecayed and decayed samples. Percent strength loss (MOE and MOR) vs. percent weight loss was also regressed. The coefficient of determination (r²) for these regressions were low, with less than 50 % of the variability being accounted for by percent weight loss. Alkali solubility of pieces from end-matched beams was correlated with percent strength loss but less so than the correlations between strength and weight loss. Radial sections from the broken beams stained the bright green typical of non-decayed wood possibly due to irregularities in the brown rot decay pattern, but more likely because the areas of the beam sampled may not have contained decay. Cross sections near the failure have responded better...|$|E
