500|$|The {{desire of}} {{building}} a diasystem to accommodate all English dialects, combined with a blossoming generative phonology, prompted American dialectologists to attempt {{the construction of an}} [...] "overall system" [...] of English phonology by analyzing dialectal distinctions as differences in the ordering of phonological rules {{as well as in the}} presence or absence of such rules.

500|$|However, {{there were}} {{problems}} between Thrale and Johnson, along with [...] "his defenders" [...] during his life and in criticism since then, over their [...] "gradual estrangement" [...] from each other {{after the death of}} her husband. These problems were then heightened by her marriage to Gabriel Piozzi. After Johnson's death, Thrale felt isolated because she believed that Johnson's previous friends along with the public as a whole did not accept her, and some went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> she abandoned Johnson in his final moments. In particular, James Boswell, who resented Thrale and felt himself as her literary competitor, began to exploit the falling out between Thrale and Johnson's friends in order to promote his Life of Samuel Johnson.|$|E
500|$|After publication, {{not all of}} the {{reaction}} was this positive. The Tory British Critic sniped that the book was [...] "stuffed with dull, common-place, Jacobin declamation", and The Quarterly Review, with the same political bias, rebuked Hazlitt for his uncomplimentary portrayal of King Henry VIII. But for the most part, the praise continued. Hunt, in a fuller review in The Examiner, applauded not only the author's enthusiasm [...] "but the very striking susceptibility with which he changes his own humour and manner according {{to the nature of the}} play he comes upon; like a spectator in a theatre, who accompanies the turns of the actor's face with his own." [...] John Hamilton Reynolds, reviewing it in The Champion, went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that [...] "This is the only work ever written on Shakespeare that can be deemed worthy of Shakespeare".|$|E
5000|$|In {{defense of}} Haeckel's embryo drawings, the {{principal}} {{argument is that}} of [...] "schematisation."

Gursch argues, Haeckel's embryo drawings should be regarded as [...] "reconstructions." [...] Although his drawings are open to criticism, his drawings should not be considered falsifications of any sort. Although modern defense of Haeckel's embryo drawings still considers the inaccuracy of his drawings, charges of fraud are considered unreasonable. As Erland Nordenskiöld argues, charges of fraud against Haeckel are unnecessary. R. Bender ultimately goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> reject His's <b>claims</b> regarding the fabrication of certain stages of development in Haeckel's drawings, arguing that Haeckel's embryo drawings are faithful representations of real stages of embryonic development in comparison to published embryos.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Achaeans is {{somewhat}} problematic. Homer, probably writing in the 9th century BC, uses the term Achaeans as a generic term for Greeks throughout the Iliad, which is believed to describe events in Mycenaean Greece, i.e. before 1200 BC. However, there is no firm evidence that the Greeks of the Mycenaean period used that name to describe themselves. The term Ahhiyawa, found in 13th century BC Hittite texts may mean [...] "Achaeans", {{that is to say}} the Greeks of the Mycenaean culture, but again, there is no definitive evidence that this is the case. Emil Forrer went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that there existed a [...] "great empire" [...] called Ahhiyawa, which stood as equal {{by the side of the}} old states of the east. However, his conclusions were disproven by later researchers, especially by Ferdinand Sommer.|$|R

500|$|Hemingway {{has been}} called anti-Semitic, most notably because of the {{characterization}} of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a 'kike'.

Cohn is never really part of the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith. Critic Susan Beegel goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim,</b> [...] "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew."

500|$|Moreover, {{symmetrical}} positions may be disadvantageous to White {{in that he}} has {{to commit}} himself first. Watson notes that it is even difficult for White to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position, since almost every move has certain drawbacks. Fischer once went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that after 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.0-0 0-0 5.d3 d6 (Reinhard–Fischer, Western Open 1963), Believe it or not,' Black stands better!

[...] However, GM Paul Keres responded in CHESS magazine, [...] "We just don't believe it!"

500|$|As a supergroup, Black Country Communion's {{style is}} often {{described}} as a mix of various different sounds and influences. Particular significance is attributed to the band's mix of blues rock (attributed primarily to Bonamassa's work within the genre) and hard rock (originating from Hughes's previous work with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, and from Bonham's tie with Led Zeppelin via his father John), with some critics going as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that the group's sound is based on [...] "the vintage Deep Purple template". In reviews for the band's second album, a number of critics compared the sound of the group to that of Led Zeppelin – Eduardo Rivadavia of website AllMusic noted that the album [...] "sounds like the baby of drummer Jason Bonham", while Paul Cole of the Sunday Mercury claimed that it is [...] "haunted by the spirit of Zeppelin". Hughes has dubbed the group [...] "a rock and roll band in the true sense of the word".|$|E
40|$|We divide {{analytic}} metaphysics into naturalistic and non-naturalistic metaphysics.

We outline and criticise Ladyman and Ross’s [2007] epistemic argument against non-naturalistic metaphysics. We then present our own argument against it. We set out various ways in which intellectual endeavours can be of value, and we argue that in so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> it <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be an ontological enterprise, non-naturalistic metaphysics cannot be justified according to the same standards as science or naturalistic metaphysics. The lack of observable consequences explains why non-naturalistic metaphysics has, in general, failed to make progress, beyond increasing the standards of clarity and precision in expressing its theories.

25|$|Additionally, {{controversy}} ensued {{between the}} Bears' management and Lance Briggs. Only weeks after losing Super Bowl XLI, the Bears placed a franchise tag worth nearly 7.2 million {{dollars on the}} Pro Bowl-caliber linebacker, keeping him with the team for another year. Briggs became unhappy with the action and voiced his anger on The Mike North Morning Show. He even went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> he no longer {{wanted to be a}} member of the Bears, a statement he later reiterated nationally on FoxSports.com. Despite Briggs' remarks, the Bears stated that they planned to keep him with the organization for the 2007 season. The Washington Redskins offered to exchange first-round draft picks with the Bears in exchange for Briggs. Angelo deferred the offer on April 3, but later stated they were interested in negotiating another deal the following day. Briggs came to terms with the Bears on July 25, and accepted the 7.2 million dollar contract.|$|R
5000|$|Undoubtedly, {{the most}} notorious form of voice-tracking {{involves}} using out-of-market talent. In this form, the station contracts with a disc jockey in another city (often employed by the same corporation, but sometimes as a freelancer). The outsider will add local color using {{information provided by the}} station and news stories gleaned from newspapers available on the Internet. The recorded voice tracks are then sent to the station by shipping tapes, e-mailing the file as audio attachments, FTP, or dedicated networks. DJs of this style often make a point of trying <b>to</b> sound <b>as</b> local as possible, sometimes going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> falsely <b>claiming</b> <b>to</b> have visited a local landmark or attended a station promotional event.

[...] Adorján goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that, [...] "The tale of White's advantage is a delusion, belief in it is based on mass psychosis." [...] Rowson writes that Adorján's [...] "contention {{is one of the most}} important chess ideas of the last two decades ... because it has shaken our assumption that White begins the game with some advantage, and revealed its ideological nature". However, Rowson rejects Adorján's claim that White has essentially no advantage, reasoning that White is better' and 'Black is OK' need not be mutually exclusive claims".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] was generally mixed. Website Drowned in Sound described the song as [...] "sweet and charming" [...] but stated that, {{although it is}} a good album track it isn't strong enough to stand up on its own as a single and is rather [...] "bland" [...] compared to some of the band's other songs such as [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Fire in My Heart". The NME called the song [...] "a bit rubbish" [...] by the Super Furries' [...] "usual high standards" [...] and went as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that [...] "John Lennon was shot for less". The Dallas Observer claimed the track is [...] "guaranteed to induce the same type of melancholic, goose-bumpy splendor that tunes like The Kinks' 'Waterloo Sunset', Dennis Wilson's 'Forever' and Jack Bruce's 'Theme for an Imaginary Western' still do", Entertainment Weekly described it {{as one of the best}} songs on parent album Rings Around the World, comparing it to the work of The Beatles while The Daily Telegraph called it a [...] "honey-dripping pop classic". PopMatters claimed the track [...] "sounds like any of Blur's best ballads".|$|E
500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not go so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E
60|$|The Company's orders, censuring this {{transaction}} in {{the strongest}} terms, and ordering Mahomed Reza Khân to be immediately restored {{to the office of}} Naib Subahdar, were received in Calcutta in November, 1779. Mr. Hastings acted on this with the firmness which he had shown on other occasions; but in his principles he went further. Thinking himself assured of some extraordinary support, suitable to the open and determined defiance with which he was resolved to oppose the lawful authority of his superiors, and to exercise a despotic power, he no longer adhered to Mr. Barwell's distinction of the orders which had a tendency to bring his government into disrepute. This distinction afforded sufficient latitude to disobedience; but here he disdained all sorts of colors and distinctions. He directly set up an independent right to administer the government according to his pleasure; and he went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> bottom his <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> act independently of the Court of Directors on the very statute which commanded his obedience to them.|$|R
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued <b>to</b> act <b>as</b> an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> confirm Peterle's <b>claims</b> on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, {{and the fact that it}} was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk <b>as</b> the Ambassador <b>to</b> the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|R
500|$|Ralph Fiennes {{was cast}} as Gareth Mallory, a former {{lieutenant}} {{colonel in the}} British Army and now {{the chairman of the}} Intelligence and Security Committee, which gives him the authority to regulate MI6. At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of M. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a [...] "really interesting part which is really quite fun". To play the returning character of Miss Moneypenny, Naomie Harris was cast. Harris' role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. Despite ongoing speculation in the media that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny, this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production of the film, with Harris herself even going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> dismiss <b>claims</b> that Eve was in fact Moneypenny, stating that [...] "Eve is not remotely office-bound". According to Harris, Eve [...] " [...] she is Bond's equal, but she is really his junior". Another character returning to the series was Q, played by Ben Whishaw. Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play, and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying [...] "I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney.

500|$|The Sketch mostly {{comprised}} long, reprinted tracts {{from older}} {{works on the}} Mosquito Coast {{and other parts of}} the region. The original material ranged from misleading to outright made up. MacGregor's publicists described the Poyaisian climate as [...] "remarkably healthy... agree admirably with the constitution of Europeans"—it was supposedly a spa destination for sick colonists from the Caribbean. The soil was so fertile that a farmer could have three maize harvests a year, or grow cash crops such as sugar or tobacco without hardship; detailed projections at the Sketchs end forecast profits of millions of dollars. Fish and game were so plentiful that a man could hunt or fish for a single day and bring back enough to feed his family for a week. The natives were not just co-operative but intensely pro-British. The capital was St Joseph, a flourishing seaside town of wide paved boulevards, colonnaded buildings and mansions, inhabited by as many as 20,000. St Joseph had a theatre, an opera house and a domed cathedral; there was also the Bank of Poyais, the Poyaisian houses of parliament and a royal palace. Reference was made to a [...] "projected Hebrew colony". The Sketch went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the rivers of Poyais contained [...] "globules of pure gold".|$|E
500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

She has agreed, albeit reluctantly, to allow a film crew to monitor her for an Intervention-esque documentary show as she checks into a rehab clinic. Carson is quickly made a target of ridicule by the other patients, as she has been taking drugs because she believes {{that she has been}} demonically possessed. Jason (Morgan McClellan), a production assistant for the film crew, is sympathetic and quickly bonds with Carson - even going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> believe her <b>claims</b> after her behavior turns increasingly erratic. During all of this Carson also has several displays of supernatural behavior that is captured on camera but only when she is alone. There are suggestions of bringing in an exorcist, however the clinic's physician Dean Pretiss (Richard Wilkinson) thinks that this would be detrimental to Carson's mental well being. When Carson attacks Jason the show's producer Suzanne (Kate Whitney) begins to push Pretiss for an exorcist, only for him to state that he wants to transfer Carson to a mental institution.|$|R

She was darker than her brother--so dark that her heavily coiled hair seemed to be black until the light shone slantwise across it. The delicate, half-petulant features, the finely traced brows, and the thoughtful, humorous eyes were all perfect in their way, and yet the combination left something to be desired. There was a vague sense of a flaw somewhere, in feature or in expression, which resolved itself, when analysed, into a slight out-turning and droop of the lower lip; small indeed, and yet pronounced enough to turn what would have been a beautiful face into a merely pretty one. Very despondent and somewhat cross she looked as she leaned back in the armchair, the tangle of bright-coloured silks and of drab holland upon her lap, her hands clasped behind her head, with her snowy forearms and little pink elbows projecting on either side.|$|R

Iraq eventually finished fourth in the tournament with Iran failing to make the semi-finals for the third straight time.
