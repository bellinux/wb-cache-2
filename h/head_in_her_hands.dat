25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
500|$|Media {{and public}} {{reaction}} to the marriage was negative and cynical. Some commentators believed Jackson was marrying a person he did not love, and Rowe was having a baby {{who may not have}} been biologically Jackson's. The Daily Mirror, a British tabloid newspaper, published a photograph of Rowe on the balcony of an Australian hotel. In it, she is seen holding her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> One Jackson biographer stated that the woman's dismayed and exasperated pose was most probably due to the excessive presence of paparazzi below. The Daily Mirror, however, ran the photograph while mockingly proclaiming, [...] "Oh, God! I've Just Married Michael Jackson." ...|$|E
500|$|The promotional {{music video}} for [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] was {{directed}} by Daf Palfrey and appears on the DVD version of the band's 'greatest hits' album [...] The video begins with silent footage of five characters, who appear in a small white rectangle in {{the centre of the}} screen against a black background. The text [...] "I am like a film strip ... and like a child ... in a thousand lunar parks ... someone is always ... cranking the handle" [...] appears as the video cuts between shots of each person. [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a bald man with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. [...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title [...] "Act 2: The stalking" [...] is displayed. Shots of [...] "The stalker" [...] and [...] "The wife" [...] are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title [...] "Act 3: The murder" [...] is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of [...] "The mistress" [...] which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock. More footage of the band follows before [...] "The husband" [...] is shown motionless of the floor, surrounded by a white tape outline. The video ends with more jump cuts between the band, the masked table tennis players and the five named characters.|$|E

2500|$|I thought I {{was being}} taken {{just for a}} few days. I can recall seeing my mother {{standing}} {{on the side of the}} road with her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> crying, and me in the black FJ Holden wondering why she was so upset. A few hundred words can't fix this all but it's an important start and it's a beginning ...|$|E
2500|$|She has lectured widely {{about her}} {{first-hand}} {{experiences of the}} anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which allegedly motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed adapted curved corrals, intended to reduce stress, panic and injury in animals being led to slaughter. This {{has proved to be}} a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep, godlike connection to them.|$|E

60|$|Lady Montbarry bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> silence. <b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> trembled as {{she took}} out her handkerchief, and passed it over her forehead. Agnes {{detected}} the trembling, and shrank back a step. 'Is the subject painful to you?' she asked timidly.|$|R
60|$|She {{said nothing}} more then, but {{rose to her}} feet, and went quite close up to him. With a gesture that had no thought of passion in it, only sublime, motherly love, she took Luke's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and pressed it to her heart.|$|R

60|$|One evening, {{as she was}} {{studying}} <b>in</b> the parlour, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> buried <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> she heard new voices in the kitchen speaking. At once, from its apathy, her excitable spirit started and strained to listen. It seemed to crouch, to lurk under cover, tense, glaring forth unwilling to be seen.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} head a little, and peered at her daughter's face; as if from the remembrance of her own youth, she had flown to the remembrance of her child's.

60|$|The Princess {{buried her}} <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> She was not anxious {{to look at}} any one just then, or to be looked at. The Count rose to his feet. There were drops of {{perspiration}} upon his forehead. He was distracted.|$|E
6000|$|She stopped. Then {{suddenly}} the fountains {{in the deep}} of her blue eyes were broken up; she burst into a sob, and buried her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and {{her hands on his}} shoulder.

It also gave {{a glimpse of her}} rose tattoo. While being interviewed by Capital FM, Cheryl told that [...] "A lot of the time I'm on set, so I had a lot of freedom. ... Don't Care' it sums up pretty much how I feel right now. It's very pop, but fun pop!" [...] "I Don't Care" [...] was officially released as the second single from Only Human on 2 November 2014.|$|R
60|$|I stopped, awed. For she {{had stepped}} back, {{out on the}} balcony. She hid her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and I saw her breast shaken as with sobs.

60|$|Uttering {{a sudden}} shout Tolly Trevor flung himself headlong off the pony {{and tried to}} get on his feet but failed, owing to his hands being tied behind him.
