Traditional iron griddles are circular, with a semicircular hoop fixed to opposite {{edges of the}} plate and rising above it to form a central handle. Rectangular griddles that cover two stove burners are now also common, as are griddles that have a ribbed area {{that can be used}} like a <b>grill</b> <b>pan.</b> Some have multiple square metal grooves enabling the contents to have a defined pattern, similar to a waffle maker. Like frypans, round griddles are generally measured by diameter (20–30cm).|$|E

50|$|Heat {{transfer}} to the food when using a grill is primarily through thermal radiation. Heat transfer when using a <b>grill</b> <b>pan</b> or griddle is by direct conduction. In the United States, when the heat source for grilling comes from above, grilling is called broiling. In this case, the pan that holds the food is called a broiler pan, and heat transfer is through thermal radiation.|$|E
50|$|While live-fire {{cooking is}} {{difficult}} indoors without heavy-duty ventilation, {{it is possible}} to simulate some of the effects of a live-fire grill with indoor equipment. The simplest design is known as a <b>grill</b> <b>pan,</b> which is a type of heavy frying pan with raised grill lines to hold the food off the floor of the pan and allow drippings to run off. Otherwise, a simple frying pan can do a reasonable job of grilling.|$|E

50|$|Grilling {{is a form}} {{of cooking}} that {{involves}} dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above or below. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), a <b>grill</b> <b>pan</b> (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill), or griddle (a flat plate heated from below).|$|E

It is also famous for a variety of cheap delicious food and desserts.|$|E
50|$|Stove-top pan {{grilling}} is {{an indoor}} cooking process {{that uses a}} <b>grill</b> <b>pan</b> — similar to a frying pan but with raised ridges to emulate the function or look of a gridiron. In pan grilling, heat is applied directly to the food by the raised ridges and indirectly through the heat radiating off the lower pan surface by the stove-top flame. Stove-top grill pans {{can be used to}} put sear marks on meat before it is finished by overhead radiant heat. When cooking leaner meats, oil is often applied to the pan ridges to aid in food release.|$|E
30|$|When cooking on a {{barbecue}} grill, consumers often use aluminum <b>grill</b> <b>pans.</b> For one, the pan catches the {{fats and oils}} that would drip into the embers causing the formation of potentially noxious smoke, and the pan also protects the food from being burned by direct heat from the coals. In addition, new aluminum products for use in ovens and grills are becoming increasingly popular. Due to their light weight and excellent heat transfer camping, utensils made of aluminum are, for example, often used by fishermen and mountain climbers. Preparing food in aluminum utensils can, however, result in migration of the aluminum to the foodstuffs.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of the {{importance}} of dietary aluminum exposure (see “Aluminum in or resulting from food additives” above) and the common use of aluminum food contact materials (see “Aluminum from food contact materials” above), in particular in private households, the migration of aluminum from contact materials to food was examined. This study was deemed necessary because of the incomplete data on migration of aluminum from household and cooking utensils within the framework of consumer protection and to this extent aluminum drinking bottles and aluminum stove-top moka pots (Part II) as well as aluminum <b>grill</b> <b>pans</b> and camping utensils (Part III) were examined for migration of aluminum to food.|$|R

This missile is larger and only two can be held on each TELAR. It also has a dedicated ABM radar - the 9S19 HIGH SCREEN phased array radar at battalion level. A typical S-300V battalion is made up out of a target detection and designation unit, a guidance radar and up to 6 TELARs. The detection and designation unit consists of the 9S457-1 command post, a 9S15MV or 9S15MT BILL BOARD all-round surveillance radar and 9S19M2 HIGH SCREEN sector surveillance radar.

50|$|While it {{was created}} from the same project, hence the common S-300 designation, {{different}} priorities resulted in a design {{quite different from the}} other versions. The S-300V system is carried on tracked MT-T transporters, which gives it better cross-country mobility than even the S-300Ps on 8 × 8 wheeled transporters. It is also somewhat more distributed than the S-300P's. For example, while both have mechanically-scanning radar for target acquisition (9S15 BILL BOARD A), the battery level 9S32 <b>GRILL</b> <b>PAN</b> has an autonomous search ability and SARH delegated to illumination radar on TELARs. The early 30N6 FLAP LID on the S-300P handles tracking and illumination, but is not equipped with an autonomous search capability (later upgraded). 9S15 can simultaneously carry out an active search for goals (3 coordinates) and passive (2 position).|$|E

Russell is choked to death with a pool cue, and Frannie is electrocuted in the Jacuzzi. David's parents hurry home to deliver his prescription when a cop pulls them over for speeding. D.B finds the dead bodies of Russell, Runner, and Lisa. As he attempts to search for others, he is stabbed in the gut. Snake attacks David and is about to kill him when the dying D.B. arrives and fatally stabs Snake. David reunites with Joni and learns she is insane and killed the others except for Lisa. Joni then tries to stab David as his parents and the cop arrives and opens fire. It is revealed that David had a hyperactivity disorder since he was a kid that causes him to lose his temper. David is blamed for the murders while a still-insane Joni recovers in the hospital.|$|R
