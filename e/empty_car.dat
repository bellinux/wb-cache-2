2500|$|Lounes Matoub {{was born}} on 24 January 1956 {{in the village of}} Taourirt Moussa in Algerian Kabylie. [...] When he turned 9, he built his first guitar from an <b>empty</b> <b>car</b> oil can and {{composed}} his first songs as a teenager. His political and cultural identity was awakened by armed confrontations between Kabyles and government forces in 19631964. In 1968, the Algerian government introduced a policy of Arabization in the education system. Matoub reacted by skipping school; his memoirs recall: [...] "We had to give up Berber and reject French. I said no! I played hooky in all my Arabic classes. Every class that I missed was an act of resistance, a slice of liberty conquered. My rejection was voluntary and purposeful." [...] By 1975, he had abandoned formal education. He left for France in search of work.|$|E
2500|$|On a train {{after one}} of B's lectures, Jared stumbles upon the murdered body of B who has {{apparently}} been shot dead in an <b>empty</b> <b>car.</b> B's group of close followers clearly suspects Jared or his organization {{to be responsible for}} the murder. To Jared's surprise, Shirin resumes B's lectures where he left off and claims that she is now B. Even more surprising, she begrudgingly continues to personally tutor Jared in B's philosophies, though she openly calls Jared stupid, not because he lacks the capacity to learn but because she has never seen a person [...] "with so much mental equipment being put to so little use." [...] Shirin's further teachings include the idea of a Law of Life, the concept that storytelling may be a genetic characteristic of humans, the promotion of animism, and the notion that totalitarian agriculture results in ecological imbalance and over-population, which themselves are rapidly leading to humankind's self-destruction. Jared begins to see how he cannot remain devout to his order and in agreement with B's teachings simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with accelerating the flow of <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> in a major classification railyard in North America. Due to fluctations in inbound traffic, <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> experience long delays at the yard. Such delays can be prevented by dynamic car reassignments. We describe a procedure using a sliding time window {{in order to reduce}} the time that <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> spend in the yard and present the associated computational results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} freight <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> {{allocation}} problem in railway networks with dynamic demands, {{in which the}} storage cost, unit transportation cost, and demand in each stage are taken into consideration. Under the constraints of capacity and demand, a stage-based optimization model for allocating freight <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> in railway networks is formulated. The objective of this model is to minimize the total cost incurred by transferring and storing <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> in different stages. Moreover, a genetic algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> distribution strategies in railway networks. Finally, numerical experiments are given to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed model and algorithm...|$|R
60|$|The {{contrivance}} was {{worked by}} gravity, the loaded car crossing the river {{by virtue of}} its own weight, {{and at the same time}} dragging the <b>empty</b> <b>car</b> back. The loaded car being emptied, and the <b>empty</b> <b>car</b> being loaded with more ore, the performance could be repeated--a performance which had been repeated tens of thousands of times since the day Old Jerry became the keeper of the cables.|$|E

60|$|Jerry {{heard the}} words, faint and far, {{as from a}} remote distance. Then what was the matter? Nothing {{remained}} but the other and <b>empty</b> <b>car,</b> which he could not see, but which he knew to be there, somewhere in that terrible gulf two hundred feet beyond Spillane's car.|$|E
60|$|Feeling his {{way along}} the side of the <b>empty</b> <b>car</b> he at length reached one of the doors only to find it locked. He crossed over to the other side to find a similar {{condition}} of affairs. He was a prisoner in the freight car and riding he knew not where.|$|E

25|$|Operating {{its entire}} {{lifetime}} without any locomotives, Chesterfield Railroads moved its railcars loaded with coal mostly by gravity downhill to the docks on the James River {{at the southern}} edge of Manchester. In places where the line ran uphill, mules helped the cars climb some slopes. The <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> were hauled back uphill by the mules to the mine, to be reloaded again. In one area the weight of the loaded cars and their downhill motion pulled the <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> (connected to the full ones by ropes and drums) back toward the mines.|$|R
50|$|Some gravity railroads were {{designed}} to allow {{the weight of the}} descending loaded cars to lift the <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> back up to the top, using a cable looped around a pulley at the top for a portion of the line. A later revision designed by John B. Jervis, used two separate tracks known as the loaded or heavy track which carried cars loaded with coal to the destination, and the light track, used to return <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> to the mines. This method allowed cars to travel in a loop, without the need for passing sidings. A stationary steam engine and a looping cable, chain or iron bands were used to raise the <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> up the lift planes. The cars then coasted down a slight grade to the next lift plane. When cars reversed direction at the ends of the line on a switch or turnout instead of a loop, the railroad was known as a switchback gravity railroad.|$|R

60|$|The saddle he rigged {{was very}} simple. With the rope he made merely a large loop round the {{stationary}} cable, to which hung the <b>empty</b> <b>car.</b> When {{he sat in}} the loop his hands could just reach the cable conveniently, and where the rope was likely to fray against the cable he lashed his coat, in lieu of the old sack he would have used had he been able to find one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{railroad}} {{was originally}} constructed {{as a single}} track from Carbondale to Honesdale. [...] It contained 5 planes ascending [...] from Carbondale to the summit at Rix's Gap in the Moosic Mountains, and three planes on the [...] descent to Honesdale where the railroad terminated at the D Canal. [...] Each ascending plane was powered by a stationary steam engine which lifted the loaded cars to a [...] "level" [...] which was graded slightly to allow the loaded cars to roll by gravity {{to the foot of}} the next plane. [...] In the opposite direction, the <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> were towed by horses. [...] Each plane contained a single track, with an automatically switched siding in the center where the loaded and <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> could pass.|$|R

60|$|All {{this took}} time. More {{than an hour}} and a half had elapsed since his arrival at the <b>empty</b> <b>car.</b> And now, for the first time, he dropped out of his saddle and down into the car. He removed the detaining ropes, and the trolley-wheel began slowly to revolve. The car was moving, and he knew that somewhere beyond, {{although}} he could not see, the car of Spillane was likewise moving, and in the opposite direction.|$|E
60|$|The cable had stopped. Jerry {{threw off}} the brake, {{but it did}} not move. He caught the cable with his hands and tried to start it by tugging smartly. Something had gone wrong. What? He could not guess; he could not see. Looking up, he could vaguely make out the <b>empty</b> <b>car,</b> which had been {{crossing}} from the opposite cliff at a speed equal to that of the loaded car. It was about two hundred and fifty feet away. That meant, he knew, that somewhere in the gray obscurity, two hundred feet above the river and two hundred and fifty feet from the other bank, Spillane and his wife were suspended and stationary.|$|E
60|$|Looking at {{his watch}} again, he {{saw that he had}} kept his promise, but decided to give the man a few more minutes, and then go to his berth, unless he could learn {{something}} about him from the conductor. The berth was in the Pullman farther along the train, and after walking through the <b>empty</b> <b>car</b> he opened the door of a vestibule and stepped out on the platform. It was unprotected except for a brass rail at the side, which was divided in the middle where the steps went down. The floor jolted and a bitter wind that whistled between the vestibules buffeted him. Although he wore the fur coat, he shivered, and as he stepped across the gap between the platforms the door behind him rattled.|$|E

50|$|Traffic on {{the line}} was {{initially}} very busy, with the single locomotive hauling a train of 22 flatbed cars {{back and forth between}} the two ends. When it arrived at the western end with the empty train, it would drop the <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> off on a siding, then switch to the mainline to pull eleven filled cars out onto the line, drawing another eleven into the loading station. Once these were loaded the train left for the eastern end while the <b>empty</b> <b>cars</b> are pulled into the station by hand. At the eastern end the logs were simply rolled down into Nosbonsing, the entire operation taking two men only two and a half minutes. Typically ten trips were made per day, with a total of 4,000 logs. The rate increased to 14 a day at one point, at which point the crews striked.|$|R
