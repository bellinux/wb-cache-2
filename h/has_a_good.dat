One hijacking is the carrier's deadliest accident, when the plane plunged into the Indian Ocean due to fuel starvation in 1996.

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, it still <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related}} to the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Krichell is {{considered}} one of the greatest scouts in baseball history. Birdie Tebbetts, a member of the Veterans Committee in the 1980s, led a campaign to have Krichell, along with fellow scouts Charlie Barrett and Hugh Alexander, inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Under Hall of Fame rules, scouts are not eligible for induction. Tibbets appealed to the Hall of Fame Board of Directors every year from 1981 to 1986 to make the three scouts members of the Hall of Fame, but with no success. In The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, James awards the Paul Krichell Talent Scout Award to an example of a team that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance of signing a player who later becomes a star, who they end up passing on as the result of poor scouting.|$|E

5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> representation of carbonized plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine.|$|E
