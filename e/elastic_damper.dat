40|$|A generic {{method for}} {{analysis}} of nonlinear forced response for bladed disks with friction dampers of different designs has been developed. The method uses explicit finite element modeling of dampers, which allows accurate description of flexibility and, for the first time, dynamic properties of dampers of different designs in multiharmonic analysis of bladed disks. Large-scale finite element damper and bladed disk models containing 10 (4) - 10 (6) degrees of freedom can be used. These models, together with detailed description of contact interactions over contact interface areas, allow for any level of refinement required for modeling of <b>elastic</b> <b>damper</b> bodies and for modeling of friction contact interactions. Numerical studies of realistic bladed disks have been performed with three different types of underplatform dampers: (i) a "cottage-roof" (also called "wedge") damper (ii) seal wire damper and (iii) a strip damper Effects of contact interface parameters and excitation levels on damping properties of the dampers and forced response are extensively explore...|$|E
30|$|The {{calibration}} {{results of}} the sensor have demonstrated the good mechanical to electronic conversion performance of the developed sensor. To further verify the biomimetic performance of the sensing structure that {{is close to the}} structure advantage of the human fingertip, an experiment was conducted to investigate the force-displacement relationship of serially connected components in the sensing structure consisting of a rigid skin contact ball, a sensing film, a silicone <b>elastic</b> <b>damper,</b> and a ball-shaped bone structure. In this experiment, the setup is similar to the calibration one described in Subsection ‘Sensor calibration, identification, and verification’. Instead of using 150 -µm height square wave motion, 150 -µm height triangle wave movement was generated by the computer program to push and release the sensing structure through the contact ball. The laser distance sensor OADM 20 I 6 X 41 /S 14 F was set to a higher resolution but with a short range (range: 30 mm, resolution: 4 µm) to accurately detect displacement/deformation of the sensing structure caused by pushing and releasing operations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy {{advancing}} the technologies regarding seismic control of structures {{and development of}} earthquake resistance systems in the past decades application {{of different types of}} earthquake energy dissipation system has incredibly increased. Viscous damper device as a famous and the simplest earthquake energy dissipation system is implemented in many new structures and numerous number of researches have been done on the performance of viscous dampers in structures subjected to earthquake. The experience of recent severe earthquakes indicates that sometimes the earthquake energy dissipation devices are damaged during earthquakes and there is no function for structural control system. So, damage of earthquake energy dissipation systems such as viscous damper device must be considered during design of earthquake resistance structures. This paper demonstrates the development of three-dimensional elasto-plastic viscous damper element consisting of <b>elastic</b> <b>damper</b> in the middle part and two plastic hinges {{at both ends of the}} element which are compatible with the constitutive model to reinforce concrete structures and are capable to detect failure and damage in viscous damper device connections during earthquake excitation.

30|$|When {{inserted}} to Equation (2), {{the above}} expression shows that thermoelastic damping {{is dependent upon}} thermal conductivity as well as specific heat.

Therefore, we shift the focus to the nanoscale, where these properties are not only different, but also very strongly coupled. Our previous studies indicate that thermal conductivity is dependent on the applied mechanical strain, which we propose to exploit as a thermoelastic damping tuning parameter. In the next section, we describe an experimental study to validate this critical assumption by characterizing the relationship between strain and thermal conductivity for silicon nitride. This material has been studied in nanoscale resonators with various levels of applied mechanical pre-strain and thus is most relevant to this paper.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the green density on the {{dewaxing}} behaviour of two different uniaxially pressed iron based powder metallurgy alloys has been characterised by means of non-destructive mechanical and microstructural techniques, i. e. impulse excitation technique and synchrotron tomography. The <b>elastic</b> and <b>damping</b> properties of the green and dewaxed specimens pressed to two different densities have been evaluated. It {{was found that the}} as-pressed green specimens with lower density possessed higher stiffness and lower damping than the high density ones. This behaviour has been explained on a microstructural basis, considering the damage generated in the green specimens during the ejection step. The <b>elastic</b> and <b>damping</b> properties of the specimens after dewaxing strongly depended on their initial green density. Increased elastic properties (and lower damping) were observed for the low density specimens with respect to their green counterparts, while the opposite behaviour was observed for the specimens with higher green density (i. e. decreased stiffness and slightly higher damping after dewaxing). "In situ" monitoring of the evolution of the <b>elastic</b> and <b>damping</b> properties of the materials has been carried out by means of the high temperature impulse excitation technique to better understand the behaviour observed. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis has been carried out to correlate the mass loss events with the relevant features of the HT-IET curves.

We introduce a simple idea permitting the minimization of end-effector residual vibration when reaching a desired angular equilibrium position, in a pre-fixed desired travelling time. The results hold without considering internal <b>elastic</b> <b>damping</b> effect, using a classical controller with feedforward plus joint feedback terms. The new approach concerns the computation of the feedforward control, {{which is based on}} backward integration of the elastic dynamics, starting from a rest position of the flexible arms. This backward integration yields basically elastic trajectories permitting to reach the final desired end-effector position without oscillation. The feedback controller is then used to stabilize locally the actual states along these desired trajectories. However, for fast rest to rest motion, the feedback compensator fails to drive the system states along the desired trajectories, this being due to the relatively large initial elastic error. To overcome this limitation, proper joint motion is planned between the desired initial and final positions through optimization techniques, the goal being the minimization of the initial elastic error associated to these joint trajectories.

40|$|Purpose. In {{this paper}} it is {{necessary}} to conduct: 1) research and analyse the influence of throttle element pneumatic resistance on <b>elastic</b> and <b>damping</b> parameters of air spring; 2) to obtain the dependence of air spring parameters on throttle element pneumatic resistance value. Methodology. The work presents the elaborated model of the air spring as a dynamic system with three phase coordinates (cylinder pressure, auxiliary reservoir pressure, cylinder air mass). Stiffness and viscosity coefficients were determined on the basis of system response to harmonic kinematic disturbance. The data for the analysis are obtained by changing the capacity of the connecting element and the law of pressure variation between the reservoir and the cylinder. The viscosity coefficient is regarded as the viscosity ratio of the hydraulic damper, which for one oscillation cycle consumes the same energy as the air spring. The process of air condition change inside the cylinder (reservoir) is considered to be adiabatic; the mass air flow through the connecting element depends on the pressure difference. Findings. We obtained the curves for spring viscosity and stiffness coefficients dependence on the throttle resistance at three different laws, linking airflow through the cylinder with the pressure difference in cylinder and reservoir. At both maximum and minimum limiting resistance values the spring viscosity tends to zero, reaching its peak in the mean resistance values. Stiffness increases monotonically with increasing resistance, tends to the limit corresponding to the absence of an auxiliary reservoir (at high resistance) and the increase in cylinder volume by the reservoir volume (at low resistance). Originality. The designed scheme allows determining the optimal parameters of <b>elastic</b> and <b>damping</b> properties of the pneumatic system as function of the throttle element air resistance. Practical value. The ability to predict the parameters of <b>elastic</b> and <b>damping</b> properties of the pneumatic system as function of the throttle element air resistance will improve the running performance of carriages, the comfort of passenger transportation and reduce the wear of the rolling stock and the track caused by interaction of carriage and rails. ...|$|R
