40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} to use low-fidelity {{operations}} to control the dynamics of quantum systems. <b>Noisy</b> <b>operations</b> usually drive a system to evolve into a mixed state and damage the coherence. Sometimes frequent <b>noisy</b> <b>operations</b> result in the coherent evolution of a subsystem, and {{the dynamics of the}} subsystem is controlled by tuning <b>noisy</b> <b>operations.</b> Based on this, we find that universal quantum computation can be carried out by low-fidelity (fidelity < 90 %) operations...|$|R
