We focus on an application in the Mediterranean Sea, where in the framework of the MFSTEP project an array of Argo floats have been deployed with parking depth at 350 m and sampling interval of 5 days. In order to quantitatively test the method, the "twin experiment" approach is followed and synthetic trajectories are considered. The method is first tested using "perfect" data, i. e. without shear drift errors and with relatively high coverage. Results show that the assimilation is effective, correcting the velocity field at the parking depth, as well as the velocity profiles and the geostrophically adjusted mass field. We then consider the impact of realistic datasets, which are spatially sparse and characterized by shear drift errors. Such data provide a limited global correction of the model state, but they efficiently act on the location, intensity and shape of the described mesoscale structures of the intermediate circulation...|$|E

40|$|Variational data {{assimilation}} for Lagrangian {{geophysical fluid}} dynamics is introduced. Lagrangian coordinates add numerical difficulties into an already difficult subject, but also offer certain distinct advantages over Eulerian coordinates. First, <b>float</b> <b>position</b> and depth {{are defined by}} linear measurement functionals. Second, Lagrangian or ‘comoving’ open domains are conveniently expressed in Lagrangian coordinates. The attraction of such open domains is that they lead to well-posed prediction problems [Bennett and Chua (1999) ] and hence efficient inversion algorithms. Eulerian and Lagrangian solutions of the inviscid forward problem in a doubly periodic domain, with North Atlantic mesoscales, are compared and found to be in satisfactory agreement for about one day. Viscous stresses vastly extend the interval of agreement {{at the cost of}} considerable complexity, so in this first study the machinery of variational assimilation is developed and tested for inviscid dynamics, simulated data and short assimilation intervals.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} review of our work on Lagrangian Data Assimilation in a Variational Framework. Variational Data Assimilation aims at finding an optimal trajectory, {{solution}} of a given model, that is consistant with past observations of the modelled system. The observations {{we are interested in}} assimilating are of Lagrangian type: float positions and image sequences. At present time, Lagrangian observations are underused by numerical forecasting systems, despite the data availability. <b>Float</b> <b>position</b> observations are provided e. g. by the ARGO program floats, which are GPS-tracked every 10 days. Satellite observations of atmosphere and ocean provide everyday huge quantity of visual informa- tion (such as eddies, fronts). Observation operators for floats and image sequences are quite similar in nature and are based on passive tracers advection. For floats the observed positions are then straightforward to assimilate, although their non-linear aspect makes it quite difficult to use. For image sequences, the passive tracers dynamics are interpreted as images. The turbulent structure of these images is then compared to the observed image sequence, both of them being represented in a set of curvelets. First we will describe our methods, our observation operators and observation misfit definitions. Then we will present the first results on twins experiments...|$|E

40|$|Centimetre-level Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based {{positioning}} {{is increasingly}} relevant {{for a large}} number of applications. Currently, this level of GNSS positioning accuracy is most commonly achieved using the conventional Real Time Kinematic (cRTK) method. In order to achieve such high-accuracies with cRTK, the distance (baseline) between the user and reference station must typically be shorter than 50 km for dual-frequency GNSS receivers. To address the limitations of cRTK, the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) method, which does not require local reference networks, was developed. The principle of PPP is to model and correct error sources such as satellite orbit and clock errors using correction products and error modelling. PPP is not currently suitable for many applications, because of the long solution convergence time (from 20 to 60 min to achieve 10 cm accuracy), insufficient positioning accuracies and a lack of integrity monitoring. Current fixed ambiguity PPP methods are analysed and tested using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dataset in this thesis. Based on the analysis, the most reliable existing validation method has unacceptably large rate (12. 7 %) of incorrect ambiguity resolution. Therefore, this thesis develops an enhanced PPP method. The enhanced PPP method is based on using the enhanced ambiguity validation method (e. g. time-window based validation) and employing both GLONASS and GPS measurements to calculate a <b>float</b> <b>position</b> solution. In addition, integrity monitoring is improved in terms of failure exclusion and protection level calculation. When employing the enhanced PPP method, the rate of incorrect ambiguity resolution decreases to 5. 3 % and of correct ambiguity resolution increases to 82. 2 % when using the (NOAA) dataset. The average horizontal, vertical and 3 D position errors at the initial ambiguity resolution epoch are reduced by 40. 0 %, 23. 8 % and 31. 8 %, respectively, compared to the most reliable existing PPP method.

ABSTRACT: Stabilization of coal quality {{parameters}} is {{an important}} technological problem especially {{in the presence of}} variable raw coal characteristics such as coal size distribution and its washability. Local control systems for gravitational preparation processes have been introduced (the control of the density of separation in heavy media vessels and the refuse discharge in jigs) to compensate the influence of various disturbances on the performance of technology. The main task of these local control systems is to stabilize technological chosen parameters on the desired level, which makes it easier to keep the quality of coal within the limits of declared price and allows to control final products parameters according to the terms of the contract. Concentrates of steam or coking coal are often produced in a system of parallel processes of coal separation in heavy media vessels, jigs and flotation. In such a system there usually exists an optimal point of work (global extremum) for which the maximum amount of the final concentrate with desired ash content can be obtained. The final product of desired quality (ash content) can be produced for various set values of the densities of separation in both processes so that the blending of two components would give product of desired quality. Further analysis will show that the considered system has the characteristic of the extreme object i. e. that for the desired ash content in the product it is possible to choose optimal separation densities for which the system produces the maximum amount of the blend or the maximum value of the product [1]. In the paper an application of computer simulation program for coal preparation processes analysis and their control has been presented. The integral part of this software is an algorithm of searching the function algorithm of control target, i. e. the maximum production function of preset quality. In the paper is presented results of analysis part of coal preparation system, that is two jigs. These results relate detailed analyses one of certain of plant reviewed in the study [11]. Value of separation density was desired in one jigs, but in second jigs the value of separation density was calculated as optimum value. The density of separation in jigs can be changed indirectly, for instance by the adjustment of the <b>float</b> <b>position</b> linked with refuse removal gate. Relative values were given to the production for examined cases of enriching.

40|$|The present {{document}} is a manuscript-based dissertation covering Kyle Bassett’s PhD research from January, 2015 to January 2017. The research was particularly focused on studying and developing an emerging energy storage technique known as Buoyancy Battery Energy Storage (BBES). The buoyancy energy storage technique is presented and primary components are described and discussed. An idealized system was analyzed to determine governing equations of operation {{as well as}} ideal energy storage density. Experimental analysis was conducted to confirm properties of constant discharge force with respect to both <b>float</b> <b>position</b> and storage duration. Discharge testing was conducted with a developed scale system installed in the offshore testing tank and the University of Windsor. To evaluate the scalability of the technique, a utility scale BBES system was designed with power output capacity of 1 MW and energy storage capacity of 1 MWh. Several commercially available marine lift bags were considered and evaluated for volume requirements and drag effects at various float speeds. Theoretical roundtrip efficiency for this designed system {{was found to be}} 83 % based on results from drag calculations, pulley losses and electrical efficiency losses. Numerical simulations of system performance were completed to determine the revenue generation of the designed system based on 2015 Ontario market energy prices. To validate system operation in a marine environment, open water testing was conducted in Lake Huron. Testing validated surface deploy ability and steady state float motion was achieved. To further investigate the market opportunities and challenges facing the grid scale integration of energy storage, an analysis of market conditions was performed using Ontario, Canada as a case study. Ten years of Hourly Ontario Energy Price was analyzed using Fourier transform to reveal periodic trends within the data. It was found that the introduction of Time-of-use billing for electricity was effective in changing energy consumption behavior, improving balance for the electricity grid. Revenue generation simulations were completed for utility scale energy storage systems of various technologies (and thus various roundtrip efficiencies) using historic 2015 energy price data. Simulations included single and multi-cycle storage programs. It was determined that energy storage facilities are not currently financially viable, due to the minimal revenue produced through energy arbitrage transactions. The development of energy storage in Ontario will depend greatly on governmental subsidies and additional revenue-generating ancillary services such as regulation and black start capability. Additional experimental analysis was performed using a modified BBES system designed to convert input energy into mechanical work such that each quantity could be controlled and measured. Three float shapes of interest were tested including a horizontally configured cylinder, a vertically configured cylinder as well as a sphere. Discharge efficiencies greater than 90 % were achieved. Roundtrip efficiencies of 78 % were recorded. Results suggest that with improved conversion pulleys and component scaling, experimental roundtrip efficiencies should approach the theoretical efficiency used in the 1 MW BBES system designed...|$|E
