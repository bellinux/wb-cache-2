5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> of the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of {{the first page of}} the manuscript <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if {{they were part of the}} text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E
