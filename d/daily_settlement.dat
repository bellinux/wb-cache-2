40|$|Larvae in {{the coastal}} ocean are transported toward shore {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Crossing the surf zone is the last step in a shoreward {{migration}} and surf zones may act as semipermeable barriers altering delivery of larvae to the shore. We related variation in the structure of intertidal barnacle populations to surf zone width (surf zone hydrodynamics proxy), wave height, alongshore wind stress (upwelling proxy), solar radiation, and latitude at 40 rocky intertidal sites from San Diego, California to the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. We measured <b>daily</b> <b>settlement</b> and weekly recruitment of barnacles at selected sites and related these measures to surf zone width. Chthamalus density varied inversely with that of Balanus, and the density of Balanus and new recruits was negatively related to solar radiation. Across the region, long-term mean wave height and an indicator of upwelling intensity and frequency did not explain variation in Balanus or new recruit densities. Balanus and new recruit densities, <b>daily</b> <b>settlement,</b> and weekly recruitment were up to three orders of magnitude higher at sites with wide (> 50 m), more dissipative surf zones with bathymetric rip currents than at sites with narrow (< 50 m) more reflective surf zones. Surf zone width explained 30 - 50 % of the variability in Balanus and new recruit densities. We sampled a subset of sites < 5 km apart where coastal hydrodynamics such as upwelling should be very similar. At paired sites with similar surf zone widths, Balanus densities were not different. If surf zone widths at paired sites were dissimilar, Balanus densities, <b>daily</b> <b>settlement,</b> and weekly recruitment were significantly higher at sites with the wider, more dissipative surf zone. The primary drivers of surf zone hydrodynamics are the wave climate and the slope of the shore and these persist over time; therefore site-specific stability in surf zone hydrodynamics should result in stable barnacle population characteristics. Variations in surf zone hydrodynamics appear to play a fundamental role in regulating barnacle populations along the open coast, which, in turn, may have consequences for the entire intertidal community. </p...|$|E

Additional energy sources for heat, security and cooking are derived from fireplaces in the open or within shelters such as caves or huts.

For most banks the model's prediction accord relatively well with the observed reserve behavior of banks.

40|$|This study {{addressed}} two issues. First, it {{examined the}} ability of two models, developed by Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR), to explain the differences between futures and implicit forward prices in the thirteen-week T-bill market. The models imply that if future interest rates are stochastic, futures and forward prices differ; the structural difference {{is due to the}} <b>daily</b> <b>settlement</b> process required in futures trading. Second, the study determined the efficiency of the thirteen-week T-bill futures market using volatility and regression tests. Volatility tests use variance bounds to examine whether futures prices are excessively volatile for the market to be efficient. Regression tests investigate whether futures prices are unbiased predictors of future spot prices. The study was limited to analysis of the first three futures contracts, using weekly price data as reported in the Wall Street Journal from March, 1976 to December, 1984. Testing of the first CIR model involved determination of whether changes in futures-forward price differences are related to changes in local covariances between T-bill futures and bond prices. The same procedure applied in testing the second model with respect to changes in futures-forward price differences, local covariances between T-bill spot and bond prices, and local variances of bond prices. Volatility tests of market efficiency involved comparison of mean variances on both sides of two inequality equations. Regression tests involved determination of whether slope coefficients are significantly different from zero...|$|E

To test for DWH effects and {{to better understand the}} planktonic ecology of this species, we monitored Callinectes spp. megalopal settlement and condition at sites within and outside of the spill extent during and one year after the DWH. We tested for DWH effects by comparing 2010 settlement against baseline data available for two sites, and by testing for differences in settlement and condition inside and outside of the spill extent.

40|$|The present review {{addresses}} recent findings made in {{the western}} Iberia ecosystem on the behavioural and physical interactions that regulate dispersal, supply to coastal habitats and settlement of invertebrate larvae. These studies used the barnacle Chthamalus spp. and the crab Carcinus maenas as model organisms. The observations made on the Iberian shelf showed extensive diel vertical migrations along the water column by representatives of both groups {{that have never been}} reported before. The interaction of the diel vertical migration with the two-layer flow structure of upwelling/downwelling circulation suggests a mechanism that may help to retain larvae in shelf waters during upwelling conditions. Measurements of daily supply of C. maenas megalopae to estuaries separated by 500 km disclosed a semilunar pattern, with highest supply around highest amplitude tides, indicating that supply of megalopae to estuaries is accomplished by selective tidal stream transport. Relaxation of equatorward winds also played a role in supply, by enhancing translocation of megalopae to the nearshore. Concerning Chthamalus larvae, the observations on <b>daily</b> <b>settlement</b> made at rocky shores also separated by 500 km showed unclear patterns between locations and years. The relationship of settlement with water temperature, tidal range and upwelling indices indicated that supply of barnacle cyprids may be controlled by multiple mechanisms, viz. upwelling/downwelling circulation, internal tidal bores and sea breezes...|$|E

This study investigated the temporal variability of the supply of crab megalopae to an estuary located in the northwest coast of Portugal, which is affected by seasonal upwelling, and related variations in supply to several upwelling indices. Megalopae of the European common shore crab Carcinus maenas (L.). were collected <b>daily,</b> using artificial <b>settlement</b> substrates, during a 3 -month period, from March 15 to June 15, 2000. Two settlement episodes were detected, which were consistent with the variation in abundance and size of juvenile crabs. Variations in subtidal sea level and sea surface temperature anomaly were correlated with the strength of along-shore wind stress and consistent with upwelling theory. Contingency analyses showed positive significant associations between increasing intensity of southerly winds and megalopal supply, for time lags of 0 – 6 d, indicating that shoreward transport occurred during relaxation or reversal of upwelling favourable winds. Associations between megalopal supply and tidal range or the duration of nocturnal flood were not detected. Compared to other studies of the supply of crab megalopae to coastal habitats that used a similar methodology, very low numbers of megalopae were collected during this study. The paucity of C. maenas megalopae in the Ria de Aveiro is in agreement with the low densities of this larval stage in the plankton, and indicates that maintenance of the population is achieved despite a low supply of megalopae...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies {{a static}} model of an {{interest}} rate corridor to the Canadian data, and estimates the aggregate demand for central-bank settlement balances in the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS). The empirical specification controls for various calendar effects that {{have been shown to}} cause fluctuations in LVTS payment flows. The analysis takes into account the downward divergence of the overnight interest rate from the target rate, which has been persistent since 2005. The results suggest that a target of $ 3 billion for LVTS settlement balances does not seem excessive during the time period when Canadian monetary policy was operating at the effective lower bound (ELB). Specifically, the model projects that, if the consistent downward divergence of overnight interest rate is taken into account, then on average $ 2. 405 billion of LVTS settlement balances would probably have been sufficient to achieve the goal of keeping the overnight interest rate at or very close to the lower bound of the corridor. However, by targeting a slightly higher level, the Bank of Canada could be 95 % certain that the overnight interest rate would on average not exceed its policy rate at the lower bound of the corridor. In addition, the estimation shows that the point elasticity of overnight interest rate is around 0. 17 when the <b>daily</b> level of <b>settlement</b> balances is targeted at $ 3 billion under the ELB framework...|$|R
40|$|The current {{conceptual}} model of reinvasion and settlement for estuarine brachyuran crabs in mesotidal systems is that megalopae undergo selective tidal stream transport, in an upstream direction, and settle {{by the end}} of the flood tide. Recent studies on recruitment processes of Carcinus maenas (L.) have reported a clear decoupling between supply, as larval influx, and settlement events in the lower Mira Estuary (SW Portugal). We investigated, at high temporal resolution, whether overestimation of planktonic abundances and/or deviations of megalopal responses from the {{conceptual model}} were responsible for such decoupling. <b>Daily</b> <b>settlement</b> of megalopae was analyzed using regression and spectral analyses to identify periodicities and correlated with tidal amplitude. Hydrological parameters and supply, net flux and hourly concentration of megalopae in the plankton were addressed as factors influencing short, intermediate and long-term settlement, through 50 h sampling series. Supply and surface net flux levels of megalopae were similar and clearly decoupled from settlement on bottom-deployed collectors. Both hourly planktonic concentration and settlement patterns of megalopae fitted the conceptual model at high temporal resolution, with some deviations in terms of light intensity influences. Furthermore, our results suggest that processes preventing settlement and capable of overriding the influence of light intensities—such as turbulence—may explain the decoupling between supply and settlement of shore crab megalopae in the lower Mira Estuary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Early {{life history}} traits, such as larval growth, {{influence}} {{the success of}} coral reef fish in {{the transition from the}} larval to the juvenile life phase. Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between parasites and growth in the early life history stages of such fishes. This study examined how parasite prevalence (% infected) and load, and the relationship between parasite presence and fish growth, differed among life stages of the damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis. Parasite prevalence decreased significantly between the larval stage, which was sampled immediately before settlement on the reef (97 %) and recently settled juveniles (60 %); prevalence was also high for 4 -month-old juveniles (90 %), 7 -month-old juveniles (100 %) and adult fish (100 %). Total numbers of parasites per fish decreased dramatically (fourfold) between larval and recently settled fish, and then increased in the older stages to levels similar to those observed in larvae, but they did so more gradually than did prevalence. One explanation for these patterns is that heavily infected larvae were preferentially removed from the population during or soon after <b>settlement.</b> <b>Daily</b> fish growth, determined from otolith increments, revealed that growth did not differ between parasitised and non-parasitised larval fish, whereas recently settled fish that were parasitised had faster growth; these parasitised recently settled fish also displayed faster growth prior to settlement.

They were fed 1, 200 mg A-MPD bound with either 5. 0 mg/mL agar solution, 7. 5 mg/mL agar solution, 10. 0 mg/mL agar solution, and 12. 5 mg/mL agar solution, or a natural diet consisting of diatoms at different feeding frequencies (daily, every other day, or every 2 d) starting at day 5. A 5 Ã— 3 factorial experiment in a completely randomized design tested the effects of various treatments on postlarval settlement and survival after days 15 and 90. ScheffÃ©'s postcomparison test determined differences among treatments means. Postlarval settlement and survival were not significantly different in diets bound with higher agar concentrations and tested in 3 feeding frequencies.

40|$|Settlement {{is a key}} {{life history}} {{transition}} for coral reef fishes, and how long a fish spends close to a reef prior to settlement is poorly understood. We used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and otolith microstructure analysis (<b>daily</b> increments and <b>settlement</b> marks) to determine {{the length of time}} larval fish spend near a reef prior to settlement. The otoliths of Pomacentrus amboinensis collected from four neighbouring reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef showed clear and consistent differences in their elemental signatures prior to and following settlement. Elevated Ba:Ca near settlement and post-settlement was found in fish from all four reefs. However, there was individual variation in elemental profiles, with an increased otolith Ba-to-Ca ratio (near-reef signature) at settlement in 33 % of fish, and up to 8 d prior to settlement in others. Increment widths, often used as a proxy for growth, decreased approaching the settlement mark for all fish, providing further evidence for a "search phase" in larvae. We demonstrated experimentally that otoliths of fish kept in reefal or inter-reefal waters had different elemental chemistry. There were differences in the elemental composition of water samples within the study area, but no consistent trends with distance from reefs. There was poor discrimination of multi-element signatures among fish from different reefs during their pre-settlement phases. However, discrimination improved in the settlement and post-settlement phases of otoliths, indicating that reef waters and perhaps stage of ontogeny affected otolith chemistry. This study demonstrated clear near-reef elemental signatures in fish around settlement. We suggest these differences are due to a combination of water chemistry and physiological influences (e. g., growth). Combining LA-ICP-MS with otolith microstructure analysis can provide high-resolution information on the early life history of reef fishes. Further, a near-reef "search phase" prior to settlement may be common in reef fishes...|$|R
40|$|While {{the aim of}} Ecological Intensification is {{to enable}} the design of more {{sustainable}} and productive agricultural systems, it is not suited to dryland agroecosystems that are driven by non-equilibrium dynamics and intrinsic variability. Instead, a model based on mobility and variability management has been proposed for these agroecosystems. However, this model remains under-applied in southern Morocco where {{there have been few}} studies on the functioning of traditional agroecosystems. This paper focuses on an agroecosystem in the Moroccan Saharan fringe zone that combines agriculture and pastoralism in an acacia parkland. A grounded theory approach was used over a three-year investigation period (i) to highlight how agro-pastoral activities interface with environmental variability, and (ii) to analyze the formal and informal institutions that support these activities. Results show that farmers interface with rainfall variability through (i) an opportunistic agricultural calendar, (ii) a variation of cultivated areas, and (iii) crop diversification. Herders combine macro-mobility (nomads move over long distances to track rainfall) and micro-mobility (nomadic and sedentary herds are driven on a <b>daily</b> basis around <b>settlements)</b> to optimize the exploitation of ecological heterogeneity. During droughts, they also resort to State-subsidized forage supplies. Both cultivation and pastoral activities tend to interface with ecological dynamics and to mimic nature, resulting in a human-modified parkland that could be considered as a 'green agroecosystem'. The sustainability of natural resource use relies on flexible property rights, backed up by a social and cultural norm-based regulation system, that allow crop-livestock integration and landscape collective management. Despite encouraging results, the agroecosystem appears to be threatened by current agricultural policies, rural exodus and the lack of social recognition of nomadism. Nevertheless, because ecosystem mimicry of nature is often considered as a sound agricultural model for drylands, this case study could provide a basis for local development policies, and thus merits further attention from local managers and researchers...|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} the Madrid {{government}} pursued initiatives {{to eliminate the}} shantytowns surrounding the city. One such shantytown settlement, Los Focos, was the largest in Spain, and also composed predominantly of ethnic Romani (of Spanish nationality). During this time, the municipal government, under the conservative Popular Party, set out to initiate plans for the relocation of Los Focos to Cañada Real Galiana, where 100 single-storey houses were to be constructed in immediate proximity to the Madrid garbage incinerator, a dump, and an illegal pig farm. In the opinion of Gonick,In such physical proximity, relocated bodies and the city's refuse would face certain, constant coexistence. The blatant disregard for {{the health and safety}} of this population betrays the state's racialized vision of their urban futures: like sacks of garbage, these residents represented blight on the city, to be discarded out of sight. Such alliances between bodies and filth are of course ancient tropes in the production of spaces of value and inequality (Douglas 1966; McClintock 1995).Negative publicity led to a cancellation of the relocation program, although by that point, residents were already starting to be relocated to Valdemingómez. Currently, Valdemingómez is a low-income yet highly multi-ethnic shantytown. Located south of Highway E-901 and east of Highway M 50, Valdemingómez is named after the waste processing, incineration, and dumping facilities which it is adjacent to, and is a site of extreme social marginalization. An estimated 4,500 trucks a day pass through the main road of the <b>settlement</b> <b>daily</b> en route to the dump and recycling facilities, raising concerns over safety, particularly for children. There are no sidewalks, traffic lights, or pedestrian crossings along the road, and several children have been killed by trucks.|$|R
