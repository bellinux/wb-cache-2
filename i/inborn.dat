5|$|Warning {{coloration}} {{can succeed}} either through <b>inborn</b> behaviour (instinct) {{on the part}} of potential predators, or through a learned avoidance. Either can lead to various forms of mimicry. Experiments show that avoidance is learned in birds, mammals, lizards, and amphibians, but that some birds such as great tits have <b>inborn</b> avoidance of certain colours and patterns such as black and yellow stripes.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme <b>inborn</b> forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|The domesticated cat and {{its closest}} wild {{ancestor}} are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes. About 250 heritable genetic disorders {{have been identified}} in cats, many similar to human <b>inborn</b> errors. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models {{in the study of the}} human diseases.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an <b>inborn</b> tendency towards tameness.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{served in}} the Army during World War I, {{developing}} psychological tests to select airmen for Army aviation. Exposure {{to the war effort}} prompted his interest in international relations and causes of wars. He was an anti-war believer who held psychology should aim to assist humanity's quest to avert future wars. He was optimistic that people and ethnicities, making up nations, could be taught to live in peace, though the races were not equal in <b>inborn</b> mental capacity, a belief he held as scientific. In the later part of his career he wrote books looking at international relations, war, and the differences between races on emotions. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated Greek philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Takahashi began {{a sequel}} to Ginga Legend Weed, {{entitled}} , in issue #2173 of Manga Goraku, released on July 24, 2009. The first collected volume was released by Nihon Bungeisha in November 2009 and last July 2014. The new series follows Weed's offspring: Bellatrix, Rigel, Sirius, and, in particular, Orion. They are all named after astronomical phenomenon: Orion after the Orion constellation, Rigel after the star Rigel, Sirius after the star Sirius, and Bellatrix after the star Bellatrix. Orion bears a close physical resemblance Riki and possesses an <b>inborn</b> strength, but is rude and hot-headed. Rigel shares Orion's fiery personality, while Sirius, who resembles his father, is level-headed and a peace-keeper. Bellatrix, Weed's only daughter, is portrayed as immature and whiny.|$|E
5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be <b>inborn.</b> In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is <b>inborn</b> and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the <b>inborn</b> ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E

25|$|Familial {{types of}} {{disorders}} of fatty acid metabolism are generally classified as <b>inborn</b> errors of lipid metabolism. These disorders may {{be described as}} fatty oxidation disorders or as a lipid storage disorders, and are any one of several <b>inborn</b> errors of metabolism that result from enzyme defects affecting {{the ability of the}} body to oxidize fatty acids in order to produce energy within muscles, liver, and other cell types.|$|E
25|$|Platelet {{conditions}} may be congenital or acquired. Some <b>inborn</b> platelet pathologies are Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome (abnormal glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex), gray platelet syndrome (deficient alpha granules), and delta storage pool deficiency (deficient dense granules). Most are rare conditions. Most <b>inborn</b> platelet pathologies predispose to hemorrhage. Von Willebrand disease {{is due to}} deficiency or abnormal function of von Willebrand factor, and leads to a similar bleeding pattern; its milder forms are relatively common.|$|E

25|$|Metabolic food {{reactions}} {{are due to}} <b>inborn</b> or acquired errors of metabolism of nutrients, such as in diabetes mellitus, lactase deficiency, phenylketonuria and favism.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>inborn</b> {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} {{are caused by}} deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inborn</b> {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} form a large class of genetic diseases involving congenital disorders of metabolism. The majority {{are due to}} defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances (substrates) into others (products). In most of the disorders, problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function, or {{to the effects of}} reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds. <b>Inborn</b> errors of metabolism are now often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic diseases.|$|E
25|$|If {{the person}} has <b>inborn</b> errors in the methyltransfer pathway (cobalamin C disease, {{combined}} methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria), treatment with intravenous, intramuscular hydroxocobalamin or transdermal B12 is needed.|$|E
25|$|Adult polyglucosan body {{disease is}} an orphan disease and a {{glycogen}} storage disorder that {{is caused by}} an <b>inborn</b> error of metabolism, that affects the central and peripheral nervous systems.|$|E

25|$|A {{congenital}} {{metabolic disease}} is {{also referred to as}} an <b>inborn</b> error of metabolism. Most of these are single gene defects, usually heritable. Many affect the structure of body parts but some simply affect the function.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the Akil Laboratory {{is working}} to develop animal models in order to {{understand}} the genetic and developmental basis of differences in temperament and the implications of these <b>inborn</b> differences for vulnerability to anxiety, depression and substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study in}} British Columbia, the overall {{incidence}} of the <b>inborn</b> errors of metabolism were estimated to be 40 per 100,000 live births or 1 in 1,400 births, overall representing more than approximately 15% of single gene disorders in the population.|$|E
25|$|Heaven bids and impels {{humans to}} realise their true self. Humans have the <b>inborn</b> {{ability to respond}} to Heaven. One can obtain {{knowledge}} of divinity through his inner experience (tizhi) or knowledge of/as virtue, a central concept of Tu's theology that {{is at the same time}} intellectual and affectional (a question of mind and heart).|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{disorders}} {{in either the}} mother or the child can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Two examples are diabetes mellitus (a multifactorial disorder) and phenylketonuria (an <b>inborn</b> error of metabolism). Many such inherited diseases may directly affect the child's metabolism and neural development but less commonly they can indirectly affect the child during gestation. (See also teratology).|$|E
25|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an <b>inborn</b> {{error of}} {{metabolism}} {{that results in}} decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} Reye {{syndrome}} is unknown. It usually begins shortly after recovery from a viral infection, such as influenza or chickenpox. About 90% of cases {{are associated with}} aspirin (salicylate) use in children. <b>Inborn</b> errors of metabolism are also a risk factor. Changes on blood tests may include a high blood ammonia level, low blood sugar level, and prolonged prothrombin time. Often the liver is enlarged.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that degrades the {{serine protease}}s: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased {{by the presence}} of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (<b>inborn</b> or acquired, e.g., in proteinuria) leads to thrombophilia.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the {{individuals}} described posthumously as orthomolecularists are Max Gerson, who developed {{a diet that}} he claimed could treat diseases, which the American Medical Association's 1949 Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry found ineffective; and the Shute brothers, who attempted to treat heart disease with vitamin E. Several concepts now cited by orthomolecularists, including individual biochemical variation and <b>inborn</b> errors of metabolism, debuted in scientific papers early in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Vigabatrin is {{also used}} to treat {{seizures}} in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), which is an <b>inborn</b> GABA metabolism defect that causes intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, speech disturbance, and ataxia through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Vigabatrin helps lower GHB levels through GABA transaminase inhibition. However, this is in the brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA transaminase, so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{efforts were}} {{undertaken}} to diversify and extend its applications in radiation protection, radiation therapy, and medical imaging, one cannot overcome its <b>inborn</b> limitation. The representation of internal organs in this mathematical phantom was crude, by capturing {{only the most}} general description of the position and geometry of each organ. With the powerful computer and tomographic imaging technologies became available in the late 1980s, the history launched {{a new era of}} voxel phantoms.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{as to whether}} childhood gender stereotypes are <b>inborn</b> or are influenced by environmental factors. The presence of homosexual or heterosexual relationships in families influences play patterns in children: children of same-sex couples are raised differently, resulting in gender roles {{different from those of}} opposite-sex parents, according to the gender binary. A study by Goldberg, Kashy and Smith shows that sons of lesbian mothers play in a less-masculine way than sons of homosexual fathers or of heterosexual parents.|$|E
