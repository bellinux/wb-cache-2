5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
25|$|Décolletage is {{the upper}} part of a woman's torso, between <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> neck, {{comprising}} her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.|$|E
25|$|The video {{starts off}} with some grass sinking {{down into the}} dirt, causing it to turn wet. It then cuts to a {{scorpion}} walking to where Linkin Park are performing. It explores the many ironies of humanity and its ill-effects on {{the earth and the}} environment (see above). It juxtaposes various pieces of footage: a large, well-fed man eating fast food, a woman measuring <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> a man who is so malnourished that his ribcage is visible through his skin; African Americans being hosed down by the Ku Klux Klan; nuclear explosions, the World Trade Center collapsing {{as a result of the}} September 11 attacks, children waving American flags (one of the children being Brad Delson), a Middle Eastern child holding an AK-47, clips of oil tankers torn in half and birds covered in an oil slick. The video ends with the same grass at the beginning growing out of the dirt, causing it to dry up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary, dear," [...] {{said her}} aunt, putting her little arm round <b>her</b> niece's <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> {{embracing}} <b>her,</b> [...] "don't {{fall in love}} with Walter." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} on the Born This Way Ball and [...] tours; in the latter she dressed up in a polka-dotted rubber outfit with tentacles growing out around <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> her head. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described her look as [...] "she had an inflatable rubber order of fried calamari growing out of her spine", while Adam Carlson from Billboard said that the outfit made Gaga look like a [...] "dancing Ursula from The Little Mermaid". In 2017, the song was added to the setlist of the Joanne World Tour. The performance ends with a choreographed attack on Gaga by her dancers.|$|E
500|$|During {{the murder}} trial, Bryant testified that Till grabbed her hand {{while she was}} {{stocking}} candy and said, [...] "How about a date, baby?" [...] She said that after she freed herself from his grasp, the young man followed her to the cash register, grabbed <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "What's the matter baby, can't you take it?" [...] Bryant said she freed herself, and Till said, [...] "You needn't be afraid of me, baby," [...] used [...] "one 'unprintable' word" [...] and said [...] "I've been with white women before." [...] Bryant also alleged that one of Till's companions came into the store, {{grabbed him by the}} arm, and ordered him to leave. According to historian Timothy Tyson, Bryant admitted to him in a 2008 interview that her testimony during the trial that Till had made verbal and physical advances was false.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2013, Gomez {{unexpectedly}} uploaded a {{music video}} for [...] "Birthday" [...] to her official YouTube channel {{to coincide with}} her 21st birthday. Gomez left a short message, saying [...] "I wanted to celebrate my 21st Birthday with all of you, so we made this video for us all to celebrate together. Thank You for all the love and support you have shown and continue to show me. I love you all so much!!" [...] In the video, a [...] "smiley" [...] Gomez is seen in a black crop top and shorts with a flannel shirt around <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> is shown singing the song with her friends in a dark room. The video is also interspersed with clips of a party in an underground night club, as glitter falls from the ceiling. The video ends with Gomez's friends singing [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] to her. Within the first 24 hours of being released, the video had garnered over a million views.|$|E

6000|$|He clasped {{the white}} hand {{that had been}} laid within his, put his arm round <b>her</b> slender <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> drawing <b>her</b> fondly to his bosom--"This night at least," [...] said he, [...] "we'll pass at Terracina." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Beating--his--wife! How ghastly!' {{said the}} Bride. 'Fancy YOUR beating ME!' She slipped an arm round <b>her</b> husband's <b>waist,</b> <b>and,</b> leaning <b>her</b> {{head against his}} shoulder, looked out across the cloud-filled valley in deep content and security.|$|R
500|$|On April 21, 1913, Phagan {{was laid}} off due to a {{shortage}} of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, {{she went to the}} factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.|$|E
500|$|Keable {{remained}} in Tahiti, his health worsening. He suffered weight loss, diabetes, {{high blood pressure}} and fever, all stemming from a kidney illness. Nonetheless, he completed the novel Numerous Treasure, which he had begun before Buck's death; the bittersweet tale of a Polynesian woman who shared her name with a cocktail and a brand of cigarettes was a commercial success, and has been considered a valuable portrait of early-century Tahitian life. His health and spirits rallied in the years after Buck's death: he completed a travel book, Tahiti, Isle of Dreams, and a book tour of the United States and Europe. On returning to Tahiti he struck up a relationship with a mixed-race islander named Ina, and made many new friends including the writers Alec Waugh (elder brother of Evelyn), who had been inspired to visit Tahiti by Numerous Treasure, Zane Grey, and James Norman Hall. Waugh described the Keable of this period [...] "reclined among cushions, clad only in a pareo, while his Tahitian princess, bare-shouldered and bare-footed, her black hair falling to <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> a white flower behind her ear, glided negligently about the house" [...] – and yet noted that, on suggesting a cup of tea, Keable's voice still took on [...] "the parsonical intonation with which fifteen years earlier he had summoned the parish children to a Sunday school treat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{medieval times}} {{until the early}} 18th century, ducking was a way used to {{establish}} whether a suspect was a witch. The ducking stools were first {{used for this purpose}} but ducking was later inflicted without the chair. In this instance the victim's right thumb was bound to her left big toe. A rope was attached to <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> the [...] "witch" [...] was thrown into a river or deep pond. If the [...] "witch" [...] floated it was deemed that she was in league with the devil, rejecting the [...] "baptismal water". If the [...] "witch" [...] sank she was deemed innocent.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; {{that would}} be nonsense. And the chances are, you know, {{that you would be}} at Jericho with her. Dear, dear Clary,--you know I love you." [...] Then he put his right arm round <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> pipe <b>and</b> all, and kissed her.|$|R
60|$|And {{without more}} ado, despite her screams and her struggles, he seized Maria round <b>her</b> ample <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> round <b>her</b> {{struggling}} knees {{at the moment}} that she was stepping out of the sledge in the wake of her mistress.|$|R
2500|$|In 1858, Bernadette Soubirous {{reported}} {{a vision of}} Our Lady of Lourdes. A simple 14-year-old peasant girl of no significant educational experience, Soubirous claimed she saw uo petito damizelo, [...] "a small maiden," [...] in white, with a golden rosary and blue belt fastened around <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> two golden roses at her feet. In subsequent visitations she heard the lady speak to her, saying Que soy era Immaculada Concepciou (I am the Immaculate Conception), and asking that a chapel be built there. At first ridiculed, questioned, and belittled by Church officials and other contemporaries, Soubirous insisted on her vision. Eventually the Church believed {{her and she was}} canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933.|$|E
2500|$|Consuelo Vanderbilt {{was largely}} {{dominated}} by her mother, who {{was determined that}} her daughter {{would make a great}} marriage like that of her famous namesake. In her autobiography, Consuelo Vanderbilt described how she was required to wear a steel rod, which ran down her spine and fastened around <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> over her shoulders, to improve her posture. She was educated entirely at home by governesses and tutors and learned foreign languages at an early age. Her mother was a strict disciplinarian and whipped her with a riding crop for minor infractions. When, as a teenager, Consuelo objected to the clothing her mother had selected for her, Alva told her that [...] "I do the thinking, you do as you are told." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the ninth}} season finale, [...] "Till Death Do Us Part", a bomb is planted by {{domestic}} terrorist Harper Dearing. Tony and Ziva, feeling bad about missing Jimmy and Breena's wedding, try to cheer {{each other up}} by joking about how awful weddings are—an exchange that begins to take on meaning when they become wistful about [...] "the vow, the ring, the kiss, the ketubah..." [...] and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they {{are still in the}} elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's arm around <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> their free hands clasped tightly as the elevator appears to crash.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she remembered}} that she had still to {{complete}} her equipment as a Pinzochera. The large leather purse or scarsella, with small coin in it, had to be hung on the cord at <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> (<b>her</b> florins <b>and</b> small jewels, presents from her godfather and cousin Brigida, were safely fastened within her serge mantle)--and {{on the other side}} must hang the rosary.|$|R
60|$|Anne caught Charlotta the Fourth by <b>her</b> own plump <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> danced <b>her</b> {{around the}} kitchen until they were both out of breath.|$|R
6000|$|One, was Olympias: the {{floating}} snake [...] Rolled round her ancles, round <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> [...] Knotted, <b>and</b> folded once about her neck, [...] Her perfect lips to taste.|$|R
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke into her ear, {{put his arms around}} <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that sent him to the ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
60|$|She {{attempted}} to rise, but he passed his hand round <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> detained her.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he put his}} arm proudly round <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> looked at her with admiring eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The very thing, Christine. You are a darling!" [...] Ralph exclaimed, {{catching}} <b>her</b> by the <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> kissing <b>her,</b> {{before she}} {{had time to think}} of resistance.|$|R
60|$|Down Twenty-third street she glided swiftly, {{looking to}} neither side; no more flirtatious than the bronze Diana above the Garden. Her fine {{brown hair was}} neatly braided; <b>her</b> neat <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtues--taste and economy. Ten yards behind {{followed}} the smitten Man from Nome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing much." [...] Before {{he would}} go on, Father put his arm about <b>her</b> ample <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> led <b>her</b> to the new porch-swing {{overlooking}} the raw spaded patch of earth {{that would be a}} rose-garden some day--that already, to their imaginations, was brilliant with blossoms and alive with birds.|$|R
60|$|At that shrewd remark, Thirza put {{her hand}} on the hand which still clasped <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> pressed it closer.|$|E
60|$|Her full heart {{broke into}} tears again. He {{put his arm}} about <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> they walked by the river-side together.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} {{standing}} with his arm round <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> {{he did not like}} to mention the name of Madame Goesler.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, let's have at it again," [...] {{cried the}} Beetle, seizing <b>her</b> round the <b>waist,</b> <b>and</b> blundering on {{again in a}} furious gallop of his own invention.|$|R
6000|$|How {{strong and}} supple she looked! and how {{becoming}} <b>her</b> silk <b>waist</b> <b>and</b> straw hat! She could drive, too. Some way she seemed quite {{another sort of}} person here in her own land and in her own carriage. She {{was so much more}} composed. [...] "She has imagination," [...] he repeated to himself.|$|R
60|$|But Suzanne had {{not come}} yet, and Marguerite being dressed, {{prepared}} to go downstairs.
