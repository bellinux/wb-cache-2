[...] All Isle of Man Railway locomotives were supplied with brass chimney numerals, whilst the ex-MNR engines received them following the 1905 merger.

[...] These boilers were fitted to Nos. 5, 10, and 12, which lost their chimney numerals as a result.

50|$|Introduced in the UK in 1980 as the J1 version, their {{styling and}} spec {{was aimed at}} the sports touring market and as a {{competition}} against the Honda CB400/4 and CB550/4 series of successful UJM (universal Japanese motorcycle) middleweights.The 400 was almost the same in specs as the Z500 model but differed in {{that it had a}} rear drum brake instead of a disc.The J2 was fitted with air assisted forks, adjustable damping rear twin shocks, tubeless tyres in cast 7 spoke wheels, <b>grab</b> <b>rail</b> and different tank/seat cowl striping The J3 version was offered was Megaphone shortie silencers and chromed tops on the twin shocks.

5000|$|Honda {{released}} this motorcycle {{to compete with}} the Bajaj Pulsar and the TVS Apache. Changes included alloy wheels, powder coated engine with a polished head, electric starter, new graphics, clear lens indicator lamps, a trip meter, and a slightly smaller rear <b>grab</b> <b>rail.</b> Few performance changes included minor changes in the cylinder head, overhead valve, ignition remap and a rear sprocket increase of one tooth, which resulted in increased acceleration at the expense of reduced top speed.The airfilter was changed from a dry paper to oil coated to better suit dusty conditions and a new airflow screw in carburetor. A limited Moto GP [...] "Unicorn Grand Prix" [...] edition had the guise of a Repsol Honda RC211V. [...] HMSI sold 720,000 Unicorns in 2007.

5000|$|The 2001 US F4i {{had a new}} {{subframe}} {{which raises}} the seat by five millimeters allows for more storage room and improved two-tier seat. The new tail unit has less padding and a higher perch for the passenger. The F4i's tail-light is smaller with a new dual-bulb configuration. The F4i had a new dash layout with a large analog tachometer. The new LCD digital display had a speedometer, odometer, clock, engine temperature read-out, amber shift light, and trip meters.The single largest change aside from the styling is the addition of high-pressure (50 psi). [...] programmed fuel injection — thus the model designation [...] "F4i". In a number of countries, the bike was sold in both the [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "Sport" [...] variants, the Sport having a two-part seat, no <b>grab</b> <b>rail</b> and no main stand (though the main stand mounting holes remained). Fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range, while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions. The injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38 mm throttle bodies. Each injector has four nozzles, and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the F4.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{fail-safe}} systems is the overflow tube in baths and kitchen sinks. If the valve sticks open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow.

If the cable breaks, the brakes <b>grab</b> <b>rails,</b> and the elevator cabin does not fall.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{the extent to}} which homes and neighbourhoods of older community-dwelling people are ‘supportive’. Method: Cross-sectional survey, in-home observation and interviews involving 202 participants (75 – 79 years). Measures included SF- 36 health-related quality of life and Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) scores, and self-reported home usability, access, safety and neighbourhood. Associations between home and neighbourhood characteristics were assessed using c 2 -tests, t-tests and Pearson correlations. Results: Older people rated neighbourhood satisfaction highly (3. 0 men, 3. 2 women; 4 being the highest score). Many homes failed objective adaptability and safety ratings, particularly bathrooms (80 % did not have a shower <b>grab</b> <b>rail,</b> 77 % did not have non-slip floors); 27 % of homes scored ≥ 8 of 25 possible hazards. There were significant correlations between perceptions of housing and neighbourhood and SF- 36 and disability scores. Conclusion: Many homes and neighbourhoods may not accommodate increased frailty or disability of older people into the future...|$|E

30|$|Removing {{the central}} {{handrail}} and adding more <b>grab</b> <b>rails</b> at head height increases space without compromising passenger comfort. An {{addition to the}} design would be to add portable shelving to {{the part of the}} carriage between the doors and pivoting bogie.

This shelving would be used for smaller, individual packages that would not be transported using the cargo boxes.|$|R
50|$|Motor functioning: In a 2002 {{study by}} Min Soo Kang, it was {{reported}} that of the elder population in America, 18% will have a disability.

25|$|Part of the {{franchise}} agreement required replacement of older rolling stock with newer models, and refurbishment of the existing rolling stock.

50|$|A {{much less}} {{common form of}} foot braking is frog braking. This is where the rider <b>grabs</b> <b>rail</b> {{on both sides of}} the board and then stomps a foot down while crouched.
