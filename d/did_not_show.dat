5|$|The 827th was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} sent to the Pacific theater, but in February, 1944, it was declared insufficiently trained and held back for further preparation; a different unit was substituted at the last minute. The next six months <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> great improvement in quality, but nonetheless the battalion was eventually sent overseas. It arrived in Marseille in late 1944, deploying to the front in December, attached to the 12th Armored Division.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer than a century. Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source. The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor was a white dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} by the army {{inspector}} general, Francisco Vargas, Donayre requested 80,000 gallons of fuel without clear justification when he was commander of the Southern Military Region, between January and September 2006, and diverted part of it to army headquarters in Lima. This led to an investigation by the anti-corruption prosecutor, Marlene Berrú, but, despite being summoned six times, Donayre <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> up at her office. He finally attended her request on November 25, 2008; in his testimony he denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the Southern Military Region actually received less fuel under his command than in the previous year.|$|E

Most of the teams in the tournament had not teamed up {{on a regular basis}} prior to the show, except for Los Nuevo Infernales. In the end, the team of El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr., who was paired up for the tournament, defeated Alan Stone, Super Crazy, and Zumbido to win the titles.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters {{and worked as}} a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, he had moved back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In January 2005, police charged Taylor with misdemeanor child abuse for allegedly leaving four of his children (ages from 2 to 11) alone for more than eight hours. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> up for his court date, and at one point there were four outstanding warrants for his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> in New York again until 1959.|$|E

5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} April 1917 Hawks {{was working}} on Cecil B. DeMille's The Little American. (On this film he met and befriended the then 18-year-old slate boy James Wong Howe, who was {{to become one of}} Hollywood's most {{significant}} cinematographers.) Hawks then worked on the Mary Pickford film The Little Princess, directed by Marshall Neilan. According to Hawks, Neilan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> up to work one day, so the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green.

Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>show</b> through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
