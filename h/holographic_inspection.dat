40|$|Holographic imaging {{has been}} {{successfully}} used to detect bubbles in the face rubber and debonds between the rubber and metal on the face and sides of the head mass and shroud of sonar transducers. 1 - 3 This work was done using <b>holographic</b> <b>inspection</b> equipment and techniques applied in the rubber tire industry. A considerable amount of baseline data exists for tires from which a determination {{of the seriousness of}} an observed defect can be made, but this is not yet the case for transducers. The relationship between the appearance of a holographic image and the impact of the indicated defect on the reliability and lifetime of the transducer is unknown. The basic questions are: How do debonds affect transducer lifetime? How should the fringe pattern of the holographic image be interpreted? What does the fringe pattern reveal {{about the size of the}} actual defect...|$|E
40|$|Defect {{inspection}} metrology is {{an integral}} part of the yield ramp and process monitoring phases of semiconductor manufacturing. High aspect ratio structures have been identified in the ITRS as critical structures where there are no known manufacturable solutions for defect detection. We present case studies of a new inspection technology based on digital holography that addresses this need. Digital holography records the amplitude and phase of the wavefront from the target object directly to a single image acquired by a CCD camera. Using deep ultraviolet laser illumination, digital holography is capable of resolving phase differences corresponding to height differences as small as several nanometers. Thus, the technology is well suited to the task of finding defects on semiconductor wafers. We present a study of several defect detection benchmark wafers, and compare the results of digital <b>holographic</b> <b>inspection</b> to other wafer inspection technologies. Specifically, digital holography allows improved defect detection on high aspect ratio features, such as improperly etched contacts. In addition, the phase information provided by digital holography allows us to visualize the topology of defects, and even generate three-dimensional images of the wafer surface comparable to scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. These results demonstrate the unique defect detection capabilities of digital holography...|$|E
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of holographic NDE to detect unbonded and de-laminated defects within bonded, laminated and composite structures {{has been previously}} demonstrated [1]. However, this NDE method has historically not been as readily accepted by industry as other NDE methods. This was primarily due to the relatively long time and high cost required per part inspected and {{the high level of}} expertise required of the operator. A holographic NDE method was developed [2, 3] that significantly reduces the inspection time and the required level of operator expertise making this method both practical and cost effective for production applications. Recently, an electronic imaging system [4, 5] has been incorporated to replace the photographic film process used previously. With this latest improvement, the current holographic NDE system offers several benefits over other NDE methods. Holography provides a large field of view which permits an area up to several square feet to be inspected with one hologram. The inspection rate is also extremely fast. Since the electronic system operates at 30 frames per second, the easily interpreted inspection results are viewed in real time. The method can detect “touching” unbonds and delaminations since, as will be discussed later, the bond line(s) are stressed as part of the inspection procedure. With the electronic imaging, a <b>holographic</b> <b>inspection</b> may be performed with very little involvement of an operator who may possess little actual knowledge of holography...|$|E

40|$|Digital Holography (DH) {{numerical}} {{procedures have}} been developed to allow imaging through turbid media. A fluid is considered turbid when dispersed particles provoke strong light scattering, thus destroying the image formation by any standard optical system. Here we show that sharp amplitude imaging and phase-contrast mapping of object hidden behind turbid medium and/or occluding objects are possible in harsh noise conditions and with a large field-of view by Multi-Look DH microscopy. In particular, it will be shown that both amplitude imaging and phase-contrast mapping of cells hidden behind a flow of Red Blood Cells can be obtained. This allows, in a noninvasive way, the quantitative evaluation of living processes in Lab on Chip platforms where conventional microscopy techniques fail. The combination of this technique with endoscopic imaging can pave the way for the <b>holographic</b> blood vessel <b>inspection,</b> e. g. to look for settled cholesterol plaques as well as blood clots for a rapid diagnostics of blood diseases...|$|R
40|$|For many {{aspheric}} and freeform optical components, existing interferometric solutions {{require a}} custom computer-generated hologram (CGH) {{to characterize the}} part. The overall objective {{of this research is}} to develop hardware and a procedure to produce a combined, dynamic, Hartmann/ Digital <b>Holographic</b> interferometry <b>inspection</b> system {{for a wide range of}} advanced optical components, including aspheric and freeform optics. This new instrument would have greater versatility and dynamic range than currently available measurement systems. The method uses a spatial light modulator to pre-condition wavefronts for imaging, interferometry, and data processing to improve the resolution and versatility of an optical inspection instrument. Existing interferometers and Hartmann inspection systems have either too small a dynamic range or insufficient resolution to characterize conveniently unusual optical surfaces like aspherical and freeform optics. For interferometers, a specially produced, computer-generated holographic optical element is needed to transform the wavefront to within the range of the interferometer. A new hybrid wavefront sensor employs newly available spatial light modulators (SLMs) as programmable holographic optical elements (HOEs). The HOE is programmed to enable the same instrument to inspect an optical element in stages, first by a Hartmann measurement, which has a very large dynamic range but less resolution. The first measurement provides the information required to precondition a reference wave that avails the measurement process to the more precise phase shifting interferometry. The SLM preconditions a wavefront before it is used to inspect an optical component. This adds important features to an optical inspection system, enabling not just wavefront conditioning for null testing and dynamic range extension, but also the creation of hybrid measurement procedures. This, for example, allows the combination of dynamic digital holography and Hartmann sensing procedures to cover a virtually unlimited dynamic range with high resolution. Digital holography technology brings all of the power and benefits of digital holographic interferometry to the requirement, while Hartmann-type wavefront sensors bring deflectometry technologies to the solution. The SLM can be used to generate arbitrary wavefronts in one leg of the interferometer, thereby greatly simplifying its use and extending its range. The SLM can also be used to modify the system into a dynamic Shack-Hartmann system, which is useful for optical components with large amounts of slope. By integrating these capabilities into a single instrument, the system will have tremendous flexibility to measure a variety of optical shapes accurately...|$|R
