40|$|Motives {{and forms}} of travelling, Fraňková Soňa The author's work {{analyzes}} three basic motives that lead to travel and subsequently introduces in more detail travel's four institutionalized forms and how these forms are realized. The three basic motives discussed by the author include; <b>escape,</b> <b>instruction,</b> and necessity. In addition, the forms are introduced as ways to implement these themes. The first distinctive modes of travel is described as pilgriming and trips for sacredness. The second form is romantic meandering which is the conscious act of leaving one's home in Romantic times. The third form discussed is wandering which through one realizes <b>escape,</b> <b>instruction,</b> and necessity. Finally, the last option is hiking. All these forms are presented in terms of theirhistorical development and specifics that are inherent within. An {{integral part of the}} work is also the comparison of these forms with an emphasis on their interaction...|$|E
5000|$|One {{reportedly}} coded Underground Railroad song is [...] "Follow the Drinkin' Gourd". [...] The song's {{title is}} said {{to refer to the}} star formation (an asterism) known in America as the Big Dipper and in Europe as The Plough. The pointer stars of the Big Dipper align with the North Star. In this song the repeated line [...] "Follow the Drinkin' Gourd" [...] is thus often interpreted as <b>instructions</b> to <b>escaping</b> slaves to travel north by following the North Star, leading them to the northern states, Canada, and freedom: The song ostensibly encodes <b>escape</b> <b>instructions</b> and a map from Mobile, Alabama up the Tombigbee River, over the divide to the Tennessee River, then downriver to where the Tennessee and Ohio rivers meet in Paducah, Kentucky.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relation}} between the presence versus the absence of sleep deprivation or allergy symptoms and the rate and function of problem behavior. Three students whose problem behavior was negatively reinforced by <b>escape</b> form <b>instruction</b> were studied across several weeks using analogue functional analyses. Our results indicated that the extraexperimental events were associated with (a) termination of instruction functioning as a negative reinforcer, (b) increased rates of negatively reinforced problem behavior, or (c) increased rates of problem behavior across all conditions...|$|R
50|$|Separating {{the control}} signals, also {{referred}} to as the control plane, from the data, if a bit-transparent connection is desired, is usually done by <b>escaping</b> the control <b>instructions.</b> Occasionally, however, networks are designed so that data is, to a varying degree, garbled by the signaling. Allowing data to become garbled is usually acceptable when transmitting sounds between humans, since the users rarely notice the slight degradation, but this leads to problems when sending data that has very low error tolerance, such as information transmitted using a modem.|$|R
40|$|Problem behavior, such as off 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash task behavior, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} cited challenges competing with school readiness skills for young children with disabilities. This study demonstrated how a functional behavior assessment can be conducted in a school setting to determine the functional relation between off 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash task behavior and academic engagement stimuli for three kindergarten students at 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash risk of academic failure. Indirect and descriptive behavior assessments were first conducted to determine the hypothesized function of off 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash task behavior. Two experimental functional analysis conditions were then constructed to confirm the hypothesized function. Results demonstrated that when preferred academic engagement stimuli were used during <b>instruction,</b> <b>escape</b> 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash maintained off 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash task behavior decreased substantially. Therefore, the use of preferred stimuli as an instructional support may have abolished the value of escape as reinforcement for off 2 ̆ 6 ndash - 2 ̆ 6 ndash task behavior. Implications for practice and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{ethnography}} of Chinese popular fiction readership which presents an integrated exploration of contemporary readers' tastes {{and patterns of}} reading behaviour. However, {{in order to understand}} the genres and particular texts that contemporary readers designate as "popular," especially within the context of Chinese popular culture which has long been the site of an active exchange between written and oral traditions, it is necessary to examine the historical audiences and generic antecedents, the traditions of texts and contexts, that provide modern readers with reference points of continuity and change within the larger landscape of Chinese popular literature. [...] To this end, this study suggests that reading patterns, like other kinds of expressive behaviour in everyday life, can be thought of in terms of repertoires of aesthetic discrimination which may have inactive as well as active dimensions. The inactive facets of a reader's repertoire, it is argued, may still exert important influences on the shaping and articulation of preferences and associations. [...] Related to issues of methodological design, including the use of printed and electronic Chinese and English language questionnaires, face-to-face interviews and e-mail correspondence, the readership sample is comprised primarily of men and women who have achieved or are pursuing some level of post-secondary or postgraduate education. Trends in readers' affinities and/or aversions to particular genres, as well as their uses of fiction - whether they read for <b>escape</b> or <b>instruction,</b> for example - are considered, as are such concepts as fan culture, reader identification with characters or other aspects of the narrative and the phenomenon of addictive reading styles. This pattern of consumption is explored with particular reference to Chinese martial arts fiction, which as a genre is given the most detailed treatment, followed by romance and detective fiction. In addition to readers' conceptions of the process of reading itself and their perceptions of the various traditions which inform their favourite contemporary novels, this work also looks at the importance of conversation in readers' experiences, as well as some of the interactions between gender and genre, especially with regard to the intentional transgression and renegotiation of the boundaries of traditionally "masculine" or "feminine" fiction...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{based upon}} my master’s thesis, I {{argue that the}} {{traditional}} image of the romance genre as formulaic hence literary worthless consistently underestimates {{the complexity of the}} aesthetic strategies used in this genre. This is indicated by the analysis of six handbooks for writing romance novels; this romance community internal corpus provides an explicit articulation of the genre’s otherwise implicitly held literary norms and values. Using a ‘functional-normative’ perspective I focus on the question whether the proposed norm – the advice in the handbooks – is functional; i. e. whether it contributes effectively to the fulfilling of the generic functions, which are <b>escape,</b> relaxation and <b>instruction</b> (Radway, 1984). 	Detailed study of this corpus ultimately reveals the existence of a constant tension in the community’s aesthetic strategies between a need for recognizable generic features (the romance ‘formula’) and, within this generic frame, an outspoken appreciation of such ‘high culture’ literary values as novelty, creativity and originality. The handbooks use the concept of an author’s personal ‘voice’ to refer to this idiosyncratic, original, non-formulaic aspect of each romance. ‘Voice’ refers to the combination of all the elements which make one’s writing unique and personal. The importance of voice in the reception of romance novels gives rise to its significance on an institutional level. This indicates that the aesthetic strategies of the whole romance community are based on a constant interaction of opposing values, an intrinsic complexity not reflected in the traditional and widespread image of the genre. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens in}} 44 BC, {{just after the}} {{assassination}} of Julius Caesar, and {{tells the story of}} the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra (Fleming) and her relationship with the Roman general Mark Anthony (Burr) from that time until their mutual suicide in 30 BC. It also stars William Lundigan as Lucilius and Michael Fox as Octavius. Lucilius, having previously accompanied Julius Caesar to Egypt and having been a close witness to Caesar's romance with Cleopatra, believes that Cleopatra is a woman highly skilled in besotting men to promote her own agenda, in this case to bind Mark Anthony to her desire to become queen of Rome and to make her son by Caesar the eventual ruler of the Roman Empire. In the meantime, as Lucilius becomes aware, Cleopatra is beguiling Anthony with continuous showings of feasting and luxury while the vast population of Egypt is suffering in hunger and poverty. When Lucilius reveals his concerns to Cleopatra, she makes an unsuccessful attempt to seduce him, in order to win him to her side. Cleopatra persuades Anthony that all this disaffection is the work of her younger half-sister, Arsinoe, and Lucilius is sent on an expedition against her in which she is (unhistorically) killed. Lucilius returns from this trip wounded by Cleopatra's own soldiers and even more distrustful of her, and is confined to his apartments as an honored prisoner, while Anthony continues to have his judgment clouded with constant feasting and drinking (and, although this is not mentioned, some sort of physical contact with Cleopatra's person). But Anthony dimly realizes that he has failed in his duties to Rome, most specifically in his role as a member of the ruling triumvirate, and that Cleopatra is scheming to use him to conquer Rome to make himself king and herself queen and Caesar's son the next absolute ruler of Rome, but he knows that Romans will never accept such a development; so he enables Lucilius to <b>escape,</b> with <b>instructions</b> to return to Rome and warn Octavius of what is happening in Egypt. (Unlike the Elizabeth Taylor version, this Cleopatra is not madly in love with Anthony, but is merely using him as a stepping stone). Soon enough Octavius brings Roman armies to Egypt to subdue this incipient mutiny. In this movie it would appear that a conscience-stricken Anthony stays in Cleopatra's palace, refusing to lead an Egyptian army against his beloved Rome. As Octavius closes in, Anthony stabs himself, Lucilius breaches the palace gates in time to bring a dying Anthony to Cleopatra's chamber, and Cleopatra, in despair of the complete frustration of her ambitions, uses a snake to kill herself. This brings the movie to its end before we see Cleopatra die.|$|R
5000|$|For the Great Escape {{operation}} Cochran {{was one of}} {{the primary}} tunnellers and that factor coupled with his command of the German language gained him the favourable position No.16 in the line of the two hundred men hoping to escape through the tunnel. As such he {{was one of the}} 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24-25 March 1944, in the escape now famous as [...] "the Great Escape". When the Germans discovered the escape they began extensive well planned manhunts. Disguised in a uniform stained to resemble those of the displaced persons on forced labour duties all across Germany Cochran was positively sighted sweeping streets in Frankfurt am Main before travelling alone to Freiburg and then south only to be recaptured at Lörrach in distant southern German right on top of the French and Swiss frontiers. Literally only needing to cross the river to Basel in neutral Switzerland he was hand-cuffed and taken to a local police station. He was not promptly returned to Luftwaffe custody to be sent back to prison camp as was the established practice but instead he was taken by his captors to Karlsruhe Kriminalpolizei prison under the control of Oberregierungsrat Josef Gmeiner head of the Karlsruhe Gestapo. Gmeiner deputised Krimminalkommissar Walter Herberg to take Cochran out into the countryside and supervise junior ranking Gestapo agents Heinrich Boschert and Otto Preiss who would execute him there with the official story that Cochran was attempting to <b>escape</b> again. The <b>instruction</b> was to take Cochran's body to the nearby Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp high in the Vosges mountains where he was to be cremated in the camp crematorium.The following morning, 31 March 1944 in a soft-topped official sedan, they collected Cochran but the driver drove directly through Strasbourg to Natzweiler in error and they had to leave the camp and stop in a wooded area nearby supposedly for a break before their journey. Cochran was promptly shot dead and his body taken to the camp for cremation.He was one of the 50 escapers executed and murdered by the Gestapo. Originally cremated and buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery.|$|R
