5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{extends from}} parts of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire in the west, to Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen in the east, and the rather smaller North Wales Coalfield {{underlies}} parts of Flintshire and Denbighshire. Vast quantities of coal were mined in Wales during the Industrial Revolution and the earlier {{part of the}} twentieth century, after which coal stocks dwindled and the remaining pits became uneconomical as foreign coal became available at low prices. The last <b>deep</b> <b>pit</b> in Wales closed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a <b>deep</b> <b>pit.</b> In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Two teeth, one {{complete}} and one damaged, form the known material of the gondwanathere Lavanify, first described in 1997. The teeth are high-crowned and curved; one contains a deep cementum-filled furrow {{and the other}} at least one <b>deep</b> <b>pit</b> (infundibulum). Lavanify appears to be most {{closely related to the}} Indian gondwanathere Bharattherium and more distantly to the other gondwanatheres, which are known from Argentina. Two other teeth, not yet fully described, may represent different tooth positions of another gondwanathere. One, a fragmentary molariform (molar or molar-like premolar—the identities of gondwanathere tooth are poorly understood) is larger and lower-crowned than the Lavanify teeth and the other, which is {{complete and}} unworn, is yet lower-crowned and has the surface obliquely oriented. Its crown consists of a W-shaped ridge with the parts separated by deep infundibula. This second tooth may also represent a completely different, yet unknown mammalian group.|$|E

5|$|The molars are {{slightly}} more high-crowned (hypsodont) {{than in most}} oryzomyines, {{and many of the}} accessory crests are reduced, but they are sharply distinct from the highly derived, hypsodont molars of Holochilus. The main cusps are located opposite each other and have rounded edges. The enamel folds do not extend past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an accessory crest on the upper molars that is usually well-developed in oryzomyines, is present but short on the first and second upper molar; it is much more reduced in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys. The corresponding structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is present on the first and second molars in Lundomys, but absent in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys. Another accessory crest, the anteroloph, is present, though small, on the first upper molar in Lundomys, but entirely absent in both other genera. As in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the anterior cusp on the first lower molar, the anteroconid, contains a <b>deep</b> <b>pit.</b> Each of the three upper molars has three roots; unlike in both Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, the first upper molar lacks an accessory fourth root. The first lower molar has four roots, including two small accessory roots located between larger anterior and posterior roots. The second molar has either two or three roots, with the anterior root split into two smaller roots in some specimens.|$|E
25|$|The coal {{industry}} steadily declined after 1945. By the early 1990s {{there was only}} one <b>deep</b> <b>pit</b> still working in Wales. There was a similar catastrophic decline in the steel industry (the steel crisis), and the Welsh economy, like that of other developed societies, became increasingly based on the expanding service sector.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} pits in carbon steel exposed to dilute (0. 055 M nitrate-bearing) {{alkaline}} salt solutions that simulate radioactive waste {{was investigated in}} coupon immersion tests. Most coupons were tested in the as-received condition, with the remainder having been heat treated to produce an oxide film. Nitrite, which is an established pitting inhibitor in these solutions, was present in concentrations from 0 to 0. 031 M to 0. 16 M; the last concentration is known to prevent pitting initiation in the test solution at the 50 degrees C test temperature. The depths of the <b>deepest</b> <b>pits</b> on coupons of particular exposure conditions were measure microscopically and were analyzed as simple, type 1 extreme value statistical distributions, to predict the <b>deepest</b> expected <b>pit</b> in a radioactive waste tank subject to the test conditions. While {{the growth rate of}} pits could not be established from these tests, the absolute value of the <b>deepest</b> <b>pits</b> predicted is of the order of 100 mils after 448 days of exposure. The data indicate that even nitrite concentrations insufficient to prevent pitting have a beneficial effect on limiting the growth of <b>deepest</b> <b>pits...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{strike was}} {{resolved}} {{by the spring of}} 1985, when the government effectively defeated the NUM and continued its policy of mine closures. The closure of the pits resulted in the closure of many associated industries, which decimated the local communities. Many former pit villages have struggled to recover. There are now no <b>deep</b> <b>pit</b> mines left in North East Derbyshire.|$|E
25|$|When {{coal mining}} was nationalised in 1947, about 20,000 men {{worked in the}} {{industry}} in Stoke-on-Trent. Notable Collieries included Hanley <b>Deep</b> <b>Pit,</b> Trentham Superpit (formerly Hem Heath, Stafford and Florence Collieries), Fenton Glebe, Silverdale, Victoria, Mossfield, Parkhall, Norton, Chatterley Whitfield and Wolstanton. The industry developed greatly, and new investments in mining projects were planned within the City boundaries {{as recently as the}} 1990s. However, 1994 saw the last pit to close as the Trentham Superpit was shut.|$|E

25|$|According to Chinese text Sanguo Zhi, it {{recorded}} {{the existence of}} three types of prehistoric dwellings in Korea: pit houses, log houses and elevated houses. Only the remains of pit houses have been identified, however. Pit houses consisted of a 20–150cm <b>deep</b> <b>pit</b> and a superstructure of grass and clay supported by a tripod-like frame made of timber to provide protection from the wind and rain. Pit houses of the Neolithic period had circular or oval pits about 5–6 meters in diameter with a hearth at the center. Most of the early ones were located on hills. As these dwellings moved down nearer to rivers, the pits became rectangular in shape as well as larger, with two separated hearths.|$|E
25|$|Beves's father, {{the aged}} nobleman Guy of Hampton, is murdered {{by his mother}} and her lover, the Emperor of Germany. The guilty pair marry, and are soon {{plotting}} to kill Beves, the seven-year-old heir to Guy's earldom. When the plot fails they instead sell him to merchants, who send him off to the Levant by ship. There he finds refuge at the court of Ermin, king of Armenia. As he grows up he proves his valour in various exploits, the king's daughter Josian {{falls in love with}} him, and the king makes Beves a knight and presents him with a sword called Morgelai and a horse called Arondel. Beves repels an invasion by the Saracen king Brademond, but falls out with Josian, whom he finds too independent-minded. The two are reconciled when Josian declares she will be a Christian. Ermin, believing that Beves has deflowered his daughter, sends him to Brademond with a sealed letter in which Brademond is asked to kill him. Beves reaches Damascus, insults the Saracen gods, and presents his letter to Brademond, who immediately casts Beves into a <b>deep</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess osteogenesis in osteoprogenitor cells by nanopits {{and to assess}} optimal feature depth. Topographies of depth 80 nm, 220 nm and 333 nm were {{embossed}} onto polycaprolactone (PCL) discs. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells were seeded onto PCL discs, suspended in media and incubated. Samples were fixed after three and 28 days. Cells were stained for the adhesion molecule vinculin and the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX 2 after three days. Adhesion was lowest on planar controls {{and it was the}} shallowest, 80 nm <b>deep</b> <b>pits</b> that supported optimal adhesion formation. 80 nm and 220 nm <b>deep</b> <b>pits</b> induced most RUNX 2 accumulation. After 28 days, osteocalcin and osteopontin expression were used as markers of osteoblastic differentiation. 220 nm <b>deep</b> <b>pits</b> produced cells with the highest concentrations of osteopontin and osteocalcin. All topographies induced higher expression levels than controls. We demonstrated stimulation of osteogenesis in a heterogeneous population of mesenchymal stromal cells. All nanopit depths gave promising results with an optimum depth of 220 nm after 28 days. Nanoscale modification of implant surfaces could optimise fracture union or osteointergration...|$|R

500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, what am I going to do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a <b>deep</b> <b>pit,</b> where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E
500|$|A new {{headgear}} {{and winding}} engine were {{built at the}} <b>Deep</b> <b>pit</b> shaft; ventilation was by means of two axial-type fans installed in an underground chamber. After 1947 a [...] tunnel [...] below ground level was driven to the Stuart Street Power Station, to provide coal direct from the colliery. A conveyor within the tunnel delivered 200 long tons (224 short tons) of small coal an hour to the power station's bunker. Most of the developments begun by Manchester Collieries were completed after nationalisation in 1947 by the National Coal Board (NCB). After modernisation and reconstruction, coal was extracted by longwall mining using coal-cutting machinery and conveyors. This type of mining creates a void or goaf into which the roof is allowed to collapse. At Bradford, which had no spoil heap, the goaf was infilled with spoil or waste. As there was insufficient spoil to fill the void, some was brought from other pits. The NCB incorporated the takes, or coal reserves, of Moston and Ashton Moss Collieries into the redeveloped Bradford Colliery. Moston was closed, but the shafts of Ashton Moss were retained for winding men and equipment.|$|E
