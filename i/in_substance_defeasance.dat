This was a qualitative study that was comprised of fourteen counselors who were interviewed regarding what works <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> treatment with adolescents. The study identified four themes that contribute to our knowledge about what works <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abuse treatment among adolescents. The study recommends that future research explore further what works with adolescents <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abuse treatment, including collaborating with family members, identifying strengths in adolescents, building an authentic rapport with adolescents, and using the latest evidence-based practices...|$|R

40|$|Background. In India {{there have}} been limited number of studies on {{periodontal}} status among drug addicts, and thus this study aims to assess the Oral hygiene and periodontal status <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abusers and compare it with non-substance abusers. Methods. A comparative {{study was conducted to}} assess the periodontal status <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abusers. Non-substance abusers were procured from the general population of Bangalore. From the control group 250 non-substance abusers were age and sex matched with the study population of substance abusers. The oral hygiene and periodontal condition of all subjects was assessed using Oral hygiene index- simplified (OHI-S), Russell's periodontal indices and Gingival bleeding index. Results. The mean of OHI-S and Periodontal Index (Russell's Index) scores were higher (2. 70 and 3. 68, resp.) <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abusers than the control group (2. 45 and 2. 59, resp.). The mean Gingival bleeding score was lower (9. 69) <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abusers than the control group (22. 7) and found to be statistically significant. A positive correlation found between OHI-S and Russell's periodontal index whereas negative correlation was found between OHI-S and Gingival bleeding <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abusers. Conclusions. Though the oral hygiene was fair, more periodontal destruction and less of gingival bleeding were observed <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abusers as compared to control group...|$|R

40|$|Pathological {{and problem}} {{gambling}} {{refer to a}} class of disorders, including those meeting criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, and others comprising a spectrum of severity defined by significant personal and social harm, that may be common <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> use treatment but are frequently unrecognised. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence indicating the prevalence of such gambling disorders <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> use treatment. It provides the best available estimates from studies of clinical samples of substance users, and suggests around 14 % of patients that demonstrate comorbid pathological gambling. Around 23 % suffer conditions along the broader spectrum of problem gambling. The review also highlights important limitations of existing evidence, including scant data on current versus lifetime comorbidity, as well as reliance on convenience samples and self-administered measures of gambling problems. Notwithstanding a concomitant need for caution when applying these results, the findings suggest a strong need to identify and manage gambling comorbidity <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> use treatment. Strategies for identification of gambling disorders, and therapies that may provide useful adjunctive interventions <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> use treatment are discussed...|$|R
