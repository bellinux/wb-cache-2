The increased demand for high data rate (i. e., multi-track spacecraft recording instrumentation systems), coupled with performance under extreme environmental conditions, requires a thorough knowledge of the various parameters which establish an optimum designed tape tracking and handling system. Stress analysis techniques are required to evaluate these parameters substantiated with test <b>tape</b> tracking data, <b>to</b> show the effect of each parameter on a tape recorder instrumentation tracking system. The technology is applicable <b>to</b> ground type <b>tape</b> recorders where the detrimental effects of edge guidance can be eliminated...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandOne of the {{critical}} performance and life limiting elements of a spacecraft tape recorder instrumentation system which has received little attention in technical literature is magnetic tape tracking and handling technology. This technology is required to understand how <b>to</b> gently <b>transfer</b> <b>tape</b> from one reel to another with proper alignment and a desirable uniform velocity at the read and write transducer heads.

500|$|An {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, Antonucci wanted Ed, Edd n Eddy {{to be produced}} in a way akin to cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s. Consequently, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creation of the initial animation, and then later edited back at a.k.a. Cartoon. However, when the negatives arrived back from Korea, they were so dirty, a run through digital noise reduction (DVNR), technology used to clean up dirt and grain digitally as <b>film</b> is <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>tape,</b> was unavoidable. Antonucci referred to it as [...] "a necessary evil", because it caused large damage to the animation. Upon seeing the harmul effects on the pilot, the percentage of DVNR was minimalized to purify the colors and avoid affecting the image as much as possible.|$|R

25|$|The Minox cameras project {{an image}} of 8×11mm onto the negative. The film is in strips 9.2mm wide, or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film, and unlike 35mm film, it has no {{sprocket}} holes. This film strip is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber cartridge, with the <b>film</b> leader <b>taped</b> <b>to</b> a take-up spool in the take up chamber. The film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for Riga Minox and Minox II, III, IIIs and B cameras. From Minox BL and C cameras onward the Minox film cartridge holds 15, 30, or 36 exposures.|$|R
