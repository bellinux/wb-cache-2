500|$|Initially, {{knowledge}} of bootlegs {{and where to}} purchase them spread by word of mouth. The pioneering bootlegger Rubber <b>Dubber</b> sent copies of his bootleg recordings of live performances to magazines such as Rolling Stone {{in an attempt to}} get them reviewed. When Dylan's record company, Columbia Records objected, Rubber <b>Dubber</b> counteracted he was simply putting fans in touch with the music without the intermediary of a record company. Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap photocopies. The packaging became more sophisticated {{towards the end of the}} decade and continued into the 1980s. Punk rock saw a brief entry into the bootleg market in the 1970s, particularly the bootleg Spunk, a series of outtakes by The Sex Pistols. The album received a good review from Sounds' Chas de Whalley, who said it was [...] "an album that no self-respecting rock fan would turn his nose up at." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{advent of}} sound raised another problem for cinemas in Thailand: the {{language}} of the talkies. Soon a dubbing method developed in which a <b>dubber</b> would provide a simultaneous translation of the dialogue by speaking Thai into a microphone {{at the back of the}} theater. The first Thai <b>dubber</b> was Sin Sibunruang, or [...] "Tit Khiaw", who had worked for Siam Film Company and was the editor of the company's film magazine.

2500|$|Buñuel {{has been}} {{hailed as a}} pioneer of the sound film, with L'Age d'Or being cited {{as one of the}} first {{innovative}} uses of sound in French film. [...] Film scholar Linda Williams has pointed out that Buñuel used sounds, including music, as nonsynchronous counterpoint to the visual image, rather than redundant accompaniment, in accordance with theories that had been advanced by Sergei Eisenstein and others in a 1928 manifesto on the sound film. [...] Critic Marsha Kinder has posited that Buñuel's years as a film <b>dubber</b> in Europe and Hollywood put him in the position of [...] "mastering the conventions of film sound, to subvert them more effectively". [...] In his later years, Buñuel was almost completely deaf, but he continued to assert control over the sound effects in his films, such as The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, in which seemingly important speech, especially political discourse, is often drowned out by the noise of urban life, in such a systematic manner that Kinder has identified Buñuel {{as one of the first}} professional sound designers in cinema. As further illustration of this, scholar Sally Faulkner has described the means by which, in his film Tristana, [...] Buñuel [...] "engineers a kind of figurative deafness, or disability, in the spectator" [...] in scenes which involve deaf characters, by, for example, combining the sound of gushing water with an image of a stagnant pool, or exaggerating the volume level of chiming bells.|$|E

I give you credit for sincerity, Mr. Siddons, but I don't want you to think I'm not as much interested in the welfare of these people as you and the men behind you. The trouble is, you only see one side of this question. When you're in my position, you're up against hard facts.
