In addition, alloys of Zn and Al are also used not only to inhibit corrosion of Zn, but also to increase the capacity of the anode material and decrease its weight [57] by harvesting both the reactivity of Al in alkaline solutions and its density. Special attention has been devoted to the more environmentally acceptable Zn–Ni alloy system. The comparative corrosion of Zn and Zn–Ni alloys in different conditions (temperature and concentration of the KOH electrolyte) has been studied in [58] by potentiodynamic and impedance methods. By plotting the corrosion current vs. concentration of KOH electrolyte (log[KOH]) for Zn and Zn–Ni alloys, a linear trend is observed for each alloy.

40|$|A {{study of}} three {{electrode}} substrates namely gold, platinum and silver, for arsenic detection via {{anodic stripping voltammetry}} is reported. Hitherto it has been accepted that gold is the most suitable metallic surface for use in this context, as suggested by Forsberg and co-workers (Forsberg, G.; O'Laughlin, J. W.; Megargle, R. G. Anal. Chem. 1975, 47, 1586.). We revisit these experiments and find that by switching from hydrochloric acid to nitric acid the oxidation of silver that had previously masked the arsenic stripping signal at this surface is shifted considerably enough to allow a clear, analytically reliable As(III) stripping signal to be detected. In contrast to silver and gold platinum is found to have poor performance as an electrode substrate for arsenic detection. Using ASV a LOD of 6. 3 × 10 - 7 M is found for As(III) detection at a silver electrode, similar to that which we have previously reported at a gold electrode (A. O. Simm, C. E. Banks and R. G. Compton. Electroanalysis, 2005, 17, 335.) The use of ultrasound was then investigated to further reduce the LOD, which {{was found to be}} 1. 4 × 10 - 8 M.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{hydrogen}} absorbed by a high-strength steel during cathodic polarization in near-neutral solutions using rigidly controlled experimental conditions. Direct hydrogen analysis by the vacuum heating technique has been utilized and it has been established that use of high extraction temperatures (i. e. > 300 °C) can lead to errors which are probably associated with a reaction between adsorbed water and the steel. Extraction at 200 °C has been found to give satisfactory results free from this error. The linear relationship between hydrogen absorption and time observed during the early stages of polarization in solutions above pH 4. 0 was considered to be characteristic of a rate-controlled slow discharge mechanism of hydrogen evolution. The relationship between <b>hydrogen</b> absorption and <b>overvoltage</b> has been studied in the range pH 4 - 10; the results were found to conform with those anticipated from the kinetics of hydrogen evolution. Metallurgical structure was found to exert a strong influence on the ability of the steel to absorb hydrogen, and a modification of previous theories on delayed failure due to hydrogen has been proposed {{on the basis of the}} present study. The influence of arsenic additions to the solution on hydrogen absorption during cathodic polarization have been studied. It has been found that there is a region of pH and <b>overvoltage</b> where <b>hydrogen</b> uptake is inhibited and these results have been correlated with sustained load experiments.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} control of fuel cells, {{focusing}} on high-temperature proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells. Fuel cells are devices that convert the chemical energy of hydrogen, methanol or other chemical compounds directly into electricity, without combustion or thermal cycles. They are efficient, scalable and silent devices {{that can provide}} power {{to a wide variety}} of utilities, from portable electronics to vehicles, to nation-wide electric grids. Whereas studies about the design of fuel cell systems and the electrochemical properties of their components abound in the open literature, there has been only a minor interest, albeit growing, in dynamics and control of fuel cells. In the relatively small body of available literature, there are some apparently contradictory statements: sometimes the slow dynamics of fuel cells is claimed to present a control problem, whereas in other articles fuel cells are claimed to be easy to control and able to follow references that change very rapidly. These contradictions are mainly caused by differences in the sets of phenomena and dynamics that the authors decided to investigate, and also by how they formulated the control problem. For instance, there is little doubt that the temperature dynamics of a fuel cell can be slow, but users are not concerned with the cell’s temperature: power output is a much more important measure of performance. Fuel cells are very multidisciplinary systems, where electrical engineering, electrochemistry, chemical engineering and materials science are all involved at various levels; it is therefore unsurprising that few researchers can master all of these branches, and that most of them will neglect or misinterpret phenomena they are unfamiliar with. The ambition of this thesis is to consider the main phenomena influencing the dynamics of fuel cells, to properly define the control problem and suggest possible approaches and solutions to it. This thesis will focus on a particular type of fuel cell, a variation of proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells with a membrane of polybenzimidazole instead of the usual, commercially available Nafion. The advantages of this particular type of fuel cells for control are particularly interesting, and stem from their operation at temperatures higher than those typical of Nafion-based cells: these new cells do not have any water-management issues, can remove more heat with their exhaust gases, and have better tolerance to poisons such as carbon monoxide. The first part of this thesis will be concerned with defining and modelling the dynamic phenomena of interest. Indeed, a common mistake is to assume that fuel cells have a single dynamics: instead, many phenomena with radically different time scales concur to define a fuel-cell stack’s overall behaviour. The dynamics of interest are those of chemical engineering (heat and mass balances), of electrochemistry (diffusion in electrodes, electrochemical catalysis) and of electrical engineering (converters, inverters and electric motors). The first part of the thesis will first present some experimental results of importance for the electrochemical transient, and will then develop the equations required to model the four dynamic modes chosen to represent a fuel-cell system running on hydrogen and air at atmospheric pressure: cathodic <b>overvoltage,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> pressure in the anode, oxygen fraction in the cathode and stack temperature. The second part will explore some of the possible approaches to control the power output from a fuel-cell stack. It has been attempted to produce a modularised set of controllers, one for each dynamics to control. It is a major point of the thesis, however, that the task of controlling a fuel cell is to be judged exclusively by its final result, that is power delivery: all other control loops, however independent, will have to be designed bearing that goal in mind. The overvoltage, which corresponds nonlinearly to the rate of reaction, is controlled by operating a buck-boost DC/DC converter, which in turn is modelled and controlled with switching rules. Hydrogen pressure, being described by an unstable dynamic equation, requires feedback to be controlled. A controller with PI feedback and a feedforward part to improve performance is suggested. The oxygen fraction in the cathodic stream cannot be easily measured with a satisfactory bandwidth, but its dynamics is stable and disturbances can be measured quite precisely: it is therefore suggested to use a feedforward controller. Contrary to the most common approach for Nafion-based fuel cells, temperature is not controlled with a separate cooling loop: instead, the air flow is used to cool the fuel-cell stack. This significantly simplifies the stack design, operation and production cost. To control temperature, it is suggested to use a P controller, possibly with a feedforward component. Simulations show that this approach to stack cooling is feasible and poses no or few additional requirements on the air flow actuator that is necessary to control air composition in the cathode.

40|$|Measurements of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>overvoltage</b> {{on solid}} indium {{electrodes}} {{were made in}} 0. 1 M HC 104 at temperatures f rom 21 ~ to 59. 5 ~ The slow step in the hydrogen evolution reaction is probably discharge of a hydrogen ion, as indi-cated by the exchange current (10 - 11 amp/cm 2), transfer coefficient (0. 5), effect of added iodide ion, and effect of acid concentration. The enthalpy of activation is 14. 1 +_ _ 0. 5 kcal /mole at the reversible hydrogen potential and 10. 0 • 0. 2 kcal /mole at the zero-charge point. From these values, an estimate of 50 _ 10 kcal/g atom is obtained for the heat of adsorption of hydrogen atoms on indium. The reaction is very sensitive to traces of oxygen, and the formation and removal of oxide films are discussed. Indium offers an unusual opportunity for a detailed study of the hydrogen evolution reaction. In dilute acid, hydrogen evolution is the principal reaction over a po-tential range of more than 0. 8 v.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} on corrosion rates of 3 - 25 % Mo-Ni alloys in 10 % HC 1 at 25 ~ 70 ~ and the boil ing point. Data also include measurements of corro-sion potentials, crit ical current densities for passivity, anodic polarization {{in the active}} potential region, and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>overvoltage.</b> Molybdenum-nickel alloys, l ike other passive metals, corrode under anodic control, but their cor-rosion potentials, unl ike values for the passive chromium alloys, are more active than the corresponding Flade potentials at which a passive film is established. Corrosion resistance derives apparent ly from a sluggish anodic dissolution re-action, such as a low rate of ion hydration. Chemical propert ies of Mo are im-parted to Ni or to Ni plus Fe alloys at crit ical ratios related to electron con-figuration of the component metals. Chromium is outs tand ing ly passive, and it confers this p roper ty on al loys of i ron at a min imum con-centrat ion of about 12 % Cr. The la t ter al loys mak...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel electrolytic cell pressurized by D 2 in which deuterium loading ratio in a palladium cathode can be determined in-situ during the calorimetric measurements of excess heat. A gas diffusion type fuel cell anode is partially immersed in the electrolyte solution {{to act as a}} counter electrode, at which electrochemical oxidation of deuterium gas molecules to deuterium ions takes place instead of electrolytic decomposition of water molecules to generate oxygen gas. Factors controlling the loading ratio such as electrolyte composition, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>overvoltage</b> at the palladium cathode, current density and isotope effect have been examined. Dependence of the excess heat generation at the palladium cathode on the loading ratio {{as well as on the}} current density shows that the critical loading ratio and the current density to generate excess heat are ca. 0. 83 and 100 mA/cm 2, respectively. The maximum D/Pd of 0. 89 has been achieved in the present study, at which excess heat generation of ca. 35 % with respect to the input electrolytic power has been observed...|$|E
40|$|Although Ti is very {{resistant}} o {{the action}} of all acids, except HC 1, H 2 SO 4, and es-pecially HF, its resistance breaks down if soluble fluorides {{are added to the}} acidic solu-tions. It was found that the HF l iberated by acids part ia l ly dissolves the protect ive film that is always present on the surface of Ti. Hydrogen ions then are discharged at the local cathodes, which are now exposed to the acids through the pores of the film. In agreement with this concept, the rate of dissolution of Ti increases only sl ightly with increased concentrat ion of a strong acid (HC 1, H 2 SO 4), at a constant concentra-t ion of NH 4 F, but it increases greatly with increased concentrat ion of NH 4 F (at a con-stunt concentrat ion of the strong acid). If the concentrat ion of NH 4 F is increased still further, the Ti becomes passive, and simultaneously its potent ia l decreases to- 0. 94 volt (hydrogen scale). This passiva-t ion could be explained by formation of a part ia l salt film {{on the surface of the}} dis-solving Ti, and by increase of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>overvoltage</b> on local cathodes, because of the NH 4 F present...|$|E
