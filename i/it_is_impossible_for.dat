5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> her to not love him.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would {{they be able to}} travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
60|$|How long he thus {{literally}} {{fought against}} the elements <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him so much as to conjecture.|$|R
50|$|As {{the electoral}} {{threshold}} stood at 2%, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> {{a party to}} receive only one seat in the Knesset.|$|R

5|$|Gregory's Chronicle, the Chronicle of London, or MS Edgerton 1995, is {{the name}} given to a fifteenth-century English chronicle. It {{takes its name from}} its {{supposed}} author, William Gregory, who started as a skinner in London. Greogory {{went on to become a}} London Alderman, Sheriff from 1436 to 1437, and eventually Mayor from 1450 to 1451. The name 'Gregory' for the manuscript is, however, merely a convenience, as its actual authorship is unknown. Indeed, since the chronicle spans the period 1189 to 1470, and William Gregory died in 1467, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to have composed it in its entirety. Other fifteenth-century authors have been proposed, ranging from a contemporary poet to an Ecclesiast, but since even the exact dates of its composition are also debated it has been impossible for historians to definitively attribute the authorship to any known individual.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Viking metal scene believe that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> someone to be a Viking unless they {{themselves}} are of northern European descent. According to Trafford and Pluskowski, the members of practically all Viking metal bands claim Viking ancestry, and after its inception in Scandinavia, Viking metal spread to areas historically settled by Vikings, including England, Russia, and Normandy. Viking metal bands have even formed in the United States and Canada, with their members claiming Viking descent either directly from Scandinavia or through England. The scene also spread {{to other parts of}} Northern Europe in areas united by a common Germanic heritage, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. For instance, the Austrian band Valhalla makes extensive use of Viking iconography, including horned helmets. Another Austrian example is Amestigon, which on the cover of its promotional album Remembering Ancient Origins depicts a wood carved scene of Sigurd killing Regin, an image taken from a panel held in Hylestad stave church.|$|E

5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weaknessâ€¦ And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas' {{argument}} from first cause {{started with the}} premise that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a being to cause itself (because {{it would have to}} exist before it caused itself) and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> there to be an infinite chain of causes, which would result in infinite regress. Therefore, there must be a first cause, itself uncaused.|$|E
25|$|Strong agnosticism is {{the belief}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> humans to know whether or not any deities exist.|$|E

25|$|Some {{consumers}} may object that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to boycott yield management when buying some goods, such as airline tickets.|$|E
25|$|Truly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> lower Louisiana to {{get along}} without slaves and {{with the use of}} slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward {{prosperity}} and wealth.|$|E
25|$|Heinlein also {{explains}} that the population remains steady in Oz {{despite the lack of}} death because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> children to be born in Oz. When the population does increase through immigration, Glinda just extends the borders an inch or two in each direction, which makes more than enough space for all additional people.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> me to {{give you}} an idea of the {{surprise}} and consternation experienced by all on the receipt of the order to sail. Indeed, that surprise is well justified, for nothing can be expected of this expedition except the total destruction of the fleet or its hasty and demoralized return.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is to}} use language-based protection. In a language-based protection system, the kernel will only allow code to execute that has been produced by a trusted language compiler. The language may then be designed such that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the programmer to instruct it {{to do something that}} will violate a security requirement.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to skeptical explanations, Bruce Maccabee says a meteor theory would require impossibly slow speeds and durations for brightly glowing meteors on a horizontal trajectory. He says <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a bird {{to be as}} bright as reported by Arnold, and that birdsâ€”which could not fly as fast as Arnold's planeâ€”would have steadily moved backward, not forwards, relative to his position.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> {{me to be}} insulted or abused in any way. For I do naught {{that deserves}} censure, and I care not for what is {{reported}} falsely. As for the emperors who are dead and gone, they will avenge themselves in case anyone does them a wrong, if in very truth they are demigods and possess any power.|$|E
25|$|The Korean {{government}} says that Usando was the Liancourt Rocks. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> one to survive at Liancourt Rocks without outside assistance, a distinction to be noted is that Usanguk {{refers to a}} state based on Ulleng-do, whereas Usando refers to an island. Japanese scholars argue that Usando refers to either Ulleung-do or Jukdo while Korean scholars argue that it refers to Liancourt Rocks.|$|E
25|$|If a {{being is}} {{essentially}} omnipotent, {{then it can}} also resolve the paradox (as long as we take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossibleâ€”just like the accidentally omnipotentâ€”and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.|$|E
