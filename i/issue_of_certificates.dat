40|$|Background: Globally, the {{administration}} of vaccines by pharmacists is gaining momentum and incorporation of vaccination and injection skills in pharmacy school curricula is becoming more common. Objectives: This paper reports on one of four focus groups conducted to validate an Australian developed undergraduate vaccination training program (VTP) and its wider application beyond the Australian health care environment. Methods: A focus group discussion was conducted with six Sri Lankan medical and pharmacist experts following {{the development of a}} vaccination training program. Results: Participants voiced that prior to incorporation of the VTP into undergraduate Sri Lankan curricula, approval should be sought from the Ministry of Health and established vaccinators. The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> of competency was deemed inappropriate to be issued to Sri Lankan students. Additionally the assessment of competency was seen to be essential on a yearly basis throughout the curricula. Concern was expressed concerning the management of vaccine associated anaphylaxis in the context of minimal pre-hospital care. Participants voiced that vaccination training should be piloted prior to formal incorporation into Sri Lankan undergraduate pharmacy curricula Conclusion: While there is wide interest in the introduction of clinical skills into pharmacy curricula, {{the results of this study}} raise questions about the inclusion of injection and vaccination training in Sri Lankan undergraduate curricula...|$|E
