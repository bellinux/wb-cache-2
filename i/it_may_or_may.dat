5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not be commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|In {{the common}} {{presentation}} of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms may start {{soon after the}} movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically {{between the ages of}} 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first.|$|E

25|$|A {{double check}} occurs when two pieces {{simultaneously}} threaten the enemy general. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> {{not be possible}} to block, but capturing one of the checking pieces is insufficient to remove the threat. The only blockable cases are either a chariot and cannon on the same file as the general, with the chariot acting as a screen for the cannon, or two horses giving discovered check after another piece unblocks the attack from both. Other combinations of double checks are not blockable.|$|E

DO medical students may also choose to sit for the USMLE if they wish to take an MD residency and about 48% take USMLE Step 1.

500|$|Mary Elizabeth [...] "Bette" [...] Kane is a reinvented {{version of}} the Betty Kane {{character}} during the Golden Age. As her original characterization was retconned out of existence during the Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, a discrepancy arose where her Bat-Girl character had joined the west coast {{version of the}} Teen Titans but simply disappeared. The character was reintroduced as Bette Kane and the alias of Flamebird. Following Infinite Crisis, the character's past as Bat-Girl was hinted at as {{being a part of}} continuity. However, that reference included a revamped origin of the character and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not have been the current Bette Kane.|$|E
500|$|Gilla Ciaráin's father bore a Gaelic name meaning [...] "iron knee". <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> {{not be a}} Gaelicisation of Járnkné, an identical-meaning Old Norse name. Gilla Ciaráin's {{own name}} is Gaelic, meaning [...] "the servant of Saint Ciarán". Gaelic names {{beginning}} with the initial name-element Gilla- first appear on record in {{last half of the}} tenth century. Such names were shortened to Gilli by Scandinavian settlers in Britain and Ireland. In fact, such a phenomenon may account for the name accorded to Gilli himself. Gilli's name suggests that he was at least partly of Gaelic descent, perhaps either Irish or Hebridean. Although various names are attributed to Gilli's wife in the numerous versions of Njáls saga, the best version of this source gives Hvarflǫð. This name appears to be an Old Norse form of Forbflaith, a relatively rare Gaelic name.|$|E

50|$|The flora of the U.S. Sierra Nevada alpine zone is {{characterized}} by small, low growing, cushion and mat forming plants that can survive the harsh conditions in the high-altitude alpine zone above the timber line. These flora often occur in alpine fell-fields.
