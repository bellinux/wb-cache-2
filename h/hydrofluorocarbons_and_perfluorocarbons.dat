We have also shown that these solute descriptors can be obtained from partition coefficients of solutes in various water–solvent and gas–solvent systems.

The higher global warming potential has two causes: HFCs remain in the atmosphere {{for long periods of}} time, and they have more chemical bonds than CO2, which means that they are able to absorb more solar energy per molecule than carbon dioxide. Wealthy countries are clamping down on these gases. Thornton says that many countries are needlessly producing these chemicals just to get the carbon credits. Thus, as a result of carbon trading rules under the Kyoto Protocol, nearly half the credits from developing countries are from HFCs, with China scoring billions of dollars from catching and destroying HFCs that would be in the atmosphere as industrial byproducts.|$|R

40|$|The {{requirement}} to tackle anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{has become increasingly}} urgent as understanding of the risks of climate change has advanced. The scientific community has been developing mechanisms {{to bring about a}} reduction in the quantities of anthropogenic GHG emissions in order that responsibility for anthropogenic climate forcing may be equitably assigned and specific, pragmatic emissions reduction targets can be set and progress measured. The ‘carbon footprint’ is increasingly being recognised as a valuable indicator in the field of GHG emissions management. For ease of application the definition the “carbon footprint” has been limited to the inclusion of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) by Wright et al. (2011). However, in some cases a more complete measure is needed that includes the full array of Kyoto “basket” GHGs – CO 2, CH 4, nitrous oxide (N 2 O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs) <b>and</b> <b>perfluorocarbons</b> (PFCs). Outside of the academic literature the conventional approach is to term this metric a “GHG inventory” (UN, 1998; Ranganathan et al., 2004). However, in the academic literature the term “GHG inventory” has been used to account for various different collections of GHGs and other climate-influencing gases, leading to confusion over the definition of the “GHG inventory”. Consequently, an alternative term, the “climate footprint”, has been proposed (Wiedmann and Minx, 2008; Wright et al., 2011) which aims to eliminate this confusion. The question is: should we continue using the commonly-used term, “GHG inventory”, and endeavour to impose and promote a strict definition or should we introduce a new, rigorously defined term, the “climate footprint...|$|R

Road transport, being the dominant mode of transport in the country, emitted 87 % of the total CO 2 equivalent emissions from the transport sector. The main objective of this research is to quantify the carbon footprint due to fuel loss at signalized intersection. The methodology adopted is: i) Assortment of intersections with high, medium and low volumes ii) Examine the delays taking place at each intersection for individual modes of travel (car, buses, 2 -wheeler and 4 -wheeler) iii) Fuel consumption during idling of vehicles at signalised intersection has been calculated iv) Estimation of total carbon footprint of fuel loss in Delhi during idling of vehicles at selected intersections using IPCC Guidelines. The scope of the study is limited to the signalized intersections only. The results indicate that idling CO 2 emission contribute 9 % of the total emissions from transport sector in Delhi in 2004. Delay causes fuel loss, time loss and emissions. Thus to curb these losses it is very important to adopt proper policies and mitigation measures...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse {{some aspects of the}} interdependences between the economy and the {{environment}} by applying the input-output approach. Although economic activity affects the environment in many ways, in {{this study we}} only focus on one: the atmospheric pollution. Concretely, we consider nine different gases. On one hand, the six greenhouse gases regulated by Kyoto protocol: carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (HFCs), <b>and</b> <b>perfluorocarbons</b> (PFCs). <b>And,</b> on the other hand, three gases related to local environmental problems such as acidification and eutrophication: sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia (NH 3). The study is structured in four self-contained essays that examine the relation between the economic activity and emissions in Spain from different perspectives. After an introductory chapter, in Chapter 2 we describe the methodology and the database used in other chapters. First, we present the basis of the input-output analysis emphasising those characteristics that make it a suitable approach to study the interdependences between the economy and the environment. Then, we describe the database and the procedure required to obtain an environmentally extended input-output table for Spain. We apply the environmentally extended input-output model presented in this chapter to describe the Spanish situation regarding atmospheric pollution in 1995 and 2000. In Chapter 3, we examine the contribution of the driving forces of the evolution of emissions in Spain from 1995 to 2000. For doing so, we decompose the change in emissions into the three main 'sources'. First, shifts in total intensity emission matrix (the eco-technological effect); second, changes in the composition of final uses (the structure effect); and third, changes in the level of final uses (the level effect). We quantify the effects of these three determinants performing a structural decomposition analysis. Chapter 4 shows the capacity of input-output analysis to study the relationship between the economic activity and the environment at a micro level. The purpose of this chapter is to analyse the different impact on atmospheric pollution of different households with different 'economic position'. We calculate total (direct and indirect) emissions generated by private consumption of Spanish households classified by quintiles of expenditure in the year 2000. In Chapter 5 we estimate the emissions embodied in Spanish international trade. By applying a multiregional input-output model we define and compare two approaches: the responsibility emission balance and the trade emission balance. We evaluate the international responsibility of Spain in 1995 and 2000. Finally, Chapter 6 summarises the conclusions of this study. El propósito de esta tesis es el de analizar algunos de los factores que determinan las interdependencias existentes entre la economía y el medio ambiente. Aunque la actividad económica afecta al medio ambiente de forma muy diversa, el objeto de estudio de este trabajo está centrado en el análisis de un único problema medio ambiental: la contaminación atmosférica. Concretamente se consideran nueve gases diferentes. Por un lado los seis gases de efecto invernadero regulados por el protocolo de Kioto: dióxido de carbono (CO 2), metano (CH 4), óxido nitroso (N 2 O), hexafluoruro de azufre (SF 6), hidrofluorocarbonos (HFCs), y perfluorocarbonos (PFCs). Y por otro lado, tres gases relacionados con problemas medioambientales de carácter más local y/o regional como son la acidificación y la eutrofización: óxidos de azufre (SOx), óxidos de nitrógeno (NOx), y amoniaco (NH 3). </i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} project is created {{to build the}} protocol and the preliminary corporate GHG emissions inventory for Steelcase, Inc., global leader in the office environments industry headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In October 2005 Steelcase joined the Climate Leaders Program (CL), a voluntary industry-government partnership, created by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Partner companies develop a corporate-wide GHG inventory of the six major gases – carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, <b>hydrofluorocarbons,</b> <b>perfluorocarbons,</b> <b>and</b> sulfur hexafluoride from both direct and indirect emission sources, and design a corporate GHG emissions reduction strategy with reduction goals to be attained over the next 5 to 10 years. Operational boundaries of the inventory incorporate all business units and subsidiaries that are under full operational control of Steelcase, Inc. Organizational boundaries include all CO, CH, NO and HFC emissions from core direct and core indirect sources. 242 GHG emissions data are collected and analyzed by fuel source using facility-specific approach with 2004 base year. Calculation methodology {{is based on the}} emissions factors approach, with final results measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MT CO 2 e). The preliminary estimate of the total corporate GHG footprint for 2004 is 188, 000 MT CO 2 e with 26 % originating from direct and 74 % from indirect emissions sources. The inventory identifies manufacturing, corporate, and transportation as the three most carbon intensive operations. They account for 61. 6 % (115, 710 MT CO 2 e), 20. 1 % (37, 684 MT CO 2 e) and 7 % (10, 516 MT CO 2 e) of emissions, respectively. Most of the GHG footprint comes from electricity use (139, 136 MT CO 2 e or 75 % of all emissions) and natural gas combustion (27, 811 MT CO 2 e or 15 % of all emissions). The protocol is designed to institutionalize the process for collecting, calculating, maintaining, and reporting corporate GHG emissions data at Steelcase. Corporate deliverables include the Inventory Management Plan and the GHG Inventory. Finally, the author provides an overview of other voluntary GHG reduction programs in the US and a general discussion of policy and market drivers that influence corporate climate change strategies...|$|R
