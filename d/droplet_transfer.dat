40|$|A {{method of}} {{ensuring}} the complete <b>transfer</b> of liquid <b>droplets</b> from nozzles in microfluidic devices to nearby surfaces involves relatively simple geometric {{modification of the}} nozzle surfaces. The method is especially applicable to nozzles in print heads and similar devices required to dispense liquid droplets having precise volumes. Examples of such devices include heads for soft printing of ink on paper and heads for depositing droplets of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein solutions on glass plates to form microarrays of spots for analysis. The main purpose served by the present method {{is to ensure that}} <b>droplets</b> <b>transferred</b> from a nozzle have consistent volume, as needed to ensure accuracy in microarray analysis or consistent appearance of printed text and images. In soft printing, droplets having consistent volume are generated inside a print head, but {{in the absence of the}} present method, the consistency is lost in printing because after each printing action (in which a drop is ejected from a nozzle), a small residual volume of liquid remains attached to the nozzle. By providing for complete <b>transfer</b> of <b>droplets</b> (and thus eliminating residual liquid attached to the nozzle) the method ensures consistency of volume of <b>transferred</b> <b>droplets.</b> An additional benefit of elimination of residue is prevention of cross-contamination among different liquids printed through the same nozzle a major consideration in DNA microarray analysis. The method also accelerates the printing process by minimizing the need to clean a printing head to prevent cross-contamination. Soft printing involves a hydrophobic nozzle surface and a hydrophilic print surface. When the two surfaces are brought into proximity such that a droplet in the nozzle makes contact with the print surface, a substantial portion of the <b>droplet</b> becomes <b>transferred</b> to the print surface. Then as the nozzle and the print surface are pulled apart, the droplet is pulled apart and most of the droplet remains on the print surface. The basic principle of the present method is to reduce the liquid-solid surface energy of the nozzle to a level sufficiently below the intrinsic solid-liquid surface energy of the nozzle material so that the droplet is not pulled apart and, instead, the entire <b>droplet</b> volume becomes <b>transferred</b> to the print surface. In this method, the liquid-solid surface energy is reduced by introducing artificial surface roughness in the form of micromachined serrations on the inner nozzle surface (see figure). The method was tested in experiments on soft printing of DNA solutions and of deionized water through 0. 5 -mm-diameter nozzles, of which some were not serrated, some were partially serrated, and some were fully serrated. In the nozzles without serrations, transfer was incomplete; that is, residual liquids remained in the nozzles after printing. However, in every nozzle in which at least half the inner surface was serrated, complete <b>transfer</b> of <b>droplets</b> to the print surface was achieved...|$|R

This new control approach offers improved spatter reduction and fusion control compared to conventional constant voltage control systems. The control approach is {{based on the premise that}} if optimum <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> conditions exist, then the short circuit current can be minimized through clamping, the <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> taking place primarily under the influence of surface tension. Unlike previous controlled dip transfer strategies this approach places no reliance on pre-emptive detection of the short circuit rupture or on rapid peak current reduction. Novel adaptive control and monitoring techniques have been developed to assist in assessing the degree to which current clamping is introduced to the process, as well as identifying the type and degree of spatter generated. A study of optimized welding conditions has identified a relationship of use for the selection of welding parameters. The study led to the derivation of a hypothesis that defines the optimum short-circuiting event for <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer.</b> The investigation of the welding process has also identified inherent process irregularities when using CO 2 shielding gas, which has led to the development of control strategies whose actions minimize the affect and enhance the welding process stability.

40|$|Gas Metal Arc (GMA) welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods in welding technology. It was invented at the {{beginning}} of the XXth century and is applied in many fields of industry until now. For almost every alloy used in industry, the GMA welding can be applied thanks to its variations (MIG/MAG including cored wire electrode welding, electrogas welding, plasma gas metal arc welding), inexpensive consumables and equipment. Despite the long-standing and widely spread application of this process, it still has not been completely understood due to the complex physical phenomena involved and their interaction with each other. As a consequence of this, its potential is not completely revealed and the research topic “physical phenomena in GMA welding” is still relevant. The goal of this work is the attainment of new knowledge about the GMA welding process in relation to the physical phenomena of the droplet formation, detachment and its transfer. For this, the effect of different welding process parameters on these physical phenomena is studied. Finally, it is studied how the droplet detachment and <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> can be controlled by these process parameters. These studies are performed with the help of modern theoretical and experimental methods. The obtained results can be used not only for a better understanding of the welding process, but also for helping to apply in the industry, for example, low-spatter, more stable and energy-saving welding processes. One of the most important physical phenomena in GMA welding include the droplet formation and its transfer to the weld pool. The process stability, the weld seam geometry, the chemical composition and mechanical properties of weld seam, as well as the safety of welding construction depend on these processes. Therefore, the mentioned phenomena are very important for the quality and profitability of the welding process. The <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> serves the GMA welding as an energy and mass transporter between the welding power source and electrode and the weld pool. With it, the GMA welding process can be purposefully controlled, even though the physical phenomena are in a complex interaction with each another. Both methodical approaches, the theoretical and the experimental, are applied for different, partially overlapping parameter ranges. The theoretical approach is applied mainly for non-measurable properties, like properties of the anode boundary layer, arc plasma and evaporation processes. The experimental approach makes it possible to observe the general process pattern and is used for measurable properties like droplet diameter, droplet velocity and arc length. The theoretical approach incorporates both, the physical-mathematical modelling and the numerical simulation of the metal transfer in GMA welding. The knowledge acquired with the help of numerical studies can be used to optimize the chemical composition for welding materials or to calculate and optimize the chemical composition of the weld seam. For the numerical analysis, different approaches are applied whereby the models implemented in ANSYS CFX software were validated by the simplified numerical experiments and were afterwards complemented with models based on the current process knowledge. In the experimental approach, modern measuring techniques are used in order to observe and analyse the welding process. For this, visual recordings of the welding process were made with a high-speed camera, synchronized with recordings of the welding current and voltage. Finally, the dependencies of the welding process parameters in relation to the droplet formation and <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> are determined. For this, the process parameters are widely varied. In this work, new knowledge in the topic concerning the droplet formation and <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> was obtained which leads to a better understanding of GMA welding process and makes it possible to benefit more from its potential which finally saves resources and costs.

Consequently, the study and the {{development of}} innovative artificial micro-object manipulation strategies in these dimensions are particularly relevant. As presented in the literature, micromanipulations are perturbed by the adhesion and surface forces which depend on surrounding mediums. We propose to perform micro-assembly tasks in liquid medium, because adhesion and surface forces applied on submerged microobjects are less important than in air. An overview of the microforces in air and in liquid is presented in this paper.

The first portion of the work includes fundamental studies of impinging droplet fluid and heat transfer characteristics presented in the form of droplet impact behavior regime maps. The maps, along with detailed photographs and heat transfer measurements, identify distinct heat transfer regimes for impinging water drops. Next, an experimental and a theoretical study of the Leidenfrost point (LFP) for sessile and impinging droplets are presented. The experimental results indicate weaknesses in several previous LFP models and {{serve as the basis for}} a new theoretically-based model. The new LFP model postulates that at liquid/solid interface temperatures at and above the LFP, a sufficient number of cavities are activated and the bubble growth rates are fast enough that a complete vapor layer is established nearly instantaneously between the liquid and solid.

40|$|The single stable {{cathode spot}} on the base metal unique to GMA-welded titanium, causes {{spattering}} ABSTRACT. Severe spattering occurs in low-current GMA W of titanium and tita-nium alloys. For example, 1. 6 -mm (V 16 ·in.) diameter Ti- 6 AI- 4 V welding wire spatters at direct current electrode-positive (DCEP) welding currents of less than 240 A, eject-ing almost 20 % of the filler metal from the weld. Using a high-speed camera, an analysis of metal-droplet transfer in the welding arc was carried out to {{determine the cause of}} the spatter. Spattering is not a result of the plasma jet repelling molten filler metal droplets from the base metal. Spattering follows a regular pattern. The transferring droplets touch down on the base plate and wet the weld pool. At low current levels, a portion of molten welding wire is pinched off and ejected from the vicinity of the weld pool before the droplet incorporates com-pletely, thus causing spatter. As the drop-let wets the weld pool, the cathode spot relocates from the weld pool {{to the top of the}} transferred, but unincorporated, drop-let. Cathode spot relocation from the weld pool to the droplet takes place in approximately 1. 1 ms, so the droplet top remains distinguishable from the weld pool for at least this length of time. The current levels that are associated with spatter are associated with globular trans-fer of filler metal droplets, and compara-tively slow droplet wire-to-plate transfer velocities. Below 240 A, <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> velocities are typically 130 cm/s (4. 3 ft/s).

Applying an extended version of FLUENT which includes the static electric field and the space charge effect due to the charged <b>droplets,</b> <b>transfer</b> efficiency and film thickness distribution of the coating processes of flat plates could be estimated to {{a high degree of}} accuracy. In the present contribution the obtained results are transferred to the case of high speed rotary bells with so-called external charging. This charging mechanism, using electrodes to produce a flux of free ions interacting with the paint droplets is mainly applied in the case of water based conductive paints. Hence, the existing program for direct charging atomisers has to be extended further, considering the following features: - calculation of the static local density of ion current and the corresponding space charge field - calculation of particle trajectories taking into account the transient charging within the flow domain In principle, the space charge field is calculated solving an additional conservation equation for the flow of ions. For the time dependent charging of the paint droplets existing models are applied using additional corrections factors based on experimental results of the local currents. Current results indicate a good agreement of the main features of measured and calculated static film thicknesses, e. g. the general geometry and the extention. This is also true for the transfer efficiency. Consequently, also the dynamic film thickness profiles, produced by the atomiser moving over a flat target, are very similar. As the next step, the program will be verified with respect to the sensitivity to parameter changes of the atomiser and more complex target geometries. Future applications of the program are not limited to the calculation of the coating process only. A potential task may be the development of improved atomizers...|$|R

This project investigated the experimental and theoretical advantages of combining a fiber optic delivered Nd:YAG laser with a miniaturized GMAW system. Consistent gas metal arc <b>droplet</b> <b>transfer</b> employing a 0. 25 mm diameter wire was only obtained at high currents in the spray transfer mode. Excessive heating of the workpiece in this mode was considered an impractical result for most Sandia micro-welding applications. Several additional droplet detachment approaches were investigated and analyzed including pulsed tungsten arc transfer(droplet welding), servo accelerated transfer, servo dip transfer, and electromechanically braked transfer. Experimental observations and rigorous analysis of these approaches indicate that decoupling droplet detachment from the arc melting process is warranted and may someday be practical...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies into <b>droplet</b> {{impingement}} heat <b>transfer</b> {{have demonstrated}} that it has great potential for providing high heat flux cooling {{in areas such as}} thermal management of electronics. The wettability of the surface affects the flow dynamics of the impingement process and the resulting heat transfer. In this study, the effect of surface wettability on carbon nanotube water-based nanofluid <b>droplet</b> impingement heat <b>transfer</b> has been studied and compared with water. Superhydrophobic or hydrophilic coatings are applied on one face of monocrystalline silicon wafers (the drop impinges on this face) while the other face is painted matt black to permit infrared thermography. The silicon wafer is preheated to 40 °C and a single droplet impinges normally on the top facing coated surface of the monocrystalline silicon wafer. The inverse heat conduction problem has been solved using the measured black face temperature. For both the water and nanofluid droplets, the convective heat transfer coefficient reduces with the decrease in surface wettability. It is found that the nanofluid produce a significantly higher convective heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient during <b>droplet</b> impingement than water, with the enhancement increasing with increasing wettability...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{turbulent}} clustering of water <b>droplets</b> on radiative <b>transfer</b> is investigated {{by means of}} both a three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of particle-laden homogeneous isotropic turbulence and a radiative transfer simulation based on a Monte Carlo photon tracing method. The results show that turbulent clustering causes the formation of void regions of droplets and hence increases the direct transmittance. This effect decreases as the turbulent Reynolds number increases and {{is estimated to be}} negligibly small under the conditions in real clouds...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to fabricate solid capsules with precise control of size, permeability, mechanical strength, and compatibility. The capsules are fabri-cated by the self-assembly of colloidal particles onto the interface of emulsion droplets. After the particles are locked together to form elastic shells, the emulsion <b>droplets</b> are <b>transferred</b> to a fresh continuous-phase fluid {{that is the same}} as that inside the droplets. The resultant structures, which we call “col-loidosomes, ” are hollow, elastic shells whose permeability and elasticity can be precisely controlled. The generality and robustness of these structures and their potential for cellular immunoisolation are demonstrated by the use of a variety of solvents, particles, and contents. Efficient encapsulation of active ingredients such as drugs, proteins, vitamins, flavors, gas bubbles, or even living cells is becoming increasingly important {{for a wide variety of}} applications and technologies, ranging fro...|$|R
