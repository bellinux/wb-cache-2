40|$|An {{expert system}} for amino acid {{sequence}} identification has been developed. The algorithm uses heuristic rules developed by human experts in protein sequencing. The system {{is applied to the}} chromatographic data of phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids acquired from an automated sequencer. The peak intensities in the current cycle are compared with those in the previous cycle, while the calibration and succeeding cycles are used as ancillary identification criteria when necessary. The retention time for each chromatographic peak in each cycle is corrected by the corresponding peak in the calibration cycle at the same run. The main improvement of our system compared with the onboard software used by the Applied Biosystems 477 A Protein/Peptide Sequencer is that each peak in each cycle is assigned an <b>identification</b> <b>name</b> according to the corrected retention time to be used for the comparison with different cycles.

Since much of this data will be in the form of speech from various sources, it becomes important to develop the technologies necessary for indexing and browsing such audio data. This paper describes some of the requisite speech and language technologies that would be required and introduces an effort aimed at integrating these technologies into a system, called Rough’n’Ready, which indexes speech data, creates a structural summarization, and provides tools for browsing the stored data. The technologies highlighted in this paper include speaker-independent continuous speech recognition, speaker segmentation and <b>identification,</b> <b>name</b> spotting, topic classification, story segmentation, and information retrieval. The system automatically segments the continuous audio input stream by speaker, clusters audio segments from the same speaker, identifies speakers known to the system, and transcribes the spoken words. It also segments the input stream into stories, based on their topic content, and locates the names of persons, places, and organizations. These structural features are stored in a database and are used to construct highly selective search queries for retrieving specific content from large audio archives.

The polycubes have since been stored for almost 40 years at the Hanford Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) after failure of two processes to reclaim the plutonium and uranium oxides from the polystyrene matrix. Thermal decomposition products from this highly cross-linked polystyrene matrix were characterized using Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) system coupled to a horizontal furnace. The decomposition studies were performed in air and helium atmospheres at about 773 K. The volatile and semi-volatile organic products for the radiation-damaged polystyrene were different compared to virgin polystyrene. The differences were in the number of organic species generated and their concentrations. In the inert (i. e., helium) atmosphere, the major volatile organic products identified (in order of decreasing concentrations) were styrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, nathphalene, propane,. alpha. -methylbenzene, indene and 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene. But in air, the major volatile organic species identified changed slightly. Concentrations of the organic species in the inert atmosphere were significantly higher than those for the air atmosphere processing.

40|$|A problemÃtica da comunicaÃÃo com o cego Ã observada durante a atuaÃÃo profissional do enfermeiro. Este, desde a graduaÃÃo, nÃo Ã preparado para as especificidades desta deficiÃncia. Apesar de existir estudos sobre a cegueira, a relaÃÃo dela com o processo comunicativo ainda tem lacunas, particularmente porque o cego possui uma barreira sensorial capaz de comprometer as informaÃÃes recebidas durante a assistÃncia de enfermagem ao paciente. Este estudo se justifica pela necessidade do enfermeiro utilizar constantemente a comunicaÃÃo verbal no procedimento de assistÃncia e, para tanto, precisar conhecer os princÃpios e conceitos referentes ao processo comunicativo. Quando essa comunicaÃÃo ocorre entre o enfermeiro e o cego, Ã importante ressaltar sua peculiaridade, no intuito de que o profissional desenvolva habilidades de comunicaÃÃo para efetivar uma assistÃncia de qualidade. Diante destas exigÃncias, teve-se como objetivo geral analisar a comunicaÃÃo verbal entre o enfermeiro e o cego diabÃtico Ã luz da teoria de Roman Jakobson e como objetivos especÃficos identificar o remetente da interaÃÃo na comunicaÃÃo entre o enfermeiro, o cego diabÃtico e o acompanhante, e traÃar o perfil do remetente segundo as funÃÃes conativa e emotiva, o referencial, o contato e o cÃdigo. Ã um estudo descritivo e exploratÃrio, com abordagem quantitativa, realizado em um centro especializado em {{diabetes}} e hipertensÃo da cidade de Fortaleza, CearÃ. Trata-se de instituiÃÃo de referÃncia estadual em atenÃÃo Ã saÃde, com atendimento especializado a diabÃticos e hipertensos. Os sujeitos do estudo foram cegos, de ambos os olhos, atendidos nesse centro especializado, alÃm dos seus acompanhantes e as enfermeiras da instituiÃÃo. A coleta de dados foi realizada durante a consulta de enfermagem a diabÃticos, presentes a pesquisadora, a enfermeira, o cego e um possÃvel acompanhante. Para registros dos dados usaram-se filmagens realizadas, nos meses de fevereiro e marÃo de 2005. Anteriormente as filmagens, a pesquisadora entrevistou o cego, e colheu dados de identificaÃÃo (nome, idade, sexo, naturalidade, tempo de tratamento para controle de diabetes, tempo de acompanhamento na instituiÃÃo) e o interrogou acerca de como e quando adquiriu a cegueira. Isso ocorreu na sala de espera, antes do paciente ser consultado. As filmagens foram feitas durante a consulta de enfermagem, cuja duraÃÃo, em mÃdia, foi de 19 minutos. Foram realizadas cinco filmagens, analisadas por trÃs juÃzes- enfermeiras. As cenas foram analisadas a cada 15 segundos, quando ocorria uma pausa no vÃdeo e registro no instrumento de anÃlise de dados. No total analisaram-se 1. 131 interaÃÃes verbais entre o enfermeiro, o cego e o acompanhante. Como resultado dessas interaÃÃes, observou-se que o enfermeiro assumiu o papel de remetente da comunicaÃÃo em 57, 8 %, enquanto o cego em 20 %. No relacionado Ã variÃvel vocativo, prevaleceu o indicador modo de aÃÃo em 66, 2 % da comunicaÃÃo. Em relaÃÃo ao conteÃdo das informaÃÃes, sobressaÃram as orientaÃÃes em 85, 4 %, onde o canal mais utilizado foi a audiÃÃo (53 %), seguida da visÃo (40, 6 %). Durante as consultas, a linguagem mais utilizada foi a comum (96, 1 %). Para o cego, prevaleceu a comunicaÃÃo de assuntos pessoais (42 %), enquanto para a enfermeira (59, 8 %), prevaleceu o tratamento. As funÃÃes emotivas mais comuns nas interaÃÃes foram as de solidariedade, satisfaÃÃo, tranqÃilidade e empatia. Segundo se concluiu, o enfermeiro, nesse cenÃrio de atuaÃÃo, ainda precisa desenvolver habilidades de comunicaÃÃo. Mesmo encontrando aspectos positivos durante a comunicaÃÃo verbal, foi constatado que o cego tem necessidade de verbalizar aspectos desvalorizados pelo profissional e que a enfermeira deve conhecer e valorizar as especificidades relativas ao atendimento a essas pessoas. Sugeriu-se, ao final, a ampliaÃÃo de pesquisas voltadas para a comunicaÃÃo entre enfermeiros e pessoas cegas com o objetivo de otimizar a assistÃncia. The {{issue of}} communicating with blind patients is observed during the professional performance of the nurses, who, since their undergraduate studies on blindness, is relationship with the communication process still presents some gaps. It is acknowledged that the blind patient presents a sensorial barrier that can compromise the information received during the nursing attendance to the patient. This study is justified by the nurseâs necessity of using verbal communication at all times during the attendance procedure and, for that matter, the necessity of knowing the principles and concepts which refer to the communication process. When this communication process takes place between the nurse and the blind patient, {{it is important to}} emphasize is specificity, making the professional develop communication skills to put into effect na assistance of quality. The general aim has been to analyze the verbal communication between the nurse and the diabetic blind patient in the light of Roman Jakobsonâs theory and, the specific aims, to identify the addresser of the interaction in the communication between the nurse, the diabetic blind patient and his/her companion, and to outline the addresserâs profile according to the conative function, to the emotive function, the referential, the contact and the code. This is a descriptive and exploratory study, which has utilized a quantitative approach, carried out in a specialized center in diabetes and hypertension in the city Fortaleza, CearÃ. This institution is a State reference in health care, provinding specialized attendance to diabetic and hypertensive patients. The subjects center blind peeple presenting blindness in both eyes, who are attended at this specialized center, their companions to diabetic patients, where the researcher, the nurse, the blind patient and a possible companion werw present. The data were recorded through video recording, in February anda March of 2005. Before the video recording, the researcher interviewed the blind patient, collecting data for <b>identification</b> (<b>name,</b> age, sex, city of birth, time of treatment for the control of diabetes, times of attendance in the institution), inquiring also about how and went blind. That took place in the waiting room, before the pacientâs examination. The video recordings were performed during the nursing attendance, lasting, on average, 19 minutes. Five video recordings were performamed, analyzed by three nurse-referees. The scenes were analyzed every 15 seconds, when there was a pause on the video and entry on the data analysis instrument. A total of 1131 verbal interactions between the nurse, the blind patient and the companion were analyzed. As a result of those interactions, it was observed that the nurse took upon himself the role of addresser of the communication in 57. 8 %, while the blind patient did it in 20 %. In what reagards the vocative variable, the mode of action prevailed in 66. 2 % of the communication. In what concerns the cotent of the information, guidance stood out in 85. 4 %, were the most utilized channel was hearing (53 %), followed by sight (40. 6 %). The most employed language during the attendance was the common type ((96. 1 %). To the blind patient, the communication of person matters prevailed (42 %), while to the nurse it was the treatment (59. 8 %). The most common emotive fuctions in the interactions were those of sympathy, satisfaction, tranquility and empathy. It has been concluded that the nurse, in the performance setting, still needs to develop communication skills. Even as positive aspects have been found during verbal communication, it has been ascertained that the blind patient das the necessity of verbalizing, aspects that were undervalued by the health professional, and the nurse needs to know and appreciate the specificd related to the attendance to those people. It has been suggested in the end the expansion of studies on the communication bteween the nurses and the blind patients, having as na aim to optimize the attendance...|$|E
