5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> the same area, for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> horizontal flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E

5|$|Dyestuffs {{including}} carmine (cochineal), shellac, and kermes {{have been}} made from the bodies of <b>insects.</b> <b>In</b> classical times, Tyrian purple was extracted from sea snails such as Stramonita haemastoma (Muricidae) for the clothing of royalty, as recorded by Aristotle and Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} maggots such as blowfly larvae (gentles) and {{bluebottle}} larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for carnivorous animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds It {{has been suggested}} that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> their food, and the use of <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.|$|E

5|$|The broadbills are small, brightly {{coloured}} birds, which feed on {{fruit and}} also take <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> flycatcher fashion, snapping their broad bills. Their habitat is canopies of wet forests.|$|E
5|$|The flycatchers {{are small}} birds that fly {{out from a}} perch to catch <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> the air or from the ground. There are about 120 species worldwide, 11 {{of which have been}} {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|The green huntsman spider {{is green}} {{due to the}} {{presence}} of bilin pigments in the spider's hemolymph (circulatory system fluids) and tissue fluids. It hunts <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> green vegetation, where it is well camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Among the <b>insects,</b> <b>in</b> both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, a {{butterfly}} was seen as the personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the praying mantis was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targetedâ€”conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|Echolocating bats {{follow an}} infinity-point path when hunting <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> the dark. This {{is not for}} {{camouflage}} but for {{the efficiency of the}} resulting path, so the strategy is generally called constant absolute target direction (CATD); it is equivalent to CBDR but allowing for the target to manoeuvre erratically.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} dragonfly populations across the world, {{for example in}} Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands {{were lost in the}} 20th century, so its dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields, ponds, and creeks. Dragonflies feed on pest <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> rice, acting as a natural pest control. Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa, and represent a conservation priority.|$|E

5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} males, are territorial. Some {{defend a}} territory against others {{of their own}} species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against <b>insects</b> <b>in</b> unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there.|$|E
