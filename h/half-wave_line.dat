40|$|This paper {{provides}} additional theoretical {{information on}} half-wave-length power transmission. The analysis is rendered more general by consideration {{of a natural}} <b>half-wave</b> <b>line</b> instead of a short line tuned to half-wave. The effects of line loading and its power factor on the voltage and current profiles {{of the line and}} ganerator excitation have been included. Some of the operating problems such as charging of the line and synchronization of the half-wave system are also discussed. The inevitability of power-frequency overvoltages during faults is established. Stability studies have indicated that the use of switching stations is not beneficial. Typical swing curves are also presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA tunable 9. 6 GHz to 11. 7 GHz {{bandstop filter}} is presented. Tuning is done using RF-MEMS {{structures}} with analogical capacitance variation, from 25 fF to 225 fF [1]. The filter is a 2 pole design, based on ring resonators coupled on a 50 Ohms micro-strip transmission line. A <b>half-wave</b> <b>line</b> is arranged {{between the two}} resonators, to optimize microwave performances with a zero reflection mode, and minimizes the out of band losses. The measured performances are - 35 dB of rejection at 9. 6 GHz, shifting to - 42 dB at 11. 7 GHz. The losses below the rejected band are less than - 1 dB. This device has also been measured under variable RF power and has shown handling at 6 W...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT ⎯ This letter {{proposes a}} band-pass filter (BPF) with two {{transmission}} zeros {{based on a}} combination of parallel coupling and end coupling of <b>half-wave</b> transmission <b>lines.</b> The fabricated BPF exhibited a narrow bandwidth and two transmission zeros near the pass-band due to the end-coupled and shielding waveguide. At the center operation frequency of 60 GHz, the 20 dB bandwidth of the BPF is 1. 0 GHz, which is almost 2 % of the center operation frequency, and the insertion loss is 3. 12 dB. Two transmission zeros reach approximately 40 dB at 58. 5 and 62. 5 GHz. The simulation results almost agree with the measured results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical method for {{the calculation of}} electric circuits with distributed parameters with losses that may vary over time. It is proposed to use the energy integral in order to estimate the accuracy of numerical solutions. The elaborated numerical scheme, named Albatross, is conservative with minimal dissipation and dispersion. These properties lead {{to the fact that}} the computational error does not accumulate, that gives the possibility to realize the transparent calculations of non stationary solutions without loss of accuracy at large time intervals corresponding to 300 … 500 electromagnetic wave runs along the line length right up to steady-state regime. The results of calculations for non-homogeneous circuits with distributed parameters are presented graphically. These results can be used as a model to develop new approximate methods for numerical solution of electrotechnical problems. The solutions of these problems have been obtained by means of operator method, complex amplitude method, Fourier method as well as by numerical method Albatross. The results of calculations for various modes in the <b>half-wave</b> transmission <b>line</b> are represented. The comparison between the physical and mathematical experiments in analyzing of different regimes in <b>half-wave</b> electrical transmission <b>line</b> is represented. The comparison of accuracy of the solutions obtained by proposed method, by Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method and by Godunov’s scheme for telegraph equations is carried out. It is illustrated, that FDTD method has some limited application for solving the telegraph equations in spite of the fact that it is of second order of accuracy...|$|R
