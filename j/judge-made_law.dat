500|$|During Hale's {{period as}} a {{barrister}} and judge, the general conclusion in England {{was that the}} repository {{of the law and}} conventional wisdom was not politics, as in Renaissance Europe, but the common law. This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke, who in his Institutes and practice as a judge advocated <b>judge-made</b> <b>law.</b> Coke asserted that <b>judge-made</b> <b>law</b> had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, [...] "a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics". This principle was known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's theory meant that certainty of the law and [...] "intellectual beauty" [...] was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable. John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law {{was nothing more than a}} contract made by the English people; this is known as the [...] "appeal to contract". Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke's theory. Along with Francis Bacon, he argued for natural law, created by the King's authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke's [...] "reason" [...] (the method used by lawyers) but through understanding the King's instructions. While the judges did make law, this was only valid because it was [...] "tacitly confirmed (because not disapproved) by the [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|In turn, {{allowing}} {{federal courts}} {{to make up}} their own independent <b>judge-made</b> <b>law</b> only made the problem worse. [...] Parties who felt disadvantaged by a state judge-made rule could create diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts by simply moving to another state or reincorporating there (if a party was a corporation). [...] In the worst cases a party who had lost in the state supreme court would simply begin all over again in federal courts; since the federal district court had its own set of common law rules, it could hold it was not bound by the state supreme court ruling.

2500|$|Common law [...] (also {{known as}} {{judicial}} precedent or <b>judge-made</b> <b>law</b> or case law) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals. (Black's Law Dictionary {{is the main}} legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.) This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts. In this connotation, [...] "common law" [...] distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most Anglo-American jurisdictions includes [...] "statutory law" [...] enacted by a legislature, [...] "regulatory law" [...] (in the U.S.) or “delegated legislation” (in the U.K.) promulgated by executive branch agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or [...] "case law", i.e., decisions issued by courts (or quasi-judicial tribunals within agencies).

2500|$|The Court is most {{vulnerable}} and comes nearest to illegitimacy when {{it deals with}} <b>judge-made</b> constitutional <b>law</b> having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution....

2500|$|By {{contrast}} to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example {{to create a}} new cause of action that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the tort of wrongful death, which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or estate, to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of <b>judge-made</b> <b>law</b> unless such statute should violate some [...] "second order" [...] constitutional law provision (cf. judicial activism).|$|E
2500|$|By 1938, as Justice Brandeis acknowledged, [...] "the mischievous {{results of}} the {{doctrine}} had become apparent." [...] The problem with Swift was that rather than reducing forum shopping, it had only increased it by increasing the opportunities for forum shopping available to litigants. [...] There were two underlying issues behind this. [...] First, as the Erie opinion noted, nothing in the Constitution actually grants jurisdiction to the federal judiciary to conduct plenary review of issues of state common law where no federal issue is present. [...] Second, in accordance with that understanding (although this latter point was not noted in the Erie opinion), Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 only authorized the Supreme Court to review those state supreme court decisions that rejected federal claims. [...] While Congress broadened the scope of Supreme Court review in 1914 to include state supreme court decisions allowing federal claims, Congress never actually authorized the Supreme Court to conduct plenary review of the merits of state law claims (and no one ever sought a constitutional amendment that would authorize Congress to do that). [...] This meant the Supreme Court could not directly dictate uniform rules of state common law to all state courts or reverse their decisions for failing to apply such rules, which stands {{in stark contrast to}} other common law federations like Australia and Canada whose highest courts do possess such powers. [...] Since state courts had no actual obligation to follow the [...] "general law" [...] independently formulated under Swift by federal courts, state <b>judge-made</b> <b>law</b> continued to diverge instead of converge.|$|E
2500|$|Equity {{is a body}} {{of rules}} that {{developed}} in England separately from the [...] "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the <b>judge-made</b> <b>law</b> if he thought it equitable to do so. This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to {{take good care of}} the entrusted property. In the early case of Keech v Sandford [...] a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford {{that he did not want}} the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote, ...|$|E

40|$|Once colonised by the British, Malaysia {{inherited}} the British {{political and legal}} system, as well as written and <b>judge-made</b> <b>laws.</b> We trace {{the development of the}} law on the shareholders’ oppression remedy in Malaysia, and compare it with the development in England. We found that the influence of English case laws is still very pervasive in the courtroom. The reasons for this includes, among others, the use of a company law statute based on the British statute, the reliance of English case laws and other legal materials, the legal training of members in the legal profession, as well as the use of the English legal tradition and the English language in the Malaysian courtroom. We conclude that despite a similarity in the written law, the sharing of a common legal heritage and a propensity by Malaysian lawyers and judges to use English laws, the laws as applied by the courts in Malaysia is not identical to the law in England. There was a desire to keep up with English developments, but in the whole the Malaysian courts {{have not been able to}} keep pace. In the courtroom, the lack of resources and expertise are probably the main factors contributing to the underdevelopment of the law. The propensity to rely on the reforms in other countries with little emphasis to the peculiarity in the local environment has undermined law reform. We argue that an effective law-making process and legal institutions are as important as the law itself...|$|R
