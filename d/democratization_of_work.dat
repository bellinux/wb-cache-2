Predominantly in the USA, the {{business}} case for organiza-tional democracy has recently emerged {{out of new}} wave management and {{is characterized by a}} communitarian challenge to the economic efficiency of hierarchical modes of organizational governance. It presents democra-tization as a pragmatic remedial device to counter the symptoms of employee alienation and ameliorate the organizational problems asso-ciated with destabilized capitalism. This paper outlines the origins and nature of {{the business}} case for organizational democracy through a com-parison with new wave management; uncovers its underlying rationale in terms of an array of constitutive assumptions that justify and differentiate its prescriptions for the workplace; and considers the implications of using a business case to legitimate the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> organizations. It concludes by outlining the paradoxes inherent in the business case and suggests that, rather than appropriating the business case’s functionalist teleology, it is at the interconnection of politics, ethics and knowledge, together with more consideration of the values and particularism which underpin trust in hierarchy, whence organizational democracy can best gather its rationale and legitimization. Key words. governance; new wave management; organizational democracy; participation The remorseless spread of capitalist democracy has been heralded as the ultimate stage of development of economic and political institution...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study was the {{relationship}} between quality of work life and satisfaction with definite job attributes in regard to job contents and work environment. The quality of work life into organizations is explained based on the tendencies for humanization of work environments and <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> relations. Three general dimensions established in series of Moos’s researches (1974, 1981, 1994; Young 1998; Teh 1999) of psychosocial aspects in different settings- educational, health-care, military, economic, service, universities, prisons etc. are considered as characteristics of each work environment. Basic environmental dimensions include: Relationship Dimensions (peer cohesion, involvement etc.) which identify the nature and the intensity of personal relations in the environment and evaluate the degree of involvement in the environment as well as the degree of mutual support; Personal Growth Dimensions (professional interest, etc.) that evaluate main directions along which personal growth and self- enhancement are directed to realization of environmental goals; and System Maintenance and Change Dimensions (innovation, clarity, etc.) which encompass the degree of order in the setting, clarity of expectations, maintenance of control and adjustment to changes. Motivators are treated as factors of job satisfaction whilst unfavorable hygiene factors cause job dissatisfaction in work environment (Hertzberg 197, according McKenna 2000) ...|$|E

Some alternatives are pointed {{with respect to the}} humanization of the practice centered in the worker, admitting the commitment with the ambience and improvement <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> conditions.

40|$|This essay {{analyses}} the asymmetrical {{relationship between}} the time of scientific research {{and the time of}} the different segments interested in their results, focusing mainly on necessity to establish technical consensus about the fields of science that require rigorous investigations and texts. In the last years, civil society sectors - mainly scientific journalism, legislative power, and public opinion - has shown growing interest in participating of the decision making process that regulates science routes. In this study, we analyzed the decision making process of the Biosafety Law, as it allows research with embryonic stem cells in Brazil. The results allow us to conclude that this asymmetrical {{relationship between the}} different times (of science, scientific disclosure, public opinion, and public power) contribute to the maturing of the dialog on scientific policies, {{as well as to the}} establishment of a consensus concerning science routes, which aims at the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> scientific <b>work...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fischer alleged the German {{government}} {{hoped to}} use external expansion and aggression to check internal dissent and <b>democratization.</b> Some <b>of</b> his <b>work</b> {{is based on}} Theobald von Bethmann-Hollwegs Septemberprogramm which laid out Germanys war aims. Controversially, Fischer asserted {{a version of the}} Sonderweg thesis that drew a connection between aggression in 1914 and 1939. Fischer was later to call Bethmann-Hollweg the [...] "Hitler of 1914". Fischer prompted the Primat der Innenpolitik ("primacy of domestic politics") school, emphasizing domestic German political factors. Some prominent scholars in this school include Imanuel Geiss, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Wolfgang Mommsen and Volker Berghahn.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Wiki technologies, {{which are}} popular in social settings, are {{beginning}} to contribute to more flexible and participatory approaches to the exploitation of knowledge in corporate settings. Through the lens of activity theory, this paper aims to investigate contentious challenges to organizational activities that {{may be associated with}} the introduction of corporate wikis, in particular the potential <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>work.</b> Design/methodology/approach: From a study of several cases of corporate wiki adoption, this paper presents and interprets two representative cases sampled to provide more generalized results. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews and observation. The analysis followed a systematic process of data reduction, display, and rich interpretation using the concepts of activity theory. Findings: This research provides new understandings of the undervalued activities of knowledge workers, their challenges as wiki users and resulting implications for organizational transformation and improved organizational performance. Research limitations/implications: There is potential bias and limited scope as the choice of cases was determined through organizations known to the researchers and involved some action research. However, the authors justify this approach for a dynamic, emergent topic worthy of immediate investigation and direct applicability of findings to corporate practice. Social implications: This paper addresses the implications of new Web 2. 0 technologies for the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> knowledge management in the workplace. Originality/value: The novelty <b>of</b> this <b>work</b> lies in using activity theory to explore reasons why some organizations are more successful than others in implementing wikis.

The work maps socioeconomic development of the Ottoman Empire and Turkey, the influence of specific Turkish values on this development and the political efforts to modernize the system. On the basis of this analyse, it evaluates Turkish potencial for adoption of new values and their application for modernization and <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> society. <b>Work</b> also analyses values of Turkish people, discovered by various opinion polls, and compares them with the standards of the EU. Consequently, it explains the differences in values by analysis of Turkish ideologies and the cleavages between them. Eventually, the work maps ideological fundamentals of contemporary Turkish political system, their reflection in Constitution, laws and political practice. It also concentrates on ideologies and goals of Turkish political parties and movements, their influence on Turkish society and their compatibility with the standards of the EU. The principal aim of this analysis is to evaluate influence of specific Turkish ideologies on Turkish political and economic development and fulfilment of political standards of the EU...|$|R

Primarily, the advantages <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy in the conditions of new technologies are explained. It is shown how increasing influence of non state players decreases the monopoly of state players. It is suggested that media and social network are catalysts of democracy. On the other hand, negative effects <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy in the conditions of new technologies are analyzed. The new technology as potential source of propaganda and vulgarization is described. Finally, although there are disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy in the conditions of new technologies, it is concluded the advantages surpass the disadvantages.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the internet, including developments such as Web 2. 0, has led to new relationship realities between organizations and their stakeholders. One manifestation of these complex new realities has been the emergence <b>of</b> an internet-based <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> brand management. Research about this phenomenon has so far mainly focused on investigating just one or more individual themes and thereby disregarded the inherent multi-layered nature <b>of</b> the internet-based <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> brand management as a holistic, socio-technological phenomenon. The aim {{of this paper is}} to address this limitation through an investigation of the various socio-technological <b>democratization</b> developments <b>of</b> the phenomenon. To achieve this aim, a balanced and stakeholder-oriented perspective on brand management has been adopted to conduct an integrative literature review. The review reveals three key developments, which together form the essential parts of the phenomenon: (I) the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> internet technology, (II) the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> information, and (III) the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> social capital. The insights gained help to clarify the basic structures of the multi-layered phenomenon. The findings contribute also to the substantiation of a call for a new brand management paradigm: one that takes not only company-initiated but also stakeholder-initiated brand management activities into accoun...|$|R

40|$|In {{my paper}} I have {{examined}} the United Nations role in the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo. In order to complete this purpose I have asked two questions • How has the UN contributed to the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo {{that has taken place}} so far? • What advantages and/or disadvantages has the UN presence in Kosovo had from a democratic perspective? The method I have used in my paper is a qualitative one, and more specified a qualitative text analysis. This means that I have examined a rather small number of sources, but in return I have analyzed these sources very carefully. In addition to the choice of a qualitative method I have used Robert A. Dahl’s theory about polyarcy as a definition of democracy. The results from my analysis are that the UN has done some <b>work</b> in favour <b>of</b> the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo, but the UN has also acted in a way which restrains <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo in many ways. The main reason why the UN hinders the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> Kosovo is it’s unwillingness to let go of its power over the region to the local officials...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{comprehend}} how the mobile phone and the Internet change power relations between {{citizens and the}} state, by assessing the possibilities they allow for in terms of Gramsci's theory of hegemony, which explores class struggles and domination. It illustrates this theoretical position with a case study analysis of Zimbabwe. This way, it hopes to give a better explanation of diverging outcomes in terms of empowerment of citizens vis-à-vis their government. The paper addresses the ambiguous theoretical and empirical relationship between digitally networked technologies (DNTs) and democratization. It argues for an analytical distinction between <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> public discourse, <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> opportunities for collective action, and <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> political decision-making. Synthesizing theories of liberation technologies, theories of alternative and participatory discourse, and Gramsci's theory of hegemony, this paper warns for technological deterministic thinking about DNTs' impact on the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> discourse and the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity for collective action. It further contends that, even if both types <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> are realized, the <b>democratization</b> <b>of</b> political decision-making does not necessarily follow. Applying this theoretical synthesis {{to the case of}} Zimbabwe, this paper argues that the proliferation of DNTs, although having powerful effects, is but one factor that has changed power relations in Zimbabwe since independence. DNTs expand the number and reach of alternative discourses and can be a key campaigning tool for opposition politics but the standards upheld in DNTs-enabled communication seem to foster further polarization. Expanding spaces for counter-hegemonic forces and increasing popular acceptance of human rights discourses have limited the manoeuvrability of the Mugabe regime. Whether this will suffice to bring about real political change, however, will depend on the regime's continued successfulness in making apparent as opposed to real concessions...|$|R
