After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone <b>does</b> <b>something</b> he does not like, they will hear about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E

Examples include judo, gliding, modern pentathlon, figure skating and sailing.|$|E

25|$|Young {{contended that}} he was merely acting {{for the state of}} Minnesota when he sought to enforce its laws. The Court disagreed, holding that when a state {{official}} <b>does</b> <b>something</b> that is unconstitutional, the official cannot possibly be doing it {{in the name of the}} state, because the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution means that the Constitution overrides all the laws of the states, invalidating any contrary laws. Therefore, when a state official attempts to enforce an unconstitutional law, that individual is stripped of his official character. He becomes merely another citizen who can constitutionally be brought before a court by a party seeking injunctive relief.|$|E
25|$|Bonario, {{a wealthy}} but mild-mannered {{merchant}} and former widower, is now married to Ciprigna. Much {{younger than her}} husband, Ciprigna is vain, capricious, and bullying. Bonario's children from his first marriage, Valerio and Isabella, and his servants, Fiuta the major domo and Cilia the maid, are so exasperated by her behaviour that they confront Bonario and threaten to leave his house unless he <b>does</b> <b>something</b> to curb his new wife's antics. Giglio, Ciprigna's fawning and flamboyant cavaliere servente, arrives and pays court to her. Their encounter in the garden is observed by Bonario, his children, and the servants. Bonario prepares a speech which he plans to deliver to Ciprigna {{in an attempt to}} reassert his authority but accidentally drops it. When she finds it, the outraged Ciprigna unbraids her husband in a lengthy tirade. Fiuta reproves his master for cowardice.|$|E

25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in Ties That Bind, as in the original game, concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations often involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of Blackmore, the game's antagonist, urging him to kill them. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act, and Blackmore, who will praise him if he <b>does</b> <b>something</b> evil. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both his own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil. There is also a morality gauge in the menu, which shows exactly where Torque's morality is currently positioned.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in The Suffering concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he <b>does</b> <b>something</b> evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he can turn the chair on to torture an inmate strapped to it (bad morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both Torque's own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality.

[...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E

500|$|As a god, {{the player}} can teach their {{creature}} to perform {{tasks such as}} stocking the village store or performing miracles. The creature is taught what and when to eat, and how to attack or impress enemy villages. Fighting skills may be taught in one-on-one battles with other creatures; attack and defence abilities can be improved. Teaching is performed using a reinforcement learning system: if the creature <b>does</b> <b>something</b> the player does not want, it can be discourage with a slap. If the creature <b>does</b> <b>something</b> the player approves of, it can be stroked. The creature remembers the response to various actions and gradually changes its behaviour accordingly. With time and repetition, it can perform complex functions that allow it {{to serve as the}} player's avatar. Three types of leashes are used to command the creature to go to a specific place, and can be tied to a building to restrict movement. One leash encourages the creature to pay attention when actions are demonstrated; the others encourage either benevolent or malevolent behaviour. [...] The game reinforces the creature's choices and learning by providing visual feedback, and the creature has an alignment separate from the player's. Evil wolves sport glowing eyes and large fangs and claws; good ones turn a shade of purple and glow gently.|$|E
500|$|The PS2 and Wii {{versions}} received mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics, with the PS2 {{version of the}} game holding a 46% at GameRankings and a 51 out of 100 at Metacritic. The Wii version scored a bit higher, with a 53% at GameRankings and 53 out of 100 at Metacritic. The PS2 and Wii versions of Revenge of the Fallen were panned for having awful controls. Specifically, IGN stated that [...] "the game will often ignore {{what you want to}} do, and instead <b>does</b> <b>something</b> different", giving the game 4.2 out of 10. GameZone panned the controls of the Wii version, saying that [...] "control problems – among other missteps – ruined this game".|$|E
500|$|Several {{other critics}} have {{commented on the}} live-action sequence. Mediaite's Tommy Christopher wrote in a column that the episode was [...] "capped off by a pitch-perfect parody of The Muppet Show, but veered into adult humor {{that would make the}} Muppet-inspired pottymouths of Avenue Q blush." [...] He commented that the part where Moe thinks he is kissing Perry's bellybutton and she tells him not to stop [...] "has got to be a first on network television, {{breaking}} the dual taboos of oral sex and puppet-on-human conjugal bliss." [...] The segment was praised by Germain Lussier of /Film, who gave it {{as an example of how}} the show, [...] "every once in a while, [...] <b>does</b> <b>something</b> so outrageous, we all step back and marvel at their brilliance." [...] Joyce Eng and Kate Stanhope of TV Guide named the sequence the second top television moment of the week.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{negative}} and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but {{often it is}} considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault with something should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both [...] "do's" [...] and [...] "don't s". <b>Doing</b> <b>something</b> usually also implies not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else, and, not <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> often implies <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else. There is therefore a conscious choice [...] "to do this, or do that", but not {{both at the same}} time.|$|R

500|$|According to Black, Vala's {{motivation}} {{to hide her}} miraculous pregnancy by marrying the local villager Tomin (played by Tim Guinee) in late season 9 stems from [...] "genuinely car for the man.

[...] Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination. Throughout season 10, Vala has {{to come to terms}} with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by Morena Baccarin), well knowing from the beginning that Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought. Black believed Vala had to [...] "try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her", despite her own lack of maturity. When Vala meets her father Jacek (Fred Willard) in [...] "Family Ties", Vala shows [...] "a slightly more dramatic and vulnerable side" [...] that was new to the audience.|$|E

[...] She stated that she admired Sade because [...] "she stays true to her style no matter what... she's an amazing artist, an amazing performer... and I absolutely love her." [...] Aaliyah expressed she had always desired to work with Janet Jackson, whom she had drawn frequent comparison to over the course of her career, stating [...] "I admire her a great deal.

500|$|In May 1956 Bessie's {{concerns}} about the treatment of prisoners in Walton Prison led to an investigation by Sir Godfrey Russell Vick, which revealed numerous instances of violence {{by members of the}} prison staff, and brought about reforms. In July that year, during a home affairs debate, Bessie demanded tougher regulations on the supply and licensing of air pistols, which under the existing law were readily available to juveniles. She alarmed the house by brandishing two such pistols which, she explained, she had confiscated in the course of her duties as a juvenile court magistrate. When rebuked by the Deputy Speaker, she replied that she had deliberately used shock tactics, reprising her earlier council chamber argument that [...] "no one takes any notice unless someone <b>does</b> <b>something</b> which is out of order, or is unusual".
