5|$|Despite the scuffle, Eliza {{was part}} of the royal party who {{accompanied}} Lunalilo when he sailed to Kailua-Kona, in November 1873, the following month, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dry weather would improve his tuberculosis. However, the trip had no lasting effect on Lunalilo's health. After returning to Honolulu, Lunalilo succumbed to the disease and died on February 3, 1874.|$|E
5|$|During the autopsy, the {{pathologist}} of Princeton Hospital, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, removed Einstein's brain for preservation {{without the}} permission of his family, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neuroscience of the future {{would be able to}} discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; he simply {{occupied}} {{the land in}} <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States would eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers.

5|$|MacArthur {{expressed}} the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan {{by the end}} of the year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied that he could make one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.|$|E
5|$|While in Germany, Victoria {{showed an}} {{interest}} in the Nazi Party, which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movement might help restore the Russian monarchy. She and Kirill attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 and Victoria donated money to the party. She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party.|$|E

5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E
5|$|Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb {{developed}} a 4-minute pilot episode for Buffy the Animated Series, which was set during the show's first season.

Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series may be resurrected in some form.|$|E
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government would fall before {{he was forced to}} retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 an American {{newspaper}} {{published the}} allegation that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned {{in some way that}} 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance, and that he may have been identified as a visitor, he contrived to bring the Prince to the house on an innocent pretext in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E

5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as the murderer in the musical Jack the Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police will lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E
5|$|It was John's <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pope {{would give}} him {{valuable}} legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared {{himself to be a}} papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E

5|$|Over the decades, {{experimental}} condensed matter physicists {{have discovered}} a number of exotic states of matter, including superconductors and superfluids. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including Subir Sachdev <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AdS/CFT correspondence {{will make it possible}} to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in {{the hamlet}} of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, {{where he had}} spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery {{arranged}} the accommodations in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on The Dick Cavett Show—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
