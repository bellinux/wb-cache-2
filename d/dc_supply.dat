5|$|Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered Mir. The station used a 28volt <b>DC</b> <b>supply</b> which {{provided}} 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When {{the station was}} illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the nickel-cadmium storage batteries installed throughout the station. The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.|$|E

25|$|A second {{power station}} {{was built in}} the early 1920s, using water from a small {{concrete}} dam on the Swart Beck.

25|$|Fluorescent lamps can run {{directly}} from a direct current (<b>DC)</b> <b>supply</b> of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume about as much power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates {{at one end of}} the tube. Fluorescent lamps are (almost) never operated {{directly from}} DC for those reasons. Instead, an inverter converts the DC into AC and provides the current-limiting function as described below for electronic ballasts.|$|E
25|$|The LBSCR scheme, {{authorised}} in 1903, pioneered main-line rail electrification in the UK, and {{the first}} electric train ran on 1 December 1909. For the following three years, steam trains alternated with electrics, the latter operating every 15 minutes from 7.30am to midnight. Passenger numbers had fallen on introducing electric tramways in South London by 1.25million in six months. In {{the first year of}} the rival line's electric operation passengers increased from 4million to 7.5million. The electrification used the overhead system at 6700 V AC, supplied by a power station at Deptford. After creation of the Big Four railway companies, the Southern Railway installed standard third-rail 660 V <b>DC</b> <b>supply</b> on 17 June 1928.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{hydroelectric}} power station was built in 1890 just below the confluence of Red Tarn Beck and Glenridding Beck. The water for this came from Keppelcove Tarn, along a leat on the lower slopes of Catstye Cam to a wooden penstock about [...] above the power station. From there it was piped down to a water turbine driving a dynamo which produced a 600volt <b>DC</b> <b>supply.</b> Copper cables took this to the mine, through the Low Horse Level and down the Low Level Shaft to a switchroom in Warsop's Crosscut. As the mine deepened, power demands increased. In 1899 a second turbine and a 500volt dynamo was installed in the power station. The two power lines were kept separate, but the new one followed the same route into the mine, where {{it seems to have}} been used to power an air compressor. New equipment was put into the power station in 1911 to produce a 2,000 volt threephase AC supply. A transformer in Warsop's Crosscut converted this to 350volts for use in the mine, and to the 550volt <b>DC</b> <b>supply</b> needed for the existing motors.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{application of}} thyristors, with associated triggering diac, in consumer products related to stabilized power supplies within color television receivers {{in the early}} 1970s. [...] The stabilized high voltage <b>DC</b> <b>supply</b> for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device {{up and down the}} falling slope of the positive going half of the AC supply input (if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation). The precise switching point was determined by the load on the DC output supply, as well as AC input fluctuations.|$|E
2500|$|Replacement of {{the steam}} engines began in 1922, {{starting}} at Whitworth Street. Four [...] pumping engines were removed {{and replaced by}} electrically driven centrifugal pumps. The work was completed by 1924. The following year, the remaining [...] pumps were retained, but their steam cylinders were removed, and the flywheels replaced by a helical gear drive, to connect the pumps to [...] electric motors. These were variable speed direct current devices, and a motor converter set had to be installed, to provide the low voltage <b>DC</b> <b>supply</b> from the incoming high voltage alternating current supply. The motor converter set was built in 1914, and was second-hand. The pumps at the Water Street station were converted to electrical operation {{in a similar manner}} soon afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract–Dual {{two-level}} inverter topology is {{a simple}} structure able to produce multilevel output voltage wave-forms equivalent to a 3 -level inverter. Its modular structure consists of two standard two-level three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) <b>supplied</b> by two <b>dc</b> <b>supplies.</b> In case of two separate <b>dc</b> <b>supplies</b> an independent modulation of the two inverters can provide arbitrary power sharing between inverters in order to balance their dc voltages. However, proper multilevel voltage waveforms can be obtained only by relatively complex space vector modulation (SVM). This paper proposes two carrier-based modulation techniques for a dual two-level inverter with power sharing capability and proper multilevel voltage waveforms. Their main advantage {{is a simple}}r implementation compared to SVM. The proposed algorithms have been verified by numerical tests and preliminary implementation in an industrial DSP. I...|$|R
