50|$|NATO, {{through its}} <b>interoperability</b> <b>directive,</b> has {{recognized}} that widespread interoperability {{is a key}} component in achieving effective and efficient operations. In many of the operations world-wide in which NATO nations are engaged, they participate together {{with a wide variety}} of other organizations on the ground. Such organizations include coalition partners from non-NATO nations, Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs - e.g. Aid Agencies) and industrial partners. The NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) provides the necessary guidance and technical components to support project implementations and Federated Mission Networking.|$|E
40|$|Interoperability is a {{political}} priority as it comes to electronic tolling in Europe. The idea of numerous on board units behind the windscreen of European trucks is a true politicians nightmare. Still the number of on-board equipment (OBE) is increasing while the answer to stopping this, the European Electronic Tolling Service (EETS), is not taking off. In this paper the specific complexity of EETS and the <b>interoperability</b> <b>Directive</b> are looked at {{from the perspective of}} a public toll charger. This perspective is relevant because in many Member States motorways are publicly owned and operated, and road user charges consequently will be public money, often levied as a tax. These circumstances do not seem to match very well with the starting points of the Directive that more or less seems to presuppose private roads were private service providers can collect private service fees for the private toll chargers. In this paper the political and legal problems will be represented and put out for discussion...|$|E
40|$|The Agency {{has a role}} to help {{facilitate}} the procedure for authorising the placing in service 1 of vehicles and the harmonisation of the National Safety Authorities decision making processes for authorisation. This is particularly important in the transition phase until all the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) are complete and all networks and vehicles conform to the TSIs. In this context this report {{is part of a}} suite of initiatives intended to facilitate vehicle authorisation. These initiatives include: defining and maintaining the list of parameters to be checked for vehicle authorisation compiling and maintaining the Reference Document that: o lists the national rules for each parameter; o describes the national legal framework covering the authorisation procedure, and o records the equivalence of the various national rules for each parameter. The Agency, under the auspices of its Cross Acceptance Working Party, set about understanding and documenting the different existing national authorisation procedures, their commonalities and differences. The analysis also identified technical subject areas of authorisation that generated the most cost, time delay and uncertainty. It soon became clear that as well as determining the “status quo ” of authorisation procedures used today, it was essential to have a common understanding of the new procedure contained within the recast <b>Interoperability</b> <b>Directive.</b> This led to the initiative with the European Commission to document a common understanding {{in the form of a}} Commission Recommendation (known as DV 29 [2]). This part of the Agency report (Part 1) is one of three documents foreseen to cover the authorisation procedure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Satellite Control Reference Model {{that provides the}} basis for an approach to identify where standards would be beneficial in supporting space operations functions. The background and context {{for the development of}} the model and the approach are described. A process for using this reference model to trace top level <b>interoperability</b> <b>directives</b> to specific sets of engineering interface standards that must be implemented to meet these directives is discussed. Issues in developing a 'universal' reference model are also identified...|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{harmonisation}} {{of technical}} <b>interoperability</b> the EU <b>Directive</b> on Technical Standards and Regulations establishes {{a procedure that}} imposes an obligation on Member States to notify the Commission and each other of all draft technical regulations concerning products and information society services, including telemedicine, before they are adopted by national laws [1, 24].|$|R
40|$|The Directive 2007 / 2 /EC of the EU {{adopted in}} 2007 aims at {{establishing}} an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies and policies or activities {{which may have}} an impact on the environment [...] It cover spatial data sets related to one or more of the 34 themes listed in the INSPIRE annexes. Hydrography theme (HY) provides four application schemas that deliver a water spatial framework for mapping, reporting, modelling and spatial analysis purposes. An Oceanographic Geographical Features theme (OF) describes the physical and chemical characteristics of the sea and Sea Regions theme (SR) define marine areas of common features. Pool of the HY, OF and SR spatial data, makes an information system that integrates interoperable data on inland and coastal waters and provides core spatial data models that can support resolving water thematic issues. It can be applied on the national level, but as well as on the regional or European level. The data specifications for these themes are part of the Regulation on <b>interoperability</b> implementing INSPIRE <b>Directive</b> and further described in the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. JRC.
