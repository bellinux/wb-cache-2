40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} {{the results of the}} 150 % rated capacity load test performed by DynCorp Hoisting and Rigging on the CASTOR GSF special cask lifting beams. The two lifting beams were originally rated and tested at 20, 000 kg (44, 000 lb) by the cask manufacturer in Germany. The testing performed by DynCorp rated and tested the lifting beams to 30, 000 kg (66, 000 lb) + 0 %, - 5 %, for Hanford Site use. The CASTOR GSF cask, used to transport isotopic Heat Sources (canisters), must be lifted with its own designed lifting beam system (Figures 1, 2, and 3). As designed, the beam material is RSt 37 - 2 (equivalent to American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM] A- 570), the <b>eye</b> <b>plate</b> is St 52 - 2 (equivalent to ASTM A- 516), and the lifting pin is St 50 (equivalent to ASTM A- 515). The beam has two opposing 58 mm (2. 3 in.) diameter by 120 mm(4. 7 in.) length, high grade steel pins that engage the cask for lifting. The pins have a manual locking mechanism to prevent disengagement from the casks. The static, gross weight (loaded) of the cask 18, 640 kg (41, 000 lb) on the pins prevents movement of the pins during lifting. This is due to the frictional force of the cask on the pins when lifting begins...|$|E

Embossing was done at 100 °C to prevent any damage on polycarbonate template. With embossing of moth eye nano-patterns, transmittance of PVC film was increased up to 6 % over 400 nm to 800 nm wavelength region. This embossed PVC film was then used as an imprint template after depositing thin layer of SiO 2 and self-assembled monolayer. Consequently, polymer based moth eye nano-patterns were formed on glass template after UV imprinting and its transmittance was increased from 90 % to 92 %...|$|R
