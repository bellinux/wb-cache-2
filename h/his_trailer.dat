5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the motel and finds Max inside <b>his</b> <b>trailer,</b> having an {{apparent}} epileptic seizure. As Mulder tends to Max, he discovers a mysterious scar behind Max's ear. Mulder reviews earlier X-Files, discovering similar scars on two reported alien abductees. Scully believes that whatever abduction experience Max had was a schizophrenic delusion, having noticed medication in <b>his</b> <b>trailer.</b> But Mulder believes that Max, despite his interest in UFOs, is completely unaware of his experiences and was guided to Townsend by his abductors {{on the night of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|Players begin Urus {{story in}} New Mexico near the Cleft, a deep fissure {{in the ground}} near the {{entrance}} to the D'ni caverns. A man who introduces himself as Zandi sits in front of <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> by the Cleft, encouraging the player to discover the environment and join the exploration. The player stumbles across a hologram of a woman, Yeesha, who {{tells the story of the}} D'ni and requests help to rebuild the civilization.|$|E
5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E
5000|$|Guerrero's {{trailers}} {{have received}} wide praise from columnists and film critics, from Time Magazine to Entertainment Weekly.

5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared <b>his</b> <b>trailer,</b> {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, however, McCarthy leaves Homer {{for another}} client. Without McCarthy {{to keep him}} in shape, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even <b>his</b> <b>trailer,</b> and the movie begins to go over budget. The studio {{executives}} and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful. The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged, upsetting and confusing the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie to the fans and say he liked the film. Though pleased by the offer, Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the movie online, and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) leaves <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear growling outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is nervous that he will reject her, and goes out to lunch with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E
5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson that Management had planned for Ben to kill him so all of his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the Usher, Ben's ultimate nemesis.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in <b>his</b> <b>trailer.</b> At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E

25|$|Two men who {{initially}} attracted police attention {{in connection with}} the murders were Fred Reynolds and Lorenzo Montoya.

Lorenzo Montoya lived less than three miles from the burial site. In 2006 there were reportedly tire tracks leading from <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> to the site.

25|$|Giske {{was sentenced}} to {{compulsory}} psychiatric care {{for the murder of}} Giskegjerde Schjetne on October 25. The court ruled in favour of the prosecution on all counts. The court ruled that while Giskegjerde Schjetne was walking home that on the evening of August 4, Giske had first struck Giskegjerde Schjetne with his car, seriously injuring her. He then kidnapped her and drove her to his mechanical workshop in Bryn. He placed her in <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> home, which was parked inside an derelict barn.|$|E

During the late hours of that same day, Bourque left his rented home, dressed in camouflage and carrying a rifle and a shotgun. He calmly walked down a road in <b>his</b> <b>trailer</b> park, passing several neighbours along the way.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} Guerrero's Premakes was {{born out of}} the {{perception}} that classic cinema is under appreciated. <b>His</b> <b>trailers</b> portray contemporary movies as direct extensions of old film serials, 50's B-movies, and other products of Hollywood's golden age. He authored the series as an attempt to preserve the audience for classic films. So far, he has re-imagined versions of such films as Forrest Gump (with James Stewart cast in the title role), The Avengers,Ghostbusters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pixar's Up, and The Empire Strikes Back. He also created a vampiric parody of Gone with the Wind.|$|R

Early on he struggles with an older truck that lacks heat, but another driver grants Tilcox {{the use of his}} brand new Volvo truck leased to Trinity Transport.

25|$|The sudden {{increase}} in popularity of Spock caused William Shatner, who portrayed Captain James T. Kirk, to be dismayed {{that he was}} not portraying the favourite character. Although he was being paid $5,000 an episode, plus a percentage of profits, and Nimoy was being paid $1,250 an episode, it was the latter who was receiving several sacks of fan mail a week. The fan mail figures were leaked to the press, angering Shatner. This animosity from Shatner increased when reporters from Time arrived at the studio and set up for a photoshoot around Nimoy's makeup chair. Shatner and James Doohan were also in the makeup room, and Doohan later recalled that once Shatner realised he was being ignored, he jumped from his chair, shouted that he was the Captain of the show and from then on he would have his makeup applied in <b>his</b> <b>trailer.</b> The popularity of Spock had built to the extent that gossip columnists in Hollywood spread rumours among agents that Shatner was going to be dropped from the series and replaced with Nimoy as the lead.|$|E

5000|$|In {{evaluating}} the fourth factor, courts often consider {{two kinds of}} harm to the potential market for the original work. First, courts consider whether the use in question acts as a direct market substitute for the original work. In Campbell, the Supreme Court stated that [...] "when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of {{the entirety of the}} original, it clearly supersedes the object of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur". In one instance, a court ruled that this factor weighed against a defendant who had made unauthorized movie trailers for video retailers, since <b>his</b> <b>trailers</b> acted as direct substitutes for the copyright owner's official trailers.|$|R
