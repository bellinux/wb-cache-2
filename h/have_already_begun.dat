5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain the forces of nature across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> to revive their leader, and have only to lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they fail in each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, {{published}} in 2008, {{claims to have}} replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization {{on the part of}} participants. The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> (as measured by the readiness potential). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{during the}} summer months can be challenging. Courses {{students}} have taken at their old schools may not fulfill the graduation requirements at their new school. Moving during the winter holidays or mid-year, however, has traditionally been viewed as the worst time to move. The student is forced to join classes that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun.</b> Social groups become even more difficult to break into, and activities that the student enjoyed may be barred to him or her. For example, an athlete {{may not be able to}} join his or her sport because they missed tryouts and the season had already begun. A student who excelled at their old DoDDS or DDESS school suddenly feels inadequate at the larger school. Recent studies, however, show that mobility during the school year may be less traumatic than summertime moves.|$|E
25|$|As of 2011, {{most of the}} U.S. {{car fleet}} was able to run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle {{manufacturers}} produced vehicles designed to run on more concentrated blends. As of 2015, seven states – Missouri, Minnesota, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington – required ethanol to be blended with gasoline in motor fuels. These states, particularly Minnesota, had more ethanol usage, and {{according to a source}} at Washington University, these states accumulated substantial environmental and economic benefits as a result. Florida required ethanol blends as of the end of 2010, but has since repealed it. Many cities had separate ethanol requirements due to non-attainment of federal air quality standards. In 2007, Portland, Oregon, became the first U.S. city to require all gasoline sold within city limits to contain at least 10% ethanol. Chicago has proposed the idea of mandating E15 in the city limits, while some area gas stations <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> offering it.|$|E

500|$|Aurora {{finally left}} Hobart, Tasmania, on 24 December 1914. On 16 January 1915 the shore party landed at McMurdo Sound, where Mackintosh {{established}} a base camp at Captain Scott's old headquarters at Cape Evans. Believing that Shackleton might <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> his march from the Weddell Sea, {{he was determined}} to begin depot-laying at once. [...] Joyce, the expedition's most seasoned Antarctic traveller—he had been with Scott's Discovery Expedition in 1901–04, and with the Nimrod Expedition—protested that the party needed time for acclimatisation and training, but was overruled. Joyce was shocked by the rebuff; he had expected that Mackintosh would defer to him on sledging matters: [...] "If I had Shacks here I would make him see my way of arguing", he wrote in his diary. The depot-laying journey which followed began with a series of mishaps. A blizzard delayed their start, a motor sledge broke down after a few miles, and Mackintosh and his group lost their way on the sea ice between Cape Evans and Hut Point. Conditions on the Barrier were harsh for the untrained and inexperienced men. Many of the stores taken on to the Barrier were dumped on the ice to reduce loads and did not reach the depots. After Mackintosh insisted, over Joyce's urgent protests, on taking the dogs all the way to 80°S, all died on the journey. The men, frostbitten and exhausted, returned to the old Discovery expedition hut at Hut Point on 24 March, but were cut off from the ship and from their Cape Evans base by unsafe sea ice [...] and had to wait, idle, for nearly three months. After this experience, confidence in Mackintosh's leadership was low, and bickering rife.|$|E
2500|$|Although Blake {{was yet to}} {{formulate}} his mythological system, several preliminary elements of that system are present in microcosm in Tiriel. According to Peter Ackroyd, [...] "the elements of Blake's unique mythology <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> to emerge. It is the primeval world of Bryant and of Stukeley, which he had glimpsed within engravings of stones and broken pillars." [...] Elements of his later mythology are thus manifested throughout the poem.|$|E

2500|$|Title VI, or the [...] "Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010", {{introduces}} the so-called [...] "Volcker Rule" [...] after former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker by amending the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. With {{the aim of}} {{reducing the amount of}} speculative investments on large firms' balance sheets, it limits banking entities to owning no more in a hedge fund or private equity fund than 3% of the total ownership interest. The total of all of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3% of the Tier 1 capital of the banking entity. Furthermore, no bank that has a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund, [...] "may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund" [...] without disclosing {{the full extent of the}} relationship to the regulating entity, and assuring that there is no conflict of interest. [...] "Banking entity" [...] includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries, and must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions. In response to the Volcker Rule and in anticipation of its ultimate impact, a number of commercial banks and investment banks operating as bank holding companies <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> to downsize or dispose of their proprietary trading desks.|$|E
