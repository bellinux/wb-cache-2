5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, {{a man who}} {{has been}} magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the <b>inquisitiveness</b> and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E
25|$|Steno's {{questioning}} mind {{also influenced}} his religious views. Having {{been brought up}} in the Lutheran faith, he nevertheless questioned its teachings, something which became a burning issue when confronted with Roman Catholicism while studying in Florence. After making comparative theological studies, including reading the Church Fathers and by using his natural observational skills, he decided that Catholicism, rather than Lutheranism, provided more sustenance for his constant <b>inquisitiveness.</b> In 1667, Steno converted to Catholicism on All Souls' Day when Lavinia Cenami Arnolfini, a noblewoman of Lucca, insisted.|$|E
25|$|Interpreters were {{recruited}} and {{examined by the}} respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: US, UK, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, {{as well as in}} special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopædic knowledge, <b>inquisitiveness,</b> as well as a naturally calm disposition.|$|E
25|$|Motivated {{in part by}} a businessman's {{desire to}} {{quantify}} the economics of the choice, and in part by his scientific <b>inquisitiveness,</b> he set out to determine which prime mover was more efficient. He discovered Joule's first law in 1841, that the heat which is evolved by the proper action of any voltaic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of that current, multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it experiences. He went on to realize that burning a pound of coal in a steam engine was more economical than a costly pound of zinc consumed in an electric battery. Joule captured the output of the alternative methods in terms of a common standard, the ability to raise one pound, a height of one foot, the foot-pound.|$|E
500|$|Common {{starlings}} may be kept as pets or as laboratory animals. Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz {{wrote of}} them in his book King Solomon's Ring as [...] "the poor man's dog" [...] and [...] "something to love", because nestlings are easily obtained from the wild and after careful hand rearing they are straightforward to look after. They adapt well to captivity, and thrive on a diet of standard bird feed and mealworms. Several birds may be kept in the same cage, and their <b>inquisitiveness</b> makes them easy to train or study. The only disadvantages are their messy and indiscriminate defecation habits {{and the need to}} take precautions against diseases that may be transmitted to humans. As a laboratory bird, the common starling is second in numbers only to the domestic pigeon.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlin {{was noted}} by colleagues at Utah {{for being a}} lifelong {{champion}} of the scientific method and instilling in his students ideas that natural processes must be used to explain human existence. Angus and Grace Woodbury wrote {{that one of his}} greatest cultural contributions was his ability [...] "to lead the naive student with fixed religious convictions gently around that wide gulf that separated him from the trained scientific mind without pushing him over the precipice of despair and illusion." [...] His influence continued as his students became teachers, gradually increasing societal understanding of evolution and naturalistic perspectives. His colleague and former student Stephen Durrant stated [...] "by word, and especially by precept, he taught us diligence, <b>inquisitiveness,</b> love of truth, and especially scientific honesty". Durrant compared Chamberlin to noted biologists such as Spencer Fullerton Baird and C. Hart Merriam in the scope of his contributions science.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street's creators {{recognized}} that television lent itself {{well to the}} use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. [...] One of the positive behaviors they modeled was <b>inquisitiveness</b> and the enjoyment of learning. [...] If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} {{received by the}} cast and crew for its representation of Torres' internal conflict over her half-human, half-Klingon identity. Biller identified the episode as his favorite of the three scripts he wrote for the show's first season; he also wrote [...] "Elogium" [...] and [...] "Jetrel". He viewed the scene depicting Torres' realization that she was human {{as one of the best}} from the episode. Dawson described the episode as a [...] "very big step for B'Elanna" [...] and appreciated that the script avoided a cliché ending by leaving room for Torres to deal with her internal identity struggles. Towards the end of Voyagers final season, she looked back on the episode as one of the show's highlights. Taylor and Beltran praised Dawson for her ability to play two contrasting characters; Beltran added that it was a great episode that showcased Dawson's abilities as an actor. While Kolbe initially found Dawson's <b>inquisitiveness</b> and frequent questions during filming to be a challenge, he felt that she did [...] "a hell of a job on that one". He enjoyed the completed version of the episode, but expressed disappointment with its ending.|$|E
2500|$|A {{man who is}} humble, steadfast, {{free from}} deceit and <b>inquisitiveness,</b> well disciplined, restrained, {{attentive}} to his study and duties, who loves the Law and keeps it, who is afraid of forbidden things and strives after the highest good–a man of such habits develops the red leśyā.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after {{entering}} elementary school {{he began to}} express a strong <b>inquisitiveness</b> about nature. Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone, {{at the age of}} five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer: ...|$|E
2500|$|Europe's Renaissance, {{beginning}} in the 14th century and extending into the 16th, consisted of the rediscovery of the classical world's scientific contributions, and {{of the economic and}} social rise of Europe. The Renaissance also engendered a culture of <b>inquisitiveness</b> which ultimately led to Humanism and the Scientific Revolution. Although it saw social and political upheaval and revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, the Renaissance is perhaps known best for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term [...] "Renaissance man." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{he claimed}} that his sense of wonder came from his father. In his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management {{tensions}} within New York's garment industry. Although he was awed by Carl's intellectual abilities, he took his son's <b>inquisitiveness</b> in stride and saw {{it as part of}} his growing up. In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors. Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking: ...|$|E
2500|$|Cioculescu's {{prestige}} {{continued to}} increase during the spell of liberalization corresponding to the early rule of Gheorghiu-Dej's successor Nicolae Ceauşescu. He was granted chairmanship of the Bucharest Faculty of Letters in 1965, holding it for ten years. During the same interval, he was also assigned chairmanship of the Romanian Academy Library, overseeing some of Romania's largest collections of books. According to his student, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu, Cioculescu established his reputation as [...] "an old fashion erudite" [...] among those who attended University during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was the hero of several anecdotes popular with students. Ştefănescu argues that {{this was part of}} a larger phenomenon, which implied the recovery of interwar culture by young intellectuals: [...] "For the world of communism, he miraculously personified the intellectual climate of the pre-war period. Not by accident, almost all the interviews he gave would obsessively return to questions about his advanced age, to the spiritual testament he dedicated to his followers and so on. This almost indecent <b>inquisitiveness</b> was explained not by the age as such, but by the feeling that the literary historian and critic belonged to another epoch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mirabeau's {{love affairs}} are well-known, {{owing to the}} celebrity of the letters to Marie Thérèse de Monnier, his [...] "Sophie". In spite of his {{disfigurement}} (or perhaps because of it), he won {{the heart of the}} lady to whom his colonel was attached; this led to such scandal that his father obtained a lettre de cachet, and Mirabeau was imprisoned in the Île de Ré. On being released, the young nobleman obtained leave to accompany the French expedition to Corsica as a volunteer. During the Corsican expedition, Mirabeau contracted several more gambling debts and engaged in another scandalous love affair. However, he proved his military genius in the Corsican expedition, and also conducted a thorough study of the island during his stay. The study was most likely factually incorrect, but his desire to learn of a country that had been previously unstudied emphasizes Mirabeau's endless curiosity and <b>inquisitiveness,</b> particularly into the traditions and customs of society. [...] Mirabeau learned the value of hard work in the French army. This aspect of Mirabeau's personality contributed to his popular success in later years, during the Revolution. After his return, he tried to keep on good terms with his father, and in 1772 he married a rich heiress, Marie–Marquerite–Emilie de Covet, daughter of the marquis de Marignane. Emilie, who was 18 years old, was apparently engaged to a much older nobleman, the Comte de Valbelle. Nonetheless, Mirabeau pursued her for several months, expecting that their marriage would benefit from the money that the couple would receive from their parents. After several months of failed attempts at being introduced to the heiress, Mirabeau bribed one of the young lady's maids to let him into her residence, where he pretended to have had a sexual encounter with Emilie. To avoid losing face, her father saw that they got married {{just a couple of days}} afterwards. Mirabeau received a small allowance of 6,000 livres from his father, but never received the expected dowry from the marquis.|$|E

60|$|Hetty Torrance {{felt her}} fingers quiver under his grasp, {{but the next}} moment he had turned away, and her companions noticed there was a faint pink tinge in her cheeks when she rejoined them.

60|$|Young Powell, {{a little}} shy {{notwithstanding}} the friendly {{disposition of the}} other, answered him smilingly, aware somehow {{that there was something}} marked in this <b>inquisitiveness,</b> natural, after all--something anxious.

6000|$|Winston nodded. [...] "Still, it is {{not mere}} <b>inquisitiveness,</b> sir.

60|$|Cheyne {{looked up}} languidly, {{wondering}} whether the half-indifferent <b>inquisitiveness</b> was assumed, {{as he remembered}} the anxiety {{he had seen in}} Hetty's face when he first came in.

60|$|I {{understood}} at {{once one}} of the charms of this woman. Her voice was deliciously soft and musical. The words seemed to leave her lips slowly, almost lingeringly, and she spoke with the precision and slight accent of a well-educated foreigner. Her eyes seemed to be wandering all over me and my possessions, yet her interest, if it amounted to that, never even suggested curiosity or <b>inquisitiveness.</b>|$|E
