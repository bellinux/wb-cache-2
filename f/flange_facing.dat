Compared to the floating type joints, the gasket outer metal ring is compressed after bolt-up and the stored energy can compensate the loss of residual gasket stress due to internal pressure, bending moment and creep, resulting in a low leakage. As {{it is difficult to}} assess the flanged joint integrity affected by creep analytically, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model is developed to highlight the creep behaviour of MMC flanged joint under different load cases at elevated temperature.

50|$|It is {{considered}} wrong to join together two choke flanges; the resulting {{gap between the}} <b>flange</b> <b>faces</b> is twice that intended, and the effect {{is similar to that}} of having two joins in the guide rather than one. In the absence of unpressurizable choke flanges, all flanges fall into one of three categories: choke, gasket/cover and cover. An E-plane cross section of an assembled choke connection is shown in figure 3. This is the plane cutting each of the broad walls of the waveguide along its centre-line, which is where the longitudinal surface currents—those that must cross the join—are at their strongest. The choke ditch and the gap between the <b>flange</b> <b>faces</b> together form a somewhat convoluted side-branch to the path of the main guide. This side branch is designed to present a low input impedance where it meets the broad walls of the waveguide, so that the surface currents there are not obstructed by the gap, but instead flow onto and off of the separated <b>faces</b> of the <b>flanges.</b> Conversely, on the outer edge of the choke ditch, at the point where the two flanges come into physical contact, the ditch presents a high series impedance. The current through the contact point is thus reduced to a small value, and the danger of arcing across any crack between the flanges is likewise reduced.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the <b>flange</b> <b>faces</b> in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|R

30|$|The entire {{setup is}} housed in a four-fold {{differentially}} pumped vacuum chamber. The four chambers, {{described in more detail}} in the next sections, are a source chamber, a chamber housing the guides, a chamber where the collisions are detected, and a chamber to characterise the two molecular beams. Source and guide chamber are constructed using ISO-F and ISO-K type flanges with Viton or other rubber gaskets. The last two use CF flanges with copper gaskets. The adapter tube to make the transition between these standards is also the one that provides the kink, which is necessary because of the bend in the guides. A commercial half-nipple with an ISO-F flange was welded to a CF flange with a 10 -degree tilt between the <b>flange</b> <b>faces.</b> This separation in two standards was chosen for simplicity (and cost), and because other than continuity {{there is no reason to}} use the CF standard on a source chamber where the pressure during operation usually lies above 10 − 5 mbar.

Data from prior tests showed that there was a superfluid helium leak and a total disassemble of the cryostat was conducted in order to localize and fix the leak. To improve efficiency new fill tubes and clamps with modifications were added to the helium tank. Upon removal of the tank, corrosion was found on the <b>flange</b> <b>face</b> that connects to the helium cold plate and therefore had to be fully replaced and copper plated to prevent future corrosion.

Four additional shielded twisted pairs of cryogenic wire and a wire harness for the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) were added. Finally, there was also design work done for multiple pieces that went inside the cryostat and a separate probe used to test the SQUIDs. Upon successful completion of the cryostat upgrade, tests were run to check the effectiveness and stability of the upgrades. The post-retrofit tests showed minor leaks were still present and due to this, superfluidity has still not been attained.

40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of gasketed flanged joint design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The flange ring and hub transmit the bolt load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in gasket seating width, which will vary as the <b>flange</b> <b>faces</b> rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted flange assemblies examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b).

The effects of welding parameters, welding procedure, applied mechanical constraints on residual stress built-up and distortions are evaluated. Effort are made to suggest the preventive or corrective measures for the reduction of welding distortions and residual stresses to improve the performance and service life of welded pipe-flange joints. This thesis is organized in three phases. In the first phase, preliminary studies for implementation of numerical technique for welding simulation and selection of appropriate models are performed. In the second phase, welding residual stresses are investigated including their dependence on welding parameters and their mitigation technique. The third phase is associated with the welding deformations. In Chapter- 1, a general introduction of welding deformation and residual stresses and their effect in pipe-flange joints in presented. In Chapter- 2, a comprehensive literature review of experimental and finite element simulation of welding in general and its application in circumferential joint in particular is discussed. Chapter- 3, describes the general finite element formulation and its application technique for material modeling, heat source modeling, modeling of filler material and analysis procedure etc. Chapter- 4, presents a comparative study of two and three-dimensional FE models of the pipe-flange joint subjected to a welding process. The aim of this study was to select an appropriate FE model for forth coming parametric numerical studies with the objective to investigate residual stresses and deformations. In Chapter- 5, experimental validation procedure has been described and a few selective validations are also presented. The objective of this chapter is to establish the reader confidence over the accuracy of numerical results.

The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the most effective mode of mechanical stress relieving. In Chapter- 8, the issues related to welding procedure specifications are addressed.

Results show that the distributions of stress intensity factor tend to be even across the flange width under gravity loads. The thickness of beam web has little effect on stress intensity factors.

40|$|The work {{constitutes}} {{a study of}} the strength of mild steel fillet welds subject to static loading, and the behaviour of flange welded beam-column connections under combined bending and shear. Tests are conducted on short welds in the as-welded and stress relieved conditions, and also on full-size beam-column connections. It is shown that welds under compression have a lower strength than when under tension. Failure of the fillet weld is initiated at the weld root, the important factor controlling the initiation being weld ductility. The greater the residual stress, the lower the weld ductility and ultimate strength. Thermal stress relieving increases strength by as much as 30 %. Weld failure plane is rarely at the throat and varies from 0 ° to 45 ° depending upon loading condition. Failure plane average stresses are related by a circular function which is expressed in terms of externally applied forces at limit state. The tension weld of a flange-welded beam-column connection always fails before the compression weld. The shear load sharing between the welds is a complex function of elastic compression of the web, elastic/plastic deformation of the flanges, load/deformation characteristics, and the type of load application. Bearing forces between the compression <b>flange</b> and column <b>face</b> produce low level bearing stresses and frictional forces which make a negligible contribution to shear load resistance.
