40|$|In {{regions of}} high seismic risk, {{high-strength}} concrete (HSC) columns of tall buildings {{are designed to}} be fully ductile during earthquake attack by providing substantial amount of confining steel within the critical region. However, in areas of low to moderate seismic risk, the same provision of confining steel is too conservative because of the reduced seismic demand. More critically, it causes problematic steel congestion in the beam-column joints and column critical region. This will eventually affect the quality of concrete placing owing to blockage. To relieve the problem, the confining steel in the critical region of HSC columns located in low to moderate seismicity regions can be suitably reduced, while maintaining a <b>limited</b> <b>ductility</b> level.

An important prerequisite of theapplication of new material grades is the characterization of its mechanicalproperties. Post-localization and fracture predictive technologiesgreatly facilitate the design of components which make optimal use ofthese steel grades. In this thesis, press hardened boron alloyed steelsubjected to differential thermo-mechanical processing is characterized. Fracture properties {{in relation to the}} different microstructures obtainedis studied. Furthermore a dual phase (DP) cold forming steel is chosenfor evaluation of <b>ductility</b> <b>limit</b> in shear loading. throughout thiswork a strategy for modelling post-localization response and predictingductility limit using shell elements larger then the typical width of thelocalized neck is used. The studied material is assumed to be in a stateof plane stress. Mesh dependency is alleviated by the introduction of aelement size dependent parameter into the constitutive description. Thisparameter acts as a hardening parameter, controlling the evolution ofthe yield surface depending on loading, strain history and shell elementsize. Model calibration relies on a full field measurement technique, DigitalSpeckle Photography (DSP), to record the plane deformation field oftensile specimens. Quantitative measurements of the severely localizeddeformation preceding crack initiation are feasible. With the proposedstrategy, mesh sensitivity in terms of post localization load responseand fracture elongation predictions is reduced significantly compared toresults obtained without the element size dependent parameter. It wasfound that high strain hardening favours strain localization of shear band type, and accelerates the formation of a localized neck. The hardeningcharacteristics is determinant to which deformation mode dissipates theminimum energy. For the DP steel, the Tresca yield surface more accuratelydescribes the yielding point compared to the von Mises planestress elipse. Furthermore, the exponential ductility function dependenton the stress triaxiality parameter agrees well with experimental fracturedata in the ductile loading regime for both DP and boron steel. In shear loading, the maximum shear (MS) stress criterion successfullydescribes the <b>ductility</b> <b>limit.</b> Due to the significantly different ductilityof the various microstructures obtainable by the thermo-mechanicalprocessing of boron alloyed steel, a modelling strategy is needed. It wasfound that in ductile loading, local equivalent fracture strain can be relatedto the hardness of that material point.

The multiplicative nature of the model, and the high strain hardening of this material were among the reasons the Johnson-Cook is unable to represent the material when simulating events with high strain and high strain rates such as punching...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental research aiming to investigate on the compressive behavior of full size clay brick masonry columns reinforced with Basalt Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (BFRCM) or with steel wires collaring. Uniaxial compressive tests were performed on eight retrofitted columns and four control specimens. Two masonry strength were considered by varying the mortar grade. Results are presented and discussed in terms of axial stress-strain relationships, failure modes and crack patterns of the specimens tested up to failure. For the limit of investigated variables, comparisons with unreinforced specimens show the ability of these alternative techniques in increasing <b>ductility</b> with <b>limited</b> strength enhancements, even if further investigations should be addressed on detail effectiveness and scale effect...|$|R

Due to a certain level of ductility of the structure is expected to deform repeatedly - again and back - back (due to earthquake load), without significant failure. To get the level of ductility as we planned, then after the reinforcement is determined, the next should be controlled ductility values From the analysis on the block 11 - 11 'pedestal region (400 / 700) with As = 5 D 36, As' = 2 D 36 and field with As = 5 D 36, As' = 2 D 36 obtained ductility values, means that the beam behaves as a <b>limited</b> <b>ductility,</b> as well on CD beam, beam also behaves as a 16 - 17 <b>limited</b> <b>ductility.</b> While the KL beam at the pedestal region (450 / 750) with As = 4 D 36, As '= 3 D 36 got value = 5. 4727, means that the beam behaves as a full ductility, while in the field area with As = 6 D 36, As' = 2 D 36 obtained value = 2. 934 means that the beam behaves as a <b>limited</b> <b>ductility.</b> From the results of adding reinforcement in the area hit (As') then the ductility tends to increase, but must remain beracuan that these structures in a state of under reinforced.

40|$|Aluminium alloy {{composites}} {{have been}} extensively investigated {{for use in}} tribo-contact applications, however little detailed literature exists on the sub-surface microstructural evolution {{as a result of}} lubricated sliding wear. In this study two un-reinforced alloys (2124 and 5056) and identical alloy composites, reinforced with 15 vol. % MoSi 2 intermetallic particles were produced by a powder metallurgy route and subject to lubricated sliding at initial Hertzian contact pressures of 0. 9 – 1. 2 GPa. Focused ion beam (FIB) techniques were used to produce thin sections parallel to the worn surface. Sub-surfaces layers were then examined in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results indicated that the depth of deformation was minimal in the alloys, with the most highly deformed polycrystalline layer confined to approximately 1 ?m below the worn surface. Equiaxed sub-grain sizes of around 0. 1 ?m were comparable to that observed for dry sliding of similar alloys and composites [1]. Evidence of surface erosion by solid particle impact was also observed, with wear debris generated as a result of material exceeding the <b>ductility</b> <b>limit.</b> For the composites, the MoSi 2 provided a suitable means of transferring the normal contact load from asperity contacts to areas in the bulk of the sample. Reinforcement fracture was observed both at the worn surface and in areas further away in the bulk, for particles which were in direct contact with each other. Evidence of the deformation of the aluminium matrix below reinforcements was also present, with average sub-grain sizes of around 330 nm. Thus, such intermetallic reinforcements may have potential to replace reinforcements that are more abrasive to counterfaces, such as SiC or Al 2 O 3, whilst still providing adequate wear resistance for the aluminium alloy. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Rebar {{corrosion}} is {{the most}} commonly observed deterioration mechanism in reinforced concrete (RC) structures, severely affecting their performance and potentially resulting in premature in-service failures. Corrosion causes internal damage to RC elements, owning {{to the loss of}} steel area and the formation of associated expansive corrosion products. Corrosion damage, which may ultimately lead to inadequate performance, includes loss of steel area, loss of bond between steel and concrete, reduced concrete strength due to cracking, loss of concrete section due to spalling and reduced mechanical properties of the affected rebars, i. e. strength and ductility, mostly due to pitting formation. The severity of this damage, however, depends on the nature (i. e. uniform or/and pitting) and extent of corrosion as well as the location of its occurrence, i. e. tension, compression and/or shear reinforcements in RC beams. Accurate performance evaluation of corroding structures could allow extension of service life, where appropriate, and may contribute to a more consistent safety level across a network of structures. This would improve the efficient use of scarce resources, and minimize the impact of indirect costs through optimised inspection, maintenance and repair works. In this study, performance of corroding under-reinforced beams is examined under serviceability (i. e. deflections, cracking patterns) and ultimate (i. e. load capacity, ductility) conditions through detailed parametric and reliability analysis studies. The performance of corrosion-damaged under-reinforced beams is assessed using non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA). Empirical models from the literature are used to consider the different effects of corrosion damage in the analysis. The NLFE models are used in parametric studies, where a number of corrosion-damage scenarios are examined. For the mid-scale beams studied within this thesis, loss of tensile steel area and concrete damage/section-loss due to corrosion in the compressive region of the beam, are found to be the main causes for loss of load capacity and bending stiffness. The numerical models predicted an increase of beam's ductility for increasing amounts of corrosion, up to approx. Qcor = 12 % loss. This behaviour was found to be due to the beneficial effect of reducing tension rebar area and yield strength on beam's ductility. At higher amount of corrosion, beam's ductility started to deteriorate due to a transition in beam's behaviour at ultimate deflection from concrete crushing towards premature rupture of the corroded tension rebars. Reliability analysis, which is a widely proposed assessment tool of corroding RC structures, is used to examine the influence of uncertainties associated with different variables involved in the deterioration process. A FORM based reliability analysis methodology is developed, which uses NLFEA together with adaptive response surface method (RSM) for the approximation of the performance function. The procedure is used for the analysis of two corrosion damage scenarios on (mid-scale) under-reinforced beams. The response surface of the yield-load capacity limit state is shown to be a stationary surface, since the regression coefficients are insensitive to the amount of corrosion. The reliability index, B, was found to gradually reduce for increasing corrosion damage, Qcor. The sensitivity factors obtained for the load capacity limit state revealed that the relative importance of the random variables remained almost constant as corrosion loss increased. The approximation of the <b>ductility</b> <b>limit</b> state was found to be strongly influenced by the selection of variable ranges due to significant curvature in the response surface. The accuracy of the fitted response surface was improved by splitting the variable space into smaller ranges and evaluating the response surface for each corrosion interval. An initial increase of the reliability index, B, was observed for the two corrosion damage scenarios examined. The sensitivity factors for the <b>ductility</b> <b>limit</b> state revealed that as corrosion damage increases, a transition of the relative importance of random variables concrete compressive strength,fc and ultimate (tension) rebar strain, εu, is likely to occur.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{computer program}} USFOS is used extensively by oil and engineering companies world wide {{to evaluate the}} ultimate limit strength and accidental limit state behaviour of offshore structures, notably in conjunction with reassessment of existing platforms. In this context it is often necessary {{to take into account}} strength reserves on both components and connections (joints). Generally the nonlinear behaviour of components in the form of buckling or large deflection, plastic bending is well known, while the behaviour of tubular joints during extreme plastic deformations is more uncertain. To large degree one has to rely on relatively few experimental data. MSL in UK has developed joint strength formulas expressed as nonlinear P-d curves. Such curves have been implemented in USFOS, but they give sometimes strange results, e. g. - the <b>ductility</b> <b>limit</b> is reached before ultimate strength. Ductility limits are also only given for axial forces and not bending moments. An alternative to physical testing is to perform virtual experiments by means of nonlinear finite element analysis. Provided that simulations are verified against available experimental data, parametric studies of various geometrical configurations and load conditions may expand the data basis. The objective of the work is to perform nonlinear analysis with ABAQUS of various joints and {{contribute to the development of}} the data basis. The thesis is a continuation of the specialization project done in 9 th semester. Simulation of joints with abaqus is performed to verify the simulation procedure with respect to force-deformation behaviour and strain development. Single joints and the same joints as a part of a frame system plane frame system have been simulated. In this paper, non-linear analysis with ABAQUS of X-joints is performed and the simulation results are verified against existed data and studies. Conclusions and further recommendations are given. The results show that behavior of the joint is different when analyzed independently from when in frame system. The reason is that when a single joint is analyzed, the force doesn?t change direction. While in a frame system, the braces has a significant influence to the joint, as the braces can buckle, rotate, etc. which changes the direction of the force acting on the joints. When the through member is in tension, the other two braces will compress it to a very large extent, which leads to a large strain development. That can also explain why the frame system is more stable when the joint is rotated by 90 degree. It is the most critical condition when the separate braces are in compression, which should be avoided in reality. </p...|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} aspects of the seismic design and behaviour of reinforced concrete buildings with <b>limited</b> <b>ductility,</b> like the buildings with waffled slabs or flat beams, are examined in this work. The structures with these typologies are the most used in Spain for new buildings and many seismic codes do not recommend their use in seismic areas. The expected seismic performance of these structures is studied herein by means of incremental non linear structural analysis (pushover analysis) which provides capacity curves. Their behaviour is compared with that of buildings with moment resisting frames designed according to the Spanish EHE and NCSE- 02 codes and also to the ACI- 318 (2005) and IBC- 2003. The {{most important}} results of the study show that only the moment-resisting framed buildings exhibit sufficient ductility and overstrength to guarantee a stable seismic behaviour. The behaviour of <b>limited</b> <b>ductility</b> buildings is strongly influenced by the structural type; even if they are reinforced with ductile steel or if their confinement if improved, they exhibit slightly higher ductility.
