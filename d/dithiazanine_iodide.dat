5000|$|<b>Dithiazanine</b> <b>iodide</b> is a {{chemical}} compound. [...] It {{is used as}} a veterinary anthelmintic for dogs. [...] It is a highly toxic chemical, with a lethal dose for humans of about 4-16 mg/kg by oral ingestion. The mechanism of toxicity is not well known but it is believed that this chemical interferes with cells' absorption of glucose, which is essential to obtain energy through cell respiration.|$|E
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a {{significant}} threat for effective treatment of several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. To identify potential new treatment options for MRSA infections, we screened a clinical compound library consisting of 1524 compounds using a growth inhibition assay in 96 -well plates. We identified 34 agents which are either bacteriostatic or bactericidal against log-phase clinical MRSA strain USA 300. Among them, 9 candidates (thonzonium, cetylpyridinium, trilocarban, benzododecinium, bithionol, brilliant green, chlorquinaldol, methylbenzethonium and green violet) are known antiseptics, 11 candidates are known antibiotics currently recommended {{for the treatment}} of MRSA. We identified 9 new drug candidates, 5 of which (thiostrepton, carbomycin, spiramycin, clofazimine and chloroxine) are antibiotics used for treating other infections than S. aureus infections; 4 of which (quinaldine blue, closantel, <b>dithiazanine</b> <b>iodide</b> and pyrvinium pamoate) are drugs used for treating parasitic diseases or cancer. We ranked these new drug candidates according to their MICs against the MRSA strain USA 300. Our findings may have implications for more effective treatment of MRSA infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes of}} scolices and daughter cysts of Echinococcus multilocularis obtained experimentally from infected cotton rats were investigated cytopathologically {{by use of}} routine and phase contrast microscopes and supravital staining with neutral red and Janus green. Degenerative changes were recognized distinctly in parenchymal cells of scolices and germinal cells of daughter cyst. The regressive change was accepted {{as an indication of}} degeneration of the scolices and daughter cysts in addition to the abnormal changes of themselves. The scolices and daughter cysts were incubated in the medium consisting essentially of 20 % bovine serum in medium 199 to which-methyridine, diethylcarbamazine citrate, chloroquine-diphosphate, dl-cupric methionate, sodium antimony-III-biscatechol- 2, 4 -sodium disulfate, sodium antimonyl tartrate and dithiazanine iodide-were added at the rates of 10, 40 and 100 Î³ per ml. These scolices and daughter cysts were investigated for 10 days and following results were obtained. Sodium antimonyl tartrate, sodium antimony-III-biscatechol- 2, 4 -sodium disulfonate and <b>dithiazanine</b> <b>iodide</b> manifested the comparatively stronger effects, the decrease of effects was recognized in order as dl-cupric methionate, chloroquine-diphosphate and diethylcarbamazine and methyridine showed the lowest effect, and the highest rate of vesiculated scolices was recognized in the medium with methyridine...|$|E
