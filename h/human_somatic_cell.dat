This will allow proliferation of the clone even when excessive DNA damage is present. Such dominant-negative mutations occur in the tumor suppressor gene p53.

According to an article in New Scientist at the time, A very pretty illustration of the revolution taking place in human genetics, as a start is made upon the enormous task of mapping human genes, can be found in the latest Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Until now, the most that has been possible using the traditional methods of poring over family trees has been the attribution of a few genes to particular chromosomes, usually the X chromosome. But the new and powerful combination of cell fusion techniques, with methods of reliably identifying chromosomes, means that crude mapping at this level is being greatly speeded up, and that the position of genes within chromosomes is now being tackled. Marcello Siniscalco is perhaps the leading exponent of this latter craft.|$|E

The development of an experimental system that permits a facile evaluation of gene targeting efficiency in <b>human</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> lines {{is the first step}} towards the improvement of this technology and its application to a broad range of cell lines. In this study, we utilized phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class A (PIGA), a gene essential for the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors, as a reporter of gene targeting events in <b>human</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Targeted disruption of PIGA was quantitatively detected with FLAER, a reagent that specifically binds to GPI anchors. Using this PIGA-based reporter system, we successfully detected adeno-associated virus (AAV) -mediated gene targeting events both with and without promoter-trap enrichment of gene-targeted cell population. The PIGA-based reporter system was also capable of reproducing previous findings that an AAV-mediated gene targeting achieves a remarkably higher ratio of homologous versus random integration (H/R ratio) of targeting vectors than a plasmid-mediated gene targeting. The PIGA-based system also detected an approximately 2 -fold increase in the H/R ratio achieved by a small negative selection cassette introduced {{at the end of the}} AAV-based targeting vector with a promoter-trap system.

Importantly, the use of a promoter-less, ATG-less construct greatly facilitates the recovery of correctly targeted cells.

40|$|Ku 86 plays a {{key role}} in nonhomologous end joining in organisms as {{evolutionarily}} disparate as bacteria and humans. In eukaryotic cells, Ku 86 has also been implicated in the regulation of telomere length although the effect of Ku 86 mutations varies considerably between species. Indeed, telomeres either shorten significantly, shorten slightly, remain unchanged, or lengthen significantly in budding yeast, fission yeast, chicken cells, or plants, respectively, that are null for Ku 86 expression. Thus, it has been unclear which model system is most relevant for humans. We demonstrate here that the functional inactivation of even a single allele of Ku 86 in <b>human</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> results in profound telomere loss, which is accompanied by an increase in chromosomal fusions, translocations, and genomic instability.

40|$|Gene {{targeting}} has {{two important}} applications. One is the inactivation of genes (“knockouts”), {{and the second}} is the correction of a mutated allele back to wild-type (“gene therapy”). Central to these processes is the efficient introduction of the targeting DNA into the cells of interest. In humans, this targeting is often accomplished through the use of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). rAAV is presumed to use a pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair termed homologous recombination (HR) to mediate correct targeting; however, the specifics of this mechanism remain unknown. In this work, we attempted to generate Ku 70 -null <b>human</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>cells</b> by using a rAAV-based gene knockout strategy. Ku 70 is the heterodimeric partner of Ku 86, and together they constitute an end-binding activity that is required for a pathway [nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) ] of DSB repair that is believed to compete with HR. Our data demonstrated that Ku 70 is an essential gene in <b>human</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> More importantly, however, in Ku 70 +/− cells, the frequency of gene targeting was 5 - to 10 -fold higher than in wild-type cells. RNA interference and short-hairpinned RNA strategies to deplete Ku 70 phenocopied these results in wild-type cells and greatly accentuated them in Ku 70 +/− cell lines. Thus, Ku 70 protein levels significantly influenced the frequency of rAAV-mediated gene targeting in <b>human</b> <b>somatic</b> <b>cells.</b> Our data suggest that gene-targeting frequencies can be significantly improved in human cells by impairing the NHEJ pathway, and we propose that Ku 70 depletion can be used to facilitate both knockout and gene therapy approaches...|$|R
