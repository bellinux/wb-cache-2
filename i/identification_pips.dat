40|$|One of {{the major}} duties of {{financial}} analysts is technical analysis. It is necessary to locate the technical patterns in the stock price movement charts to analyze the market behavior. Indeed, {{there are two main}} problems: how to define those preferred patterns (technical patterns) for query and how to match the defined pattern templates in different resolutions. As we can see, defining the similarity between time series (or time series subsequences) is of fundamental importance. By identifying the perceptually important points (PIPs) directly from the time domain, time series and templates of different lengths can be compared. Three ways of distance measure, including Euclidean distance (PIP-ED), perpendicular distance (PIP-PD) and vertical distance (PIP-VD), for <b>PIP</b> <b>identification</b> are compared in this paper. After the <b>PIP</b> <b>identification</b> process, both template- and rule-based pattern-matching approaches are introduced. The proposed methods are distinctive in their intuitiveness, making them particularly user friendly to ordinary data analysts like stock market investors. As demonstrated by the experiments, the template- and the rule-based time series matching and subsequence searching approaches provide different directions to achieve the goal of pattern identification.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, RFID {{systems have}} been widely {{deployed}} for applications such as supply chain management and inventory control. One of their most essential operations is to swiftly identify individual tags to distinguish their associated objects. Most existing solutions identify tags sequentially in the temporal dimension to avoid signal collisions, whose performance degrades significantly as the system scale increases. In this paper, we propose a Parallel <b>Identification</b> Protocol (<b>PIP)</b> for RFID systems, which achieves the parallel identification paradigm and is com-patible with current RFID devices. Uniquely, PIP encodes the tag ID into a specially designed pattern and thus greatly facilitates the reader to correctly and effectively recover them from collisions. Furthermore, we analytically investigate its performance and provide guidance on determining its optimal settings. Extensive simulations show that <b>PIP</b> reduces the <b>identification</b> delay by about 25 % − 50 % {{when compared with the}} standard method in EPC C 1 G 2 and the state-of-the-art solutions.

40|$|Abstract. Discovery of {{interesting}} or frequently appearing time series patterns {{is one of}} the important tasks in various time series data mining applications. However, recent research criticized that discovering subsequence patterns in time series using clustering approaches is meaningless. It is due to the presence of trivial matched subsequences {{in the formation of the}} time series subse-quences using sliding window method. The objective of this paper is to propose a threshold-free approach to improve the method for segmenting long stock time series into subsequences using sliding window. The proposed approach fil-ters the trivial matched subsequences by changing Perceptually Important Point (PIP) detection and reduced the dimension by <b>PIP</b> <b>identification.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A general {{overview}} of regulation of secondary metabolism in Pseudomonas species {{is given in}} Chapter 1. Several approaches were combined to identify novel genes involved in the regulation of PCN synthesis and to study their interactions with other regulators. Site-directed mutagenesis {{was used to test}} the hypothesis that rpoS is a regulatory gene of PCN synthesis (Chapter 2). To discover additional genes in the regulatory cascade, which already contains psrA and rpoS, a random DNA-fragment microarray of the PCL 1391 genome was constructed and used for transcriptomics of the psrA and rpoS mutants (Chapter 3). A random mutagenesis approach resulted in the <b>identification</b> of <b>pip,</b> a novel gene that stimulates PCN production in PCL 1391 (Chapter 4). Analyses on the role of Pip as a switch of PCN production depending on environmental conditions are described in Chapter 5. The results described in this thesis are summarized in Chapter 6, where in addition the regulatory network of PCN synthesis in P. chlororaphis PCL 1391 is compared to regulatory networks of secondary metabolism in other Pseudomonas species.

40|$|Abstract — Routing and {{protection}} with an Overlapping Segment Shared Protection (OSSP) scheme in multi-domain networks {{is more difficult}} than that in single domain networks because of scalability requirements. We propose a novel approach for OSSP routing where the underlying idea is the prior identification of Potential Intra-domain Paths (PIP) for carrying working and backup traffic between domain border nodes. These PIPs help to reduce the multi-domain network to a simpler aggregated network where routing is performed without unnecessarily {{going down to the}} physical links. The novel approach offers an exact and highly scalable routing thanks to the prior <b>identification</b> of the <b>PIPs</b> and the introduction of a maximal share risk group feature. Experiments show that the quality of the proposed approach is close to the optimal single-domain network solution and outperforms the existing multi-domain network solutions. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Plant aquaporins {{belong to}} a large {{superfamily}} of conserved proteins called themajor intrinsic proteins (MIPs). There is limited information about the diversity of MIPs in grapevine, and their water transport capacity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify MIPs from grapevine and functionally characterise water transport of a subset of MIPs. Candidate genes were identified, by screening a Vitis vinifera L. (cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) cDNA library with gene specific probes, for aquaporin cDNAs encoding members of the plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) and tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) subfamilies. The screen resulted in the identification of 11 full-length and two partial length aquaporin cDNAs. VvTIP 2; 1 isoforms had different 30 UTRs, immediately upstream of the poly(A) tail, suggesting the presence of multiple cleavage sites for polyadenylation. Using published genome sequences of grapevine, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the MIPs with previously characterised MIPs from Arabidopsis. We identified 23 full-length MIP genes from the V. viniferagenomesequenceof a nearhomozygous line (PN 40024) that cluster into the fourmain subfamilies (andsubgroups within) identified in other species. However, based on the <b>identification</b> of <b>PIP</b> 2 genes in Cabernet Sauvignon that were not present in the PN 40024 genome, there are likely to be more than 23 MIP genes in other heterozygous grapevine cultivars. Water transport capacity was determined for several PIPs and TIPs, by expression in Xenopus oocytes. Only VvPIP 2 and VvTIP proteins function as water channels with the exception of VvPIP 2; 5. VvPIP 2; 5 differs from the water conducting VvPIP 2; 1 by the substitution of two highly conserved amino acids in Loop B (G 97 S, G 100 W), which was shown b...|$|R
40|$|Vascular Ca 2 + -activated {{chloride}} channels (CaCCs), are a {{class of}} ligand- and voltage-gated channels that couple agonist binding and inositol triphosphate (IP 3) signalling to depolarisation of the cell membrane and smooth muscle contraction. The elucidation of the precise physiological role and the pharmacological profile of this channel has been accelerated by the recent discovery of the gene (TMEM 16 A) coding for these channels. Based on the rationale that depolarising membrane potential (V m) causes contraction in vascular SMCs, the possibility of controlling vessel tone via the exogenous light-activated, depolarising Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR 2) channels was also investigated. The overall aim of this thesis is two folds: i) to define mechanisms of regulation of CaCCs by endogenous signalling molecules and pharmacological agents, and ii) {{to develop a new}} method of controlling vascular contraction by exogenous ion channels. The main findings of this thesis are: 1) Arteries (large conduit, systemic and pulmonary) obtained from mice lacking of one allele of TMEM 16 A gene (heterozygous knockouts) presented reduced response to α 1 -adrenergic receptor activation. This finding reinforced the view that TMEM 16 A proteins serve as key mechanism of modulation of artery tone. 2) Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2), a lipid involved in the IP 3 signalling cascade, is a key activator of native and cloned vascular TMEM 16 A channel. Furthermore, the closely related TMEM 16 B was inhibited by PIP 2. These modulatory effect of PIP 2 on these channels were especially pronounced in the physiological range of [Ca 2 +]i. 3) Anthracene- 9 -carboxylic acid (A 9 C), a general Cl - blocker, exhibited bimodal effects on TMEM 16 A-mediated currents. The inhibiting effect occurred via open-channel block mechanism while the activating effect was due to an increase in P o and a leftward shift in the steady-state activation curve. These mechanistic insights may help the design of novel drug (activators and inhibitors) {{that could be used to}} modulate blood vessel tone. 4) ChR 2, a light-gated and non-selective cation channel, was introduced specifically into the SMC in mice (ChR 2 -SMC). Isolated arterial SMCs obtained from these mice showed light-dependent inward currents. ChR 2 -SMC artery rings also contracted in a light-dependent manner. The mechanism of lightinduced contraction involved voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels (VGC) activation and Ca 2 + influx. To conclude, this work of thesis has shed light on the functional role of TMEM 16 A in various vascular SMCs types. The regulation of TMEM 16 A by membrane lipid will lay the foundation for the <b>identification</b> of the <b>PIP</b> 2 binding site on these channels, which could also be exploited as a site for pharmacological intervention. The study of A 9 C mechanisms of activation and inhibition may aid the development of selective blockers and activators for TMEM 16 A channels. Lastly, the control of vascular tone by ChR 2 in mice can be used to control blood perfusion to organs and tissues for experimental purposes. </p...|$|R
