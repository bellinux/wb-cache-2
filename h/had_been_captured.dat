5|$|The crusaders {{consolidated}} their conquests into crusader states. During the 12th and 13th centuries, {{there were}} a series of conflicts between those states and the surrounding Islamic states.

In 1203, the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople, and captured the city in 1204, setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261, but never regained their former strength.
