40|$|GPGPUs {{have proven}} to be {{advantageous}} for increasing application scalability both in the HPC and enterprise domains. This has resulted in an increase in the array of programming languages and range of physical compute capabilities of current hardware. Yet applications ’ scalability and portability remain limited with respect to both their degree of customization and the physical limitations of compute nodes to contain any number and composition of accelerators. This research defines the notion of a GPGPU assembly for applications on both bare-metal compute nodes as well as within Xen virtual machines in high-performance clusters, presenting to applications a logical configuration of hardware “just right ” for their needs—CPUs and a set of local and remote GPGPUs. GPGPUs are provided transparently as locally-available devices, easing programmability and portability. We characterize workloads to best match them with available GPGPUs and employ techniques such as dynamic resource monitoring of CPU, network and memory usage, latency and throughput measurements, as well as <b>instrumention</b> of binary CUDA kernels to obtain GPGPU-level usage to enable higher-level mapping policies. This research provides a dynamic runtime system for evaluating more intelligent management methods of GPGPU clusters, examining global scheduling policies, admission control and dynamic retargeting of execution streams.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of flight test results nearly {{always has to}} be performed under timecritical circumstances. Often succeeding test points and sorties depend on the successful completion of another test point which has to be assessed beforehand. To increase effectiveness, algorithms to facilitate and accelerate flight test evaluation w. r. t. handling qualities are necessary that allow a partially automated way to assess critical parameters. Two packages with algorithms have been developed {{in the frame of}} the A 400 M HQ Study 2009 - 2010 (Contract No. Q/LR 1 A/ 9 A 037 / 1 A 173, [1]). This is the second report.

It allows the {{evaluation of}} PIOs in real-time and during the post-processing phase if the required information is made available (based on flight test <b>instrumention</b> (FTI) and/or telemetry data).

To {{evaluate the}} clinical outcome of anterior endoscopic <b>instrumention</b> for scoliosis using the SRS- 24 questionnaire {{and to examine}} how these scores change over a 2 -year follow-up period. Summary of Background Data. Anterior endoscopic instrumentation correction has several advantages compared with open procedures. However, the clinical results of this technique using a validated outcome measure have rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. Methods. A total of 83 consecutive patients underwent endoscopic anterior instrumentation performed at a single unit. Patients completed the SRS- 24 questionnaire before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The SRS- 24 scores were compared between each of the follow-up intervals. Results. The pain, general self-image, and function from back condition domains improved after surgery (P < 0. 05). Activity level significantly improved between 3 and 6 months, and both function domains improved between 6 and 12 months (P < 0. 05). None of the domains increased significantly after 1 year. Conclusions. Endoscopic anterior instrumentation for scoliosis significantly improved pain, self-image, and function. The greatest improvement in function occurred between 6 and 12 months after surgery. The SRS- 24 scores at 1 year from surgery may provide a good indicator of patient outcome in the long-term...|$|E

Our algorithms provide a means for tracking the game object (the ball in baseball, the puck in hockey); instrumenting broadcast cameras and creating informative graphical visualizations regarding the object’s trajectory. The graphics are embedded in the live image in real time in a photo realistic manner. The demands of live network broadcasting require {{that many of our}} effects operate on live video streams at frame-rate (60 Hz) with latencies of less than a second. Some effects can be composed off-line, but must be Preprint submitted to IEEE MultiMedia Magazinecomplete in a matter of seconds. The final image sequence must also be compelling, appealing and informative to the critical human eye. Components of our approach include: (1) <b>Instrumention</b> and calibration of broadcast cameras so that the geometry of their field of view is known at all times, (2) Tracking items of interest such as balls and pucks and in some cases participants (e. g., cars in auto racing), (3) Creation and transformation of graphical enhancements such as illustrative object highlights (e. g., a glowing puck trail) or advertisements to the same field of view as the broadcast cameras and (4) Techniques for combining these elements into informative on-air images.

40|$|The POLARCAT project aims to {{quantify}} the contribution and impact of trace gases and aerosols transported to the Arctic region. Within the frame of this project, the French ATR- 42 research aircraft, equipped particularly with in-situ and remote sensing <b>instrumention,</b> was deployed during 2 measurement campaigns in 2008. While during the spring campaign the ATR- 42 has been flying out of Kiruna, Sweden, the summer campaign was operated out of Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Both campaigns aimed to characterize anthropogenic pollution plumes transported (from North America, Siberia) to the Arctic. This study presents primarily in-situ measurements of aerosol physical and optical properties. In particular, complete aerosol size distribution measurements (20 nm to 3 µm in diameter) have been performed next to measurements of absorption and scattering coefficients. In addition, complementary measurements of aerosol chemical in situ properties and aerosol remote sensing have been performed on board the same aircraft. We will give {{an overview of the}} vertical distributions of aerosol number concentrations in distinct size modes. Besides clean background aerosol concentrations during the first days of both measurement campaigns, more polluted air masses have been observed towards the end of both campaigns. For the more significant pollution events observed we will give first estimates of BC concentrations derived from PSAP and refractory size distribution measurements. Furthermore, first analysis of aerosol optical properties (extinction, absorption) from situ (nephelometer, photometer) and remote sensing measurements (lidar) will be compared to Mie calculations applied on measured aerosol size distributions, chemistry (refractive index), and measured humidity. In addition, the aerosol nucleation phenomenon could be observed several times during the summer campaign...|$|E
40|$|We use new neutron {{scattering}} instrumentation {{to follow in}} a single quantitative time-resolving experiment, the three key scales of structural development which accompany the crystallisation of synthetic polymers. These length scales span 3 orders of magnitude of the scattering vector. The study of polymer crystallisation {{dates back to the}} pioneering experiments of Keller and others who discovered the chain-folded nature of the thin lamellae crystals which are normally found in synthetic polymers. The inherent connectivity of polymers makes their crystallisation a multiscale transformation. Much understanding has developed over the intervening fifty years but the process has remained something of a mystery. There are three key length scales. The chain folded lamellar thickness is 10 nm, the crystal unit cell is 1 nm and the detail of the chain conformation is 0. 1 nm. In previous work these length scales have been addressed using different <b>instrumention</b> or were coupled using compromised geometries. More recently researchers have attempted to exploit coupled time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle x-ray experiments. These turned out to be challenging experiments much related to the challenge of placing the scattering intensity on an absolute scale. However, they did stimulate the possibility of new phenomena in the very early stages of crystallisation. Although there is now considerable doubt on such experiments, they drew attention to the basic question as to the process of crystallisation in long chain molecules. We have used NIMROD on the second target station at ISIS to follow all three length scales in a time-resolving manner for poly(e-caprolactone). The technique can provide a single set of data from 0. 01 to 100 Å- 1 on the same vertical scale. We present the results using a multiple scale model of the crystallisation process in polymers to analyse the results...|$|E
40|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} are {{the largest}} gravitationally bound objects in the observable universe, and they are formed from the largest perturbations of the primordial matter power spectrum. During initial cluster collapse, matter is accelerated to supersonic velocities, and the baryonic component is heated as it passes through accretion shocks. This process stabilizes when {{the pressure of the}} bound matter prevents further gravitational collapse. Galaxy clusters are useful cosmological probes, because their formation progressively freezes out at the epoch when dark energy begins to dominate the expansion and energy density of the universe. A diverse set of observables, from radio through X-ray wavelengths, are sourced from galaxy clusters, and this is useful for self-calibration. The distributions of these observables trace a cluster's dark matter halo, which represents more than 80 % of the cluster's gravitational potential. One such observable is the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE), which results when the ionized intercluster medium blueshifts the cosmic microwave background via Compton scattering. Great technical advances in the last several decades have made regular observation of the SZE possible. Resolved SZE science, such as is explored in this analysis, has benefitted from the construction of large-format camera arrays consisting of highly sensitive millimeter-wave detectors, such as Bolocam. Bolocam is a submillimeter camera, sensitive to 140 GHz and 268 GHz radiation, located at one of the best observing sites in the world: the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Bolocam fielded 144 of the original spider web NTD bolometers used in an entire generation of ground-based, balloon-borne, and satellite-borne millimeter wave <b>instrumention.</b> Over approximately six years, our group at Caltech has developed a mature galaxy cluster observational program with Bolocam. This thesis describes the construction of the instrument's full cluster catalog: BOXSZ. Using this catalog, I have scaled the Bolocam SZE measurements with X-ray mass approximations in an effort to characterize the SZE signal as a viable mass probe for cosmology. This work has confirmed the SZE to be a low-scatter tracer of cluster mass. The analysis has also revealed how sensitive the SZE-mass scaling is to small biases in the adopted mass approximation. Future Bolocam analysis efforts are set on resolving these discrepancies by approximating cluster mass jointly with different observational probes...|$|E
40|$|The {{theft of}} gold from primary deposits, primary {{producers}} and legal title holders {{is a major}} problem in many countries around the world. The identification of the source of gold and the means by which it was beneficiated are therefore crucial in determining ownership and legality, especially in the South African context, where large quantities of gold are stolen and illicitly mined, with major economic losses, predominantly from the mines in the Witwatersrand Basin. Gold usually occurs in its metallic form, often alloyed with a limited range of elements which include Ag, Hg and Cu, in addition {{to a wide range of}} trace elements. The concentrations and associated elements are typical for specific genetic types of the gold deposits from which they are mined, and this elemental fingerprint can be used for identifying deposits. Most stolen gold is melted down into small pieces of gold, or consolidated into small bars, which are then traded by criminal syndicates, and finally laundered via refineries. Before it gets to the refinery, however, it is possible to identify (via the elemental distribution) possible sources and processes employed to recover the gold. The processes used to produce illicit gold are discussed, as well as their effects on the gold metal produced, which may have an effect in masking the origin of the gold. The legislation in South Africa regarding the mining and possession of precious metals is discussed, as well as the establishment of the South African Gold Database as a means for combatting the theft of gold from the major goldmining companies in South Africa and the reason for the type of sample selected to be representative of the gold produced at each mine – unrefined d’ore gold. The different analytical techniques utilised for the analysis of gold grains, and their development and improvement of the past few decades are then discussed. It is important that a method to analyse stolen gold be fairly straight-forward and repeatable, so the different types of <b>instrumention</b> with their strengths and weaknesses are discussed. It is shown that the best method for the analysis of all types of gold material, from a comparison point of view and not for absolute analysis, is laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The development of this technique and its applications for gold are evaluated. The composition of the d’ore samples across the Witwatersrand Basin was analysed in order to determine compositional trends in the extracted gold between mines and goldfields, focussing on three goldfields in particular – Free State, Klerksdorp and West Wits. It is shown that there are two major groups of gold samples, spatially defined, within these three goldfields, which are clearly distinguished on the basis of Pb isotopic systematics and Ni content. It is also shown that the different goldfields can be distinguished on the basis of the d’ore composition, and that to a lesser extent discrimination between individual gold mines in the West Wits and Free State goldfields is possible. Illicit gold recovered from the vicinity of the Driefontein mine was analysed and compared to the samples in the database in order to determine whether the use of d’ore gold samples, produced with the carbon-in-pulp method, would be sufficient to identify illicit gold recovered using mercury amalgamation. It is shown that depending on the elements used, such identification can be made. In addition it is shown that, due to differences in beneficiation methods and the stage within the beneficiation process, the specific type of material processed to extract the gold can be identified. This has important intelligence benefits when investigating the theft and the place from where the material was stolen. The identification of two different types of gold mineralisation within the Witwatersrand Basin, and the use of the database to identify stolen gold from the basin, showed the applicability of the methodology. A second scenario was therefore examined, dealing with gold from two different genetic sources from northern South America, in which illicit gold bars were compared to artisanally recovered gold from two countries, and gold samples from the suspected source as a control. It is shown that in this second case, the two ore deposits could be very clearly distinguished, and even though the artisanal gold was recovered by amalgamation, a clear identification could be made with the control sample. The discrimination made here was much more distinct than that made within the Witwatersrand basin, and this is considered to be due to a single source of gold compared to possible multiple sources, as is the case in the Witwatersrand Basin. Each mine within the Witwatersrand basin extracts gold from one or more reefs, so the variation within and between reefs at the Driefontein mine was studied, using gold prills as samples. The identified variation is discussed in terms of depositional and post-depositional processes, and it is shown that there appear to be two populations of gold within the Ventersdorp Contact Reef (VCR), i. e. one alluvial and the other hydrothermal. For the Carbon Leader Reef (CLR), however, the prill compositions differ from those from the VCR, and show that the gold mineralisation in this reef could have arisen from another, different process or combination of processes. Individual gold grains from different reefs were then analysed, in order to determine to what degree the d’ore and prill results correlate with the gold grain compositions. Four distinct populations were found, each linked to a specific and different mineralisation process. Within the Vaal Reef, alluvial gold of epithermal vein gold from a granite-greenstone terrane was identified, as well as a second population of gold with an anomalous composition (containing U and Pb) which was interpreted as being of a remobilised origin, being formed during the first stages of diagenesis, and a third population of gold typical of low temperature hydrothermal mineralisation. Gold-bearing carbon from the CLR was also analysed, which revealed gold mineralisation attributed to precipitation of colloidal organometallic compounds. The uranium mineralisation associated with the CLR is shown to be co-eval with the gold on microbial mats, and this mineralisation was the source of the Au (and U and Pb) which was remobilised in an initial post-depositional event. The two populations identified within the VCR are confirmed as being of hydrothermal and alluvial origins. The variation within the Witwatersrand Basin, due to differences between source areas of original detrital material and hydrothermal events post-deposition, provide sufficient discrimination to enable the identification of the origin of seized illicit gold. In addition, the use of LA-ICP-MS enables the discrimination of different gold materials of natural origin to a level not seen before, with trace element resolution at micron scales, resulting in a much better and more precise identification of genetic processes.
