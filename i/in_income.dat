30|$|The {{important}} {{point here is}} that most of the observed increase <b>in</b> rural <b>income</b> per capita came from the growth <b>in</b> labor <b>income</b> rather than demographic factors. One might have imagined that the outmigration and the reduction in the dependency rate would be equally important, but they are not, at least not directly. 9 Altogether gains <b>in</b> labor <b>income</b> contributed 68 % of the observed increase <b>in</b> rural <b>income</b> per capita from all sources while the increase <b>in</b> unearned <b>income</b> contributed 16 % and the reduction of rural population an additional 16 %. 10 That means that most of the story of poverty reduction and increases <b>in</b> rural <b>income</b> <b>in</b> the rural sector in Peru were the result of increases <b>in</b> labor <b>income</b> <b>in</b> the countryside, rather than transfers or demographic factors.

5|$|Following World War I, Belgium possessed two {{colonies in}} Africa—the Belgian Congo, {{which it had}} {{controlled}} since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations.

5|$|According to its literature, the Livestock Conservancy {{is funded}} by grants, sales of {{publications}} and promotional materials, membership dues and public donations.

In the 1998 fiscal year, the organization claimed slightly over US$308,000 <b>in</b> <b>income,</b> coming mainly from public donations and membership dues, but also including service revenue, investment income and sales of goods. By 2009, this amount had jumped to slightly more than US$440,000, mainly from donations, grants and service revenue, but also including investment income. In 1998, the organization claimed slightly over US$288,000 in expenses, allocated mainly to program services, but with just under US$30,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses. By 2009, expenses stood at almost US$490,000, spent mostly on employee salaries, benefits and other compensation (which includes program service expenses), but with almost US$150,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses.

5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>income</b> inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} the time series relationship between bank fee income and bank net interest margins in Australia, applying panel vector autoregressions to a unique, hand-collected dataset. Increases <b>in</b> bank fee <b>income</b> {{are being used}} to supplement decreases in net interest margins. The increase in magnitude of fee income associated with reductions <b>in</b> margin <b>income</b> is smaller than the decrease in net interest margins, resulting in a net wealth transfer favouring users of bank services; although not all users of bank services gained and/or gained equally. The overall increase <b>in</b> fee <b>income</b> is marginally greater that the reduction <b>in</b> margin <b>income.</b> It is argued that banks have responded to falling margin revenue by increasing their range of fee-based services, especially insurance.

5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall <b>in</b> <b>income</b> and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, ISCB was in {{financial}} difficulty. Two conferences (ISMB 2003, in Brisbane and ISMB 2006, in Fortaleza) had drastically reduced numbers of participants due to their location, with a corresponding reduction <b>in</b> <b>income.</b> To allow more delegates to attend, {{it was decided to}} limit conference locations to North America and Europe. In January 2007, ISMB and ECCB agreed to hold joint conferences in Europe every other year, beginning with ISMB/ECCB 2007. ISMB would be held in North America in the years between joint meetings. , this pattern has been confirmed to continue until at least 2019. ISMB/ECCB 2007 (held in Vienna, Austria) marked the first conference for which ISCB took full responsibility for organising. Vienna became the first city to host ISMB twice with ISMB/ECCB 2011. This 'return visit' was an experiment intended to reduce the increasing effort required to find suitable conference venues. Although the return to Vienna was only deemed partially successful due to price increases, Boston (which hosted ISMB 2010 and 2014) is predicted to become a 'safe' site which ISMB can periodically return to.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost <b>in</b> <b>income</b> would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of the Gorbachev policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles <b>in</b> <b>income.</b> Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E
