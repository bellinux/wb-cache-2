40|$|This lecture first {{presents}} {{an outline of}} research work by which many troublesome problems {{in the design and}} construction of large tankers were solved, and secondly introduccs the largest tanker ever built in Japan, the A’issho Maru, of 130 000 deadweight tonnage. With regard to design of such tankers, two points, that is, (1) reduction in length of ship (L), and (2) increase in depth (D), should be taken into account from the standpoint of weight saving and of easy fabrication. Researches into structural problems of tank parts and into the dynamic pressure of cargo oil tank, due to ship motions, are described briefly, and show that the maximum impulsive pressure in model tests may be up to 5 times the static fluid pressure and may be observed at the tank top when the natural period of fluid in the tank is resonant with the oscillation period of the ship. Special care should be taken in thc detailed design of Iongitudinals, struts and so on, otherwise cracks will initiate easily at the point of stress conccntration. As regards hull construction practices in such large tankcrs, there secm to be no special problems except in the fabrication and welding of very thick plate of up to 50 mm thickness. Very thick plates thus offer several problems to be solved such as groove shapes, application of ‘Unionmelt’, <b>doubling</b> <b>plate,</b> weld cracking, and back-wave welding technique, ctc. Brief discussion and some test results on these problcms are included and mention is made of the superiority of KZ-typc groove for automatic single-pass submerged-arc welding and of ‘Uranami ‘ welding electrode (which offers a perfect one-sidc welding without backing plate). Finally, construction methods for large tankers are briefly introduced to give an idea of the hull construction of such large tankers in the building berth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For {{an inner}} <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> {{reinforced}} tubular joint, the <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> is welded onto the inner {{surface of the}} chord by using fillet weld, and {{the position of the}} <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> is placed under the brace/chord intersection. Through this reinforcement, the radial stiffness of the chord is improved, and hence the strength is increased. Finite element model is built by using software ABAQUS to analyze the ultimate load and failure mode of inner <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> reinforced tubular T-joints. Overall 432 models with different geometrical parameters and <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> sizes are analyzed. The effect of all the parameters on improving the static strength is discussed. Finally, a parametric equation for predicting the static strength of a tubular T-joint with inner <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> is presented through curve fitting technique, and its accuracy and re-liability are also evaluated by error analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to study the characteristics of mango chips drying using a <b>double</b> <b>plated</b> solar collector. The materials used were sliced mangoes with the thickness of 3, 6, and 8 mm. The equipments used for this research were <b>double</b> <b>plated</b> solar collector, thermocouple, digital balance, thermometer, vacuum oven, and desiccators. The research parameters included {{the rate of heat}} energy absorbed by the <b>double</b> <b>plated</b> solar collector, the heat energy losses, the efficiency of the <b>double</b> <b>plated</b> solar collector and the moisture content of the chips. The results of this study suggested that the use of <b>double</b> <b>plated</b> solar collector could increase the temperature and the amount of heat energy, thus speed up the drying process of the mango chips. The energy needed to evaporate the moisture content in mango decreased in proportion to the increase in drying time. The difference in mango chips’ thickness resulted in different decrease rate in water content until it reached a constant state.

40|$|Reinforcing tubular joints using <b>doubler</b> <b>plates</b> {{has been}} a common {{industrial}} practice as a last minute solution to resolve punching shear problems due to axial compression. However, such reinforcements may have negative effects when the joints are subject to different loading conditions. A parametric stress analysis of T reinforced welded round-to-round tubular joints subjected to axial tension has been performed using the finite element technique. Sixteen sets of geometric parameters {{were used for the}} parametric study by varying three parameters, namely, <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> to chord thickness ratio, tp T, brace diameter to <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> length (width) ratio, d lp, and brace to <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> thickness ratio, t tp. The said study shows that tp T and t tp have significant effects on stress concentration factors but not d lp. The present results for T reinforced tubular joints are compared with those for the corresponding unreinforced joints obtained by the authors and other researchers. In general, the reinforced joints are as good as the corresponding unreinforced joints in withstanding axial tensioning, provided that certain criteria for the selection of <b>doubler</b> <b>plates</b> are adopted. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} of the metal fatigue is contained in pictures that were taken during a routine inspection of the plane years before the crash.

The <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> had a brown nicotine stain {{all the way around}} it that could have been detected visually by any of the engineers when they inspected the plane. The stain would have suggested {{that there might be a}} crack caused by metal fatigue behind the <b>doubler</b> <b>plate,</b> as the nicotine slowly seeped out due to pressure that built up when the plane reached its cruising altitude. The stains were apparently not noticed and no correction was made to the <b>doubler</b> <b>plate.</b> Had an engineer taken notice of the stains, it is likely that the crash would never have happened.|$|R

The said study shows that tp/T and t/tp but not d/lp have significant effects on stress concentration factors in both load cases.

Ideal method is still controversial with risk of unsatisfactory results if not treated properly. Many different techniques of {{internal and external}} fixation are used. This study compares the clinical results in single locked plating versus dual plating (DP) using two incision approaches. Our hypothesis was that DP leads to less collapse and change in alignment at final followup compared with single plating. Materials and Methods: 61 cases of Type C tibial plateau fractures operated between January 2007 and June 2011 were included in this prospective study. All cases were operated either by single lateral locked plate by anterolateral approach or <b>double</b> <b>plating</b> through <b>double</b> incision. All cases were followed {{for a minimum of}} 24 months radiologically and clinically. The statistical analysis was performed using software SPSS 10. 0 to analyze the data. Results: Twenty nine patients in a single lateral locked plate and 32 patients in a <b>double</b> <b>plating</b> group were followed for minimum 2 years. All fractures healed, however there was a significant incidence of malalignment in the single lateral plating group.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{view of the}} {{importance}} of material reduction and rational structural design due to the rapid increase in oil and steel prices, an optimized structural hybrid design system for the <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> of a ship’s hull structure was developed. A direct design process by a structural designer was added to this developed optimized system to increase the design efficiency and provide a way of directly inserting a designer's decisions into the design system process. As the first step of the doubler design system development, the design formulas used in doubler design system were introduced. Based on the introduction of influence coefficients and according to the variations in the doubler length, breadth, doubler thickness, and average corrosion thickness of the main plate, the design formulas for an equivalent plate thickness were developed, and a hybrid design system using these formulas was suggested for the slender <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> of a ship structure subjected to a longitudinal in-plane compression load. By using this developed design system, a more rational <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> design can be expected considering the efficient reinforcement of the plate members of ship structures.

40|$|Background/Aim. Fractures of the {{proximal}} humerus or shaft are common, however, ipsilateral neck and shaft humerus fracture {{is a rare}} phenomenon. This combination injury is challenging for orthopaedic surgeons because of its complex treatment options at present. The {{purpose of this study}} was to review a series of ipsilateral humeral neck and shaft fractures to study the fracture pattern, complications and treatment outcomes of each treatment options used. Methods. A total of six patients (four female and two male) with the average age of 42. 8 years (range: 36 – 49 years) was collected and reviewed retrospectively. Two of them were treated with <b>double</b> <b>plates</b> and four with antegrade intramedullary nail. According to the Neer’s classification, all proximal fractures were two-part surgical neck fractures. All humeral shaft fractures were located at the middle of one third. Five fractures were simple transverse (A 3), one fragmented wedge fracture (B 3). One patient had associated radial nerve palsy. Results. All surgical neck fractures except one united uneventfully in the average time span of 8. 7 weeks. Four humeral shaft fractures healed in near anatomic alignment. The remaining two patients had the nonunion with no radiological signs of fracture healing. The average University of California, Los Angeles End-Results (UCLA) score was 23. 1. On the contrary, the average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon's (ASES) score was 73. 3. The patients treated with antegrade intramedullary nails presented 70. 5 points. The ASES scores were 79 in the <b>double</b> <b>plates</b> group. Conclusions. Ipsilateral humeral shaft and neck fracture is extremely rare. Both antegrade intramedullar nailing and <b>double</b> <b>plates</b> result in healing of fractures. However the risk of complication is lower in the <b>double</b> <b>plating</b> group...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the data}} {{reduction}} equations for common delamination toughness tests are rederived {{for use with}} specimens which have bonded doublers. The common toughness tests considered here are the double cantilever beam (DCB) for mode I toughness; the end notch flexure (3 ENF) and 4 point ENF (4 ENF) for mode II toughness; and the mixed mode bending (MMB) test for testing under combined mode I and mode II loading. Because {{the addition of the}} doublers changes the bending stiffness of the specimens, these data reduction equations may need to be corrected. Doublers were added to the delamination test specimens to solve a premature failure problem. Delamination toughness is normally tested using a beam with an imbedded insert so that one end of the specimen is split into two arms. If the specimen is too thin, or if the toughness of the material is too high, an arm of the specimen may fail in bending before the delamination grows. When this occurs, the toughness of the material cannot be determined. To delay the bending failure so that delamination growth occurs, <b>doubler</b> <b>plates</b> were bonded to both top and bottom surfaces of the specimen. A doubler parameter, beta, which describes how much the use of <b>doubler</b> <b>plates</b> changed the ratio of full thickness to delaminated bending stiffnesses, was defined. When changes to the data reduction equations were required, the changes were minor when written in terms of the beta parameter. The <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> technique was demonstrated by measuring the mixed-mode fracture toughness of a carbon-carbon composite using test specimens which would otherwise have failed before delamination growth occurred. The <b>doubler</b> <b>plate</b> technique may solve several problems that can be encountered when testing delamination fracture toughness...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceArchitectural Engineering and Construction ScienceDonald J. PhillippiSpecial steel moment {{frames are}} one of the most common systems used to resist high seismic forces. Well-proportioned moment {{resisting}} connections are essential. Special steel moment frame connections must be capable of transferring moment and shear forces that are developed in the beams to the column. These connections must be designed as a highly ductile element in order to dissipate extensive energy thus undergo inelastic deformations. <b>Doubler</b> <b>plates</b> and continuity plates have been recommended by several design codes and standards in order to strengthen the column web and prevent the inelastic deformation of the panel zone due to high shear stress concentrations. However, <b>doubler</b> <b>plates</b> and continuity plates are very expensive due to the large amount of detailing and welding requirements. Furthermore, the extensive welding may affect the properties of the steel in which it may cause shrinkage, lower potential notch toughness and cracking. In any of these cases, there is high potential of losing the desirable inelastic performance required for these SMF.

In most fracture patterns the hard bone of the bicipital groove remains intact. In this case series, we describe a novel technique of hybrid <b>double</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis of complex proximal humerus fractures with metaphyseal comminution. Methods: In randomly chosen shoulder specimens and synthetic bones, pilot studies {{for evaluation of}} the feasibility of the technique were performed. Between 4 / 2010 and 1 / 2012 10 patients underwent hybrid <b>double</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis. Seven patients (4 male, 3 female, mean age was 50 years (range 27 – 73)) were available for retrospective analysis. Based on plain radiographs (anterior-posterior and axial view), the fractures were classified according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification (OTA) and by descriptive means (head-split variant (HS), diaphyseal extension or comminution (DE)). Results: Follow-up radiographs demonstrated complete fracture healing in six patients and one incomplete avascular necrosis. None of the patients sustained loss of reduction. Three patients where reoperated. The medium, not adapted, Constant score was 80 Points (58 – 94). Patients subjective satisfaction was graded mean 3 (range: 0 – 6) in the visual analog scoring system (VAS).
