25|$|Following the Northern Cement {{model of}} the 1980, the SBP {{established}} the Smart Gilas Pilipinas program, backed by SBP President Manuel V.

In the 2011 championship at Wuhan, the SBP successfully petitioned the naturalization of Marcus Douthit; the team progressed up to the semifinals {{for the first time}} since 1987. Meeting Jordan, the team lost, never recovering after a third quarter run by the Jordanians.

[...] However, McGee continued, [...] "Much less successful was anything involving Chuck's bachelor party and Big Mike/Jeffster's subsequent desire to save their manly weekend." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that [...] "the best element {{in all of this}} was the introduction of Volkoff, or make that Hartley Winterbottom's, mother and the bonding that occurred between her and John Casey."

[...] In [...] "The Variable", the viewers would get a few more pieces of the puzzle, Lindelof said, and added: [...] "We're not promising any big whiz-bang flash pyrotechnics, but it does serve as a companion piece to another memorable episode, last season's 'The Constant', in which Desmond endured vicious, turbulence-caused side effects from traveling in time." [...] Lindelof also commented that the fifth season is about the rules of time travel as explained by Daniel, and said, [...] "We've never done a flashback story for Daniel, so he's very mysterious. Some of those mysteries will be answered in this episode." [...] Since Lindelof and his show runner partner Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "The Constant", they thought the [...] "sister episode" [...] should be written by someone other than them, which led to Kitsis and Horowitz writing it. The two show runners were pleased with the outcome of the episode. Cuse thought {{it was one of the}} best episodes of the season.|$|E
