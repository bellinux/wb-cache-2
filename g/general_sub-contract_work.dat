50|$|In 1909 Letord and Niepce {{built their}} first aircraft, a monoplane, at their {{workshops}} on rue de Paira at Meudon. In 1910 they were commissioned {{to build a}} Farman type biplane by Colonel Dorand, director of the Service technique de l'aéronautique (STAé) at Chalais-Meudon. Letord went on to build the Dorand AR.1 and 2 and the three-seater armed reconnaissance Letord 1. Letord also undertook <b>sub-contract</b> <b>work</b> for major aircraft manufacturers such as Nieuport. Some 1,500 aircraft were ordered by the Aéronautique Militaire between all the variants, with something like 300 actually produced {{before the end of}} the war.|$|R
50|$|Once {{selected}} by the United States, it was further decided to form a partnership between the United States Air Force, then beginning development of the plane for service, and nations of the NATO alliance who had a similar need for a lightweight fighter.

40|$|This book explores how {{immigration}} laws, while {{aimed at}} discouraging undocumented migration, actually sustain it. It documents {{the circumstances that}} have caused previously documented migrants to become undocumented and explores {{the impact of their}} changing status on their families and on their own employment opportunities. The authors argue that undocumented migrants are forced into the most precarious types of work, and changes in the way that employment is organised, with a shift into temporary, agency and <b>sub-contracted</b> <b>work,</b> makes undocumented migrants particularly attractive in some employment markets. This groundbreaking volume draws substantially on data collected from a two-year research study in seven European countries that was focused on understanding the impact of migration flows on EU labour markets...|$|R
5000|$|While Sloane and Begley reprised their roles, Heflin {{replaced}} Kiley in {{the role}} of up-and-coming executive Fred Staples, though at 46, he was arguably a little too old to play a junior executive. But Serling also changed Staples' character. Instead of a junior-level manager of a small factory that had done some <b>sub-contracting</b> <b>work</b> for Ramsey, he was now shown as the manager of a presumably much larger facility taken over by [...] "Ramsey and Company", and whose performance there in keeping the factory afloat during that period impressed Ramsey enough to hire Staples direct. In the teleplay, the other execs talk of having expected a much older man. That was also omitted from the film version.|$|R
50|$|MGM {{operated}} {{their own}} record manufacturing plant at Bloomfield, New Jersey, from 1947 until 1972; pressing {{not only their}} own records but {{a great deal of}} <b>sub-contract</b> <b>work</b> for other record companies, including Atlantic Records. For several years in the late 1940s-early 1950s, MGM operated a radio syndication business, producing The MGM Theater of the Air {{and a variety of other}} series based on inactive movie properties such as Dr. Kildare, Andy Hardy, Maisie, and Crime Does Not Pay. The MGM record pressing plant also manufactured the electrical transcriptions used to distribute the shows to local stations. The record manufacturing division was closed when MGM Records was sold to PolyGram; after which MGM's former competitors began manufacturing records issued by MGM.|$|R
50|$|Experienced Automation Technicians with {{advanced}} training may become specialists or troubleshooters who help other technicians diagnose difficult problems, or work with engineers in designing equipment and developing maintenance procedures. Automation Technicians with leadership ability also may eventually become maintenance supervisors or service managers. Due to the highly specialized {{skills and knowledge}} required, there are many opportunities available to Automation Technicians {{in the service sector}} where there is a great demand for contract and <b>sub-contract</b> <b>work</b> with smaller manufacturing and distribution companies. Some experienced Automation Technicians open their own design, installation and maintenance companies. They can also become wholesalers or retailers of automation equipment, including inside and outside sales of automation equipment and systems. Because of their familiarity with control systems and equipment, Automation Technicians are particularly well qualified to become manufacturers' sales representatives. Other related opportunities include customer service, quality-control, quality-assurance and consulting.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the circumstances leading to fifty-five married Chinese women’s withdrawal from participation in the formal sector to enter the informal sector specifically in home-based <b>sub-contracting</b> <b>work.</b> These women <b>sub-contract</b> from the garment makers to sew, cut and embroider at home while caring for their family. The article also discusses if the efforts of these home-based sub-contractors are costed and valued by the factories, their families and themselves. The home-based sub-contractors provide an industrial reserve army that is truly disposable, flexible and cheap. They create an informal sector within the formal structure giving {{the best of both}} worlds for the extraction of surplus by the garment makers. However, although home-based sub-contractors offer tremendous advantages to the garment industry to ensure its competitiveness and flexibility, the industry, evidently, does not value them nor are they costed. Even the husbands fail to value these women’s contribution to family well-being...|$|R
40|$|The central aim of {{this paper}} is to link the {{competitive}} performance of small, high technology defence firms to their ability to adapt to changes in the procurement process. The paper draws upon an extensive research study focused on small high technology defence firms in the UK. Firms in the sample range from 5 to 200 employees, and £ 50, 000 to £ 10 million sales turnover. The empirical analysis of the ability to create and sustain competitive advantages focuses on strategic determinants, and those inter-organisational variables that influence the performance of small firms in tendering for defence sub-contracts. The theoretical underpinnings of the study are based on Porter’s strategic management framework which suggests a close relationship between industry structure, strategy and performance. An organisation’s performance is measured by the percentage success rate of tendering for defence <b>sub-contract</b> <b>work</b> for the period 1995 through to mid- 1996...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to project {{engineering at the}} freshmen level is presented. For {{the past two years}} a pilot offering of a two-course sequence has been implemented. The goal of the sequence is to present a realistic view of mechanical engineering, provide the students with a set of basic skills, and develop team skills {{through the use of a}} simulated industrial environment. Practicing engineers and experts meet with the students to exchange ideas and discuss career paths. Technical writing, oral presentations, graphics, Internet access, and spreadsheets are also covered in skills labs. In the projects portion of the course, students play the role of design engineers within a "class corporation.

40|$|Objective To {{document}} the personal, educational and professional skills that characterise veterinarians pursuing careers as agricultural consultants {{and to determine}} the future direction for veterinary-related advisory services to agriculture in Australia. Design Thirty-six veterinarians practising as consultants in agriculture throughout Australia were sent a postal survey in 1994. Procedure A descriptive analysis was chosen because of the relatively small population available to sample. Comparisons were made on a percentage basis where appropriate. Results Twenty-four useable responses to the questionnaire were received. Consultants were mostly men with an agricultural background, aged 31 to 40 years. They considered their undergraduate veterinary studies to be a stepping stone into further education and practical experience and ultimately consultancy. Consultants predicted an increased reliance for their work on corporate farms, private agribusiness, {{research and development and}} <b>sub-contracted</b> <b>work,</b> rather than on family-owned farms. Consultants disagreed on the wisdom of combining consultancy activities with alternative businesses (for instance mixed veterinary practice). Only 13 consultants derived greater than 76...|$|R
40|$|Lean {{construction}} {{presents an}} opportunity for theory to mix with practical solutions to achieve efficiency in construction and to rethink {{the way things are}} done to improve production. This paper overviews the history of scheduling systems in construction and suggests that current Lean Construction Thinking is dominated by task-based approaches, such as Critical-Path, and that location-based scheduling techniques provide a promising alternative. The flow of resources through locations, termed work-flow, and the resultant ability to control hand-over between both locations and crews, greatly empowers the management of construction from the perspective of day-to-day management of activities. The paper concentrates on the practical problems inherent in adopting theory and proposes new strategies for adapting scheduling systems for direct relevance to site management. The concept of micro-management is introduced, based on location-based scheduling. From this, a suite of strategies for managing <b>sub-contracted</b> <b>work</b> crews is developed, concentrating on location, work flow and site management. Principles for work planning and error management are proposed; including related procurement strategies...|$|R

Rollason Aircraft Services Ltd, later renamed Field Consolidated Aircraft Services Ltd, carried out repairs and refurbishment of Airspeed Oxfords and de Havilland Tiger Moths, {{as part of the}} Civilian Repair Organisation. GAL took over most buildings on and around Hanworth Park, then consolidated the factory area, and it added a large flight shed facing the park. GAL designed and developed its own designs, with quantity production of GAL.48 Hotspur and GAL.49 Hamilcar gliders. It also produced less-successful designs, including GAL.33 Cagnet, GAL.38 Fleet Shadower, GAL.45 Owlet, GAL.47 (AOP), GAL.55, plus GAL.56 experimental flying wing gliders. <b>Sub-contract</b> <b>work</b> included construction of Fairey Firefly Mk.I monoplanes, plus major assemblies for types including Blackburn Shark, Supermarine Spitfire, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle.

50|$|An {{insurance}} investigator examines matters {{pertaining to}} insurance claims that are suspicious or otherwise in doubt for some reason. Investigators {{in this field}} have differing specialties and backgrounds. Some insurance companies have their own in-house investigation teams while other companies <b>sub-contract</b> the <b>work</b> to private investigators or private investigation firms. Although such investigations are usually conducted to combat fraud, very often investigators will be working simply to establish the circumstances of a particular claim (for example, in a multi-vehicular road accident involving various parties, claims and insurance companies).|$|R
40|$|In the 1980 s, {{labour market}} {{flexibility}} came {{to be regarded as}} a potential panacea for unemployment. Greater wage and employment flexibility would reduce unit labour costs and increase productivity. Firms would become more competitive and profit margins would increase. Investment would be stimulated resulting in increased economic growth and employment. Labour market flexibility would thus trigger a supply-side generated, virtuous circle of investment, growth and employment. In the 1990 s, the potential fallout from government policies which have deregulated the labour market and actively encouraged the growth of 'flexible' forms of employment is becoming apparent. There is now real concern that the undoubted increase in these nonstandard forms of employment (such as parttime, temporary and <b>sub-contracting</b> <b>work)</b> may have damaged the skills base of the economy and increased segmentation of the labour market. Additionally, there is the oftenoverlooked question of the link between the increase in (generally) relatively low-paid, flexible jobs and government finances. This article addresses the last issue {{in the context of the}} Scottish economy and the decision to establish a parliament in Edinburgh with income tax varying powers. It considers whether the present trend in Scottish labour market restructuring will provide a sustainable base for the forthcoming Parliament's tax varying powers and examines what the implications would be if a substitution of part-time for full-time work were to occur...|$|R
