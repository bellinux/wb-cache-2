50|$|<b>Junior</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Officer</b> (JPO) is a {{term used}} for young {{professionals}} usually {{under the age of}} 32 with an advanced university degree and a minimum of two years of professional experience. They are recruited at P1/P2 level by United Nations organizations. The JPO positions are sponsored by participating donor governments, usually for a period of two to three years. Although the positions are funded by donor countries, the JPO is directly employed by the organization. JPOs are generally nationals of donor countries participating in the programme, and some donors such as the Netherlands and Switzerland also finance nationals of developing countries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Junior</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Officer</b> Programmes in the UN Common System recruit Junior Professional Officers under {{bilateral}} agreements between the respective United Nations organizations, agencies, funds and programmes and donor countries. The programmes {{evolved from the}} United Nations’ Associate Experts (AE) programme (now UN JPO Programme), which was initiated by the Netherlands to provide additional support to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as well as training for young professionals. Other UN agencies and countries were encouraged to participate, and a UN system mandate was established under the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolution 849 (XXXII) of 4 August 1961. Today, the JPO Programme includes 30 UN Organizations and 30 donor countries.|$|E

50|$|At this time, {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the insolvency problem by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) was {{becoming more and more}} acute. The main objective that the HIPC Initiative addressed was debt relief, and the beneficiary countries had to take in hand their daily debt management responsibilities, among those, to maintain an accurate data base of all public, domestic and external, public debt. Many DMFAS user countries were HIPCs, and this fact made that developed donor countries responded with alacrity to UNCTAD/DMFAS call: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K. responded positively to support the DMFAS Programme, either by depositing resources with UNCTAD technical cooperation trust funds or by putting at the disposal of the Programme <b>Junior</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Officers</b> (JPOs), and in some cases, senior officers as well. Therefore, in spite of UNDP financing withdrawal the upgrading to version DMFAS 5 in ORACLE was carried over.|$|R
40|$|How can {{we prepare}} for and motivate ongoing {{improvements}} in development {{practice in the}} world of universal sustainable development goals? International Development Studies courses are a relatively new phenomenon. Earlier, people entered the field with technical backgrounds and learnt on the job. Similarly, many took the road from long-term international volunteering or <b>Junior</b> Expert/Junior <b>Professional</b> <b>Officer</b> posts, and moved into a career in international development [Baillie Smith, M. and N. Laurie, 2011, ‘International volunteering and development: Global citizenship and neoliberal professionalisation today’, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers; Devereux, P., 2008, ‘International volunteering for development and sustainability: Outdated paternalism or a radical response to globalisation?’, Development in Practice, Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 357 – 370; White, P., 2015, ‘The spectrum of motivations, experiences and attitudes in technical development cooperation’, Forum for Development Studies, Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 89 – 112]. More recently, development studies courses have emerged. Are they finding the right balance between critical approaches, history and vocational skills? A difference in motivations and expectations between early and mid-late career Finnish development workers was found from earlier research (White, 2015). With this case study we add a focus on the pre-career stage (via questionnaires and interviews), considering the motivations of Finnish development studies students in first year, postgraduate studies and after graduation. The article acknowledges the range of motivations and experience of those engaged with international development. It also considers the tension between critical theory and vocational skills. Competencies for development practice encompass a combination of theoretical knowledge, technical skills, administrative knowhow and attitudinal factors. We conclude that co-production, combining academic courses and research, including reflective and experiential practice, is a positive step forward...|$|R

40|$|This {{comparative}} analysis of recent transitions to democracy in Argentina and Chile examines (1) {{the impact of}} the type of transition on democratic consolidation; (2) how resolving the problem of past human rights violations has influenced civil-military relations and democratic stability; and (3) what has been the role of human rights NGOs, the Catholic Church, andd political parties. A major conclusion is that state-civil society linkages are important to understanding demodratic transition and consolidation and that these linkages have unfortunately been deemphasised in much recent transition theory.

One version {{of this is the}} <b>Junior</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Officer</b> Programme (JPO), where countries finance a vacancy within an international organisation so that a national of their country can work within this organisation for a period of time. Countries hope that a JPO will then be retained by the organisation after completion of their assignment. This research is process evaluation of 16 European JPO programmes and was commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The JPO programmes of the different countries are found to differ significantly from each other both in their format and their successfulness at meeting their various goals. This research concludes with policy advice on how the Netherlands, other European countries and the relevant international multilateral organisations can improve the programme...|$|E

The program was in effect from 2002 until 2006 {{with a total of}} forty-one U. S. citizens and permanent residents placed in the IAEA. The USSP created a <b>Junior</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Officer</b> (JPO) Program in 2005 that replaced the internship program at the IAEA. The JPO program creates opportunities for U. S. college graduates to become IAEA employees for a period of one to two years to help increase the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards. The twenty three former and current JPOs work in varying fields such as software development, information collection and analysis, non-destructive analysis systems, and unattended monitoring systems. This paper will look at the impacts of the USSP internship and JPO program on the interns and JPOs, the U. S. government, and the IAEA. Academic backgrounds, past involvement in nuclear fields, program assessment, and post-program positions were recorded and analyzed through two studies using questionnaires sent to former interns and former and current JPOs. This paper will discuss the effects of the programs on the careers of the interns and JPOs, present the evaluations of the internship and JPO Programs, and report the recommendations for changes...|$|E

In this article their assumption of a uniform distribution for time to promotion is first changed to the more natural and empirically tested exponential distribution. The resulting decision rule for the <b>junior</b> <b>professional</b> becomes very simple and intuitively appealing and can be applied continuously. Additional generalizations of the exponential distribution are then analyzed. Some very interesting results {{on the effects of}} uncertainty are obtained. Myopic decision rules are shown to be nonoptimal in certain situations. However, these changes in the Cooter and Restrepo model are obtained at a cost. The model cannot be closed. The demand for labor is not taken into account., Thus, the supply side is considered in isolation. Nevertheless, the more appealing time to promotion densities used here give better insights into the behavior of <b>junior</b> <b>professionals</b> within the basic Cooter and Restrepo framework. ...|$|R
