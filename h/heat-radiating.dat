Heat sinks (<b>heat-radiating</b> metallic objects) {{attached with}} some-portions of the circuit that produce more heat/ more vulnerable to heat. often, fans are required. Some high-voltage instruments kept immersed in oil. In some cases, to remove unwanted heat, some cooling-system like air-condition or refrigerating-heat-pumps may be required.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of engine}} has one or more rows of {{cylinders}} arranged around a centrally located crankcase. Each row generally has an odd number of cylinders to produce smooth operation. A radial engine has only one crank throw per row and a relatively small crankcase, resulting in a favorable power-to-weight ratio. Because the cylinder arrangement exposes {{a large amount of}} the engine's <b>heat-radiating</b> surfaces to the air and tends to cancel reciprocating forces, radials tend to cool evenly and run smoothly. The lower cylinders, which are under the crankcase, may collect oil when the engine has been stopped for an extended period. If this oil is not cleared from the cylinders prior to starting the engine, serious damage due to hydrostatic lock may occur.|$|E
5000|$|Low power triodes have a {{concentric}} construction (see drawing right), {{with the}} grid and plate as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode. The cathode is a narrow metal tube down the center. Inside the cathode is a filament called the [...] "heater" [...] {{consisting of a}} narrow strip of high resistance tungsten wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000 °C). This type is called an [...] "indirectly heated cathode" [...] The cathode is coated {{with a mixture of}} alkaline earth oxides such as calcium and thorium oxide which reduces its work function so it produces more electrons. The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode. The plate is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid. It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with <b>heat-radiating</b> fins. The electrons travel in a radial direction, from the cathode through the grid wires to the plate. The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic insulators and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins. A [...] "getter", a small amount of shiny barium metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.|$|E
40|$|A simplified, {{lightweight}} {{system for}} dissipating {{heat of a}} regenerative fuel- cell system would include a heat pipe with its evaporator end placed at the heat source and its condenser end integrated into {{the wall of the}} regenerative fuel cell system gas-storage tanks. The tank walls act as <b>heat-radiating</b> surfaces for cooling the regenerative fuel cell system. The system was conceived for use in outer space, where radiation is the only physical mechanism available for transferring heat to the environment. The system could also be adapted for use on propellant tanks or other large-surface-area structures to convert them to space <b>heat-radiating</b> structures. Typically for a regenerative fuel cell system, the radiator is separate from the gas-storage tanks. By using each tank s surface as a <b>heat-radiating</b> surface, the need for a separate, potentially massive radiator structure is eliminated. In addition to the mass savings, overall volume is reduced because a more compact packaging scheme is possible. The underlying tank wall structure provides ample support for heat pipes that help to distribute the heat over the entire tank surface. The heat pipes are attached to the outer surface of each gas-storage tank by use of a high-thermal conductance, carbon-fiber composite-material wrap. Through proper choice of the composite layup, it is possible to exploit the high longitudinal conductivity of the carbon fibers (greater than the thermal conductivity of copper) to minimize the unevenness of the temperature distribution over the tank surface, thereby helping to maximize the overall heat-transfer efficiency. In a prototype of the system, the heat pipe and the composite wrap contribute an average mass of 340 g/sq m of radiator area. Lightweight space radiator panels have a mass of about 3, 000 g/sq m of radiator area, so this technique saves almost 90 percent of the mass of separate radiator panels. In tests, the modified surface of the tank was found to have an emissivity of 0. 85. The composite wrap remained tightly bound {{to the surface of the}} tank throughout the testing in thermal vacuum conditions...|$|E
40|$|A two-dimensional, transient, heat-transfer {{analysis}} {{was made to}} determine the temperature response {{in the core of}} a conceptual space-power nuclear reactor following a total loss of reactor coolant. With loss of coolant from the reactor, the controlling mode of heat transfer is thermal radiation. In one of the schemes considered for removing decay heat from the core, it was assumed that the 4 pi shield which surrounds the core acts as a constant-temperature sink (temperature, 700 K) for absorption of thermal radiation from the core. Results based on this scheme of heat removal show that melting of fuel in the core is possible only when the emissivity of the <b>heat-radiating</b> surfaces in the core is less than about 0. 40. In another scheme for removing the afterheat, the core centerline fuel pin was replaced by a redundant, constant temperature, coolant channel. Based on an emissivity of 0. 20 for all material surfaces in the core, the calculated maximum fuel temperature for this scheme of heat removal was 2840 K, or about 90 K less than the melting temperature of the UN fuel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to focus on the application of the artificial neural network to configure a <b>heat-radiating</b> model for cooling towers within the parameters of fluctuating in air flow or cooling water flow. To achieve the objective, a cooling tower heat balancing equation have been used to instill the correlations between a cooling tower cooling load to the four predefined parameters. Based on the premise established, the parameters of a cooling tower’s air flow and cooling water flow in a modulated process are utilized in an experimental system for collecting relevant operating data. Lastly, the artificial neural network tool derived from the Matlab software is utilized to define the input parameters being – the cooling water temperature, ambient web-bulb temperature, cooling tower air flow, and cooling water flow, with an objective set to instilling a cooling tower model for defining a cooling tower cooling load. In addition, the tested figures are compared to the simulated figures for verifying the cooling tower model. By utilizing the method derived from the model, the mean error of between 0. 72 and 2. 13 % is obtained, with R 2 value rated at between 0. 97 and 0. 99. The experiment findings show a relatively high reliability that can be achieved for configuring a model by using the artificial neural network. With the support of an optimized computation method, the model can be applied as an optimization operating strategy for an air-conditioning system’s cooling water loop...|$|E
40|$|The World Out There {{is a novel}} {{placed in}} Gainesville, FL during the early nineties and its North-central Florida setting is {{important}} as both physical and psychological space. In addition to Spanish moss, <b>heat-radiating</b> highways, and palmettos, the novel explores the violence beneath the glittering surface of the “sunshine” state: racial tensions, neo-conservative violence against nonconformists, and a fictionalization of a brutal string of serial murders {{at the end of}} the 20 th century, the 1990 Danny Rolling killings. Although neither Rolling nor any of his victims are actual characters in the novel, this fictionalized version of the murders acts as an ominous backdrop for the action. The car wreck into Lake Walters, coming within the first pages of the book, is like a catalyst for action—the concentric waves radiating from the car dropping through that lake surface like the danger reverberating throughout the narrative, danger which touches three of the characters 2 ̆ 7 lives: the child Hank 2 ̆ 7 s near-drowning, his mother Jan 2 ̆ 7 s rape, a vicious beating which Jan 2 ̆ 7 s friend William endures. ^ A big part of the novel concerns reading people, discovering the private personalities that exist beneath the public ones. The chapters from William 2 ̆ 7 s perspective are sprinkled with images of his tattoos. These symbols offer us clues as to the secret self William hides beneath his exterior even as he tries to make meaning of the exterior/interior selves of the other characters in the novel. These tattoos also relate to a major theme—the importance of self-expression and connection with others—a theme which keeps the novel from being bleak despite the traumas inflicted on the different characters. In fact, the book is, finally, hopeful, concerning how people manage to find purpose and meaning in a scary, sometimes meaningless world. The novel argues for the necessity of art, for creating beautiful things. Even more importantly, the novel argues that in a very dangerous world people must forge connections with others, that they must overcome their fears, and that they must love. ...|$|E
