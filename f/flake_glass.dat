Para o teste C, corpos-de-prova (60 x 6 x 2 mm) foram confeccionados com as resinas Lucitone 550 (L) e Vipi Wave (V) e reembasados (2 mm) com o mesmo {{material}} (L/L ou V/V) ou com as resinas para reembasamento imediato Tokuyama Rebase II (T) e Ufi Gel Hard (U). Corpos-de-prova puros de L, V, T e U (60 x 6 x 4 mm) também foram confeccionados para se determinar a resistência ao impacto dessas resinas. Para a avaliação da adição de reforço, foi adicionado ao pó das resinas reembasadoras 5 %, em massa, do reforço de floco de vidro “glass flake” (UR, TR, L/UR, L/TR, V/UR, V/TR). 320 corpos-de-prova foram confeccionados, sendo 20 para cada condição experimental. Metade desses foi submetida à ciclagem mecânica (10. 000 ciclos) com freqüência de 5 Hz (LC, VC, TC, UC, URC, TRC, L/URC, L/TRC, V/URC, V/TRC). Um entalhe, em forma de V foi realizado na largura, na superfície correspondente ao material reembasador, com profundidade de 0, 8 mm, permanecendo 3, 2 mm de material intacto. O teste foi realizado com pêndulo de 0, 5 J e distância de 50 mm entre os suportes. Os resultados (kJ/ m 2) foram analisados utilizando-se ANOVA e teste de Dunnet C (α =. 05). Não houve diferenças estatisticamente significantes entre as médias de resistência ao impacto das condições L, L/L, V, V/V, LC, L/LC, VC e V/VC. As condições experimentais relativas às resinas autopolimerizáveis U, T, UC, TC, UR, TR e TRC foram estatisticamente iguais entre si. Além disso, URC também foi estatisticamente igual a U, T, UC, TC, TR e TRC, porém, maior do que UR. Não houve diferença significativa (P>. 05) entre as médias de resistência [...] . This study {{evaluated the}} effect of the addition reinforcement and cyclic loading on the resistance to impact of Charpy tests (C) and free falling-dart (FD) for the denture base resins and reline materials. To test the C, bars (60 x 6 x 2 mm) were prepared with the resins Lucitone 550 (L) and Vipi Wave (V) and relined (2 mm) with the same material (L / L or V / V) or with relining resins Tokuyama Rebase II (T) and UFI Gel Hard (U). Specimens pure of L, V, T and U (60 x 6 x 4 mm) were also made to determine the impact resistance of these resins. For the evaluation of the addition of reinforcement, was added to the powder of the relining resins 5 % by weight of the glass <b>flake</b> <b>glass</b> flake (UR, TR, L / UR, L / TR, V / UR, V / TR). 320 specimens were made, 20 for each experimental condition. Half of these were subjected to cyclic loading (10, 000 cycles) with a frequency of 5 Hz (LC, VC, TC, UC, URC, TRC, L / URC, L / TRC, V / URC, V / TRC). A notch in the form of V was carried out in width, the area corresponding to the relining material with depth of 0. 8 mm, 3. 2 mm of material remained intact. The test was conducted with pendulum of 0. 5 J and 50 mm distance between the supports. The results (kJ/ m 2) were analyzed using the ANOVA and Dunnet C test (α =. 05). No significant differences were noted among the mean impact values of L, L / L, V, V / V, LC, L / LC, VC and V / VC. The experimental conditions for relining resins U, T, UC, TC, UR, TR and TRC were statistically equal between themselves. In addition, URC was statistically equal to U, T, UC, TC, TR and TRC, however, higher than UR. No significant differences were noted (P>. 05) mong the mean impact values of L/ U, V/ U, L/ UC, V/ UC, L/URC and V/ URC. These conditions had values of resistance to impact significantly lower than those of the resin tested pure L and T (P <. 05). There was [...] .

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> on physical properties of conventional heat cure denture base resins and to compare it with a high impact strength denture base resin. Materials and Methods: Test specimens were divided into Group 1 - poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Trevalon), Group 2 - Trevalon HI, Group 3 - 5 % <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> + 95 % PMMA (Trevalon), Group 4 - 10 % <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> + 90 % PMMA (Trevalon), and Group 5 - 20 % <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> + 80 % PMMA (Trevalon). For <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> modified groups, part of PMMA (powder) was substituted with the same weight of <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> (GF 003 m) as required, to bring it to 100 % powder. Flexural strength was tested using three-point bending test and impact strength with Izod type impact tester. Results: Plain PMMA (Trevalon), showed the highest value of flexural strength followed by Trevalon HI. Trevalon HI (highly cross-linked PMMA) group showed the highest value of impact strength. Conclusion: Flexural strength of unmodified PMMA denture base resin decreases with increase in the concentration of <b>glass</b> <b>flakes.</b> Impact strength does not show any significant change at 5 % concentration of <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> and impact strength significantly reduces with the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> in 10 % and 20 %...|$|R

30|$|From {{the fifteenth}} century on, small glass {{particles}} were used as additives to paint layers [2 – 5] and as decorative materials in wall paintings and plaster [6 – 8]. Powdered glass particles were found in priming and paint layers of several European paintings from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century [3, 9]. A lead glass sample from a late fifteenth century German altarpiece also contained copper as colouring agent [3]. In the sixteenth century glass was added mainly for technical purposes such as siccatives and grounding. Laboratory testing carried out with modern ingredients indicated that the glass content was due to a better texture and colour depth of the tested red lakes [3]. A similar approach can be assumed for <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> used in plaster decorations. <b>Glass</b> <b>flakes</b> from 1722 in the Sala Terrena of Weissenstein Castle at Pommersfelden, Bavaria, {{were found to be}} lead glass with copper and iron as colouring elements [10]. <b>Glass</b> <b>flakes</b> on stucco work from 1714 in the former Grotto Hall in the Zwinger of Dresden (now Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon), Germany, were mainly made of lead glass as well besides some examples being soda-lime glass [11].|$|R

The site on Pabaju is important as it has not suffered the same degree of disturbance from tourists as similar sites on the nearby Australian mainland. The presence of buttons, <b>flaked</b> <b>glass</b> and other artefacts on the site are suggestive of rituals enacted just after European settlement. This was at a time of significant social and political upheaval for the Gudang people who bore the brunt of the impact of European settlement in the region as the settlement of Somerset was located in the heartland of their traditional lands a mere 3 km south south-east of Tarrungi.

30|$|Not surprisingly, the {{composition}} of the different coloured <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> does not match {{the composition}} of English glass objects like drinking vessels or bottles of late seventeenth and eighteenth century, which are reported to be mostly high potassium-lead glasses [14, 16]. Mixed alkali glasses with a compositions similar to that found in this investigation for the flakes I/ 3, I/ 39, I/ 60 and I/ 62 (Figs.  2, 3; Table  2) are reported for a late seventeenth century glass manufacture in Silkstone, however not containing lead [19]. [3], who investigated a wide range of glass particles from paintings from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century occasionally found lead glass (made with wood ash) or mixed alkali glass without lead. The Italian glasses investigated by these authors date from the sixteenth century, when lead glass was known but not common in Italy. Similar considerations may be true for North European and English glass production, where lead glass is reported occasionally for the Middle Ages [12, 13]. These medieval lead glasses, on the other hand, show very similar compositions to the high lead <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> with only traces of alkali and calcium oxides investigated here (I/ 18, I/ 34, I/ 59; Fig.  4; Table  3) [12]. In contrary, eighteenth century <b>glass</b> <b>flakes</b> used in plaster decorations from Germany were mainly mixed alkali glass without lead (Weissenstein Castle 1722) or high lead with low potassium and calcium content (Grotto hall Dresden 1714) [10, 11].|$|R

40|$|Influence of {{particle}} shape on hydrocyclone classification was investigated. Classification tests using hydrocyclone and cyclosizer showed that coarse fractions of plate-like particles such as PTFE and <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> used here {{were not necessarily}} recovered as underflow product, especially at relatively high inlet velocity. Settling velocity of the <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> particles in centrifugal field was estimated using a centrifugal particle size analyzer, and {{it was revealed that}} differences in settling velocity between coarse and fine <b>glass</b> <b>flake</b> particles became smaller with increases in angular velocity. Moreover, settling test of glass plate in water or glycerin solution was conducted to know relationship between particle Reynolds number (Re) and settling velocity of the plate. At smaller Re condition, the glass plate settled straight and stably, and larger plate settled faster than smaller plate. However, oscillating motion of the plate occurred in the region of high Re, and settling velocities of the large plate became smaller than that of the small plate in such conditions. Drag coefficient (C) calculated based on the settling velocity of the glass plate {{is similar to that of}} glass spheres below Re of about 50, above which it became larger than that of glass sphere. Approximation formula of correlaton between Re and C suggests that the influence of the Re on C can be neglected in the region of high Re, and C increases with increases in the ratio of the particle diameter to thickness (D/T). The decrease of the difference in settling velocity recognized in the centrifugal settling test and the effect of the particle shape (D/T) on C at high Re region are considered to be able to affect the hydrocyclone classification. The misplacement of coarse plate-like particles in the hydrocyclone and cyclosizer tests could be ascribed to the particle shape effects...|$|R
