40|$|The {{temperature}} of tomato and eggplant fruit was measured during distribution from harvest in Fukuoka to arrival at a wholesale market in Tokyo. There were three critical points {{to be improved}} where the <b>fresh</b> <b>produces</b> were possibly exposed to high temperature. First, the produce temperature remarkably rised before pre-cooling, and at this point, the temperature reached the maximum. Second, after pre-cooling, the <b>fresh</b> <b>produces</b> were again warmed dur-ing sorting and packaging in the packing house in which the temperature was not controlled. Third, the temperature increased in the packing house was remained in the truck. Using the experimental data simulated the temperature during distribution, the effect of temperature changes on the internal quality of <b>fresh</b> <b>produces</b> was examined. The {{results showed that the}} temperature changes remarkably decreased the organic acid and sugar con-tents of the <b>fresh</b> <b>produces</b> while the firmness was little affected. Therefore, it is considered that the <b>fresh</b> <b>produces</b> should be consistently kept at low temperature by improving the critical points during distribution in order to preserve the internal quality of <b>fresh</b> <b>produces...</b>|$|R

5|$|The name Buttercross {{originates}} {{from their}} location in market places, where people from neighbouring villages would gather around the market cross to buy locally produced products. The <b>fresh</b> <b>produce</b> {{was laid out}} and displayed on the stepped bases of the cross. The market in Dunster attracted people from surrounding villages and towns {{as far away as}} Taunton and Bodmin. The Dunster Butter Cross was erected in the late 14th or early 15th century and originally stood in the High Street, possibly {{at the southern end of}} the high street, near the Yarn Market. A cross, which was later known as the high cross, was recorded in 1461; by 1689 it was known as the Butter Cross.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning <b>fresh</b> <b>produce</b> rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} period of power outage was {{a major problem for}} the residents in Broome. Residents had to wait for days for the power supply to be restored. As all of the distribution lines were above ground, Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones. Linesmen from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect all high voltage distribution lines before these could be re-energised. Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion. These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected. The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April, 11days after Rosita struck. Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth, and this proved difficult to access information about any available supplies in the town. People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no <b>fresh</b> <b>produce</b> arriving. However, power was restored {{a few days after the}} cyclone hit. There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for <b>fresh</b> <b>produce.</b> Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, {{on the site of}} the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.|$|E
