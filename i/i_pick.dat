So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E

500|$|Ken Watanabe as Mr. Saito, a Japanese {{businessman}} who employs Cobb for the team's mission. Nolan wrote the role with Watanabe in mind, {{as he wanted}} to work with him again after Batman Begins. Inception is Watanabe's first work in a contemporary setting where his primary language is English. Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level: [...] "First chapter in my castle, <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> up some hidden feelings of the cycle. It's magical, powerful and then the first dream. And back to the second chapter, in the old hotel, <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> up [...] sharp and more calm and smart and it's a little bit [...] different process to make up the character of any movie".|$|E

500|$|System Shock {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{during the final}} stages of [...] development, between December 1992 and January 1993. Designer and programmer Doug Church spent this period at the Texas headquarters of publisher Origin Systems, and discussions about Looking Glass Technologies' next project occurred between him and producer Warren Spector, with input from designer Austin Grossman and company head Paul Neurath in Massachusetts. According to Church, the team believed that they had made [...] "too many dungeon games"; and Neurath later explained that they were experiencing burnout after the rushed development of Ultima Underworld II. As a result, they decided to create another [...] "immersive simulation game", but without a fantasy setting. They briefly considered placing the game in modern day, but Church said that the idea was rejected because [...] "it [...] just beg so many questions: why can't <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> up the phone, why can't I get on the train, and so on". Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts, where he, Neurath and Grossman brainstormed possible science fiction settings for the game. According to Spector, the game was initially titled [...] "Alien Commander" [...] and was a spin-off of the Wing Commander series; however, this idea was soon replaced entirely. Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise, because it meant that they [...] "could basically do whatever [...] liked".|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm Gonna Leave You on the Outskirts of Town" [...] was an [...] "answer record" [...] to Jordan's earlier [...] "I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town". It became Jordan's {{first major}} chart hit, {{reaching}} number 2 on Billboard's Harlem Hit Parade. His next side, [...] "What's the Use of Getting Sober (When You're Gonna Get Drunk Again)", became Jordan's first number 1 hit, reaching {{the top of}} the Harlem Hit Parade in December 1942. A subsequent side, [...] "The Chicks <b>I</b> <b>Pick</b> Are Slender, Tender and Fine", reached number 10 in January 1943.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} release under Pipe Records, Far From Silent, Joseph {{explored}} {{the complications of}} fame and fortune, in the second track [...] "Celebrity". The eighth track, entitled [...] "The Good in Me is Dead", written in {{the perspective of a}} Kosovo refugee in light of the Balkan atrocities, reflects Joseph's penchant for writing about social tragedies and injustice. [...] "The prime motive in the instant that <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> up the guitar is a selfish one," [...] Joseph says. [...] "It's because I need to deal with the world. I'm in the world and it's horrible, and what can I do? I'm just getting this stuff out of my system as it were." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1976 Rolling Stone interview, Young {{gives an}} insight into working with the Vanda/Young team: After I {{recorded}} Pasadena our relationship just developed. [...] They play me their songs and say: [...] "See {{what you think of}} this." [...] Usually I like it, sometimes I don't. [...] Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> out something they've written and say [...] "I want to do this", like I did with Things to do. (For the JPY album), we worked out some of the songs on the road. [...] Others are worked out in the studio and some, like Standing in the Rain are produced by the studio system. [...] Harry and George work it out and I come in later to do the vocal.|$|E
2500|$|Harrelson had {{input into}} the {{wardrobe}} for his character, Tallahassee. [...] "I never worked so long and hard on an outfit in my life," [...] he stated. [...] "What this guy wears is who he is. You {{want to get a}} sense of this guy as soon as you see him. So <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> out the necklaces, the sunglasses. But the hat? The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E
2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> up the phone and try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This {{is not to say that}} there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Teresa {{received}} the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for work {{undertaken in the}} struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When Teresa {{received the}} prize she was asked, [...] "What can we do to promote world peace?" [...] She answered, [...] "Go home and love your family." [...] Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: [...] "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable [...] and so much, and I find that very difficult." [...] Teresa singled out abortion as [...] "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child—what is left for me to kill you and you kill me—there is nothing between." ...|$|E
