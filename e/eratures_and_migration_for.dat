40|$|This {{review of}} the {{published}} academic literature on internal <b>and</b> regional <b>migration</b> <b>for</b> domestic work in Africa and Asia shows a dearth of studies on internal <b>migration</b> <b>for</b> domestic work in South Asia, and both internal <b>and</b> regional <b>migration</b> <b>for</b> domestic work in East Africa and West Africa. The existing literature is heavily dominated by papers on the transnational migration of domestic workers from South East and East Asia which examine in detail the shortcomings of the legal framework for regulating working conditions and recruitment practices resulting in little protection for migrant workers against exploitation. The paper highlights the serious lack of attention paid to the impacts of <b>migration</b> <b>for</b> domestic work on poverty levels within families in source areas. This is a significant {{gap in the literature}} given that migration is usually a household decision in which one member migrates to access more remunerative employment and remit money home.

40|$|Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) are a {{class of}} highly conserved {{proteins}} predominantly known for the regulation of caspases and immune signaling. However, recent evidence suggests a crucial role for these molecules in the regulation of tumor cell shape <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> by controlling MAPK, NF-κB and Rho GTPases. IAPs directly control Rho GTPases, thus regulating cell shape <b>and</b> <b>migration.</b> <b>For</b> instance, XIAP <b>and</b> cIAP 1 function as the direct E 3 ubiquitin ligases of Rac 1 and target it for proteasomal degradation. IAPs are differentially expressed in tumor cells and have been targeted by several cancer therapeutic drugs that are currently in clinical trials.

Two types of phenylacetylene dendrimers, Cayley-tree dendrimer and nanostar dendrimer with anthracene core, are examined to elucidate the features of excion recurrence <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> motions {{in relation to their}} structural dependences. It is found that the nanostar dendrimer exhibits faster exciton migration from the periphery to the core than Cayley-tree dendrimer, which alternatively exhibits exciton recurrence motion among dendron parts in case of small relaxation parameters. Such strong structural dependence of exciton dynamics demonstrates the advantage of dendritic molecular systems for future applications in nano-optical and light-harvesting devices...|$|R

The solution is then extended to do online application placement <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> <b>for</b> geographically distributed datacenters based on predictions about the application lifetimes, workload intensities, dynamic energy prices, and renewable energy generation capacities at different datacenters in the cloud system. The simulation results demonstrate 27 % to 40 % improvement using the proposed algorithms with respect to the method that does not consider the geographical load balancing. I...|$|R
