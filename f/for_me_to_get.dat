The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E
500|$|Rodgers {{finished}} with a game-high 20 assists and later said: [...] "It was the easiest game ever <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> assists, all I {{had to do was}} pass it to Wilt." [...] Attles was a defensive specialist who rarely scored, yet went 8–8 from the field and hit his single free throw. He later lamented, [...] "In the game where I literally couldn't miss, Wilt had to go out and score 100." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 August 1980, after {{a show in}} Minneapolis, Ward {{quit the}} band. [...] "It was {{intolerable}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where [...] "He {{might as well be}} a Martian". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward.|$|E

The song was written by series music producer Adam Anders with his wife Nikki Hassman, and writing partner Peer Åström. According to Anders the song was specifically crafted for Michele and was based on the storyline of Michele's character in the series, Rachel Berry. Anders told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lea’s storyline kind of inspired that song for me,” says Anders. [...] "Basically, you try to do everything right and you have good motivations with everything you’re doing but everything ends up going wrong. How many times will it take <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to write a piece that calls you into the movie and lets you know something bad is going to happen from the get go", Walker said. According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E
500|$|Strapping Young Lad {{began working}} on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's {{previous}} album did {{not live up to}} expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder. [...] "I think that as an artist, in order <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the next plateau, I kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy," [...] he explains. [...] "And Alien was no exception with that." [...] Although Townsend considered the album an [...] "impenetrable mass of technicality", it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game [...]|$|E

500|$|... "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)", is {{a remake}} of [...] "A Tout le Monde" [...] which {{originally}} appeared on the 1994 album Youthanasia. The song is a more uptempo version of the original song, and features Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia singing backing vocals. Scabbia stated she was [...] "really surprised about it because 'A Tout le Monde' is a song that I've always loved. It was a big surprise <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this invitation—I was really honored {{to be part of}} it." [...] Mustaine chose Scabbia over three other choices because of her [...] "reign in the heavy metal business". Mustaine later stated that he originally intended for the song to be a B-side for Japan, but the president of Roadrunner Records (Megadeth's label for this release) wanted [...] "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)" [...] released as the album's first single.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, {{release date}} for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising {{his role as the}} title hero. It was also {{reported}} that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity. The Los Angeles Times cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects-heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh's departure, although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel. Branagh noted, [...] "It was a long time [...] and they were way too quick <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> straight back into another, [...] it was a pleasurable experience and a film I'm very proud of." [...] The following day, Marvel formally hired Payne, one of the credited writers of the first film, to script the sequel. In August, Brian Kirk entered early negotiations to direct the Thor sequel. The film would have marked Kirk's first time directing a big-budget motion picture, after having directed television series for HBO, Showtime and the BBC, including Game of Thrones.|$|E
500|$|Approximately {{three years}} after the initial release of [...] "Love You Better" [...] and Wish Bone, a music video was created for the song. Oh Land had wanted to {{collaborate}} with Danish filmmaker Kristian Levring on several occasions but due to scheduling conflicts they were unable to work together. However, he finally agreed to produce a music video for her in 2016 and she allowed him to pick any song from her catalog for the clip; he ultimately chose [...] "Love You Better". In the video, Oh Land [...] "age slowly in reverses in a surprising, and sometimes unsettling, series of subtle fades". In order to produce the several special effects in the video, the singer wore a series of [...] "3D tracking dots" [...] in order to makes the [...] "transitions [...] seamless". Oh Land spoke about the filming process: [...] "The video was shoot was fun and challenging because it's sorta shot like stop-motion. We gradually remove prosthetics and makeup <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> younger and younger." [...] She further predicted that of the several shots, approximately [...] "95 percent" [...] of them featured her in extensive makeup. The video eventually premiered on Oh Land's official YouTube account on 21 October.|$|E

[...] U.K. magazine Total Game Boy criticized the graphics, the repetitive gameplay, and the difficulty.|$|R

500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook way <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it, {{to get it in}} Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2015 Lucas said {{he planned}} to finish Episode VII, release it in May 2015 and then sell the company afterward.

The time is more important to me than the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Del Toro has {{expressed}} interest in a sequel, saying, [...] "I think we would all come back to do a third Hellboy, if they can wait <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of Middle-Earth, but we don't know.

With any album people have there sic favourites, and Im sure this will be no different on this album. <b>For</b> <b>me</b> the one thing I have taken from this album is that actually this debut is very strong and can only lead onto bigger and better releases." ...|$|R
2500|$|During a UFC 128 post-fight {{interview}} with Ariel Helwani, Evans {{stated that he}} was done training at Jackson's Martial Arts in preparation for his fight with Jon Jones. [...] He then commenced training at Imperial Athletics in Boca Raton, Florida, at a new camp co-founded by Evans and several Brazilian fighters who had concomitantly left American Top Team due to a dispute over management services; these were later joined by some African-American fighters, {{and as a result}} the camp's members became known colloquially as the [...] "Blackzilians," [...] especially on Twitter. Evans gave further insight to MMAWeekly about his leaving Jackson's Submission Fighting, “When you get to a certain point, you really need a lot of time (with the coaches)… make sure you get the one-on-one, and you just need different things,” he explained. “After being at Jackson’s for a while, with so many people at the gym, it just got harder and harder <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg {{received}} a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of [...] "Howl" [...] he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, [...] "The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window – I have the key – Get married Allen don't take drugs – the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window". In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg's brother Eugene, she said, [...] "God's informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key {{on the side of the}} window <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window." [...] These letters and the absence of a facility to recite kaddish inspired Ginsberg to write [...] "Kaddish" [...] which makes references to many details from Naomi's life, Ginsberg's experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines [...] "the key is in the light" [...] and [...] "the key is in the window".|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over that. It was hard for me sometimes to do that song.
