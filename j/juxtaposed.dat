5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects <b>juxtaposed</b> colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E

5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The <b>juxtaposed</b> deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be <b>juxtaposed</b> in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right.

In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West <b>juxtaposed</b> the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E
40|$|Creating {{multiple}} prototypes facilitates comparative reasoning, grounds team discussion, and enables situated exploration. However, current interface design tools {{focus on}} creating single artifacts. This paper introduces the <b>Juxtapose</b> code editor and runtime environment for designing multiple alternatives of both application logic and interface parameters. For rapidly comparing code alternatives, <b>Juxtapose</b> introduces selectively parallel source editing and execution. To explore parameter variations, <b>Juxtapose</b> automatically creates control interfaces for “tuning ” application variables at runtime. This paper describes techniques to support design exploration for desktop, mobile, and physical interfaces, and situates this {{work in a}} larger design space of tools for explorative programming. A summative study of <b>Juxtapose</b> with 18 participants demonstrated that parallel editing and execution are accessible to interaction designers and that designers can leverage these techniques to survey more options, faster.

5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master of contrast, he often <b>juxtaposed</b> picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with more {{sensitive}} playing and {{was known for}} adding abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw him {{play a key role}} in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history.|$|E
5|$|Read-Only Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents <b>juxtaposed</b> with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E
5|$|Released as the album's second {{single in}} mid-1986, {{the song was}} a {{commercial}} success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped platinum blonde hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are <b>juxtaposed</b> with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} of the American web {{television}} series Daredevil, {{which is based on}} the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows the early days of Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night, <b>juxtaposed</b> with the rise of crime lord Wilson Fisk. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, DeKnight Prods. and Goddard Textiles, with Steven S. DeKnight serving as showrunner, and series creator Drew Goddard acting as consultant.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is <b>juxtaposed</b> with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's choral {{works for}} concert {{performance}} include settings of both {{secular and religious}} words. The former include Toward the Unknown Region to words by Whitman (composed 1904–06), Five Tudor Portraits, words by John Skelton (1935), and the Shakespearean Serenade to Music (in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra, 1938). Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio Sancta Civitas (1923–25) and the Christmas cantata Hodie (1954). In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works Sancta Civitas was his favourite. The Dona Nobis Pacem, an impassioned anti-war cantata (1936) {{is a combination of}} both, with words from Whitman and others <b>juxtaposed</b> with extracts from the Latin mass, anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in Britten's War Requiem twenty-five years later.|$|E

5|$|When <b>juxtaposed</b> together, Stelae 15 and 12 {{offer up}} two {{images of a}} {{what it means to}} be a genuine king. Stela 15 shows K'inich Yat Ahk II as a devout {{practitioner}} of religious rituals, doing his sacred duty. On the other hand, Stela 12 shows the ajaw as a victorious military chief, defeating enemies and taking captives. O'Neil argues that their presence on the upper terrace of the O-13 pyramid is similar to how the images of previous kings of Piedras Negras were serialized. In addition, both Stelae 15 and 12 include the names of several sculptors and artists, one of whom worked on both stelae. These names are difficult to translate because many are unique when compared to extant Mayan glyphic texts.|$|E
5|$|Being There is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on October 29, 1996 by Reprise Records. Despite its release as a double album, Being There was sold at a single album price {{as a result of}} a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and the band's label Reprise Records. The album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception, in contrast to their debut album A.M. (1995). Taking its name from the 1979 film of the same name, the self-produced album featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than on A.M.. This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it <b>juxtaposed</b> the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan, and their last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.|$|E
5|$|Burke {{experimented with}} a variety of musical styles {{throughout}} the game's development. Burke's original compositions were lighthearted as befitting for a Nintendo game, but became darker along with other parts of the game to match the Xbox audience when Microsoft acquired Rare. The composer thought that this transition was reflected in the soundtrack, with some Nintendo-style music <b>juxtaposed</b> against the roaring orchestral tracks. Burke estimates that he had written four hours of audio for the project and ultimately recorded 80 minutes with an orchestra and choir over four days in Prague. The team recorded the orchestra and choir separately. Sumthing Else Music Works published the soundtrack on compact disc and for download via the iTunes Store and Amazon. It was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition award.|$|E
