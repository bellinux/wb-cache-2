The second of five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft was successfully launched from Launch Complex 13 at the Air Force Eastern Test Range by an Atlas-Agena launch vehicle at 23 : 21 GMT on November 6, 1966. Tracking {{data from the}} Cape Kennedy and Grand Bahama tracking stations were used to control and guide the launch vehicle during Atlas powered flight. The Agena spacecraft combination was maneuvered into a 100 -nautical-mile-altitude Earth orbit by the preset on-board Agena computer. In addition, the Agena computer determined the maneuver 1 and engine-bum period required to inject the spacecraft on the cislunar trajectory 20 minutes after launch. Tracking data from the <b>downrange</b> <b>stations</b> and the Johannesburg, South Africa station were used to monitor the entire boost trajectory...|$|R
50|$|The Site Selection Team {{had picked}} six South Americanlocations: Havana, Panama, Quito, Lima, Antofagasta, andSantiago; {{but who would}} {{undertake}} the imposing task of settingup stations outside the United States proper? The U.S.Army, {{by virtue of its}} IAGS experience, was the logicalchoice. In September 1956, the Army Chief of Engineersinitiated construction at the six sites at the request ofNRL. More specifically, the task fell to the speciallycreated Project Vanguard Task Force of the Army Map Service.It should be mentioned here that the South American sites,though near large cities, were generally some distance frommodern facilities and their associated radio noise. Theisolation and primitive conditions caused logistics and operatormorale problems in early days.The Minitrack sites in the continental U.S. were establishedwith greater ease. The Navy set up and operatedthe Blossom Point and San Diego stations; the latter beingat the Brown Naval Auxiliary Air Station, near Chula Vista, California, and operated by the Naval Electronics Laboratory.The <b>stations</b> <b>downrange</b> from Cape Canaveral were set up incooperation with Great Britain and operated by the U.S. Navyand Air Force. After deliberation over tracking requirements,logistics, and support facilities, Antigua and Grand Turk were finally chosen for <b>downrange</b> <b>stations</b> instead ofthe initially planned Barbuda and Mayaguana.|$|R

2500|$|In November 1999 it was {{announced}} that Japan's National Space Development Agency planned to lease land on Kiritimati (Christmas Island) for 20 years, on which to build a spaceport. The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment. A Japanese-built <b>downrange</b> tracking <b>station</b> operates on Kiritimati and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned space shuttle called HOPE-X. HOPE-X, however, was eventually cancelled by Japan in 2003.|$|R
5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate <b>downrange</b> tracking <b>stations,</b> Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|R

50|$|The GE-600 {{series was}} {{developed}} by {{a team led by}} John Couleur based on work done for the MISTRAM project in 1959. MISTRAM was a missile tracking system that was used on a number of projects (including Project Apollo) and the Air Force required a data-collection computer to be installed in a tracking <b>station</b> <b>downrange</b> from Cape Canaveral. The data would eventually be shared with the 36-bit IBM 7094 machine at the Cape, so the computer would likely have to be 36-bits as well (why they didn't use an IBM 7094 is something of a mystery). GE built a machine called the M236 for the task, {{and as a result of}} the 36-bit needs, it ended up acting a lot like the 7094.|$|R

50|$|During Betsy's initial {{approach}} of the Bahamian archipelago on September 2, strong surf and high swells were reported in the southeastern islands, though no damage was reported. Much of the damage inflicted to the Bahamas by Betsy occurred between September 6-8, when the tropical cyclone moved across the northern Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. The preceding track {{was similar to that}} of another major hurricane in 1929, which had also drastically curved southwestward before causing significant damage to the island group. Likewise, Betsy was considered the worst hurricane to strike the region since then. Stalling over the Bahamas {{for a period of time}} as it moved through the islands, several locations sustained the Betsy's effects for prolonged periods of time, despite the tropical cyclone's relatively small size. Widespread power outage and communication blackouts ensued, preventing the flow of reports between the northern Bahamas and other outlets as the storm took place. This included NASA communication centers in Cape Kennedy, which had lost contact with <b>downrange</b> missile tracking <b>stations</b> in the archipelago. Over the duration of the hurricane, the lowest pressure measured was 961 mbar (hPa; 28.40 inHg) in Dunmore Town on Harbour Island. However, no wind measurement was recorded alongside the pressure reading due to a resulting power failure.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an effort}} between NASA and private {{industry}} to reduce airport-community noise for high-speed civil transport (HSCT) concepts, a piloted simulation study was initiated for the purpose of predicting the noise reduction benefits that could result from improved low-speed high-lift aerodynamic performance for a typical HSCT configuration during takeoff and initial climb. Flight profile and engine information from the piloted simulation were coupled with the NASA Langley Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP) to estimate jet engine noise and to propagate the resulting source noise to ground observer stations. A baseline aircraft configuration, which also incorporated different levels of projected improvements in low-speed high-lift aerodynamic performance, was simulated to investigate effects of increased lift and lift-to-drag ratio on takeoff noise levels. Simulated takeoff flights were performed with the pilots following a specified procedure in which either a single thrust cutback was performed at selected altitudes ranging from 400 to 2000 ft, or a multiple-cutback procedure was performed where thrust was reduced by a two-step process. Results show that improved low-speed high-lift aerodynamic performance provides at least a 4 to 6 dB reduction in effective perceived noise level at the FAA <b>downrange</b> flyover measurement <b>station</b> for either cutback procedure. However, improved low-speed high-lift aerodynamic performance reduced maximum sideline noise levels only when using the multiple-cutback procedures...|$|R
