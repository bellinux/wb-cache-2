In this thesis, a real-time noise analysis was implemented by an autocorrelation calculation to identify the type of environmental effects affecting a superconducting circuit.

40|$|The most {{important}} active element in superconducting circuits are <b>Josephson</b> <b>junctions.</b> Their high frequency properties motivated many different projects to implement <b>Josephson</b> <b>junctions</b> in circuits for active and passive devices. The limiting points for {{applications in the}} low temperature superconducting field are broad line width and small power of a single <b>Josephson</b> <b>junctions.</b> The present work presents experimental and theoretical investigations on vertical stacked <b>Josephson</b> <b>junctions</b> in linear or annular geometry. Presenting results of up to 28 stacked elements {{is the state of}} the art of preparing stacked low-T_c <b>Josephson</b> tunnel <b>junctions.</b> Stacks of up to 10 junctions show a parameter spread of less than 5 % due to the developed preparation procedures. Magnetic flux quanta in <b>Josephson</b> <b>junctions,</b> called fluxons, in many cases behave as solitons. Recent experiments and modeling of fluxon dynamics in annular <b>Josephson</b> <b>junctions</b> show the influence of an external magnetic field on a single moving fluxon. The resulting dynamics are strongly analogous to the motion of a particle in a washboard potential. Experiment, theoretical model and numerical simulations are in good agreement. Experiments on fluxons in two-fold stacks show the dynamic and static properties of this configuration. The critical current dependence on the external magnetic field displays different possible values, due to the voltage states of the junctions. First experimental hints on Cherenkov radiation by resonant structures in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic is found with stacks prepared during this work. (orig.) 148 refs.
