5|$|Following Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> is {{the action}} {{role-playing}} game Vampyr, set for release in Q1/Q2 2018. About 80 staff {{were devoted to}} the development of Vampyr, many of whom worked on Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange.</b> The studio started developing Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> 2 in early 2016, after its predecessor had proved financially successful. 2016 saw the origin of a new IP, which Dontnod partnered with publisher Bandai Namco to create. A separate team of senior developers was commissioned, so as not to impede the work on Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> 2.|$|E

Founded in 2008, it started {{development on the}} action-adventure Remember Me (2013). Because of its poor return on investment, Dontnod resolved its financial situation with recourse to public funding to subsidise the graphic adventure Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> (2015). Momentum gained from the successful release of Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> was allocated {{to focus on the}} upcoming action role-playing game Vampyr (2018) and Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> 2 (TBA).|$|E

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>strange,</b> in {{the silent}} winter afternoon, downstairs in the black kitchen, to sit {{drinking}} {{a cup of tea}} with Pancrazio and hearing these stories of English painters. It <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> to look at the battered figure of Pancrazio, and think how much he had been crucified through the long years in London, for the sake of late Victorian art. It <b>was</b> <b>strangest</b> of all to see through his yellow, often dull, red-rimmed eyes these blithe and well-conditioned painters. Pancrazio looked on them admiringly and contemptuously, as an old, rakish tom-cat might look on such frivolous well-groomed young gentlemen.|$|R

5|$|After Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> {{achieved}} {{financial and}} commercial success, Dontnod Entertainment started {{to become more}} prominent in the video game industry; publishers pursued the studio for the first time, whereas they previously had to pursue publishers themselves. CEO Oskar Guilbert said that the game saved his company financially after the mediocre sales of Remember Me.|$|E
5|$|In July 2016, Legendary Digital Studios and Square Enix, in {{conjunction}} with dj2 Entertainment announced {{that they would be}} adapting Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> as a digital series.

5|$|Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E

5|$|Development of Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both {{financial}} and creative. The developers conducted field {{research on the}} setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something <b>is</b> <b>strange</b> about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E

25|$|The fort is {{somewhat}} forgotten. It <b>is</b> <b>strange</b> that very {{little attention has}} been paid by either the Dutch or the Indonesians to the strongest fort ever built by Indonesians, as well as the scene of one of the fiercest battles they ever had to fight.|$|E
25|$|Many {{times it}} is the ballad that the child learns first, no Mother Goose melodies are as familiar, and it <b>is</b> <b>strange</b> indeed {{to listen to a}} little tot singing of the courtly days of old, the knights and 'ladyes' and {{probably}} the tragic death of the lover.|$|E
25|$|The first painter {{showing the}} marks of the new era is Hieronymus Bosch. His work <b>is</b> <b>strange</b> and full of {{seemingly}} irrational imagery, {{making it difficult to}} interpret. Most of all it seems surprisingly modern, introducing a world of dreams that highly contrasts with the traditional style of the Flemish masters of his day.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} Ricketts did on sardines was {{a seminal}} application of ecology to fisheries science, {{but it was}} not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: “That’s probably {{due to the fact that}} his stuff isn’t widely available... This <b>is</b> <b>strange,</b> but fisheries scientists so far as they are trained do extraordinarily little ecology... I will not publish a paper on pelagics without now mentioning Ricketts”.|$|E
25|$|The {{video game}} Life <b>Is</b> <b>Strange</b> uses {{a variant of}} the trolley problem. At the end of the game, the protagonist Max has to make a choice whether to turn back time. Changing time will kill her best friend/girlfriend Chloe but save the Arcadia Bay. On the other hand not {{changing}} time will mean that Chloe will be safe but everyone in the Arcadia Bay will die. The player can choose whether to save Chloe or Arcadia Bay, which leads to two different alternative ends.|$|E
25|$|Berkeley was {{supported}} by the Duke of York, who appointed him vice-admiral of the white, and William succeeded his dead brother as lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth later in 1665. Public scepticism over his actions persisted however, with Samuel Pepys commenting that 'it <b>is</b> <b>strange</b> to see how people do already slight Sir Wm. Berkeley … who three months since was the delight of the Court'. Berkeley's reputation was further tarnished when he was implicated in the irregular plundering of prize goods from captured Dutch merchantmen, and accused of having abandoned an action with the Dutch ship Luipaard in discreditable circumstances on 21 August 1665.|$|E
