40|$|During {{the last}} fifteen years, miniaturised {{paraffin}} actuation has evolved through the need of a simple actuation principle, still able to deliver large strokes and high actuation forces at small scales. This is achieved by the large and rather incompressible volume expansion associated with the solid-to-liquid phase transition <b>of</b> <b>paraffin.</b> The common approach has been to encapsulate the paraffin by a stiff surrounding that directs the volume expansion towards a flexible membrane, which deflects in a directed stroke.

For this purpose, beeswax samples with paraffin additions (3, 5, 10, 30, 50 %) were analysed.

For the purpose of this study, reference IR spectra <b>of</b> virgin beeswax, <b>paraffin,</b> and their mixtures containing different proportions <b>of</b> <b>paraffin</b> (5 - 95 %), were obtained. Mixtures were used for the establishment of calibration curves. To determine the prediction strength of IR spectral data for the share <b>of</b> <b>paraffin</b> in mixtures, the Partial Least Squares Regression method was used. The same procedure was conducted on beeswax-beef tallow mixtures. The model was validated using comb foundation samples of an unknown chemical background which had been collected from the international market (n = 56). Selected physico-chemical parameters were determined for comparison purposes. Results revealed a strong predictive power (R 2 = 0. 999) of IR spectra for the paraffin and beef tallow share in beeswax. The results also revealed that the majority of the analysed samples (89 %) were adulterated with paraffin; only 6 out of 56 (11 %) samples were identified as virgin beeswax, 28 % of the samples exhibited a higher level <b>of</b> <b>paraffin</b> adulteration (> 46 % <b>of</b> <b>paraffin),</b> while the majority of the analysed samples (50 %) were found to be adulterated with 5 - 20 % <b>of</b> <b>paraffin.</b> These results indicate an urgent need for routine beeswax authenticity control.
