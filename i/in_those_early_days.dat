5|$|Thorpe gained {{nationwide}} {{attention for}} the first time in 1911. As a running back, defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 upset of Harvard, a top ranked team <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate championship largely as a result of his efforts – he scored 25 touchdowns and 198points during the season, according to CNN's Greg Botelho. Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points. Thorpe rushed 191 times for 1,869 yards, according to Boda; the figures do not include statistics from 2 of Carlisle's 14 games in 1912 because full records are not available.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} of rugby {{in the first}} half of the 19th century was driven by ex-pupils from many of England's Public Schools, especially Rugby, who, upon finishing school, took the game with them to universities, to London, and to the counties. England's first international match was against Scotland on Monday 27 March 1871. Not only was this match England's first, but it also proved to be the first ever rugby union international. Scotland won the match by a goal and a try to a try, in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. A subsequent international took place at the Oval in London on 5 February 1872 which saw England defeat Scotland by a goal, a drop goal and two tries to one drop goal. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> there was no points system, it was only after 1890 that a format allowing the introduction of a points system was provided. Up until 1875 international rugby matches were decided by the number of goals scored (conversions and dropped goals), but from 1876 the number of tries scored could be used to decide a match if teams were level on goals.|$|E

25|$|Between 1906 and 1973, {{home games}} were {{played at the}} club's {{traditional}} home, Glenferrie Oval, {{in the heart of}} the affluent suburb. The state of Glenferrie Oval and its location, close by the Glenferrie train station on the Melbourne East route, was a central reason why the club was firstly accepted into the VFA in 1914, and then the VFL in 1925. The club's onfield results had not reached any great heights <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> but both the VFA and VFL had recognised the importance for representation in the suburbs east of the Yarra River. Glenferrie Oval was pivotal in these advancements of the Hawthorn Football Club as it was considered the most suitable at the time.|$|E

In 1914, Fürth became the first team from the state to become national champions and by 1930 these two sides had accumulated eight titles between them. Bayern President Kurt Landauer held the office on-and-off from 1913 until 1933 and from 1947 well into the 1950s, adopted a strategic approach to building up the team and challenging this dominance. He hired William Townley as the side's first professional coach. The Englishman was the best coach on the market in Germany and had a championship with Karlsruher FV, in 1910, to his credit.|$|E

Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> and the club had to rent the premises first before they could stump up the cash to buy the stadium {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four FA Cup Finals in 1900.

25|$|Silver {{and lead}} have been mined in Leadhills and at nearby Wanlockhead for many centuries, {{according}} to some authorities even in Roman days. Gold was discovered in the reign of James IV and, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>early</b> <b>days,</b> it was so famous for its exceptionally pure gold that the general area was known as “God's Treasure House in Scotland”. During the 16th century, before the alluvial gold deposits were exhausted, 300 men worked over three summers and took away some £100,000 of gold (perhaps £500 million today): “Between 1538 and 1542, the district produced 1163 grams of gold for a crown for King James V of Scotland, and 992 grams for a crown for his queen. Much of the gold coinage of James V and Mary Queen of Scots was minted from Leadhills gold … No commercial gold mining appears {{to have taken place}} after 1620, but gold washing with a sluice box or pan was later to become a sometimes lucrative pastime of the lead miners” (Gillanders, 1981, pp.235–236). Gold is still panned in the area with the correct licence.|$|E

Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played only one current Big 12 school: Kansas State (once). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55–60). However, Naismith coached Forrest [...] "Phog" [...] Allen, his eventual successor at Kansas, who went on to join his mentor in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. When Allen became a coach himself and told him {{that he was going to}} coach basketball at Baker University in 1904, Naismith discouraged him: [...] "You can't coach basketball; you just play it." [...] Instead, Allen embarked on a coaching career that would lead him to be known as [...] "the Father of Basketball Coaching." [...] During his time at Kansas, Allen coached Dean Smith (1952 National Championship team) and Adolph Rupp (1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team). [...] Smith and Rupp have joined Naismith and Allen as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.|$|E
