500|$|According to {{designer}} Harry Teasley, id's 1993 FPS Doom {{was a major}} influence, and {{the team}} wanted Half-Life to [...] "scare you like Doom did". Newell said that [...] "Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization {{of the experience of}} the first-person genre. Many of us {{had fallen in love with}} video games because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities. Our hope was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries." [...] The project had the working title Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game. The name Half-Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda), which represents the <b>decay</b> <b>constant</b> in the half-life equation.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{exponential}} equations {{have been}} successfully fitted to experimental long afterglow decay curve data for some phosphor materials by previous researchers. The calculated <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> in such equations are {{used to assess the}} phosphorescence characteristics of an object. This study generates <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> from experimental test data and from existing literature for comparison. It shows that the <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> of an object may not be invariant and that they are dependent on phosphor material, temperature, irradiation intensity, sample thickness, and phosphor density for samples. In addition, the use of different numbers of exponential components in interpretation leads to different numerical results for <b>decay</b> <b>constants.</b> The relationship between the calculated <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> and the afterglow characteristics of an object is studied and discussed in this paper.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{different}} set of group <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> for each fissionable nuclide complicates analysis of the dynamic behavior of fast reactors. A fast reactor containing six principal fissioning nuclides of uranium and plutonium must, in effect, be described by 36 delayed neutron groups. Additionally, the use of group <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> that depend on the neutron energy spectrum makes it difficult to select values that describe the dynamic response of epithermal systems because virtually all delayed neutron activity measurements have been performed for fast or thermal-neutron-induced fission. Clearly, it would be desirable to have a single set of group <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> that could be applied to all fissionable nuclides. A set of seven fixed <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> is proposed herein. Each of the proposed <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> is associated with a specific, dominant delayed neutron precursor. In effect, each group is represented by a single surrogate precursor. Using recently measured delayed neutron activities for U- 235 and Np- 237, the proposed set of <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> actually improved the goodness of fit to the data. For other fissionable nuclides lacking experimental data, a method has been devised to obtain yields consistent with the proposed set of <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> from the traditional six-group parameters. This transformation is accomplished without altering the traditional inferred reactivity scale...|$|R

2500|$|Logarithms can {{be defined}} to any {{positive}} base other than 1, not only e.

[...] Logarithms are useful for solving equations in which the unknown appears as the exponent of some other quantity. [...] For example, logarithms are used to solve for the half-life, <b>decay</b> <b>constant,</b> or unknown time in exponential decay problems.

While the <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> of the vector mesons f_B^* and f_B_s^* - similar to the <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> of the pseudoscalar mesons f_B and f_B_s - individually have large uncertainties induced by theory parameters not known with a satisfactory precision, these uncertainties almost entirely cancel out in the ratios of vector over pseudoscalar <b>decay</b> <b>constants.</b> These ratios may be thus predicted with very high accuracy due to the good control over the systematic uncertainties of the <b>decay</b> <b>constants</b> gained upon application of our hadron-parameter extraction algorithm.
