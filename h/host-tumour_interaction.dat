40|$|C 3 Hf/Dp mice {{were given}} a single i. p. {{injection}} of 50, 25 or 5 mug/g N-Nitroso-N-Methylurea (NMU) at either 1 or 70 days of age or 50 mug/g at 21 days of age. They were observed until death or until 120 weeks of age. The two highest doses of NMU produced tumours in {{a wide spectrum of}} organs, including the thymus, forestomach, lung, liver (only in males), kidneys, ovaries and orbital glands. The only two tumour types which appeared to be closely related to the occurrence of death were thymic lymphomata (most of which were found in mice dying before 40 weeks after treatment) and carcinomata of the forestomach. Lifetime analyses are presented concerning the occurrence of these two tumour types as well as the occurrence of any tumour after 40 weeks of age or since treatment. Incidences of thymic lymphomata were 67. 6 %, 39. 0 % and 21. 2 % in mice receiving 50 mug/g NMU at 1, 21 and 70 days respectively and 17. 1 % in mice receiving 25 mug/g at 1 day. In the other groups the incidence of thymic lymphomata was zero or negligible. The rate of progression of thymic lymphomata until death was related to both earliness of treatment and dose. On the contrary, incidences and progression of carcinomata of the forestomach were unrelated to age at treatment. Since breakdown of NMU is very rapid and does not require enzymes, these results are considered as evidence that <b>host-tumour</b> <b>interaction</b> differs from organ to organ. No excess of tumours over the controls was found in mice receiving 5 mug/g either at 1 or 70 days of age...|$|E
40|$|Melanoma-associated antigens may be {{the driving}} force behind the {{lymphocytic}} infiltrates in melanomas and the occurrence of melanoma regression. To investigate the clinical relevance of melanoma differentiation antigens (MDAs) as T-cell targets, the relationship between the presence and localization of T-cell subsets and the expression of MDAs was studied by immunohistochemistry and the diversity of CD 8 + T cells in regressive melanomas was assessed using laser-assisted microdissection. While MDA expression as well as T-cell subset distribution, as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, was heterogeneous within and between lesions, they were histologically independent phenomena. In four lesions studied in detail by PCR analysis of microdissected T cells, a limited T-cell diversity and evidence for clonally expanded tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were found. However, no major differences in T-cell diversity, as assessed by PCR analysis, between peri-and intra-tumoural areas became apparent, this despite the known clinical significance of the specific localization of a T-cell infiltrate. T cells of clonal origin did not show preferential localization to regressive tumour areas. Moreover, clonally related cells were found in two lesions with a non-brisk infiltrate, while in two lesions with a brisk infiltrate (clinically, a good prognostic factor) no evidence for clonally expanded tumour infiltrating lymphocytes was found. These data support the notion that specific immune reactivity and homing of specific cells to the tumour can occur in melanoma patients. However, they also show that the presence of clonally expanded T cells in the tumour is not necessarily associated with an effective anti-tumour immune response and may, for instance, represent regulatory cells. It appears that the clinical impact of an anti-tumour immune response is largely decided at the tumour site, where micro-environmental conditions dictate the functional state of the T cells. Full understanding of these processes can only be achieved by performing more dynamic analyses of the local <b>host-tumour</b> <b>interaction...</b>|$|E

The tumourcan alsomanipulate the immune systemtoitsown ends,oftenresulting in an ineffective or transient antitumour response. An appreciation {{of the complexity of}} these <b>host-tumour</b> <b>interactions</b> is therefore important for the development of more-effective cancer therapies. This article highlights some prominent mechanisms whereby tumours escape recognition and destruction by the host immune system, thus facilitating disease progression. One important consequence of tumour escape is that an antitumour immune response may unintentionally lead to the outgrowth of less immunogenic or more apoptosisresistant tumour escape variants, which possess enhanced tumourigenic potential. Insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer evasion and the complexity of the ever-changing interactions between host and tumour will enable a more rational design of antitumour therapies and may help not only explain disease recurrence, but also identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions. This article also offers a brief review of preclinical animal models, which are essential tools in the study of tumour immunology and cancer biology, particularly those that recapitulate the chronic nature of <b>host-tumour</b> <b>interactions</b> and help guide {{the development and}} testing of new therapies.

40|$|Our {{investment}} in cancer research has provided phe-nomenal {{insights into the}} molecular origins of cancer. These insights {{have led to the}} identification of many genes that are associated with oncogenesis, as well as a wide array of new therapeutic approaches. The chal-lenge now is to decipher the function of these genes not only in vitro or in silico, but ultimately in an intact host. A second challenge is to characterize and overcome the physiological barriers to delivery and to improve the efficacy of therapeutic agents in the tumour microenvi-ronment. Intravital microscopy (IVM) has provided powerful insights into gene expression and function in tumours, revealed the crucial role of <b>hostâ€“tumour</b> <b>interactions</b> in the biology of tumours and their responses to therapy, and indicated new approaches t...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} past, several papers {{have pointed to}} the {{possibility}} that tumour removal generates a permissive environment in which tumour growth is potentiated. This phenomenon has been coined "perioperative tumour growth" and whilst it represents a departure in terms of our attitude to the surgical process, this concept was first hinted at by Paget(1) himself. Despite this, the time interval immediately before and after cancer surgery (i. e. the perioperative period) remains an underutilised interval during which chemotherapeutic regimens are rarely implemented. Herein, we present a summarised review of the literature that supports the concept that tumour removal may potentiate the growth of residual neoplastic disease. We also outline current knowledge regarding underlying mechanisms and in this manner highlight potential therapeutic entry points. Finally, we emphasise the urgent need for trials of agents that could protect patients against the harmful <b>host-tumour</b> <b>interactions</b> that may occur during the perioperative period...|$|R
