In this paper, we have {{discussed}} {{the principle of the}} flexible blank holder forming (FBHF) technology, and established the finite element model of medal deep drawing process based on FBHF. Then we {{have discussed}} the FBHF technology by analyzing the system of finite element model. By simulating the forming of rectangular box, we can conclude that FBHF technology will have a greater advantage when the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>stamping</b> forming is much deeper. We have also compared the thickness distribution parameters, wrinkling parameters, and spring back parameters of rigid blank holder forming parts with FBHF parts. The result shows that the forming parts of FBHF technology has uniform stress and strain distribution, small spring back, the quality of inhibiting wrinkling, crack and other defects...|$|E
5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production <b>of</b> <b>stamped</b> parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stamping</b> exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, necking, flange curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|R

Despite its importance, little research has examined the effect <b>of</b> food <b>stamps</b> on children's overall well-being. Using the Current Population Survey from 1989 to 2001, we consider the impact <b>of</b> food <b>stamps</b> on three measures of poverty - the headcount, the poverty gap, and the squared poverty gap. These measures portray the incidence, <b>depth,</b> and severity <b>of</b> poverty. We find that {{in comparison to the}} headcount measure, food stamp benefits lead to large reductions in the poverty gap and squared poverty gap measures. We then simulate the effects of several changes in the distribution <b>of</b> food <b>stamps</b> and find that a general across-the-board increase in benefits has little impact on poverty reduction. In contrast, targeted changes can greatly reduce the <b>depth</b> and severity <b>of</b> poverty - increasing benefits to the poor results in a greater reduction in the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> poverty than expanding participation rates, at a similar cost, among poor households.

The characteristics of diabetic mice were measured by serial metabolite and pathology tests. The level <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2 was measured by RT-PCR and Western blot. The plaque area, lipid and collagen content of brachioce-phalic artery plaques were measured by histopathological analyses, and the macrophage apoptosis was measured by TUNEL. Correlation <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2 /Akt signaling pathway and macrophage apoptosis was validated by Ad-STAMP 2 transfection and STAMP 2 siRNA inhibition. The diabetic mice showed typical features of IR, hyperglycaemia. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2 ameliorated IR and decreased serum glucose level. In brachiocephalic lesions, lipid content, macrophage quantity and the vulnerability index were significantly decreased by overexpression <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2. Moreover, the numbers of apoptotic cells and macrophages in lesions were both significantly decreased. In vitro, both mRNA and protein expressions <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2 were increased under high glucose treatment. P-Akt was highly expressed and caspase- 3 was decreased after overexpression <b>of</b> <b>STAMP</b> 2. However, expression of p-Akt protein was decreased and caspase- 3 was increased when STAMP 2 was inhibited by siRNA. STAMP 2 overexpression could exert a protective effect on diabetic atherosclerosis by reducing IR and diminishing macrophage apoptosis...|$|R
