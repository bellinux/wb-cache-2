40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of pneumococcal isolates exhibiting an unusual resistance phenotype of higher amoxicillin MICs {{in relation to}} the penicillin MICs prompted an analysis of the pbp genes from three such strains isolated in France. For comparison, three amoxicillin-susceptible strains were included in the study. DNA sequence analysis of the pbp 2 x, pbp 2 b, and pbp 1 a genes revealed extensive sequence divergence in all six isolates compared to the sequences of the genes of penicillin-susceptible strain R 6. With the exception of pbp 2 b, no amino acid mutations were unique to the resistant isolates. Transformation experiments with cloned pbp genes isolated from one of the resistant isolates demonstrated a stepwise development of amoxicillin resistance involving penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 2 X, 2 B, and 1 A. <b>Full</b> <b>resistance,</b> equivalent to that of the donor strain, was achieved only when genomic DNA was transformed into R 62 x/ 2 b/ 1 a mutants, suggesting that <b>full</b> <b>resistance</b> development in this isolate is mediated by a non-PBP determinant. Moreover, the recently identified murMN resistance determinant {{does not appear to have}} any impact on resistance in this isolate. This determinant (from the French isolate) was, however, able to transform an R 6 mutant harboring pbp 2 x, pbp 2 b, and pbp 1 a genes from a Hungarian clone with an extremely high level of penicillin resistance so that it had increased levels of penicillin resistance. These results indicate that the development of high-level β-lactam resistance is a complex process and that the involvement of MurMN in penicillin resistance appears to be dependent on specific mutations in PBPs 2 X, 2 B, and/or 1 A.

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{intrinsically}} cross-resistant to virtually all b-lactam antibiotics. The central determinant for the MRSA phenotype is the mecA gene, whose transcriptional control may be mediated by a repressor (mecI) and a sensor/inducer (mecR 1). The mecI-mecR 1 -mediated induction of mecA takes several hours rendering the strains phenotypically susceptible {{in spite of}} the presence of the resistance gene. Therefore, it has been proposed that the <b>full</b> <b>resistance</b> to b-lactams observed in many contemporary clinical MRSA strains requires a non-functional mecI-mecR 1 regulatory system. The mecA gene is embedded in a large chromosomal cassette (the SCCmec element) for which several structural types have been described. Some epidemic MRSA clones, typically expressing <b>full</b> b-lactam <b>resistance,</b> carry SCCmec elements that contain an intact mecI-mecR 1 locus (e. g. SCCmec types II and III). We have addressed this apparent contradiction by first sequencing the mecI coding region and mecA promoter sequences in a collection of prototype MRSA strains characterized by different SCCmec types. A conserved non-sense mutation within mecI was detected in all SCCmec type III strains tested, presumably responsible for a non-functional truncated MecI protein and, therefore, explaining the <b>full</b> <b>resistance</b> phenotype. In SCCmec type II strains no conserved mutations were found. We next transformed a collection of prototype MRSA epidemic strains with a recombinant plasmid overexpressing a wild-type copy of mecI.

To test this hypothesis, we introduced the XIK 1 Ri construct into ProA-Xa 21 homozygous rice lines to silence the expression of XIK 1 in Xa 21 stable transgenic plants. ProA-Xa 21 homozygous rice lines confer <b>full</b> <b>resistance</b> to the Xoo strain PXO 99 A (Chen et al. 2010). We obtained 12 independent double transgenic RNAi lines carrying both Xa 21 and XIK 1 Ri and named them Xa 21 XIK 1 Ri (XXIK 1 Ri) lines. Three representative lines with reduced expression levels of XIK 1 and stable expression level of the XIK 1 homolog LOC_Os 02 g 34750 were found (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2). Compared with that in the wild type ProA-Xa 21 plants, the expression of XIK 1 is reduced and is about 40 %, 45 % and 80 % in the three XXIK 1 RNAi lines, XXIK 1 Ri- 1, XXIK 1 Ri- 3 and XXIK 1 Ri- 8, respectively. Expression of LOC_Os 02 g 34750, with the highest identity (80.1 %) of cDNA sequence to LOC_Os 02 g 34790, was not altered (Additional file 2 : Figure S 2). We inoculated the T 0 generations of these transgenic lines, and observed that the Xa 21 plants silenced for XIK 1 exhibited compromised disease resistance to the Xoo strain PXO 99 A compared with the wild type ProA-Xa 21 plants (Additional file 3 : Figure S 3 A-C). We then analyzed the disease resistance of plants from T 1 generations after inoculation with PXO 99 A.

However, to investigate whether current treatment strategies are still selecting for multidrug and <b>full</b> class <b>resistance,</b> the incidence, instead of the prevalence, is more informative. Temporal trends in multidrug resistance (MDR defined as at most 1 drug fully susceptible) and <b>full</b> class <b>resistance</b> (FCR defined as no drug in this class fully susceptible) in Portugal based on 3394 viral isolates genotyped from 2000 to 2006 were examined using the Rega 6. 4. 1 interpretation system. From July 2001 to July 2006 {{there was a significant}} decreasing trend of MDR with 5. 7 %, 5. 2 %, 3. 8 %, 3. 4 % and 2. 7 % for the consecutive years (P = 0. 003). Multivariate analysis showed that for every consecutive year the odds of having a new MDR case decreased with 20 % (P = 0. 003). Furthermore, a decline was observed for NRTI- and PI-FCR (both P < 0. 001), whereas for NNRTI-FCR a parabolic trend over time was seen (P < 0. 001), with a maximum incidence in 2003 –' 04. Similar trends were obtained when scoring resistance for only one drug within a class or by using another interpretation system. In conclusion, the incidence of multidrug and <b>full</b> class <b>resistance</b> is decreasing over time in Portugal, with the exception of NNRTI <b>full</b> class <b>resistance</b> which showed an initial rise, but subsequently also a decline. This is most probably reflecting the changing drug prescription, the increasing efficiency of HAART and the improved management of HIV drug resistance.

All rulers awaken opposition and rebel rulers are not the exception: civilians disagree with, disobey, and even openly confront armed combatants who rule their communities. Yet, academic research has largely ignored different forms of civilian resistance against armed groups, blinding our understanding of civilian agency, rebel behavior, and civilian-combatant relations. In an effort to contribute to filling this gap, this paper investigates when, and why, different forms of resistance to rebel rule {{are more likely to}} emerge. While support is often discussed as a key means for rebel survival and success, resistance is rarely theorized. Excellent case studies have shown that civilian opposition to rebels exists, but we ignore how common it is and why it emerges in some cases but not others. In this chapter I focus on two forms of civilian resistance against rebel rule: partial resistance, which entails opposition to specific decisions or actions by the rebels; and <b>full</b> <b>resistance,</b> which entails opposition against rebel rule altogether. I theorize when, and why, is each of these forms of resistance likely to emerge. I propose two central hypotheses. First, that partial resistance against rebel governance is common in every community where rebels govern. Second, that <b>full</b> <b>resistance</b> is much more demanding: it is likely only when preferences for preserving the status quo are sufficiently strong to make it worth the cost, and when civilians have a high capacity to initiate and sustain collective action. Two factors determine civilians’ willingness and ability to resist collectively: the quality of pre-existing local institutions (i. e. the institutions in place prior to the arrival of the rebel group), and the scope of rebel intervention in local affairs.

RESULTS: Overall, 1, 104 patients were included: 118 (10. 7 %) failed at a median observation time of 16  months. The mean number of PR mutations at baseline was 2. 7, but it was higher in patients who subsequently failed DRV. In addition, the number of PR mutations increased at failure. The increase in {{the mean number of}} mutations was completely related to mutations considered to be associated with DRV resistance following the indications of the main DRV clinical trials. DISCUSSION: The higher statistical difference at baseline between failing versus non-failing patients was observed for the V 32 I and I 84 V mutations. At DRV failure, the major increase was still observed for V 32 I; I 54 L, V 11 I, T 74 P and I 50 V also increased. Despite the increment in the mean number of mutations per patient between baseline and failure, in 21 patients (17. 8 %) at baseline and 36 (30. 5 %) at failure, no PR mutation was detected.
