5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|Lana {{attempts}} to convince everyone {{that it is}} just a rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky finds out that Lana is planning to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.|$|E

50|$|A {{heterosexual}} threesome {{may involve}} {{two men and}} a woman, or one man and two women - that is, two men <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman (for example, in double penetration), or two women with a man. A bisexual threesome may involve a man <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{a man and a}} woman, the woman <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a man and a woman, or all three <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> each other. A homosexual threesome would involve either three men or three women. Other possibilities are possible, such as a man <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> two women who are <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> each other.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women who {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{both men and women}} and women who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % who reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman were compared with those who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. RESULTS: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a <b>sex</b> partner who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), the boyfriend of her sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper). Mercedes discovers she is {{pregnant}} with Tony's child {{and plans to}} have an abortion. Jacqui discovers the affair and asks Mercedes if she can raise the child herself, as she is unable to have children. However, Mercedes has an abortion anyway. Mercedes has a brief relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and is upset to learn that he is having an incestuous affair with his half-sister, Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan). Mercedes and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) make a bet: Darren has to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby), {{and if he does}} Mercedes promises to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> him. Darren accompanies an intoxicated Hannah home and takes a photo of her with no top on. Mercedes refuses to believe Darren, but sends the photo to Hannah's boyfriend, Danny Valentine (David Judge). Danny ends his relationship with Hannah and sleeps with Mercedes.|$|E
5|$|Prostitutes {{were often}} {{hired by the}} hosts of symposia as {{entertainment}} for guests, as seen in red-figure vase paintings. Prostitutes were also drawn on drinking cups as pinups for male entertainment.

5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, and following disasters.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} people's perceptions {{of how they}} would feel if their partners cheated on them by <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> their relatives, such as if a man's wife <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> his brother. Kin selection theory suggests that in such situations, victims of infidelity might feel slightly better if their partners <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> biological relatives (compared to <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> nonrelatives) {{because some of the}} victims' genes could still get passed on through their relatives. In two experiments, participants reported how they would feel in various scenarios involving their partners <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> participants' relatives and nonrelatives. As expected, participants generally reported being very disapproving of a partner's hypothetical infidelity with both their relatives and nonrelatives. However, contrary to predictions generated by kin selection theory, participants tended to report that they would feel worse if their partners <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> their relatives. We propose several explanations for the current findings and discuss their implications for kin selection theory...|$|R

5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E

5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV).

5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, {{with the possible exception}} of syphilis.|$|E
