5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> drift of invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, and bits of debris, accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a {{sandwich}} containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

5|$|Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium–thorium dating, {{involving}} {{the decay of}} 234U to 230Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. (The name ionium for 230Th is a remnant from a period when different isotopes were not recognised {{to be the same}} element and were given different names.) These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process {{involving the}} alpha decay of 235U into 231Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both 232Th and 230Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230Th to 232Th <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.|$|E
