40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Health-care-associated</b> {{infection}} {{is a key}} factor determining the clinical outcome among patients admitted in critical care areas. The objective {{of the study was}} to ascertain the epidemiology and risk factors of <b>health-care-associated</b> infections in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in a tertiary care hospital. Methods: This prospective, observational clinical study included patients admitted in ICU over a period of one and a half years. Routine surveillance of various <b>health-care-associated</b> infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), central-line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP) was done by the Department of Microbiology through specific Infection Surveillance Proforma. Results: Out of 679 patients, 166 suffered 198 episodes of device-associated infections. The infections included CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP. The number of urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes was found to be 73 (10. 75 %) among the ICU patients who had indwelling urinary catheter. In addition, for 1 year CAUTI was calculated as 9. 08 / 1000 catheter days. The number of episodes of blood stream infection was 86 (13. 50 %) among ICU patients having central line catheters. Also, CLABSI was found to be 13. 86 / 1000 central line days. A total of 39 episodes (6. 15 %) of VAP was found in ICU patients over 18 months and VAP present for 6. 04 / 1000 ventilator days. Conclusions: The organisms most commonly associated with <b>health-care-associated</b> infections were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. The risk factors identified as being significantly associated with device associated infections in our ICU were diabetes, COPD and ICU stay for ≥ 8 days (P < 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the rationale and strategies for surveillance of <b>health-care-associated</b> infections in homecare settings, the challenges of nonhospital-based surveillance, and the feasibility of developing a national surveillance system. O ver the past 2 decades, the delivery {{of health care in}} the United States has shifted increasingly from hospitals to patients ’ homes (1 - 3). Nearly eight million people in the United States received medical care at home in 1996 (4), and an estimated 774, 113 (10 %) of these patients had at least one indwelling medical device (5). Use of a medical device is the greatest predictor (exogenous) of <b>health-care-associated</b> infection. Home care is often provided by family members who have little or no formal health-care training, which may place patients at increased risk of <b>health-care-associated</b> infections not typically seen in hospitals. In the home-care setting, patients with open wounds or central venous catheters may undertake activities of daily living (e. g., bathing, exercising, gardening, and playing with pets) that may increase the risk of infections. Rationale for a National Surveillance System in Home-Care Settings The epidemiology of <b>health-care-associated</b> infections in home-care settings has not been defined, but infections certainly occur. Outbreaks have been documented in association with use of central venous catheters, parenteral nutrition, bathing practices, educational level of caregivers, and the introduction of new products, such as needleless devices for intravenous infusion (6 - 8). Needleless devices are used for connecting and accessing intravenous infusion tubing, replacing traditional needles. These devices are used in both home and hospital settings and are perceived to be safe for patients and effective in reducing needlestick injuries...|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of antibiotics in association with high-density clinical care has driven the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria that are adapted to thrive in hospitalized patients. Of particular concern are globally disseminated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones that cause outbreaks and epidemics associated with health care. The most rapidly spreading and tenacious <b>health-care-associated</b> clone in Europe currently is EMRSA- 15, which was first detected in the UK in the early 1990 s and subsequently spread throughout Europe and beyond. Using phylogenomic methods to analyze the genome sequences for 193 S. aureus isolates, {{we were able to}} show that the current pandemic population of EMRSA- 15 descends from a <b>health-care-associated</b> MRSA epidemic that spread throughout England in the 1980 s, which had itself previously emerged from a primarily community-associated methicillin-sensitive population. The emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in this EMRSA- 15 subclone in the English Midlands during the mid- 1980 s appears to have {{played a key role in}} triggering pandemic spread, and occurred shortly after the first clinical trials of this drug. Genome-based coalescence analysis estimated that the population of this subclone over the last 20 yr has grown four times faster than its progenitor. Using comparative genomic analysis we identified the molecular genetic basis of 99. 8 % of the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of the isolates, highlighting the potential of pathogen genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool. We document the genetic changes associated with adaptation to the hospital environment and with increasing drug resistance over time, and how MRSA evolution likely has been influenced by country-specific drug use regimens.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the incidence and mortality of SAB in Icelandic children over time, and to assess the proportions of nosocomial and <b>health-care-associated</b> infections. Children < 18 years with positive blood cultures for S. aureus from January 1995 through December 2011 were identified retrospectively at the clinical microbiology laboratories performing blood cultures in Iceland. Clinical data were collected from medical records. In total, 140 children had 146 distinct episodes of SAB. Bacteremia-related mortality was 0. 7 % (1 / 146), all-cause 30 -day mortality, 1. 4 % (2 / 146), and 1 -year mortality, 3. 6 % (5 / 140). The annual incidence of SAB was 10. 9 / 100, 000 children, decreasing by 36 % from 13. 1 / 100, 000 in 1995 - 2003 to 8. 4 / 100, 000 in 2004 - 2011 (P < 0. 001). At the same time the annual number of blood cultures analyzed at the main study site decreased from 1529 to 1143 (25 %). SAB incidence was highest in infants (< 1 year), 58. 8 / 100, 000.

Antimicrobial use {{is the primary}} risk factor for development of CDAD because it disrupts normal bowel flora and promotes C. difficile overgrowth. C. difficile typically has affected older or severely ill patients who are hospital inpatients or residents of longterm–care facilities. Recently, however, both the frequency and severity of <b>health-care–associated</b> CDAD has increased; from 2000 to 2001, the rate of U. S. hospital discharge diagnoses of CDAD increased by 26 % (1). One possible explanation for these increases {{is the emergence of}} a previously uncommon strain of C. difficile responsible for severe hospital outbreaks (2). Although individual cases of CDAD are not nationall...|$|E
40|$|Background: Entero{{bacteria}}ceae are {{a family}} of bacteria that commonly cause infections in health-care settings {{as well as in}} the community. Among Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to broad-spectrum carbapenem antimicrobials has been uncommon. Over the past decade, however, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been recognized in health-care settings as a cause of difficult-to-treat infections associated with high mortality. Methods: The percentage of acute-care hospitals reporting at least one CRE from <b>health-care–associated</b> infections (HAIs) in 2012 was estimated using data submitted to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in 2012. The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae infections that were CRE was calculated using two surveillance systems: 1) the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system (NNIS) and NHSN (for 2001 and 2011, respectively) and 2) the Surveillance Network–USA (TSN) (for 2001 and 2010). Characteristics of CRE culture-positive episodes were determined usin...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory {{failure is}} one of the leading {{admission}} diagnoses on the critical care unit, and the journals have reflected this over the past few months. An understanding of the aetiology of pulmonary sepsis is important but your choice of ventilator gas humidification system is not. There are prophecies of more pandemics, but panic is futile because survival is all down to your genes. <b>Health-care-associated</b> pneumonia (HCAP) refers to a pulmonary infection that develops in individuals recently hospitalised, or undergoing renal replacement therapy or other long-term out-patient care. Over the past few years it has been postulated that this reflects a distinct group of pathogens with consequent implications for therapy and also on outcome. However, no study had looked at the pathogens of both HCAP and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) an...|$|E
