5|$|De Veer and Thomson {{prepared}} a classified 150-page {{report on the}} setting up of the gendarmerie. There were discussions of 5,000 gendarmes led by Dutch officers provided {{by the government of}} the Netherlands. On February24,1914, 13Dutch officers arrived at Vlorë: Captain Fabius, Major Kroon, Major <b>De</b> <b>Waal,</b> Major Sluys, Captain Doorman, Major Roelfsema, Dr. De Groot, Captain Sar, Major Verhulst, Major Snellen van Vollenhoven, First Lieutenant Mallinckrodt, Captains Reimers and Sonne.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to their stated objectives, Soviet {{troops and the}} predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the AzSSR OMON and army forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages strewn across Shahumyan {{to leave their homes}} and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR. British journalist Thomas <b>de</b> <b>Waal</b> has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing. The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E

5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans <b>de</b> <b>Waal</b> that suggests a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} good and evil in the human visuality, often {{associated}} with morality, is regarded by some biologists (notably Edward O. Wilson, Jeremy Griffith, David Sloan Wilson and Frans <b>de</b> <b>Waal)</b> as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} on BBC Radio 4's Front Row in May 2014, the celebrated ceramic artist and author of The Hare with Amber Eyes, Edmund <b>de</b> <b>Waal,</b> stated {{that when he was}} five years old, he was taken to a ceramics evening class at the college where he discovered ceramics.|$|E

40|$|The van <b>de</b> <b>Waals</b> {{interaction}} between two graphene sheets is studied at finite temperatures. Graphene's thermal length (ξ_T = ħ v / k_B T) controls the force versus distance (z) as a crossover from the zero temperature results for z≪ξ_T, to a linear-in-temperature, universal regime for z≫ξ_T. The large separation regime {{is shown to}} be a consequence of the classical behavior of graphene's plasmons at finite temperature. Retardation effects are largely irrelevant, both in the zero and finite temperature regimes. Thermal effects should be noticeable in the van <b>de</b> <b>Waals</b> interaction already for distances of tens of nanometers at room temperature.

25|$|Firetrucks were {{positioned}} along <b>De</b> <b>Waal</b> Drive and the M3, {{as well as}} near UCT. The fire {{reached down}} to the M3's hospital bend, opposite Groote Schuur Hospital, thus causing traffic officials to close the road and re-route all incoming traffic onto Mowbray Main Road. Other roads which were closed include Tafelberg Road towards the Lower Cable Car Station and Signal Hill Road.|$|E
25|$|Flint and <b>de</b> <b>Waal</b> {{marked the}} onset of the {{genocide}} on 26 February 2003, when a group calling itself the Darfur Liberation Front (DLF) publicly claimed credit for an attack on Golo, the headquarters of Jebel Marra District. Prior to this attack, however, conflict had broken out, as rebels attacked police stations, army outposts and military convoys and the government engaged in a massive air and land assault on the rebel stronghold in the Marrah Mountains. The rebels' first military action was a successful attack on an army garrison on 25 February 2002. The government had been aware of a unified rebel movement since an attack on the Golo police station in June 2002. Flint and <b>de</b> <b>Waal</b> date the beginning of the rebellion to 21 July 2001, when a group of Zaghawa and Fur met in Abu Gamra and swore oaths on the Qur'an to work together to defend against government-sponsored attacks on their villages. Nearly all of Darfur's residents are Muslim, including the Janjaweed, as well as government leaders in Khartoum.|$|E
25|$|Cobbles {{were brought}} into the city to block and limit access and exit from the town; the {{perpetrators}} had previously obtained the list of addresses of the Armenian residents of the city. Warnings by Azerbaijanis sympathetic to their Armenian neighbors instructed them to leave their lights {{on the night of}} the 27th; those who shut it off would be assumed to be Armenian. According to several Armenian witnesses and Soviet military personnel, alcohol and anasha, a term referring to narcotics, were brought in trucks and distributed to the crowds, although such accounts were not unreported in the media. According to <b>de</b> <b>Waal,</b> notes that the attackers were armed with homemade weapons that would have taken some time and effort to manufacture, suggesting a certain level of planning.|$|E

500|$|Sargsyan was {{appointed}} Minister of Defence by Ter-Petrosyan on 26 July 1995, during {{the restructuring of}} government ministries. He remained in that position for almost four years. The Armenian army was highly regarded by experts with Armenia being described as the only former Soviet state that [...] "managed to build a combat-capable army from scratch" [...] and was [...] "comparable in efficiency to the Soviet Army." [...] According to Thomas <b>de</b> <b>Waal,</b> the army was [...] "the most powerful institution" [...] in Armenia under him. Sargsyan is credited with substantially professionalizing the Armenian army.|$|E
50|$|<b>De</b> <b>Waal's</b> {{interest}} in pottery {{began at the}} age of five when he took a ceramics evening class at the Lincoln School of Art. He was educated at The King's School, Canterbury, where he was taught pottery by the potter Geoffrey Whiting, a student of Bernard Leach.|$|R
30|$|Adhesion is {{the force}} of {{adhesive}} strength, i.e. the absorption force at the contact surfaces (Van <b>de</b> <b>Waals</b> forces). The range of these intermolecular forces is substantially lower than the depth of roughness of the machined surfaces. For this reason, the adhesive must penetrate such surface roughness, thereby wetting the whole surface area [29, 30].|$|R
50|$|It {{has long}} been {{observed}} that the Ruppeiner metric is flat for systems with noninteracting underlying statistical mechanics such as the ideal gas. Curvature singularities signal critical behaviors. In addition, it {{has been applied to}} a number of statistical systems including Van <b>de</b> <b>Waals</b> gas. Recently the anyon gas has been studied using this approach.|$|R
500|$|Sargsyan {{was criticized}} for being undemocratic, {{particularly}} for using his influence in pre-determining the election results. The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe suggested in 1999 that his [...] "record does not inspire confidence in his commitment to democracy." [...] The 2008 book Religious Freedom in the World described him as [...] "thuggish" [...] and held him responsible for the 1995 assaults on religious minorities in Armenia (especially those that discourage military service), carried out, allegedly, by Yerkrapah. Thomas <b>de</b> <b>Waal</b> describes Sargsyan as a [...] "feudal baron," [...] and claims that Yerkrapah controlled [...] "large areas of the economy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} escalated into {{a full-scale}} {{war with the}} captured Shusha by Armenian forces on 9 May 1992. By 1993, the Armenian forces took control over not only the originally disputed Nagorno-Karabakh, but also several districts surrounding the region. A ceasefire agreement was eventually signed on 5 May 1994 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. According to Thomas <b>de</b> <b>Waal,</b> three factors contributed to {{the victory of the}} Armenian side: [...] "Azerbaijan's political and military chaos, greater Russian support for the Armenians, and the Armenians' superior fighting skills." [...] Since the 1994 ceasefire, the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has de facto control of the territories taken over in the war.|$|E
500|$|Since the video's release, Invisible Children {{has come}} under {{criticism}} for oversimplification {{of events in the}} region and has been accused of engaging in [...] "slacktivism", in which one donates or takes actions that have little to no effect beyond making one feel like one contributed. While the campaign promotes global activism, it has been criticized for providing a black-and-white picture rather than encouraging the viewers to learn about the situation. Mikaela Luttrell-Rowland from Clark University's Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies stated that it was [...] "irresponsible to prize feel good, simplistic messages over complex history and to treat consumerist-consciousness raising as interchangeable with education." [...] Africa researcher Alex <b>de</b> <b>Waal</b> accused the film of [...] "peddling dangerous and patronizing falsehoods," [...] criticized the campaign as [...] "naive" [...] for [...] "elevating Kony to a global celebrity, the embodiment of evil," [...] that might only help him as a terrorist and cult leader, and called for instead [...] "demystifying Kony—reducing him to a common criminal and a failed provincial politician." ...|$|E
40|$|A good {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties carbon nanotubes is essential to their applications. In this paper finite element analysis is carried out to simulate the axial buckling of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs) and triple-walled nanotubes (TWNTs). A commercial finite element (FE) software - ABAQUS is employed in the simulation and a buckling analysis is conducted to determine the eigenvalue of the first buckling mode for each nanotube subjected to axial loading. The effect of van <b>de</b> <b>Waals</b> force on the critical axial strain and the first bucklling mode of both the DWNTs and the TWNTs is discussed. The buckling modes of DWNTs and TWNTs are {{different from that of}} the SWNTs due to the van <b>de</b> <b>Waals</b> force involved. Inserting inner tubes does not lower the dritical axial strain of a SWNT. The post buckling behaviour of a SWNT and DWNT is also discussed...|$|R
