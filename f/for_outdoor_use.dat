5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use</b> such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use</b> but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
25|$|CFLs are {{generally}} not designed <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use</b> and some will not start in cold weather. CFLs are available with cold-weather ballasts, which may be rated to as low as −28.8°C (−20°F). Light output {{in the first few}} minutes drops at low temperatures. Cold-cathode CFLs will start and perform {{in a wide range of}} temperatures due to their different design.|$|E

25|$|Marching snare drums are {{deeper in}} size than snares {{normally}} used for orchestral or drum kit purposes. This gives the drum the big, full sound necessary <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use.</b> Standard sizes (listed as diameter x depth) are 13x11 and 14x12 inches. They can weigh anywhere from 16-45lb. Smaller sizes such as 13x9 {{have become increasingly}} popular in recent times {{with the proliferation of}} indoor drum lines.|$|E
25|$|On {{only one}} occasion, 21 December 2005, the Pope wore the camauro, the {{traditional}} red papal hat usually worn in the winter. It {{had not been}} seen since the pontificate of Pope John XXIII (1958–1963). On 6 September 2006, the Pope began wearing the red cappello romano (also called a saturno), a wide-brimmed hat <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use.</b> Rarely used by John Paul II, it was more widely worn by his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|The {{enhanced}} performance {{may arise from}} a decrease in solvent permeation across the sealant due to {{the application of the}} polymer gel electrolyte. The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s). The much improved stabilities of the device under both thermal stress and soaking with light has never before been seen in DSCs, and they match the durability criteria applied to solar cells <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use,</b> which makes these devices viable for practical application.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a weather-proof box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use.</b> Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E

40|$|Wood has a {{long history}} of use in {{familiar}} products, and even now wood is the staple material for buildings and furniture. Recently, new applications of wood have been decks, garden furniture, house fences, play equipment, boardwalks, and signboards. Wood products are also widely used in public construction works on river and roads such as bridges, sound-insulating fence, and guard-rail. The increase in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>uses</b> of wood products arises from their warmth and amenity properties, good design characteristics and natural harmony with the surrounding scenery. The environmental friendliness of wood is due to its renewability as a natural resource, to the low energy consumption in processing, and because it is easy to recycle or dispose. As proven by Horyuji Temple in Japan, which is the oldest wooden structure in the world, wood is almost an everlasting material. However, exterior wood, wood <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>uses</b> is always exposed to weathering such as light or rainfall, and to biological deterioration by decay fungi or termites. For high-performance utilization of exterior wood products, not only structural reliability, but also durability and weathering resistance are highly required. We are conducting the research projects on the high-performance utilization of wood <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>uses,</b> which are the characterization of the wood surfaces exposed to sunshine and rainfall, the non-destructive detection of decay and insect attacks in wood, the development of maintenance system to provide the long-life to wood, and so on. Among them, two research topics are outlined in this page (1) ...|$|R
2500|$|Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial hardwoods in the Southeastern United States.

2500|$|Table lamp wire is {{typically}} #18, while extension cords are #16, with #14 common on cords grounded <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use,</b> and #12 available. [...] Mini Christmas lights were mostly #24 through 1997, when that gauge was arbitrarily de-rated from 3 to 2.5 amps, preventing manufacturers from getting UL certification {{for the same}} products which had already been approved {{for more than two}} decades. [...] They were forced to use the formerly heavy-duty standard of #22 wire (itself de-rated from 5 to 4 amps), plus thicker insulation, which in turn caused them to shortchange customers by drastically shortening the light socket spacing and usable length of sets. [...] This change also made light strings stiff and unsightly. [...] Heavy-duty mini lights are now 20 AWG, with larger screw-in bulbs having sockets on 18 AWG lamp wire.|$|E

High tension drums began and were perfected in the pipe band market and later moved into the marching band and drum corps areas. The bottom (or resonant) side of the drum has a tightly tuned head and synthetic gut or metal snare wires, which are often secured to the drum using a strainer to limit their movement and make the sound more staccato. <b>For</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>use,</b> a projector or [...] "scoop" [...] - a piece of curved plastic - may be attached {{to the back of the}} bottom hoop to help project the sound forward to the audience.|$|E
