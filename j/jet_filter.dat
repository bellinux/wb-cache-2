In this study, we present a similarity-based method for comparing the perceptual importance of object properties across modalities and show how it {{can also be used to}} perceptually validate computational measures of object properties. Similarity measures for a set of three-dimensional (3 D) objects varying in shape and texture were gathered from humans in two modalities (vision and touch) and derived from a set of standard 2 D and 3 D computational measures (image and mesh subtraction, object perimeter, curvature, Gabor <b>jet</b> <b>filter</b> responses, and the Visual Difference Predictor (VDP)). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was then performed on the similarity data to recover configurations of the stimuli in 2 D perceptual/computational spaces. These two dimensions corresponded to the two dimensions of variation in the stimulus set: shape and texture. In the human visual space, shape strongly dominated texture. In the human haptic space, shape and texture were weighted roughly equally. Weights varied considerably across subjects in the haptic experiment, indicating that different strategies were used. Maps derived from shape-dominated computational measures provided good fits to the human visual map. No single computational measure provided a satisfactory fit to the map derived from mean human haptic data, though good fits were found for individual subjects; a combination of measures with individually-adjusted weights may be required to model the human haptic similarity judgments. Our method provides a high-level approach to perceptual validation, which can be applied in both unimodal and multimodal interface design.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of acid/water jetting {{treatments}} currently applied {{in the field is}} to clean up the filter cake formed during the drilling process and perhaps further stimulate the wellbore by creating wormholes if acid jetting is used in carbonate formation. This purpose can be achieved for the reason that the filter cake on the borehole can be mechanically broken by the high speed jetting action, and additionally, if acid is used, some materials in the filter cake can be dissolved, which can facilitate the mechanical breaking action. The knowledge of jetting effectiveness under various conditions is crucial for the purpose of optimizing the treatment design. In order to investigate quantitatively the effectiveness of acid/water <b>jetting</b> for <b>filter</b> cake cleanup and wellbore productivity enhancement, laboratory experiments were carried out under conditions similar to those in the field.

An analysis of the mechanism for filter cake removal and wormhole creating during acid jetting treatment was proposed.

40|$|AbstractPulse-jet bag {{filters are}} {{frequently}} employed for particle removal from off gases. Separated solids form a layer on the permeable filter media called filter cake. The cake {{is responsible for}} increasing pressure drop. Therefore, the cake has to be detached at a predefined upper pressure drop limit or at predefined time intervals. Thus the process is intrinsically semi-continuous. The cake formation and cake detachment are interdependent and may influence {{the performance of the}} filter. Therefore, understanding formation and detachment of filter cake is important. In this regard, the filter media is the key component in the system. Needle felts are the most commonly used media in bag filters. Cake formation studies with heat treated and membrane coated needle felts in pilot scale pulse <b>jet</b> bag <b>filter</b> were carried out. The data is processed according to the procedures that were published already [Powder Technology, Volume 173, Issue 2, 19 April 2007, Pages 93 – 106]. Pressure drop evolution, cake height distribution evolution, cake patches area distribution and their characterization using fractal analysis on different needle felts are presented here. It is observed that concavity of pressure drop curve for membrane coated needle felt is principally caused by presence of inhomogeneous cake area load whereas it is inherent for heat treated media. Presence of residual cake enhances the concavity of pressure drop at the start of filtration cycle. Patchy cleaning is observed only when jet pulse pressure is too low and unable to provide the necessary force to detach the cake. The border line is very sharp. Based on experiments with limestone dust and three types of needle felts, for the jet pulse pressure above 4 bar and filtration velocity below 50 mm/s, cake is detached completely except a thin residual layer (100 – 200 μm). Uniformity and smoothness of residual cake depends on the surface characteristics of the filter media. Cake height distribution of residual cake and newly formed cake during filtration prevails. The patch size analysis and fractal analysis reveal that residual cake grow in size (latterly) following regeneration initially on the base with edges smearing out, however, the cake heights are not leveled off. Fractal dimension of cake patches boundary falls in the range of 1 – 1. 4 and depends on vertical position as well as time of filtration. Cake height measurements with Polyimide (PI) needle felts were hampered on account of its photosensitive nature...|$|R

FDA-EDXRF was one of the techniques employed to try to discover the onset of 4 bearing failure. An FDA-EDXRF profile of the J 52 engine was developed in about 3 weeks. Initially, particulates obtained from J 52 filters where FDA indicated that abnormal amounts of bearing wear were present in the engine were sent to Pratt & Whitney Aerospace Laboratory to be analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM results confirmed the presence of M- 50 alloy or bearing wear. Subsequent teardowns of a portion of the engines having abnormal bearing wear indicated by FDA had fractured 4 bearing cages. This paper will outline how FDA technology has kept the J 52 fleet flying...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of dielectric materials with corona discharge causes that these materials are {{transferred to the}} electret state and, consequently, a quasi-constant electric field forms in the space surrounding the dielectric material. The charges, captured {{on the surface and}} in the volume of the material and injected {{as a result of this}} treatment form an efficient surface homocharge which exists for a long period of time. Consequently, this phenomenon can be utilised in practice. The electret effect is the basis of operation of electret microphones and sensors, <b>jets</b> and <b>filters</b> for efficient cleaning, is utilised in the development of programmable memory devices, and also for increasing the adhesion capacity of films and layers deposited on the dielectric substrate. The main relationships and the nature of the electret state are usually evident in the examination of modelling dielectric materials by measurements of the dependences of the effective surface charge density (ESCD) in relation to the storage time and the spectra of the current of thermally stimulated depolarization (TSD). On the basis of these measurements it is possible to calculate the parameters of the relaxation processes and relaxation devices, and also determine the physical models which can be used to described the electret state. The results of examination of the modelling dielectrics greatly facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the electro-physical properties of other dielectric materials with more complicated structure. In this work the experimental objects were represented by single crystals of lithium fluoride (modelling inorganic dielectric), organic silicon compound (modelling organic dielectric, used for the protection and the sealing of semiconductor crystals in the components in electronic industry), and polyethyleneterepthtalate film. The specimens of lithium fluoride and the compound were in the form of discs with a diameter of 20 mm, thickness 1 mm, and the specimens of Lavsan were in the form of squares, 20 x 20 mm, thickness 65 #mu#m. The specimens were treated with corona discharge from a sharp tip and temperatures of 22 and 170 deg. C. The measurements of ESCD were taken by the compensation method. The results of measurements of the time dependences of the ESCD of the corona electrets shows that there are relationships governing the relaxation of the electret state in dielectrics with different structure: if the {{treatment of}} the specimens was carried out at room temperature (22 deg. C), the main process of failure of the ESCD is exponential with a short relaxation time at room temperature (10 " 2 - 10 " 3 s); however when the temperature was higher and the short-life component of the ESCD was smallerTranslated from Russian (Fiz.
