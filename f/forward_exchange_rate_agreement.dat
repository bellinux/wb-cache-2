It traces the history of the interest parity concept, summarizes evidence on the empirical validity of uncovered interest parity, and discusses different interpretations of the evidence and the implications for macroeconomic analysis. The uncovered interest parity assumption has been an important building block in multiperiod models of open economies, and although its validity is strongly challenged by the empirical evidence, at least at short time horizons, its retention in macroeconomic models is supported on pragmatic grounds by the lack of much empirical support for existing models of the exchange risk premium. <b>Exchange</b> rates;Interest rates;exchange <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> expectations, spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, <b>forward</b> <b>exchange,</b> spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> international finance, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> market intervention, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> economics, foreign assets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk, <b>exchange</b> risks, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, financial globalization, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> markets, annual <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> futures, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, capital flows, foreign <b>exchange</b> market, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, globalization...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{inability}} to effectively hedge against unfavourable <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, using the current <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{as the only}} guideline, is a key inhibiting factor of international trade. Market participants use the current <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> quoted in the market to make decisions regarding future <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes. However, the current <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is not solely determined by the interaction of demand and supply, but is also a mechanistic estimation, {{which is based on}} the current spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and the carry cost of the transaction. Results of various studies, including this study, demonstrated that the current <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> differs substantially from the realized future spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> This phenomenon is known as the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> puzzle. This study contributes to the dynamics of modelling <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> theories by developing an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> model that has the ability to explain the realized future spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> puzzle. The <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> model is based only on current (time t) economic fundamentals and includes an alternative approach of incorporating the impact of the interaction of two international financial markets into the model. This study derived a unique <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> model, which proves that the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> puzzle is a pseudo problem. The pseudo problem is based on the generally excepted fallacy that current non–stationary, level time series data cannot be used to model <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> theories, because of the incorrect assumption that all the available econometric methods yield statistically insignificant results due to spurious regressions. Empirical evidence conclusively shows that using non–stationary, level time series data of current economic fundamentals can statistically significantly explain the realized future spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and, therefore, that the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> puzzle can be solved. This model will give market participants in the foreign exchange market a better indication of expected future <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> which will considerably reduce the dependence on the mechanistically derived forward points.
