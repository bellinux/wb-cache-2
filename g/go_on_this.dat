25|$|They {{arrive in}} 2049 aboard {{a space shuttle}} filled with nuclear devices on a crash course for Earth's moon. They survive and meet the shuttle's crew, led by Captain Lundvik. Lundvik {{explains}} {{they are on a}} suicide mission to destroy the moon; some years past, the moon's gravitation influence suddenly changed, causing massive high tides on Earth wiping out much of humanity, and destabilising the orbit of many of mankind's artificial satellites. Lundvik, who had wanted to become one of Earth's space-faring astronauts, offered to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> mission to save humanity. Privately, Clara asks the Doctor about this point in time, knowing the moon exists in Earth's future, but the Doctor himself is not clear, as this is a point of time in flux.|$|E
25|$|A learner's permit can {{be issued}} at age 16. The student {{may choose to}} learn by going to a driving school or in private with up to four {{different}} instructors. Usually a mix of the two is used. These instructors must be 24 or older and must have held a valid driver's licence for five years (it must not have been cancelled temporarily for drunk driving and other serious traffic violations, but a single speeding conviction is now acceptable). The instructors and student must go through a traffic safety course before permission is granted; it takes about three hours to complete and is usually given at all driving schools on certain dates. From 2010 it is enough for every student and every instructor to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> course once; before that each instructor and student pair had to go together, e.g. father/elder child, mother/elder child, father/younger child, mother/younger child.|$|E

500|$|Heigl {{declined}} {{to put her}} name forward for consideration at the 2008 Emmy Awards, claiming {{that she had been}} given insufficient material on the series to warrant a nomination. Following Heigl's statement, speculation arose that her character would suffer a brain tumor and be killed off Grey's Anatomy, substantiated by the announcement Jeffrey Dean Morgan would return to the series as Denny, who died at the end of season two. ABC's entertainment president Steve McPherson denied the rumor, stating: [...] "There is an unbelievable storyline for her this year, which is really central to everything that's going to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> season".|$|E
500|$|In early 2007, Rihanna {{began work}} on her third studio album. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, she announced that [...] "the new music is going in a different direction. Not on purpose, but I just want to hear something fresh and mostly uptempo. I think that's where I want to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> one. You feel different every album, and [...] this stage I feel like I {{want to do a}} lot of uptempo [...]" [...] The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress Charlize Theron's bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller Æon Flux.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Henstridge {{described}} the episode as [...] "a coming-of-age story. I think we see Simmons at the start, and she’s {{never really been}} combat ready ... we see her have to survive, and just to see her <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> journey from complete despair". Henstridge also noted thriller elements in the episode. On the moment in [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] where Simmons loses hope, Henstridge explained, [...] "I never thought we'd see her get to that place ... It justifies her relationship with Will, too, because {{she was ready to}} end it all and {{he was the one who}} pulled her back from the brink." [...] Concerning that relationship with new character Will Daniels, the executive producers worked with Titley to try to make it feel earned in the episode, given the fan following of 'FitzSimmons' (the potential relationship between Simmons and Leo Fitz). Executive producer Jed Whedon also noted on this that the episode [...] "wasn’t a story about the two of them on this planet, but a story about Fitz hearing this and how he will respond. He breaks your heart, at the end, she breaks your heart, and hopefully, you’re feeling for all three involved." ...|$|E

500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E
500|$|Miles {{was born}} in March 1977. [...] As a child, {{he lives with his}} mother Lara Chang (Leslie Ishii) in Encino, California. [...] Miles does not know his father, only being told by his mother that he is dead and did not care about them when he was alive, forcing them to leave him when Miles is a baby. [...] Miles resents his father for never having been around and also has disdain for other fathers who mistreat their children. [...] At seven years old, Miles discovers that he can hear the {{thoughts}} from before their death of those who are dead. [...] He becomes a professional spiritualist and develops his ability so that he can access specific information from the deceased. [...] In early December 2004, when he is twenty-seven years old, Miles is hired for $1.6 million by Charles Widmore to go on a freighter called the Kahana to an uncharted island to retrieve a mass murderer named Ben Linus, as Widmore believes that Miles will be able to communicate with those whom he had killed and gain information regarding his location. [...] Before he leaves, Miles is briefly abducted by Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team. Bram claims to know about Miles's father and the source of his superpower and he warns Miles not to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> mission, instead trying to convince Miles to join him.|$|E
2500|$|In 645, after Emperor Taizong {{carried out}} a failed attempt to conquer Goguryeo, he regretted the {{campaign}} and stated, [...] "If Wei Zheng were still alive, {{he would not have}} allowed me to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campaign." [...] He sent imperial messengers to make sacrifices to Wei and restore the stone monument, and he also summoned Wei's wife and children, greatly awarding them.|$|E

2500|$|Fa Zheng and Zhuge Liang did {{not share}} the same moral beliefs {{but they had a}} good working {{relationship}} because of their common goal, which was to serve Liu Bei well. Zhuge Liang was very impressed with Fa Zheng's brilliance. In 221, before the Battle of Xiaoting, many of Liu Bei's subjects advised their lord against going to war with his former ally, Sun Quan, who seized Jing Province from Liu in 219 and executed Liu's general Guan Yu. Liu Bei ignored them and proceeded with his campaign against Sun Quan. In the following year, he lost to Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting and had to retreat to Baidicheng, where he died in 223. Zhuge Liang sighed, [...] "If Fa Xiaozhi was still alive, he could have prevented our lord from going on this eastern campaign; even if our lord did <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> campaign, he wouldn't have ended up in this disastrous situation (if Fa Xiaozhi was with him)." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 September, Bishop Jo Seoka of the South African Council of Churches, who was {{mediating}} {{a resolution}} to the conflict, announced that the striking miners had accepted a 22% pay raise, a one-off payment of R2,000, and would return to work 20 September. However, the National Union of Mineworkers, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union and the Solidarity union did not make any statements {{in response to this}} offer. While miners' representative Zolisa Bodlani said of the deal that [...] "it's a huge achievement. No union has achieved a 22% increase before," [...] Lonmin's Sue Vey said it would offer no comment as the agreement had not yet been signed. However, Chris Molebatsi, who {{was a part of the}} organising committee for the strike, said: [...] "The campaign will <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> campaign is aimed at helping workers. People died here at Marikana. Something needs to be done. This is a campaign to ensure justice for the people of Marikana. We want the culprits to be brought to book, and it is crucial that justice is seen to be done here. It is our duty and the duty of this country to ensure justice is served, so that we can make sure this country is a democracy and to stop South Africa from going down the drain." [...] He also added that the Marikana Solidarity Campaign has more work to do in terms of supporting victims' families, offering PTSD counselling and to oversight the state-appointed judicial commission that would ensure justice after the violence; he also noted that: ...|$|E
