40|$|Research PaperIn this paper, the {{estimate}} of the productive efficiency for some Italian <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> is proposed. The estimate {{is based on a}} Stochastic Frontier Production (SFP) function and a Data Envelopment Analysis frontier (DEA) using micro data of fishing vessels. The essential random nature of the fishing processes under consideration suggests that stochastic method might be preferable to non-parametric DEA method for efficiency estimation. In other words, the risk connected with DEA is that random noise, probably due to exogenous shocks or measurement error, may be considered as inefficient. On the other hand, DEA does not identify an explicit functional form for the production function combined with a distributional form for the inefficiency term. Therefore, DEA should be less prone to mis-specification than Stochastic Frontier Production. In fishery literature, several empirical comparisons between DEA and SFP have been conducted in order to assess the level of efficiency of fishing vessels and <b>fleet</b> <b>segments.</b> This paper attempts to apply both techniques, simultaneously, to the Mediterranean area which is characterized by multi-speciies and artisanal-type fishery...|$|E

The most important <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> contributing to the overall productivity of the Maltese fishing industry, both in terms of total biomass landed and total generated income, was comprised of vessels using hooks in 2009 - 2011.

Economic {{performance}} of different <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> varies considerably {{from year to}} year, with some segments experiencing increased profitability while others experience decreased profitability. This variation is {{generally considered to be}} a consequence of the stochasticity in the industry. However, there is growing evidence that fisheries may not be as stochastic as generally thought. In this paper, a spatial bioeconomic model is developed of a multi-species multi-gear fishery, which assumes individual profit maximising behaviour. It is shown that inter-annual variations in profits are a function of the spatial behaviour of the fishers, which tends to vary chaotically over time...|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{costs are}} an {{important}} element in models used to analyse and predict fisher behaviour for application within the wider mixed fisheries and ecosystem approaches to management. This investigation explored the predictive capability of linear and generalized additive models (GAMs) in providing daily fuel consumption estimates for fishing vessels given knowledge of their length, engine power, <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> (annual dominant gear type), and fuel prices. Models were fitted to half of the Irish fishing vessel economic data collected between 2003 and 2011. The predictive capabilities of the seven best models were validated against the remaining, previously un-modelled, data. The type of gear used by a <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> had an important influence on fuel consumption as did the price of fuel. The passive pot gear and Scottish seine gear segments indicated consistently lower consumptions, whereas dredge and pelagic gears showed consistently higher fuel consumptions. Furthermore, increasing fuel price negatively affected fuel consumption, especially for more powerful, larger vessels. Of the formulated models, the best fit to training data were a GAM with a gear main effect and two smooth functions; standardized vessel length and engine power interacting with fuel price. For prediction, overall, this model showed the closest predictions with the least bias, followed by three linear models. However, all seven models compared for predictive capability performed well for the most sampled segments (demersal and pelagic trawlers). This is an author produced pre-print pdf.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in bioeconomic models as tools for understanding pathways of fishery behaviour {{in order to assess}} the impact of alternative policies on natural resources. A model system is presented that combines stochastic age-structured population dynamics with complex fisheries economics. Explicitly, the economic response of <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> to changes in stock development is analysed by applying observed values and stochastic recruitment. The optimization of net profits determines the fishing effort and the investment and disinvestment behaviour of <b>fleet</b> <b>segments,</b> which, in turn, affect the level of catch rates and discards. This tool was applied to the North Sea saithe fishery, where ICES re-evaluated the existing EU–Norway management plan, focusing on biological reference points only. Two scenarios were tested with alternative harvest control rules and then contrasted with one unregulated scenario with no quotas and driven by optimizing the net profit of the whole fleet. The model showed the success of both harvest control rules in rebuilding the stock and the associated costs to the fleets in terms of maximal 21 % reduction in net profits, 21 % reduction in crew wages and 11 % reduction in fleet size in the midterm (2007 – 2015). In the long term (2022), successful stock recovery coincided with net profits almost equalling that of the unrestricted fishery. The model is highly sensitive to the parameter values but can be used strategically, providing a qualitative understanding of the anticipated relative changes...|$|E

Since 1996 for instance, the cod quota for the German fishery was reduced from 22 000 t to 13 000 t {{in the year}} 2001. And further cuts took place in 2002. However, concerning the Baltic herring, its populations developed well. Nevertheless, the German quota has been used only by 13 % because of marketing problems. But these difficulties will be reduced by establishing a new fish processing plant {{on the island of}} Ruegen in the near future. Therefore the regional government of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and a PO of Ruegen took an initiative to investigate the possibilities of a revival the spring herring fishery.

In order to fill this gap, an assessment on the North Western Adriatic Sea coast has been performed. Landings per Unit of Effort (kilograms per boat per day) for each trawling <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> have been analysed, by comparing on a monthly basis the before (2007 - 2009) and after ban (2011 - 2013) period. The comparison was carried out considering total landings and the six main species targeted inside the three miles area (sand smelt, cuttlefish, red mullet, sole, turbot, and mantis shrimp). Within a general reduction of total landings, a differential effect based on the analysed metiers was detected, with small trawlers being more negatively affected than the large and rapido ones, which showed, for some species, positive impacts. From an ecological point of view, though, no positive overall effects were detected, probably {{due to the fact that}} the adopted measure is not sufficient to reduce the overexploitation. In any case, all this is affecting the structure of the small-scale fishery in the area, since small trawlers are changing métier, moving towards the artisanal fishery, with deep impacts on the very coastal area that the trawling ban was designated to protect, compromising all possible benefit...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary This {{document}} {{is the second}} deliverable in work package 5 of the DiscardLess project. The project is intended {{to contribute to a}} successful implementation of the landing obligation of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy of the EU. The work package 5 addresses how unwanted, unavoidable catches can be handled on-board the fishing vessels i. e. from catch to first sale. The objective of this deliverable is to identify available alternatives and recommend the most applicable solutions for on-board handling of these unwanted, unavoidable catches for four different <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> in three case studies. The case studies are North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Northeast Atlantic (Iceland and UK), but the selection of vessels has taken into consideration transferability to other European fleets and areas. Practical and cost efficient solutions are identified, adapted and developed for four different <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> based on input from different tasks in the project (1. 4, 5. 1, 6. 1 & 6. 2) and stakeholder interaction. The <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> selected are 10 - 15 meter hook & line coastal vessels typically operated in Northeast Atlantic, 18 - 30 meter Danish seine/bottom trawl vessels typically operated in the North Sea and adjacent areas, 34 - 44 meter Bay of Biscay bottom trawlers typically operated by the Spanish fleet and finally 40 - 60 meter fresh-fish bottom trawlers used by most EU offshore fleets. Solutions for sorting, bleeding, cleaning, chilling, pre-processing, storing and other on-board handling are suggested and evaluated based on need, cost and applicability. Some parts of the work include elements of technological innovation, but most rely on exploiting currently available solutions, applying “best practice” technology and knowledge. Recommended solutions are presented on deck-plans (drawings) in order for stakeholders to get a clearer picture of the suggested changes. The work presented in this report focuses on the four previously mentioned fleet types that provide a relatively good cross-section of important EU fleets that are to be heavily affected by the landing obligation. It includes reviewing current setup of on-board handling where discarding is allowed and then identifies solutions applicable for those fleet types under a discard ban. The main challenges are connected to catches of juvenile fish, which cannot be utilised for direct human consumption. A number of alternatives are identified for each fleet segment and the most applicable solutions are discussed and demonstrated in detail e. g. in deck-plans, mas-balance calculations, cost/benefit assessment etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of quality of}} economic data is a relevant issue that has been raised by several working groups and by different bodies (first of all STECF and RCMs). This issue also affects end users that {{should be aware of}} the reliability of data used in the analysis. The new Data Collection Framework establishes the list of economic variables to be collected for the total fleets and for the <b>fleet</b> <b>segments.</b> It also requires Member States to describe the methodologies applied for the data collection and to give information on the quality (accuracy and precision) of estimates. Thus, SGECA 09 - 02 was asked to give appropriate recommendations and proposals in order to homogenise the presentation of National Programmes and also in order to facilitate the STECF task to evaluate the quality of the data collected by the Member States. Moreover, the Regional Co-ordination Meetings held in 2008 identified several issues within the new DCF requiring further work or clarification. Thus, this report reflects the reviews and discussions on the most frequently applied methodologies to collect economic variables for <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> and the common approaches proposed to assess data quality. SGECA reached a consensus on a list of recommendations, that were proposed to STECF for their possible adoption and endorsement.

40|$|The Peruvian {{anchoveta}} {{fishery is}} currently targeted {{by a large}} fleet featuring {{a wide range of}} vessel sizes (segments), with highly variable capacities. In addition, the landings of the industrial fleet are used exclusively by the reduction industry, while those performed by small- and medium-scale vessels are destined mainly for direct human consumption. Despite these differences, the entire fleet is made up of purse seiners that perform similar operations when at sea. Therefore, the main aim {{of this study is to}} identify the differences in eco-efficiency between the different <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> in order to delve into the potential environmental improvements that could be attained through operational benchmarking. To this end, the combined use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was applied to the Peruvian anchoveta fleet. More specifically, a modified 5 -step LCA + DEA method, whose particularities are broadly discussed throughout the study, was computed to obtain the desired operational benchmarks and, thereafter, estimate the target environmental gains. Results led to an average efficiency score of 86 % throughout the segments, with a total of eight <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> out of 13 (62 %) operating inefficiently. Nevertheless, no clear pattern was identified through the segments, although certain correlations with stock abundance, fuel use intensity, overcapacity and climatic conditions are discussed. Reduction in material inputs based on operational benchmarks translated into environmental gains that ranged from 26 % to 53 % for inefficient segments. Finally, it is expected that the findings in this study may aid stakeholders and policy makers when revising fuel use optimisation and overcapacity management strategies...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{interviews of}} {{a representative sample}} of 106 retired fishers in Italy, Spain and Greece, asking specific questions about the trends they perceived in dolphin and shark abundances between 1940 and 1999 (in three 20 year periods) compared to the present abundance. The large marine fauna studied were not target species of the commercial <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> interviewed (trawl fishery). The fishers were asked to rank the perceived abundance in each period into qualitative ordinal classes based on two indicators: frequency of sightings and frequency of catches (incidental or intentional) of each taxonomic group. The statistical analysis of the survey results showed that both incidental catches and the sighting frequency of dolphins have decreased significantly over the 60 + years of the study period (except for in Greece due to the recent population increase). This shows that fishers' perceptions are in agreement with the declining population trends detected by scientists. Shark catches were also perceived to have diminished since the early 1940 s for all species. Other long-lived Mediterranean marine fauna (monk seals, whales) were at very low levels {{in the second half of}} the 20 (th) century and no quantitative data could be obtained. Our study supports the results obtained in the Mediterranean and other seas that show the rapid disappearance (over a few decades) of marine fauna.

40|$|Research PaperThis work {{analyses}} empirically {{the exploitation}} dynamics from 1997 to 2003, {{of the most}} important segment of the Spanish fishing fleet operating in the EU waters, also known as “ 300 fleet”. The aim of the analysis is exploring the economic consequences of the coming into force of the new approaches in the EU fisheries management system in the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy Reform, particularly from an institutional point of view. Such analysis is based on the use of suitable index analysis for quantifying the contribution caused by the variation in prices, catches, and capital productivity into the changes in production of this <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> during this period. For this case analysis, It is suggested that the current EU fishing resources management system distorts the biological perception of scarceness or abundance of resources through the institutional framework of quota allocation. Quota allocation is becoming the factor that contributes most to explain the variations in fleet income, as against capital productivity that plays a secondary role. However capital productivity would explain the higher contribution to income generation provided that the biological perception of scarceness was internalised faithfully in the institutional framework for EU fishing quota setting and allocation. Restrictions on fishing activities, based on quotas and licences limit the range of strategies that the Spanish fleet operating in EU waters can deploy in order to face biological variability, improvement of technology and changes in fish market prices. These observations lead {{to the conclusion that the}} current fishing resources management system during the Common Fisheries Policy Reform, could have been distorting the biological perception of scarceness or abundance of natural resources and reduce the capital productivity contribution in the income creation, by making the fishing capital less malleable, and by generating less economic efficiency in the Spanish fleet under TAC regulation...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} within {{the scientific community}} that a single species approach to European mixed fisheries can result in species-specific advice inconsistent with multi-species management objectives. Within the reformed Common Fisheries Policy a move toward mixed fisheries and ecosystem based management is encouraged. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to improve understanding of the complex targeting behaviour undertaken by commercial fishers. Whereby, improved understanding will enhance the ability to predict the responses to future mixed fisheries management measures and changing economic conditions within the Irish fishing industry. Irish métiers (groups of homogeneous fishing trips) highlight the complexity of fishing activities within the Irish fleet, having identified 33 otter trawl métiers and 19 in the remainder of the fleet. Métier dynamics identified over compensation to introduced management, resulting in effort displacement and increased temporal specific fishing pressure. Therefore were deemed as appropriate base units for all subsequent analyses. Two economic variables, operational fishing cost and trip landings value, considered to represent important drivers were developed. This lead to application of a general additive model to estimate and predict fuel consumption estimates according to <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> definitions. A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified kilowatt fishing days as the most appropriate effort measure. The final investigation stage successfully amalgamated the knowledge gained into the formulation of novel Markov transition probability for a multinomial model to predict fisher métier strategy choice. This is to be incorporated into management strategy evaluation, aiding the assessment and possible impacts of future management proposals on the Irish fleet and commercial stocks around Ireland. Developments presented will benefit the progression toward optimising sustainability within a mixed fisheries approach to management through incorporation of economic considerations.

The {{terms of}} {{reference}} for the meeting are given in section 2. 1. 27 experts from 16 Member States attended the meeting. PGECON is an operative meeting with a general aim to compare different approaches and to share different experiences. Participation is open to national experts involved {{in the implementation of}} the economic modules of the DCF. Attendance to the PGECON is expected to give useful inputs in improving the national sampling schemes. The main conclusions and recommendations from the meeting are given in the section n. 12. The meeting dealt with a broad range of issues considered relevant for the improvement of the collection of economic data and for the evolution of the DCF. A key topic for the meeting was the discussion on the revision of the data collection framework. This discussion considered both the general principles of the new Data Collection Multiannual Program (DCMAP) as well as the technical and operative issues of the new framework. PGECON discussed that for the economic modules of the DCF, a certain degree of flexibility would be advisable. This will allow to adjust the data requirements in terms of level of aggregation and to include additional variables if a specific scientific or political need emerges or to exclude variables when they turn out not to be needed. However, this flexibility should not exclude the necessity to also have stability in terms of the core of the economic data requirements. PGECON also addressed the issue of the level of aggregation of economic data. The present DCF requires the collection of economic data by <b>fleet</b> <b>segment,</b> by year and by supra-region. However, there seems to be several scientific fields where the availability of economic data at higher temporal, regional or activity-related level could be necessary. It was concluded that DCF fleet economic data should not be collected at less aggregated levels as it is not feasible to collect data at a level of resolution that fulfils all potential requirements. Rather these data should be disaggregated on the basis of other information (transversal variables) which is available at the required resolution. PGECON compared the methodologies used by the Member States attending the meeting in calculating the ecosystem indicator on “fuel efficiency of fish capture” and the variable “direct subsidies”. The aim of this comparative exercise was to attempt the definition of a standard methodology to calculate the ecosystem indicator and the direct subsidies. The Workshop on calculating capital value using PIM and definition of DCF variables, (13 th - 17 th June 2011) clarified some fundamental concepts related to the PIM methodology for the estimation of capital value and capital cost and illustrated some practical implementation of the approach. As a follow up of this workshop, PGECON carried out a comparison of the average prices per capacity unit and corresponding assumptions applied by the Member States attending the meeting.

Norway has contributed to this project with a review of the Norwegian policy on fisheries rebuilding programs, supported by case studies on the rebuilding of the Northeast Arctic cod and Norwegian Spring Spawning herring.

Electrification, via mass market adoption of plug-in vehicles (i. e. battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles), has emerged as a front runner for road transport across the globe, but there are concerns that the pace and extent implied by many modelling studies is problematic and that assessment of (a) the heterogeneity in the market, (b) other low carbon vectors (e. g. conventional hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell) and (c) life cycle energy and environmental impacts have been relatively neglected. This paper aims to fill these gaps by examining the timing, scale and impacts of the uptake of plug-in vehicles in the heterogeneous UK car market from a consumer perspective. To achieve this aim it (a) brings together a bespoke disaggregated model of the transport-energy-environment system (the UK Transport Carbon Model) with previous work by the authors on heterogeneity in the demand for and supply of plug-in vehicles and (b) applies the improved model to develop future low carbon scenarios that assess the potential impact of different investment pathways and policy approaches to the electrification of cars with the view to meeting the UK’s legally binding carbon budgets to 2050. The results show the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity in and dynamic nature of the car market in terms of new technology adoption by private consumers, so called ‘user choosers’ and fleet managers, as well as accounting for potential effects on wider life cycle emissions resulting from different uptake pathways. It allows an assessment of the effectiveness of different policy instruments, market conditions (vehicle supply, private vs <b>fleet</b> market, vehicle <b>segments)</b> and social factors (consumer awareness, range “anxiety”, perceived charging requirements) on different consumer segments, thus providing more policy-focused conclusions on the likely pathways to high penetration of plug-in vehicles that may be required to meet future carbon and air quality targets...|$|R

Efficient policy instruments are needed to change the development. This report uses empirical models to analyse how CO 2 emissions, fleet structure, economic performance, and employment opportunities are affected by imposing management instruments to reduce climate impacts. These instruments include both fisheries management such as larger stock levels and more efficient fleets, and energy policy such as fuel taxes or CO 2 trading schemes. To get a representative view of the Nordic fisheries, the analysis contains case studies from all the Nordic countries: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Finland.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the EU long-term management plan for cod stocks, in force since 2009, is analysed focusing on the human and institutional factors. The plan operates through landings quotas (TACs) and effort restrictions following a Harvest Control Rule, and deploys a novel instrument allowing Member States to ‘buy back’ or increase fishing effort for <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> engaged in cod-avoidance measures. The stipulated fishing mortality reductions have not been achieved. On the positive side, the ‘buy-back’ instrument has led to increased uptake of selective gear and implementation of permanent and real- time temporary closures. On the negative side, ignoring the dimension of fishers as reactive agents in the design, the impact assessment, and the annual implementation of the measures {{has contributed to the}} failure to adequately implement the plan and achieve its objectives.

40|$|The 12 th RCM North Atlantic {{was held}} in Hamburg (Germany) 14 - 18 September 2015. The main purpose of the RCM is to {{coordinate}} the National Programmes (NP) of the Member States (MS) in the North Atlantic region. National Programmes for 2011 - 2013 have been rolled over for the period 2014 - 2016. Therefore, the main focus at this year was to improve regional data collection, analysis and storage and the evolution towards Regional Coordination Groups (RCG). The impact of {{the introduction of the}} landing obligation and preparations for its implementation was also discussed taking into account possible changes in scientific sampling schemes. The participation of four National Correspondents make possible to address National administration issues related to the oncoming EU MAP. A data call was launched by the chairs of the RCM NA, RCM Baltic and RCM NS&EA where MS were requested to upload data for 2014 in the regional database (RDB Fishframe) hosted by ICES. All MS except France and Northern Ireland complied with this request on landings and effort data. All MS except France uploaded sample data for 2014. French data were available for the meeting using a web base interface. Evaluation of the data call for submission data to the RDB revealed the numbers of species in landings and sample data and the numbers of metiers in effort data are in general data stable. RCM NA see big improvements in the work MS are doing regarding data calls coming from a situation where some countries didn´t provide any data to a new scenario where everyone is providing data; {{at the same time the}} overall quality has significantly improved, which is a large step forward. Regional data collection, analysis, storage and the evolution towards Regional Coordination Groups (RCG). Optimizing and harmonizing fisheries management across MS is dependent on improving regional coordination. The group discussed various needs and aspects relevant for facilitating future work of the RCM. Future tasks for the RCM don’t differ much from the current tasks. The discussion was focused on the structure of the RCGs, funding and short term needs to address tasks in an efficient way in the future. Regional coordination encompasses many different aspects, ranging from regional cooperation, sampling design, quality control procedures, data storage and analysis to the actual coordination, reporting and accountancy. Current task sharing and coordination procedures as well as future mechanisms are partially covered under the current MARE study 2014 / 19 (FISHPI). The project and its progress were presented to the group. The outcomes of this study will demonstrate future procedures based on case studies. As substantial effort and costs are involved to facilitate the process of regional coordination, the group highlighted the importance to access to budgets to cover these costs. Development of the RDB is also crucial for future work of the RCGs; funds are needed for the development. Additionally, RCM NA identified 4 supra regional topics where work can be done intersesionally in cooperation with the rest of RCMs: (1) Cost sharing of funding surveys; (2) Impact of landing obligation; (3) reviewing the ICES list of data needs; and (4) review and follow up on RDB upload logs. Due to the importance to moving to a regional catch sampling scheme, an exercise was realised using the distribution of landings by harbour and <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> as a proxy of sampling frames that could hypothetically operate in a regional probability based design. The exercise was based on landing weight, for the simple reason that this was the only complete variable that was available for all the various national data sets. A regional sampling design can however be optimized in any number of ways (e. g. by landings value, by métier diversity, by species diversity, by number of fishing trips). The aims and aspirations of the end users need to be defined to ascertain which is most appropriate. It is one of the overriding advantages of a regional sampling design (as opposed to the aggregation of national designs) that the overall coverage can be set out to achieve regional goals. The RCM NA analyzed and discussed the main achievements of WKISCON 2. It was clear that concurrent sampling at-sea is a long-established practice in most MS and that, where it was applied, concurrent sampling of fishing trips on-shore resulted in substantial increases in species collected without jeopardizing the main uses of data. Stock assessment and discard estimation and management are the major current uses of concurrent sampling data. Concurrent sampling has also been providing other benefits than its initial reason, such as advice to local, national and international authorities, research on MSFD descriptors, mixed fisheries and gear interactions and on mortality of rare species, data-poor stocks and PETS. It was clear that concurrent sampling being a statistically valid method for species selection which has proven to fulfil different end-users needs, implementation constraints hinder concurrent sampling on-shore. Thus, in order to meet end-users needs and to overcome the constraints that may arise from the implementation of concurrent sampling in some countries, particularly on-shore, RCM NA considers that different statistically sound approaches other than concurrent sampling must be developed to be tested in the field, so they may provide useful alternatives. Introduction of the landing obligation and its impact in the implementation in scientific sampling schemes. In terms of evaluating the impact of the introduction of the Landing Obligation (LO) regulation on data collection, there is only limited experience as the current implementation only covers Pelagic and Industrial fisheries in this region but MS have or are preparing for the implementation where they can. It is currently perceived that this year is a transition period for the pelagic fisheries and that these fisheries and control agencies are not fully implementing the LO (managing but not enforcing). As a result MS did not have a lot of comments on the current year and are in general preparing for next year. During the meeting it was decided to gather further information to address this issue by getting member states who were present to fill in a table on “Monitoring the impact of the landing obligation on data collection in the North Atlantic region” outlining the current state of play. This table could be considered as a live document which should be filled in year by year as the Landing Obligation is phased in. This table will then serve to provide an historical record as countries can document the changes year by year and will also provide guidance and act as a learning tool to all member states on how other countries are implementing the LO. National administrations The group discussed the proposal for task sharing and criteria for joint surveys. RCM NS&EA and RCM NA 2014 discussed a cost model for the present joint MS financed surveys and for future joint surveys. In addition to this model, the RCM NA 2015 highlighted that four categories of surveys should be considered in relation to task sharing and criteria for joint surveys. In the light of cost sharing, the group commented that the current DCF recast proposal refers to ‘exploitation of stocks’ rather than EU TAC or landings. Given the relative stability, EU TAC shares are the preferred basis for sharing costs. The exploitation of stocks shall be interpreted as EU-TAC share as a default. In specific cases, RCGs can in the future agree on different interpretation where needed and feasible. Fully agreement among the group was concerning to the engagement and participation of National Correspondent (NC) in this meeting. The future role of the NCs in the RCG context was discussed, indicating a formal role for the NCs in the RCG process to approve and agree on regional arrangements. However, the current recast of the DCF doesn’t include the formal involvement of the NCs in the coordination procedures and meetings. RCM NA highlights this as potentially problematic for the foreseen formal role of the NCs. Other items on the agenda were the consideration of the follow up of relevant recommendations made last years by Liaison Meeting and presentations and relevant development from ICES, EC and SC-RDB...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the spatiotemporal {{behavior}} of fishermen at the fleet scale is key for defining effective strategies for fisheries management. Here we classify the spatial patterns exhibited by fishing trip trajectories in the world's largest monospecific fishery, the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Our {{goal is to}} identify spatial strategies and their possible changes over 2000 - 2009. The data comprise more than 350, 000 fishing trips, recorded using a vessel monitoring system. On-board observers monitored {{a small fraction of}} those trips (> 2000), providing data for inferring the type of activity (fishing, searching, and cruising) from the position records, for use in a state-space model. Each fishing trip was characterized by its duration, maximum distance to the coast, geographical extension, and time spent fishing, searching and cruising. Using clustering techniques, we identified four types of fishing trips, associated with differences in management among regions, <b>fleet</b> <b>segments,</b> and skippers' behavior. The methodology could be used to investigate fishing spatial strategies using VMS trajectories in other fisheries...|$|E
40|$|As {{with many}} shrimp fisheries, the North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery has been characterised by {{by-catch}} and discarding of juvenile fish {{species that are}} of value to other <b>fleet</b> <b>segments.</b> To offset this externality, the mandatory use of veil nets or separator panels was introduced in 2003 for all vessels using an aggregate beam length of more than 8 [*]m. Sea trials prior to this date suggested that retained catch might be reduced by between 8 % and 35 %, depending on the area and season. These studies, however, do not consider the behavioural response by fishers to reduce this impact. In this study, the actual impact of the restrictions on the productivity of UK Crangon vessels was estimated using a production frontier approach. The ex post analysis suggests that a productivity decline of around 14 % has been experienced by UK vessels adopting this gear. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors.
