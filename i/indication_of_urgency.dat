Due to {{the high}} density and {{importance}} of speech in most workplaces, practical sonification systems should be designed to complement and synergize with, rather than compete with, language. The multiple-message, high- dimensional channel of voice quality (such as prosody in speech, and similar communication systems in animals) is held out as one way of achieving such synergy. Systems that exploit the vocal channel can run, and be interpreted, in parallel with speech and require little training to learn. I will present some examples of biological sounds, full of acoustic parameters ready for appropriate interpretation by humans, and with an available bandwidth more than adequate for many practical sonification applications. These span the biological spectrum from frogs to dogs and birds. I will briefly discuss the principles underlying vertebrate vocal production {{and how they can}} be modelled in silico. While pitch can be useful, timbre is argued to be more flexible and multidimensional for sonification purposes. The example of formant frequencies as cues to individuality and size, and variability as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> are given as examples. Temporal cues, particularly rhythm, provide a rich and structured multidimensional channel that can be easily implemented vocally. Physical models of vocal production systems, of animals, real or imagined, provided a rich framework for exploration in sonification. And they are fun...|$|E
40|$|Over 100 {{family members}} were interviewed—individually and in focus groups—to gain a picture of their lived {{experience}} and their perspective on reform of Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s mental health system. The thesis looks at needs of families in two ways. ﬁrst, by examining the common themes of their experience with the mental health system and with supporting 2 ̆ 2 consumers 2 ̆ 2 in the community; and second, by asking families directly about their satisfaction with existing supports, and about needed additional supports. Focus group {{participants were asked to}} make suggestions about innovative models to meet unmet need, and about how families could participate more fully in the mental health system as a 2 ̆ 2 stakeholder 2 ̆ 2. The results provided a picture of families‘ needs and strengths, on an individual and collective basis. Common themes which emerged pertained to a number of different aspects of family experience. First of all, the research documented the struggle to 2 ̆ 2 engage 2 ̆ 2 the mental health system, families found various barriers and facilitating factors in interpreting the presence of a mental health problem, looking for potential sources of help, and then actually accessing supports from the formal mental health care system. The thesis showed the sometimes dire consequences when help was not forthcoming, or was altogether inaccessible. Secondly, family experience with institutional care was documented, showing a wide divergence of perceptions of quality. Negative perceptions were associated with the intimidating hospital atmosphere, criticisms of the medical model, and instances of neglect and abuse. Positive (or ambivalent) perceptions were associated with family respite, 2 ̆ 2 stabilization 2 ̆ 2 and improvement of the consumer, and speciﬁc instances of humane or perceptive care giving. Also, several barriers to families’ goal of informed, active involvement with care were shown, along with successful strategies of becoming involved. Next, families described several themes pertaining to their relative 2 ̆ 7 s transition to the community, and his or her connection with ongoing community resources Descriptions of the actual transition process revealed, again, lack of family involvement, instances of premature discharge (with questionable hospital motives), and lack of assistance with the transition to community life, including connection to ongoing resources. Families made speciﬁc comments about the existence and appropriateness of housing, vocational support, income maintenance, and social support. A common theme here was families‘ criticism that supports were designed in such a way to prevent integration in the different aspects of community life. Various struggles which family members faced on a day to day basis were documented, including disruption of daily work routines, of social and family life, of future hopes and plans, and of the mental health of other family members. The thesis also documented ways in which people had adapted to and changed their situation for the better. Personal resources, and assistance from family support groups were significant in this regard. Satisfaction ratings of existing supports revealed that families on the whole were somewhere between 2 ̆ 2 neutral 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 somewhat satisﬁed 2 ̆ 2 with formal resources They were 2 ̆ 2 somewhat satisﬁed 2 ̆ 2 with informal resources, such as the support of family and friends. Ratings of needed new resources, as inferred by frequency of listings, revealed that vocational assistance, information/referral, and housing were top priority for family members. Quantitative and qualitative material was then synthesized to give a broader context to family needs. The qualitative themes indicative of need (for example, lack of information about available resources) were matched with appropriate quantitative ratings, thus providing an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> of the need, then, key recommendations were included which were made by families as to how that need could or should be met. A ﬁnal section provides a dynamic picture of needs by showing how each changes {{in the course of the}} families’ experience with different components of the mental health system, and how each changes as individual and collective family strengths manifest themselves...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We studied seven {{hydropower}} license consultations {{to examine}} {{the role of a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to reach agreement. Hydropower licensing consultations were studied because the statutory requirement for consultation encourages negotiation, all such consultations are similar, and a negotiated settlement is not a foregone result. Cases selected for analysis met screening criteria. Structured interviews were conducted with participants after the negotiations had been concluded. Respondent recollections were checked against the documentary record. A sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to reach agreement was a significant factor in the completion of these negotiations; where there was no shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> purposeful delay adversely affected the negotiations. Although a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was experienced by at least one party in each case, only a shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> {{at the end of the}} process proved significant. Delay did not prevent ultimate agreement but a shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> brought speedier agreement and greater satisfaction with the negotiation...|$|R

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is the therapy {{of choice in}} many hematological malignant and non-malignant diseases by using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched siblings as stem cell source but only {{one third of the}} patients will have HLA-matched siblings. Hence, physicians rely on the availability of matched unrelated donors (URD). The possibility of finding a matched URD is now more than 70 % due to continuous expansion of URD registries around the world. The use of URD in adult patients is steadily increasing and in the last 8 years has superseded the numbers of matched sibling donor transplants and has become the most commonly used stem cell source. There is also an increasing trend to use peripheral blood (PB) stem cells rather than bone marrow (BM) stem cells. Outcomes following URD transplants depend mainly upon the <b>indication</b> and <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> transplant, age and comorbidities of recipients, cytomegalovirus (CMV) matching/mismatching between donor and the recipient, and degree of HLA matching. In some studies outcome of unrelated stem cell transplants in terms of treatment-related mortality (TRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) is comparable to sibling donors...|$|R

This exploratory study examined the relationship between superintendents' perceived sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and student academic performance. More specifically, the study examined the leadership of Missouri superintendents based upon a district's Annual Performance Report. The Missouri Annual Performance Report ranks districts from highest to lowest with the following designations: performance with distinction; full waiver; limited waiver; provisionally accredited; and, unaccredited. This study focused only on the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in the districts performing with distinction, performing with a full waiver, and performing with a limited waiver due to limited sample size in the lower levels of provisionally accredited and unaccredited. A total of 98 superintendents in Missouri were included in this study. Quantitative data were collected using survey responses. Superintendents responded to items about their perceptions of their own sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance, the source <b>of</b> their <b>urgency,</b> their purposeful communication <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> their perceptions <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in district stakeholders, and the strategies used to communicate the urgency. Data from the surveys were analyzed using analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and step-wise linear regression. Superintendents in districts performing with a limited waiver reported a significantly stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance than did superintendents in districts performing with distinction {{at the end of the}} first year in their position as superintendent. Superintendents in districts with a limited waiver also reported a significantly stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance than did superintendents in districts performing with distinction at the time of the survey. Superintendents in districts with a limited waiver purposefully communicated significantly more often than superintendents in districts performing with distinction with boards of education. In addition, superintendents in districts with a limited waiver purposefully communicated significantly more frequently with all district teachers than superintendents in districts performing with distinction. Superintendents leading districts performing with a limited waiver and superintendents leading districts with a full waiver identified an impending crisis to communicate a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance significantly more often than superintendents leading districts performing with distinction. Through regression analysis, Providing Opportunities for Success, Identifying an Impending Crisis, Setting Goals and Targets, and Utilizing Data were communication strategies significantly associated with the degree to which the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance increased throughout the district. Regression findings also implied that utilizing the communication strategy "providing opportunities for success" could increase the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> for boards <b>of</b> education, district administrators, building principals, teacher leaders, all district teachers and the media. Throughout this study it was evident that superintendents leading districts with a limited waiver, which indicates lower student academic performance, reported a stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student achievement than did their counterparts in higher performing districts. These superintendents purposefully communicated a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> more often and they used the communication strategy of "identifying an impending crisis" more frequently to increase a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> across their districts than did superintendents in districts with higher student performance. In addition, when superintendents utilize the communication strategy of "providing opportunities for success," which includes actions such as articulating a vision and implementing a purposeful school improvement process, an increase in a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student achievement is more likely to occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} in the acoustic structure of alarm calls appears to convey information about the level <b>of</b> response <b>urgency</b> in some species, while in others it seems to denote the type of predator. While theoretical models and studies on species with functionally referential calls have emphasized that any animal signal considered to have an external referent also includes motivational content, to our knowledge, no empirical study {{has been able to}} show this. In this paper, I present an example of a graded alarm call system that combines referential information and also information on the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> Acoustically different alarm calls in the social mongoose Suricata suricatta are given in response to different predator types, but their call structure also varies depending on the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> Low urgency calls tend to be harmonic across all predator types, while high urgency calls are noisier. There was less evidence for consistency in the acoustic parameters assigned to particular predator types across different levels <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> This suggests that, while suricates convey information about the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> along a general rule, the referential information about each category of predator type is not encoded in an obvious way...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{there has}} been a growth in the use of triage nurses to {{decrease}} general practitioner (GP) workloads and increase the efficiency of telephone triage. The actual safety of decisions made by triage nurses has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether triage nurses accurately estimate the <b>urgency</b> level <b>of</b> health complaints when using the national telephone guidelines, and {{to examine the relationship between}} the performance of triage nurses and their education and training. Method: A cross-sectional, multicentre, observational study employing five mystery (simulated) patients who telephoned triage nurses in four GP cooperatives. The mystery patients played standardised roles. Each role had one <b>of</b> four <b>urgency</b> levels as determined by experts. The triage nurses called were asked to estimate the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> after the contact. This level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was compared with a gold standard. RESULTS: Triage nurses estimated the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> 69 % of the 352 contacts correctly and underestimated the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> 19 % of the contacts. The sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> the <b>urgency</b> estimates provided by the triage nurses were found to be 0. 76 and 0. 95, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values <b>of</b> the <b>urgency</b> estimates were 0. 83 and 0. 93, respectively. A significant correlation was found between correct estimation <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and specific training on the use of the guidelines. The educational background (primary or secondary care) of the nurses had no significant relationship with the rate of underestimation. CONCLUSION: Telephone triage by triage nurses is efficient but possibly not safe, with potentially severe consequences for the patient. An educational programme for triage nurses is recommended. Also, a direct second safety check of all cases by a specially trained GP telephone doctor is advisable...|$|R

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Perhaps {{the most}} {{positive}} aspect of the current HVAC conditions at the Library involve {{the interest of the}} University Operations and Maintenance and their willingness to work with the Law Library to find solutions. This department has previously taken steps (such as the installation of a recording hygrometer) to address some of the issues in the Law Library. A second positive area is the interest in the Dean of the Law School to identify the funds necessary to make improvements. These are situations not found on every campus and they suggest that the Library 2 ̆ 7 s problems, no matter how large they may seem, can be brought under control. Equally positive is the interest in preservation {{on the part of the}} Library 2 ̆ 7 s director, Ann Puckett, Esq. I encourage the Library to maintain the current momentum. The Library does have a variety of serious problems relating to the current environmental conditions and to any efforts to achieve and maintain a preservation environment. Foremost among these problems are (1) the design of the current HVAC system, which is not intended to maintain adequate humidity control, (2) the absence of adequate moderate or long-term environmental monitoring records, and (3) the very poor level of building cleanliness. These problems are currently manifested in what appear to be high levels of mold in the building and a system which cannot adequately control the humidity level of the building and collections. It is likely that the solution to these issues will require a two pronged approach of capital improvement - - replacing and/ or modifying HVAC equipment - - and an overall building cleaning program - - sufficient to reduce the mold load in the collections. While delayed maintenance programs may be a necessary approach to classrooms and dorms, it is shortsighted to delay maintenance of the Library considering its houses a 19 + million investment in books and other educational materials. The loss or damage of this collection could create a situation from which the University would have trouble recovering. Every effort possible should be taken to protect this in vestment. For the bulk of the recommendations offered below there is also some <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> the proposed work. Virtually all of the proposed modifications and changes can be accomplished within a 5 -year plan and many are of such significance to the well-being of the collection that they should be implemented within the next year...|$|R
