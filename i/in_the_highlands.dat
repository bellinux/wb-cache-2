5|$|Along {{with several}} other roads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands,</b> the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E

5|$|Zebu, {{a form of}} humped cattle, were {{introduced}} to the island around 1000CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought sorghum, goats, possibly Bambara groundnut, and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted {{a major part of the}} pastoralists' diet. Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlands.</b> Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo (ruled 1575–1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlands</b> prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured polities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlands.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{resurgence}} of malaria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> African <b>highlands</b> have been subject of debate. Because vector abundance is important for malaria transmission, gaining {{a better understanding of}} vector biology is a key to understanding <b>the</b> mechanisms of <b>highland</b> malaria. We studied vector productivity <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> <b>highland</b> environment and compared productivity between lowland and highland sites. We found lower vector productivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highland</b> and <b>in</b> wetlands where <b>the</b> temperature was lower. Immature stage development time was significantly longer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highland</b> site. Development time was significantly shorter in aquatic habitats in cultivated areas than in wetlands, and survival rate was significantly higher in cultivated areas. Fecundity was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highland</b> site. These findings suggest that changes in local temperature and land use contribute to an increase of malaria vectors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highland...</b>|$|R

5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher ground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and Southern Uplands providing sediment {{to the surrounding}} basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E

5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{styles of}} {{architecture}} in Madagascar have been impacted {{over the past}} two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> began during the reign of Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the London Missionary Society and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and French colonization of the island in 1896. Modernization {{over the past several decades}} has increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related to the external orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands.</b> Among those with means, foreign construction materials and techniques – namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features – have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>highlands</b> and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This {{cessation}} in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

In comparison to the densely urbanised region that the King's Regiment encompassed in north-west England, the Cameron Highlanders area of recruitment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> was sparsely populated. Although it had its numerical designation omitted, the battalion's identity was preserved and headquarters at Fraser Street, Liverpool were retained. During a royal visit to Liverpool in 1938, George VI presented the battalion with new colours at Everton Football Club's Goodison Park stadium.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, average {{temperatures}} began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting {{the extent of}} arable agriculture, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Highlands.</b> The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought innovations in agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, particularly in the Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By the late Middle Ages, Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.|$|E
