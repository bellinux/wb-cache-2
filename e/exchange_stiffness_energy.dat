Since the widely accepted analytic expression of the switching current density {{is based on the}} macro-spin model, there is no dependence of the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> constant. When the switching is occurred, however, the spin configuration forms C-, S-type, or complicated domain structures. Since the spin configuration is determined by the shape anisotropy and the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> constant, the switching current density is very sensitive on their variations. It implies that there are more rooms for the optimization of the switching current density with by controlling the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> constant, which is determined by composition and the detail fabrication processes...|$|R
40|$|The <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness,</b> Aex, {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} controlling magnetization {{reversal in}} magnetic materials but is very difficult to measure, especially in thin films. We developed a new technique for measuring the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a magnetic material based on the formation of a spin spiral within two antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic films [1]. Using this method, I was able to measure the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> of thin film Co alloyed with Cr, Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru. The results of this work showed that the rate at which a substituent element reduces the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> is not directly related to its effect on the magnetization of the alloy. These measured trends have been understood by combining measurements of element specific magnetic moments obtained using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and material specific modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA). The experimental results also hint at significant reduction of the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> at the interface that can account for the difference between our results and those obtained on bulk materials...|$|R

40|$|We {{measure the}} {{frequencies}} of spin waves in nm-thick perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB systems, and model the frequencies to deduce the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> of this material in the ultrathin limit. For this, we embody the layers in magnetic tunnel junctions patterned into circular nanopillars of diameters ranging from 100 to 300 nm and we use magneto-resistance to determine which rf-current frequencies are efficient in populating the spin wave modes. Micromagnetic calculations indicate that the ultrathin nature of the layer and the large wave vectors used ensure that the spin wave frequencies are predominantly determined by the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness,</b> such {{that the number of}} modes in a given frequency window can be used to estimate the exchange. For 1 nm layers the experimental data are consistent with an <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> A= 20 pJ/m, which is slightly lower that its bulk counterpart.

40|$|Using the spin-spiral {{formulation}} of the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital method, the principal components of the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> tensor are calculated for typical hard magnets including tetragonal CoPt-type and hexagonal YCo 5 alloys. The <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> is strongly anisotropic in all studied alloys. This anisotropy makes the domain wall surface tension anisotropic. Competition between this anisotropic surface tension and magnetostatic energy controls the formation and dynamics of nanoscale domain structures in hard magnets. Anisotropic domain wall bending is described in detail from the general {{point of view and}} with application to cellular Sm-Co magnets. It is shown that the repulsive cell-boundary pinning mechanism in these magnets is feasible only due to the anisotropic <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> if suitably oriented initial pinning centers are available.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from August 9, 2016 - August 9, 2018 Magnetic thin films have potential to improve devices such as on-chip inductors, and enable new technologies such as {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM). The use of magnetic cores in on-chip inductors is typically limited to applications well under 1 GHz. At higher frequencies, the performance of the magnetic core is severely limited by eddy current losses and ferromagnetic resonance. This work investigates the feasibility of using shape anisotropy to increase the ferromagnetic resonance frequency and thus allow the use of thin-film magnetic cores at frequencies up to 3 GHz. Magnetic cores are fabricated on top of existing chip- scale inductors. The effect of core shape and oxide layers, which are added to reduce eddy currents, on the magnetic properties of the film are investigated. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are of interest in MRAM and spintronic logic circuit ap- plications due to their non-volatility, low-power operation, and size scalability. One limitation to the creation of scalable magnetic random access memory is thermal stability. For large devices, this energy barrier is proportional to the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a material. Typically the thermal stability is measured in fabricated MRAM devices, and is used to back-calculate the exchange stiff- ness. This work presents a novel approach which uses images of magnetic domains, in conjunction with vibrating sample magnetometer and ferromagnetic resonance measurements, to measure the <b>exchange</b> <b>stiffness</b> in unpatterned films. This allows for estimation of the thermal stability that can be obtained by a given magnetic free layer without need to fabricate and measure completed de- vices.
