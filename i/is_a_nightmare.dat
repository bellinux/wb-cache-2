500|$|Even though {{improvements}} {{were made}} the ground suffered problems when hosting large crowds, due to narrow surrounding streets and {{a shortage of}} turnstiles. A reporter for the Manchester Football News summarised the access problems: [...] "The croft <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> in wet weather, and altogether the approach is easily the worst of any I know". On occasion, further problems occurred inside the ground as well as outside. A 1913 cup tie against Sunderland drew a crowd officially recorded as 41,709, but believed to be significantly higher. An hour before kick-off the gates were closed, with many ticket-holders unable to gain admission. The crowd was so large that once the match kicked off the crowd began to spill onto the pitch, a problem which worsened as the game progressed. Sunderland's Charles Buchan recalled that [...] "Before half-time they were three or four yards inside the touchlines." [...] A Sunderland goal in the 58th minute caused further encroachment, forcing the referee to abandon the match. An FA inquiry into the events on the terraces gave rise to debate {{on the issue of}} crowd control at sporting events. Use of mounted police was a particularly contentious issue, the chairman of the committee asking [...] "If the ball struck a horse, and the creature plunged among the people, who was to be held responsible for any injuries that might accrue?" ...|$|E

Revealing the news whilst interviewed on talk show Loose Women, Lane said that the pair would meet off-screen in Tenerife. Though she had not read the scripts, Lane thought they would be [...] "a really good combination". Coronation Street publicity said it would make [...] "exciting viewing" [...] for fans. They further stated: [...] "Kylie and David are trouble as individuals so the thought {{of the two of them}} getting together <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> prospect for both their families [...] there is no end to the trouble they will cause for everyone." [...] Lane also revealed that the storyline was implemented because there was no other plausible way for Kylie to return. They did not carry on with the scenario with Becky and Steve, because the viewers needed [...] "something new". Lane was happy with the direction of the storyline because it paved the way for more [...] "explosive" [...] material. Kylie was also tipped to be the one in control of the relationship. She also acknowledged that certain aspects of their relationship would mirror Becky and Steve's relationship, in the sense that when Kylie is with David, a [...] "loved up" [...] nicer side to Kylie surfaces.|$|E

Norwood revealed that Mercy is shocked by the proposal, adding [...] "Mercy thinks he's lost his marbles, but soon comes round to the idea. Fatboy reckons that this isn't about his feelings, it's all about keeping her in the UK. Of course, he's also hoping that if she stays, maybe she'll end up liking him {{in the way he}} likes her. [...] You can get into a lot of trouble for , ut all Fatboy can think is, 'How can I save Mercy?' She's the girl he loves." [...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E

60|$|This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> hypothesis, but the {{difficulties}} of the practical problem seem to warrant its entertainment. The {{number of people in}} Russia who can even read and write is extremely small, the need to get them employed industrially as rapidly as possible is very great, hence the system of education which develops out of this situation cannot be very ambitious or enlightened. Further it will have to continue over a sufficiently long period of time to allow of the risk of its becoming stable and traditional. In adult education already the pupil comes for a short period, learns Communism, reading and writing--there is hardly time to give him much more--and returns to leaven the army or his native village. In achieving this the Bolsheviks are already doing a very important and valuable work, but they cannot hope for a long while to become the model of public instruction which they have hitherto been represented to be. And the conditions of their becoming so ultimately are adherence to their ideals through a very long period of stress, and a lessening of fanaticism in their Communist teaching, conditions which, unhappily, seem to be mutually incompatible.|$|E

6000|$|The {{brain of}} man {{is subject to}} short and strange snatches of sleep. A cloud seals the city of reason or rests upon the sea of imagination; a dream that darkens as much, whether it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> of atheism or a {{daydream}} of idolatry. And just as we have all sprung from sleep with a start and found ourselves saying some sentence that has no meaning, save in the mad tongues of the midnight; so the human mind starts from its trances of stupidity with some complete phrase upon its lips; a complete phrase which is a complete folly. Unfortunately {{it is not like}} the dream sentence, generally forgotten in the putting on of boots or the putting in of breakfast. This senseless aphorism, invented when man's mind was asleep, still hangs on his tongue and entangles all his relations to rational and daylight things. All our controversies are confused by certain kinds of phrases which are not merely untrue, but were always unmeaning; which are not merely inapplicable, but were always intrinsically useless. We recognise them wherever a man talks of [...] "the survival of the fittest," [...] meaning only the survival of the survivors; or wherever a man says that the rich [...] "have a stake in the country," [...] as if the poor could not suffer from misgovernment or military defeat; or where a man talks about [...] "going on towards Progress," [...] which only means going on towards going on; or when a man talks about [...] "government by the wise few," [...] as if they could be picked out by their pantaloons.

60|$|I think I should {{manifest}} {{an energy}} more becoming {{a child of}} yours if I were to sustain my nodding head at least enough longer to scrawl the initial words of my usual letter: we are travellers {{in the midst of}} travel. You heard from me last at Innsbrück--or rather, I think, at Botzen, just before, a place beautiful by nature but most ugly by man; and [we] came by an admirable five hours' run through the remnant of the Tyrol to Munich, where we spent two rather busy days. It's a singular place and one difficult to write of with a serious countenance. It has a fine lot of old pictures, but otherwise it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> of pretentious vacuity: a city of chalky stucco--a Florence and Athens in canvas and planks. To have come [thither] from Venice is a sensation! We found reality at last at Nüremburg, by which place, combined with this, it seemed a vast pity not to proceed rather than by stupid Stuttgart. Nüremburg is excellent--and comparisons are odious; but I would give a thousand N.'s for one ray of Verona! We came on hither by a morning and noon of railway, which has not in the least prevented a goodly afternoon and evening at the Castle here. The castle (which I think you have all seen in your own travels) is an incomparable ruin and holds its own against any Italian memories. The light, the weather, the time, were all, this evening, most propitious to our visit. This rapid week in Germany has filled us with reflections and observations, tossed from the railway windows on our course, and irrecoverable at this late hour. To me this hasty and most partial glimpse of Germany has been most satisfactory; it has cleared from my mind the last mists of uncertainty and assured me that I can never hope to become an unworthiest adoptive grandchild of the fatherland. It is well to listen to the voice of the spirit, to cease hair-splitting and treat one's self to a good square antipathy--when it is so very sympathetic! I may 'cultivate' mine away, but it has given me a week's wholesome nourishment.|$|E

Pulvis et Umbra appeared in the April number, and was later included in the volume Across the Plains (1892). He wrote this particular essay with intense feeling. Writing to Sidney Colvin in December 1887, he said, [...] "I get along with my papers for Scribner not fast, nor so far specially well; only this last, the fourth one.... I do believe is pulled off after a fashion. It is a mere sermon: ... but it is true, and I find it touching and beneficial, to me at least; and I {{think there is some}} fine writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases. Pulvis et Umbra, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian Sermon, if I had wanted. Its sentiments, although parsonic, will not offend even you, I believe." [...] (Letters, II, 100.) Writing to Miss Adelaide Boodle in April 1888, he said, [...] "I wrote a paper the other day--Pulvis et Umbra;--I wrote it with great feeling and conviction: to me it seemed bracing and healthful, it is in such a world (so seen by me), that I am very glad to fight out my battle, and see some fine sunsets, and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the camp fire.

60|$|When the {{ordinary}} opponents of Socialism talk about impossibilities and alterations {{in human nature}} they always miss an important distinction. In modern ideal conceptions of society there are some desires that are possibly not attainable: {{but there are some}} desires that are not desirable. That all men should live in equally beautiful houses is a dream {{that may or may not}} be attained. But that all men should live in the same beautiful house is not a dream at all; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> That a man should love all old women is an ideal that may not be attainable. But that a man should regard all old women exactly as he regards his mother is not only an unattainable ideal, but an ideal which ought not to be attained. I do not know if the reader agrees with me in these examples; but I will add the example which has always affected me most. I could never conceive or tolerate any Utopia which did not leave to me the liberty for which I chiefly care, the liberty to bind myself. Complete anarchy would not merely make it impossible to have any discipline or fidelity; it would also make it impossible to have any fun. To take an obvious instance, it would not be worth while to bet if a bet were not binding. The dissolution of all contracts would not only ruin morality but spoil sport. Now betting and such sports are only the stunted and twisted shapes of the original instinct of man for adventure and romance, of which much has been said in these pages. And the perils, rewards, punishments, and fulfilments of an adventure must be real, or the adventure is only a shifting and heartless nightmare. If I bet I must be made to pay, or there is no poetry in betting. If I challenge I must be made to fight, or there is no poetry in challenging. If I vow to be faithful I must be cursed when I am unfaithful, or there is no fun in vowing. You could not even make a fairy tale from the experiences of a man who, when he was swallowed by a whale, might find himself at the top of the Eiffel Tower, or when he was turned into a frog might begin to behave like a flamingo. For the purpose even of the wildest romance results must be real; results must be irrevocable. Christian marriage is the great example of a real and irrevocable result; and that is why it is the chief subject and centre of all our romantic writing. And this is my last instance of the things that I should ask, and ask imperatively, of any social paradise; I should ask to be kept to my bargain, to have my oaths and engagements taken seriously; I should ask Utopia to avenge my honour on myself.|$|E
