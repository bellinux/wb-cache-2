40|$|Wide-field {{fluorescence}} microscope {{techniques such as}} single/selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) are typically configured to image large regions of a sample at once. Here the <b>illumination</b> <b>beam</b> provides uniform excitation of several biological features across the region, `sliced' to a thickness of between 5 - 10 microns. In this {{paper we propose a}} simple alteration to the optical configuration of a SPIM by switching the light-sheet- forming cylindrical lens with a spatial light modulator. This has the potential to adaptively reconfigure the light sheet geometry to improve the optical sectioning of specific biological features, rather than the thicker sectioning of several features at once across a larger observation field-of-view. We present a prototype version of such a system, referred to as an Adaptive-SPIM (A-SPIM) system. We then suggest that the direct recording of <b>illumination</b> <b>beam</b> shapes within the working microscope system can better facilitate the analysis and subsequent re-configuration of the <b>illumination</b> <b>beam</b> to a specific geometry, and summarise the design and operation of a device that we have developed specifically for this purpose.

40|$|Grazing {{incidence}} interferometers {{are used}} for integral fast and precise measuring of the cylinder form deviation of bores and shafts. Actual known systems operate in transmission and therefore require accessibility on both side of the work piece. This boundary condition restricts the spectrum of testable work pieces and demands stationary operating measuring instruments. A much higher application bandwidth can be achieved with a mobile sensor {{based on the same}} measuring principle and realised as a reflection set-up. In the research project, feasibility and limitations of such a system were examined. A sensor was conceived, designed, built and tested. It is moved to the work piece and measures the cylinder form deviation of a bore by dipping in one side of the work piece. The sensor possesses a compact set-up to a coaxial <b>illumination</b> and observation <b>beam</b> <b>path,</b> which are both folded several times, and the use of special, highly precise manufactured optical components. An operational check of the sensor was performed measuring a test cylinder and a cylinder liner of a automotive crankcase. Limitations were estimated and know-how regarding set-up, functional behaviour and adjustment of such a system was conceived. A mobile sensor configured according to the examined principle in connection with handling equipment, coordinate measuring machines or integrated in an individual stationary base is suitable for the fast, integral and exact measuring of cylinder form deviations of bores in a manufacturing environment. It has the potential to drastically improve the present inspection technique regarding accuracy, measuring time and predicate security. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceOne of main {{challenges}} in light-sheet microscopy is {{to design the}} light-sheet as extended and thin as possible - extended to cover a large field of view, thin to optimize resolution and contrast.
