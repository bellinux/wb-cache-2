5|$|Meanwhile, an invigorated Walter ventures out to Chinatown {{to find a}} herbalist for his research; {{unaware of}} the clerk's {{connection}} to the case, Walter casually mentions the giant worms. Walter manages to lose Astrid (Jasika Nicole), who was sent to follow him out of worry {{for his ability to}} travel alone. She goes back to the lab, but is attacked by Triad gang members intent on getting back the remaining worms. Unaware of this, a distraught Walter becomes lost and wastes all his bus money on wrong phone numbers, causing Peter to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> him up. Olivia talks to Jarvis, who finally admits to being aware of the medicine. She tells Olivia the whereabouts of the incoming ship, but they find it already empty. Peter and Walter return to the herbalist shop and discover the remaining passengers. The FBI storms in and the survivors are sent to the hospital for care. Feeling remorseful about the trouble he caused, Walter injects himself with a tracking implant and gives Peter the transponder.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the NK 6th Division {{was ordered}} to await {{reinforcements}} before continuing the attack. From north to south, the division had its 13th, 15th, and 14th Regiments. The first replacements arrived at Chinju on about August 12. Approximately 2,000 unarmed South Koreans conscripted in the Seoul area joined the division by August 15. At Chinju, the NK 6th Division issued them grenades and told the recruits they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up weapons from killed and wounded soldiers on the battlefield. Another group of 2,500 replacements conscripted in the Seoul area joined the 6th Division on August 21, bringing the division's strength to approximately 8,500 men. In {{the last week of}} August and the first week of September, 3,000 more recruits conscripted in southwest Korea joined the division. The 6th Division used this last body of recruits in labor details and only later employed them as combat troops. As a part of the North Korean build-up in the south, the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan with another 10,000 men. The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear.|$|E

5000|$|Picking oakum was {{a common}} {{occupation}} in Victorian times in British prisons and workhouses. In 1862, girls under 16 at Tothill Fields Bridewell <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> 1 lb a day, and boys under 16 <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> 1+1/2 lb. Over the age of 16, girls and boys <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> 1+1/2 and 2 lb per day respectively. The oakum was sold for £4 10s ( [...] in modern money) per hundredweight (100 - 112 lb). At Coldbath Fields Prison, the men's counterpart to Tothill Fields, prisoners <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> 2 lb per day unless sentenced to hard labour, in which case they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> between 3 and 6 lb of oakum per day.|$|R

Upon picking of the jury after listening {{to all of the}} jurors we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick,</b> if we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a black juror I recommend that [...] be one of the jurors."

Their {{families}} {{meet at the}} engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as {{he does not want}} to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon after the death of his step-father.|$|E

The 6th Division used this last body of recruits in labor details at first and only later employed them as combat troops. The South Korean conscripts were often forcibly taken from their homes by North Korean troops, and typically held very weak morale. The North Koreans realized they presented a weakness in the lines but were unable to acquire men using other means. The North Koreans placed rear-guard troops behind the conscripts' formations, who would threaten to shoot them if they attempted to defect, desert or surrender their positions.|$|E
5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in {{the availability of a}} shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed to be completed in a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up an object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a bag or an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E

25|$|There were no {{sports teams}} for girls {{when she was}} in high school, but she played a number of sports {{including}} basketball, in rec leagues and pickup. When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. As she entered her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make sure she would be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> her.|$|E
25|$|The {{supplement}} of {{an interior}} angle is called an exterior angle, that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair of angles. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending {{one of the}} two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.|$|E

500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the pieces {{for her in the}} end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|In May 1970, Clancy {{was traded}} by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming. [...] Clancy had begun a {{business}} selling {{real estate in}} Miami during the offseason, {{but he also had}} ties to Green Bay. [...] He had attended St. Matthew's Grade School there in the 1950s. [...] Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade: [...] "I don't like to leave Miami. [...] You hate to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up and move and I definitely plan to come back (to Miami) in the offseason. [...] But most of my dad's family are still up in Green Bay.

She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
