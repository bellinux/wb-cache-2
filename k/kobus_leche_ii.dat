40|$|Background: Two {{types of}} lechwe antelopes {{exclusively}} exist {{in their natural}} ecosystems in Zambia; the Black lechwe (<b>Kobus</b> <b>leche</b> smithemani) and the Kafue lechwe (<b>Kobus</b> <b>leche</b> kafuensis). Despite inhabiting similar ecosystems, tuberculosis {{has been reported in}} Kafue lechwe without its documentation in Black lechwe antelopes. However, the past few decades have seen a drastic decline in both lechwe populations. Whereas studies have postulated that infectious diseases such as tuberculosis are having a negative impact on the Kafue lechwe population, no information is available on Black lechwe antelopes. Thus this study was conducted to investigate tuberculosis in Black lechwe antelopes of the Bangweulu swamps in comparison with the Kafue lechwe antelopes of Lochinvar. Findings: A total of 44 lechwe antelopes (Black (n = 30) : Kafue (n = 14) were sampled from Bangweulu and Lochinvar respectively. A positive case was defined with findings of gross lesions with Ziehl Nielsen and culture confirmation. Out of the 14 animals examined in Lochinvar, 21. 4 % [95 % CI: 15. 4, 44. 4 %] had necropsy lesions consistent with tuberculosis. The corresponding samples from 30 Black lechwe of Bangweulu yielded negative results on all the three tests. Conclusions: Current findings from this study intimate the possible absence of tuberculosis in Black lechwe antelopes whilst confirming the presence of tuberculosis in Kafue lechwe of the Kafue basin. The absence of tuberculosis in the Black lechwe suggests that the observed population decline may not be caused by tuberculosis. However, without detailed molecular epidemiological studies {{it is not possible to}} determine the association of M. bovis infection in sympatric animal populations. The possible role of transmission of tuberculosis between wildlife and cattle is discussed herein. Finding...|$|R

Uniquely for a cave fill in the Witwatersrand hominin-bearing sites, the sediments are horizontally stratified and form a number of flowstone bound sequences.

50|$|Shoebills {{are largely}} piscivorous but are assured predators of a {{considerable}} range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) and Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus) {{as well as}} various Tilapia species and catfish, the latter mainly in the genus Clarias. Other prey eaten by this species has included frogs, water snakes, Nile monitors (Varanus niloticus) and baby crocodiles. More rarely, turtles, snails, rodents and small waterfowl have reportedly been eaten. There exists a single report of shoebills feeding on lechwe (<b>Kobus</b> <b>leche)</b> calves, although this would need confirmation. Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than other large wading birds. Fish eaten by this species are commonly {{in the range of}} 15 to 50 cm long and weigh around 500 g, though lungfish of as much as 1 m have been attacked. Snakes preyed upon are commonly from 50 to 60 cm long. In the Bangweulu Swamps of Zambia, the main prey items fed to young by the parents consisted of the catfish Clarias gariepinus (syn. C. mossambicus) and water snakes. In Uganda, lungfish and catfish were mainly fed to the young. The big beak is sometimes used to dig into pond-bottom mud to extract lungfish from their aestivation burrows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Kafue lechwe (<b>Kobus</b> <b>leche</b> Kafuensis), a {{medium-sized}} semi-aquatic antelope, is endemic to the Kafue basin of Zambia. The {{population of the}} Kafue lechwe has significantly dropped in the last decades leading to its subsequent inclusion on the red list of endangered species. In order to save the remaining population from extinction, {{it has become increasingly}} important that the impact of parasite infection and infestation on the Kafue lechwe is investigated. Findings Endoparasites accounted for the majority of parasites observed from a study of 40 Kafue lechwe occurring in the the Kafue basin. Amphistoma spp. were present in all animals examined, while Fasciola gigantica had a prevalence rate of 0. 525 (95 % CI: 0. 36 to 0. 69) and species of Schistosoma 0. 3 (95 % CI: 0. 15 to 0. 45). Among the ectoparasites, Strobiloestrous vanzyli, had a prevalence rate of 0. 15 (95 % CI: 0. 03 to 0. 27), while Rhipicephalus appendiculatus had a prevalence of 0. 075 (3 / 40). Our findings indicate that body condition was not influenced by the parasitic infestation in Kafue lechwe. There was no association between sex and parasitic burden (odds ratio = 0. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 8 - 1. 3). However, an association between age and parasitic burden was observed as older animals above 15 years were more likely to get parasite infections than those aged between 1 - 5 years (odds ratio = 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 4). Conclusion Overall, {{there was no evidence that}} parasitic infections and infestations adversely affected the lechwe population on the Kafue basin. These findings indicate that ecto- and endo-parasite infestation might not play a significant role in reducing the Kafue lechwe population on the Kafue basin. </p...|$|R
40|$|Black lechwe (<b>Kobus</b> <b>leche</b> smithemani) is a {{semi-aquatic}} {{medium sized}} antelope currently enlisted on the IUCN red list {{of endangered species}} and is only endemic to the Bangweulu basin of Zambia. Its population has significantly decreased due to floods that {{took place during the}} period 1930 - 1940 from over 250 000 - 15 000 leading the Zambian government to gazette all habitats of Black lechwe into state protected areas, and to establish urgent management strategies needed to save the remaining population from extinction. Using retrospective data, our findings show that the population has increased from 15 000 animals in 1954 to 55 632 in 2009. The current population is estimated at 34. 77 % (55 632 / 160 000) of the carrying capacity of the Bangweulu basin. Although the Black lechwe is one of the 42 species offered for consumptive utilization by the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA), only 0. 12 % and 0. 08 % of the current stock was offered for safari and resident hunting annually for the period 2005 - 2009, respectively. Annual quota utilization were estimated at 67 % (n= 37) and 81 % (n= 37) for safari and resident hunting, respectively. Hence, overall income obtained from utilization of Black lechwe is very low accounting for only 2. 1 % of the total revenue earned from wildlife utilization. Although the current population trend is showing a unit increase of 639 animals per year, it is still far below levels ideal for the lucrative utilization. In this study, we demonstrate that adverse ecological changes on wildlife species, can lead to their vulnerability and danger of extinction, and that their recovery to full carrying capacity may demand a considerable amount of tim...|$|R
