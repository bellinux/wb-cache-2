This paper presented the study on the natural characteristics of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> with SS-SS boundary condition using cylindrical shell model. Based on Sanders’ shell theory, the vibration differential equation was obtained by using the energy method. The displacement shape functions were assumed by beam functions in the axial direction and the trigonometric functions in the circumferential direction. The influences of length to radius ratio, thickness to radius ratio, circumferential wave number and pressure on natural characteristics were analyzed. In the end, the steady responses of the forced vibration for a specific pipe model were obtained and the modal shapes were illustrated to understand the break of the pipe.

50|$|The {{basic form}} of a {{wallpaper}} steamer is a semi-sealed container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water {{is added to the}} container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is sealed, the steam pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe.</b> At the end of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> is a flat plate about 30 cm square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{electronic}} skin; stretchable electronics; silver nanoweires; capacitive pressure sensor; electrode micro-structure Abstract: The novel <b>flexible</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor with skin-like stretchability {{and sensibility}} has attracted tremendous attention in academic and industrial world in recent years. And {{it also has}} demonstrated great potential in the applications of electronic skin and wearable devices. It is significant and challenging to develop a highly sensitive <b>flexible</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor with a simple, low energy consuming and low cost method. In this paper, the silver nanowires (AgNWs) as electrode material were synthesized by polyol process. The polydimethylsiloxane（PDMS）was chosen as a flexible substrate and polyimide（PI）film as dielectric layer. The AgNWs based electrode was prepared in two methods. One is coating the AgNWs on photographic paper followed by in situ PDMS curing. Another one is suction filtration of the AgNWs suspension followed by glass slide transfer and PDMS curing. Then the capacitive pressure sensor was packaged in a sandwich structure with two face to face electrodes and a PI film in the middle. The sensitivity of the sensor {{as well as the}} micro-structure of the electrodes was compared and studied. The results indicate that the roughness of the electrode based on AgNWs/PDMS micro-structure {{plays an important role in}} the sensitivity of sensor.
