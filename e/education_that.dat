5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's <b>education</b> <b>that</b> fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an <b>education</b> <b>that</b> follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

We study mean-variance plots of human capital assets. We compare the properties of human capital returns using a performance measure and by sing tests for mean-variance spanning.

Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of <b>education</b> <b>that,</b> taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E

That is, a marginal {{increase in the level}} of investment in human capital increases the variance of future earnings and consumption.|$|R

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of <b>Education</b> <b>that</b> housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E

Each class in kindergarten through group eight has 32students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 in kindergarten, 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in the early childhood program.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of <b>Education</b> <b>that</b> would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Connecticut, Allen had a {{frontier}} upbringing but also received an <b>education</b> <b>that</b> included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he {{became interested in}} the New Hampshire Grants, buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks {{led to the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys, whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in his capture by British authorities. First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships, he was paroled in New York City, and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her <b>education</b> <b>that</b> her parents decided that she was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E

5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular <b>Education</b> <b>that</b> stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church and}} state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E

5|$|John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) {{was born}} in Glasgow {{and worked in the}} city from 1834, playing an {{important}} part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture and based in Glasgow included Daniel Macnee (1806–82). He moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876. Other major figures who worked in portraiture included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William Quiller Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian <b>education</b> <b>that</b> would become common among Scottish artists of the later nineteenth century. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits before he finally moved to London in 1831. David Wilkie (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeded Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge {{of one of the most}} influential British artists of the century.|$|E

Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
