25|$|Open-label {{case series}} have {{suggested}} that primidone is effective {{in the treatment of}} epilepsy. Primidone has been compared to phenytoin, phenobarbital, mephobarbital, <b>ethotoin,</b> metharbital, and mephenytoin. In adult comparison trials, primidone {{has been found to be}} just as effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethotoin,</b> 3-ethyl-5-phenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione, is {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction}} of benzaldehyde oxynitrile, with urea or ammonium hydrocarbonate, which forms an intermediate urea derivative which on acidic conditions cyclizes to 5-phenylhydantoin. Alkylation of this product using ethyliodide leads to the formationof <b>ethotoin.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Ethotoin</b> is {{available}} in 250 mg tablets. It is taken orally in 4 to 6 divided doses per day, preferably after food.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ethotoin</b> (marketed as Peganone by Ovation) is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy. It is a hydantoin, similar to phenytoin.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} method is described for the quantitative determina tion of trimethadione, paramethadione, ethosuximide, metharbital, methsuxim-ide, phensuximide, mephenytoin, <b>ethotoin,</b> primidone and diazepam in serum. Gas chromatography, with temperature programming, is employed {{and each of}} the drugs or any combination of them may be assayed on a single specimen during a single rapid determination on 3 percent OV- 17 following chloroform extraction. Retention times relative to an internal standard (methyl myristate) are given. The recovery of the drugs is from 77 to 100 percent, the instrument response is linear for each drug, and the coefficients of variation are from 3 to 9 percent...|$|E
