5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita atkinsoniana grow {{on the ground}} in mixed {{coniferous}} and deciduous forests. They have been collected in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, and West Virginia. One field guide notes a preference for association with oak where there <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> cover of blueberry (Vaccinium) bushes. The mushroom has also been collected in Quebec, Canada. The southern extent of its range extends to the Mexican state of Michoacán. The mushroom fruits most commonly during late summer and fall after heavy rains.|$|E
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{methods used}} to {{cultivate}} crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work De Agri Cultura, which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut the ears of wheat and barley without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E

5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E
25|$|Infection {{is another}} {{potential}} complication, for example when debris <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> into an abrasion and remains there. Injuries resulting from bites carry a high infection risk.|$|E
25|$|Cold in-place recycling. Bituminous {{pavement}} <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> or milled {{into small}} particles.

25|$|Sintered: P-Tex base {{material}} <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> to powder then reformed with pressure and heat, {{and cut to}} shape. A sintered base is very porous and absorbs wax well. Sintered bases slide faster than extruded bases when waxed, but will be slower if unwaxed for a period. They are more expensive, and harder to repair.|$|E
25|$|Additives in dried, commercially sold pasta include {{vitamins}} and minerals that are lost from the durum wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the semolina flour once it <b>is</b> <b>ground.</b> Vitamins added include niacin (Vitamin B3), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), folic acid (Vitamin B9) and thiamine (Vitamin B1), added back {{in the form of}} thiamin mononitrate. Ferrous iron is also included as a supplement.|$|E
25|$|This {{process takes}} oat groats {{straight}} to a grinding unit (stone or hammer mill) {{and then over}} sifter screens to separate the coarse flour and final whole oat flour. The coarser flour is {{sent back to the}} grinding unit until it <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> fine enough to be whole oat flour. This method is used often in India and other countries. In India whole grain flour of oats (jai) used to make Indian bread known as jarobra in Himachal Pradesh.|$|E

25|$|Types Ia, IIa, and IIIa {{have the}} same {{composition}} as types I, II, and III. The {{only difference is that}} in Ia, IIa, and IIIa, an air-entraining agent <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> into the mix. The air-entrainment must meet the minimum and maximum optional specification found in the ASTM manual. These types are only available in the eastern United States and Canada, only on a limited basis. They are a poor approach to air-entrainment which improves resistance to freezing under low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northern}} part of Colombia, they are used to prepare a fritter called buñuelo. The beans are immersed in water for a few hours to loosen their skins and soften them. The skins are then removed either by hand or {{with the help of a}} manual grinder. Once the skins are removed, the bean <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> or blended, and eggs are added, which produces a soft mix. The mix is fried in hot oil. It makes a nutritious breakfast meal.|$|E

25|$|Made of high gem quality, {{flawless}} diamonds, {{usually with}} 16 facets, they typically weigh 1/8 to 1/3 carat (25 to 70mg). The culet (tip) <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> and polished to a hexadecagonal surface {{parallel to the}} table. The culets of the two diamonds face one another, and must be perfectly parallel {{in order to produce}} uniform pressure and to prevent dangerous strains. Specially selected anvils are required for specific measurements—for example, low diamond absorption and luminescence is required in corresponding experiments.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the changes that occur in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60°C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> {{with little or no}} washing or hulling.|$|E
25|$|Durum wheat <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> into {{semolina}} flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.|$|E

25|$|In Mexico, {{particularly}} in the towns and cities, corn tortillas are often made nowadays by machine and are very thin and uniform, but in many places in the country, they are still made by hand, even when the nixtamal <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> into masa by machine. In Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, they are still often made by hand and are thicker. Corn tortillas are customarily served and eaten warm; when cool, they often become rubbery or grainy as the cooked starches stale. The largest tortilla producer {{in the world is}} the Mexican company Gruma, headquartered in Monterrey.|$|E
25|$|After a {{metal piece}} <b>is</b> <b>ground</b> to an initial finish, it is {{superfinished}} with a finer grit solid abrasive. The abrasive is oscillated or rotated while the workpiece is rotated {{in the opposite}} direction; these motions are what causes the cross-hatching. The geometry of the abrasive depends on the geometry of the workpiece surface; a stone (rectangular shape) is for cylindrical surfaces and cups and wheels are used for flat and spherical surfaces. A lubricant is used to minimize heat production, which can alter the metallurgical properties, and to carry away the swarf; kerosene is a common lubricant.|$|E
25|$|NEMA wall {{receptacles}} can {{be found}} installed in any orientation.
