The retrievals require modeling of ocean surface emissivity fully covered with sea <b>foam.</b> To model <b>foam</b> emissivity well, knowledge of <b>foam</b> properties, both mechanical and dielectric, is necessary because these control the radiative processes in <b>foam.</b> We present a physical description of <b>foam</b> dielectric properties {{obtained from the}} <b>foam</b> dielectric constant including <b>foam</b> skin depth; <b>foam</b> impedance; wavelength variations in <b>foam</b> thickness, roughness of <b>foam</b> layer interfaces with air and seawater; and <b>foam</b> scattering parameters such as size parameter, and refraction index.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of green <b>foam</b> with black <b>foam</b> and gauze during {{negative}} pressure wound therapy (NPWT), with regard to wound bed appearance and granulation tissue formation, and monitoring of wound exudate. METHOD: Wounds {{on the backs of}} eight pigs underwent 72 hours of NPWT plus either green polyurethane <b>foam</b> with an open pore structure, black polyurethane <b>foam</b> with an open pore structure or saline-moistened AMD gauze. Sections of biopsies from the wound bed, including the overlying dressing, were examined histologically with regard to microdeformation of the wound bed and granulation tissue formation. The force required to remove the wound fillers was measured. RESULTS: Wound exudate and bleeding could be easily seen when using gauze and green <b>foam,</b> but were not visible under the black <b>foam.</b> Such visibility facilitates monitoring of the wound status. No difference was found in the quantity or characteristics of the granulation tissue formed under the green <b>foam</b> or black <b>foam.</b> Both green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> resulted in more pronounced granulation tissue formation than gauze under negative pressure. There was also more leucocyte infiltration and tissue disorganisation under green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> than under gauze. All three wound fillers created microdeformation within the wound bed surface. Similar forces were required to remove green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> (5. 0 ± 0. 6 N for green <b>foam</b> and 4. 0 ± 0. 4 N for black <b>foam),</b> while less force was needed for gauze (2. 1 ± 0. 2 N). This may be a result of tissue ingrowth into the <b>foam</b> (357 ± 12 µm for green <b>foam</b> and 362 ± 14 µm for black <b>foam),</b> but not into gauze (0 µm), as shown by examination of biopsy sections from the wound bed. CONCLUSION: Green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> have similar biological effects on the wound bed. Bleeding and exudate can be more easily monitored when using green <b>foam</b> or gauze. Differences in the wound bed tissue morphology when using <b>foam</b> or gauze plus NPWT support clinical observations that granulation tissue under <b>foam</b> is thick but fragile, whereas that under <b>foam</b> is thinner but denser.
