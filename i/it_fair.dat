500|$|Less {{than two}} weeks after the {{controversial}} game, ESPN The Magazine released an anonymous poll of 100 current MLB players that named Joyce as the best umpire in Major League Baseball. Joyce was named on 53% of ballots, 19 ballots ahead of second-place Tim McClelland. One player was quoted as saying, [...] "The sad thing about the Galarraga game is, Jim Joyce is seriously one of the best umpires around... He always calls <b>it</b> <b>fair,</b> so players love him. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's terrible that this happened to him." [...] Furthermore, the players in this poll overwhelmingly endorsed (86%) Selig's decision not to overturn the call, and were overwhelmingly against (77%) instituting replay for calls on the bases.|$|E

We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the game for September 2002, a trial version was released. It contained five scenarios of the game's campaign, and two random maps. In the trial version, the player can only select Zeus, but there are nine gods available in the full version of the game. There was debate during Age of Mythologys construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and how to make them [...] "fair" [...] while still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded {{that the best way to}} make <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game. Age of Mythology underwent a large amount of beta-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons Age of Mythology became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a [...] "faceless drone in another building".|$|E
2500|$|If the Board of Directors of the {{co-operative}} cannot {{resolve the}} member issue, {{which is a}} cause for possible termination of occupancy rights, it can pass a motion to send the member a notice to appear requiring the member to attend at a Board meeting at which the termination (eviction) of that member's occupancy [...] will be considered. If the Board votes to terminate an occupancy (evict), the member has a right of appeal to the membership as a whole. In order to enforce the eviction, the Board must bring an application to a judge of the Superior Court, on which occasion the member {{has the opportunity to}} present his/her case to the judge; the judge considers whether the eviction process was conducted fairly and in accordance with due process, and has a residual discretion to refuse the eviction should the judge consider <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> to do so, notwithstanding the decision of the Board. Sometimes this hearing is conducted like a trial, with oral evidence from both sides, while at other times it is conducted based only on written documents submitted to the court; the practice varies from judge-to-judge and courthouse to courthouse, and there is no consensus on the proper procedure or what right a member has to be heard. This process is different from evictions of rental tenants, which proceed in Ontario before a specialized tribunal and in which the tenant is always entitled to an oral hearing. The standard of deference that judges should show to the decisions of Boards is a controversial and unresolved issue in the law, with various cases taking seemingly inconsistent positions on the issue. As of 2012 new provincial legislation in Ontario will allow housing co-operatives to apply to a special tribunal to obtain a [...] "writ of possession" [...] to evict a member from their unit.|$|E
