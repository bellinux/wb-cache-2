5|$|After the games, <b>Evans</b> {{returned}} to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, <b>Evans</b> travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. <b>Evans</b> revitalised himself under his favourite coach and {{returned to}} his old style of sprinting. He twisted his ankle later in Perth and missed some training time. He won the Australian 100m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove <b>Evans</b> from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. The threat was withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU and pointed out that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, <b>Evans</b> joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. <b>Evans</b> arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. <b>Evans</b> started brightly to win his heat of the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1m 2.87s. His new mark did not last long—John Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate <b>Evans</b> to the second-fastest qualifying time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. <b>Evans</b> established a women's group and sued him. <b>Evans</b> won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which <b>Evans</b> denied complicity. In 1924, <b>Evans</b> paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evans</b> became {{embroiled in}} several {{internal}} Klan conflicts that gained media exposure. In January 1921, {{he and a}} group of grand dragons expelled the publicist Clarke, who had been critical of Evans' efforts to involve the Klan in electoral politics. <b>Evans</b> also clashed with Henry Grady, a judge from North Carolina who served in the Klan from 1922 to 1927, reaching the rank of Grand Dragon. Before <b>Evans</b> gained control of the Klan, Grady had been considered a potential successor to Simmons. After Grady dismissed a Klan-backed law that would have banned the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service organization, <b>Evans</b> revoked his membership. Grady subsequently leaked his correspondence with <b>Evans</b> to the media.|$|E

5|$|<b>Evans</b> {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings {{to be approved}} by artists such as Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had <b>Evans</b> illustrate covers for the new publication. <b>Evans</b> worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster and <b>Evans</b> became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent <b>Evans</b> and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which <b>Evans</b> engraved. Toward the end of his apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused <b>Evans</b> to work late into the night and return early in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Hiram Wesley <b>Evans</b> {{was born}} in Ashland, Alabama, on September 26, 1881, and moved to Hubbard, Texas, with his family as a child. The son of Hiram Martin <b>Evans,</b> a judge, and his wife, Georgia <b>Evans,</b> the younger <b>Evans</b> {{graduated}} from Vanderbilt University. Shortly after, he became a dentist, receiving his license in 1900. He married Bam Hill in 1923; they had three children together.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, <b>Evans</b> {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he should step up his {{swimming}} career, and <b>Evans</b> entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, <b>Evans</b> came second to Lindsay Spencer. <b>Evans</b> was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, <b>Evans</b> vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, <b>Evans</b> travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. <b>Evans</b> did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months of training in London, <b>Evans</b> had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech running back Darren <b>Evans</b> was named the game's most valuable player. <b>Evans</b> set a Virginia Tech bowl-game record for carries, and tied the Tech record for rushing yards. <b>Evans</b> finished the season with 1,265 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns–both marks were Virginia Tech records for a freshman.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{their opponents}} {{were able to}} lift and the final saw Steve Lundquist of the United States set a new world record of 1m 1.65s; <b>Evans</b> took bronze, 0.98s behind silver medallist Davis. <b>Evans</b> was unable to {{maintain}} the pace that he had set in the heats, clocking a time 0.10s slower. In the 200m, <b>Evans</b> came second in his heat but was not fast {{enough to make the}} final, swimming 1.47s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for <b>Evans</b> was the 4×100m medley relay. <b>Evans</b> was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists in three of the respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; <b>Evans</b> and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change. <b>Evans</b> recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, <b>Evans</b> {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. <b>Evans</b> later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing {{in the eyes of the}} selectors. As a result of being overlooked, <b>Evans</b> retired from competitive swimming.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, <b>Evans</b> {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. <b>Evans</b> and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by <b>Evans.</b> After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Evans</b> {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent <b>Evans</b> into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. <b>Evans</b> declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from <b>Evans,</b> and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Evans</b> {{had led the}} {{kidnapping}} and torture {{of a black man}} while leader of the Dallas Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, <b>Evans</b> presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. He moved the Klan's headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on Pennsylvania Avenue. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, the Klan was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between <b>Evans</b> and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the Great Depression significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting <b>Evans</b> to work for a construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with the Klan in 1939, after disavowing anti-Catholicism. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, James A. Colescott. The next year, <b>Evans</b> faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.|$|E

Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When <b>Evan</b> returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells <b>Evan</b> that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, <b>Evan</b> tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe <b>Evan</b> and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, <b>Evan</b> finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time <b>Evan</b> arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe midway through the session. <b>Evan</b> reluctantly explains his divine mission, but Long does not take him seriously, and <b>Evan</b> is suspended from Congress and removed from the Public Land Act bill. <b>Evan</b> deduces that God purposely had him suspended from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark.

Heidi who had no idea that <b>Evan</b> had spent time at the Murphys' is mortified when Larry and Cynthia offer to use the money that they had set aside for Connor's college fund to send <b>Evan</b> to school instead. After returning home, Heidi and <b>Evan</b> fight over his secrecy. When Heidi protests that the Murphys are not Evan's family, <b>Evan</b> confesses that he feels not only welcomed, but accepted by the Murphys in light of Heidi's absence and expectations towards Evan's mental health. Heidi tearfully berates him for running off to his shiny new family while Alana begins to find inconsistencies in the fake emails <b>Evan</b> [...] "received" [...] from Connor and suspect that the entire story has been a lie. Beginning to panic, <b>Evan</b> urges Jared to help him clear up the inaccuracies, but Jared refuses due to Evan's own absence. <b>Evan</b> counters that Jared himself had acted as a friend to him when he needed him. Jared threatens to expose <b>Evan,</b> and <b>Evan</b> warns him he could in turn open up about Jared's role.

5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, <b>Evans</b> {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so <b>Evans</b> designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life <b>Evans</b> turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. <b>Evans</b> was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. <b>Evans</b> dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E
5|$|Compton and <b>Evans</b> {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play.

England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring <b>Evans</b> on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while <b>Evans</b> {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, <b>Evans</b> being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E
