40|$|The {{project was}} to develop a radio {{controlled}} <b>door</b> <b>holder</b> system as the first in a range of radio based products for Stephenson Gobin Eng Co. Ltd. Stephenson Gobin manufacture and market a wide range of electromechanical products, including retaining devices for fire doors and smoke vents. Typical installations are in hospitals, nursing homes, shopping centers, hotels or any building open to the public. The author discusses why a radio controlled <b>door</b> <b>holder</b> system is commercially and technically viable. Various wired and Wirefree <b>door</b> <b>holder</b> systems are evaluated on merits of safety and ease of installation. Stephenson Gobin developed a bi-stable latching door holding device which consumed no current in a state that was capable of holding a fire door open. This was due to a rotating magnetic slug assembly which only drew current to latch from one state to other. The device needed to be controlled wirelessly and possible methods of communication were assessed. Communicating using the license free radio frequency spectrum was selected due to the falling costs of radio components and the huge growth in the radio communication sector. The author developed and tested the hardware and software necessary to communicate with and actuate such a device...|$|E

50|$|The men {{and women}} who {{volunteer}} at the conferences are called <b>door</b> <b>holders.</b> They serve on different teams such as community groups, logistics and registration and are considered to be {{at the core of the}} gatherings. They travel from all over the nation to serve at these gatherings. At various times throughout the year Passion City Church has special events for <b>Door</b> <b>Holders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first modern}} direct-pull {{electromagnetic}} lock {{was designed by}} Sumner [...] "Irving" [...] Saphirstein in 1969 for initial installation on doors at the Montreal Forum. Fire concerns by local authorities in locking the doors at the Forum prompted management to find a locking solution that would be safe during a fire incident. Saphirstein initially proposed to use a linear stack of <b>door</b> <b>holders</b> to work as an electromagnetic lock. These <b>door</b> <b>holders</b> were traditionally used to hold doors open, but in this application Saphirstein believed {{that they could be}} packaged and adapted to work as a fail-safe lock. After a successful prototype and installation at the Forum, Saphirstein continued evolving and improving the design and established the Locknetics company to develop accessories and control circuits for electromagnetic locks.|$|R

RFID cards serve to open the key boxes or car <b>doors.</b> <b>Holders</b> of a RFID based year pass of the Rhein-Main Verkehrsverbund shall soon be able to use this card to get access to car or car key.|$|R
50|$|Many {{buildings}} are built with fire-resistant doors to separate {{different parts of}} buildings and {{to allow people to}} be protected from fire and smoke. When using a cabin hook in such a situation, one should keep in mind that a fire-resistant door is an expensive and heavy item, and it only works as a fire door if it is always closed. To open the often heavy fire door easily, magnetic <b>door</b> <b>holders</b> are used that are released when the buildings electrical fire alarm system is activated by a fire. As cabin hooks must be activated manually, they are inappropriate for fire doors.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic {{smoke door}} holders/retainers: wall or floor mounted {{solenoids}} or electromagnets {{controlled by a}} fire alarm system or detection component that magnetically secures spring-loaded self-closing smoke tight doors in the open position. Designed to de-magnetize to allow automatic closure of the door on command from the fire control or upon failure of the power source, interconnection or controlling element. Stored {{energy in the form}} of a spring or gravity can then close the door to restrict the passage of smoke from one space to another in an effort to maintain a tenable atmosphere on either side of the door during evacuation and fire fighting efforts in buildings. Electromagnetic fire <b>door</b> <b>holders</b> can be hard-wired into the fire panel, radio controlled triggered by radio waves from a central controller connected to a fire panel, or, acoustic, which learn the sound of the fire alarm and release the door upon hearing this exact sound.|$|R
50|$|In her motel room, Linden finds {{a drawing}} from a {{previous}} case attached to the refrigerator door. Her son Jack (Liam James) denies putting it there, so she runs {{out into the hallway}} to look for intruders. She and Jack later show up at <b>Holder's</b> <b>door</b> and ask to spend the night at his apartment. Outside the apartment, an unidentified person watches them from a parked car.|$|R
50|$|On {{the inside}} of the car, the {{dashboard}} has got an all black theme along with a touchscreen infotainment system with AppleCarPlay connectivity. There are bottle holders on both the front as well as the rear <b>door</b> with cup <b>holders</b> on the rear centre armrest. There is an automatic climate control and remote control audio system of the integrated 2-DIN speaker system, integrated with Bluetooth and AUX connectivity.|$|R
50|$|Nameplates {{are usually}} sold as two {{separate}} components: the manufactured nameplate insert and the nameplate holder. This setup allows the nameplate insert {{to be used}} {{in a variety of settings}} depending on the specific holder—the same plastic, wood, or metal nameplate insert can usually be removed and reinserted into another holder style with minimal effort; thereby creating a new nameplate application. Various nameplate holders range from wall and <b>door</b> mounts, desk <b>holders,</b> to cubicle hangers.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research into}} a specific area of Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band applications that employ a central control panel to send broadcast {{information to the}} units in a system. One {{example of this is}} fire safety systems. The focus is on how battery life, reliability and usability of such a system may be improved through different mechanisms. The case study application is a system of radio controlled fire <b>door</b> <b>holders.</b> Following a review of the current literature and a look at the considerations of designing a wireless network, a comparison is made of two radio transceivers, each of which operates in a different frequency band. Testing is performed with both, and a choice made as to which to use in system implementations and further research. Results from the first system implementation quantify communications and circuitry improvements that increase battery life through improved receiver sensitivity and communications resilience. The second system implements a narrowband system, as well as improving unit displays for information output and system troubleshooting. Results from it show a further increase in receiver sensitivity and techniques developed to improve timing to reduce on-time, so reducing power consumption further. The third implementation employs frequency hopping techniques along with further advances in timing. Enhanced display manager techniques add to the usability of the system. Beyond this, more recent chip technology is used with algorithmic changes in small test units to assess how further improvements can be made in terms of battery life. A ten-fold improvement in battery life compared to the original implementation is shown to be possible when comparing the narrowband and wideband systems. Further improvements are described employing the latest chip technology. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|The {{plate was}} then {{carried to the}} camera in a {{light-tight}} plate holder. Withdrawing a protective dark slide or opening a pair of <b>doors</b> in the <b>holder</b> exposed the sensitized surface within the dark camera and removing a cap from the camera lens began the exposure, creating an invisible latent image on the plate. Depending on the sensitization chemistry used, {{the brightness of the}} lighting, and the light-concentrating power of the lens, the required exposure time ranged from a few seconds to many minutes. After the exposure was judged to be complete, the lens was capped and the holder was again made light-tight and removed from the camera.|$|R
5000|$|At a bar, Holder asks {{a prostitute}} (Tantoo Cardinal) {{to take him}} to the {{construction}} site. After she refuses, male prostitute Benny (Justin Rain) offers to take him. Holder leaves him after being told the site is on the tenth floor. Holder pushes the elevator button for the tenth floor, but it doesn't work. He rides to the ninth floor and walks up the final flight of stairs, only to find a locked stairwell door. Back on the elevator, Holder encounters casino maid Mary (Q'orianka Kilcher), who hands him a book of matches. After stepping off, she mentions Rosie's backpack, and the <b>doors</b> close before <b>Holder</b> can pursue her. He opens the matches to see a simple note: [...] "11am tomorrow". The elevator arrives at the lobby, where Holder is greeted by tribal policemen. One of them handcuffs Holder, who says he is a cop. The tribesman replies, “Not here, you ain't.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Graham {{wrote that}} {{investment}} is most intelligent {{when it is}} most businesslike. By that he meant that the stock investor is neither right nor wrong because others agreed or disagreed with him; he is right because his facts and analysis are right. [...] Graham's favorite allegory is that of Mr. Market, a fellow who turns up every day at the stock <b>holder's</b> <b>door</b> offering {{to buy or sell}} his shares at a different price. Usually, the price quoted by Mr. Market seems plausible, but occasionally it is ridiculous. The investor is free to either agree with his quoted price and trade with him, or to ignore him completely. Mr. Market doesn't mind this, and will be back the following day to quote another price. The point is that the investor should not regard the whims of Mr. Market as determining the value of the shares that the investor owns. He should profit from market folly rather than participate in it. The investor is best off concentrating on the real life performance of his companies and receiving dividends, rather than being too concerned with Mr. Market's often irrational behavior.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{fire and}} life safety {{analysis was performed}} on the Orfalea College of Business. The report covers the prescriptive analysis of the building and the performance-based design analysis. The prescriptive analysis includes assessment of the relevant codes for egress system, water-based suppression system, alarm and detection system, and structural fire protection. The egress analysis under the Life Safety Code 2015 found the building meets the requirements of occupant load to exceed exit capacity, number of exits and its location, travel distances. Four rooms on the second floor that have not met the common path of travel distances limits were discussed in detail in this report. In addition, two locations where exits signs should have been located were investigated in this report. The water-based suppression system was analyzed, and an automatic fire sprinkler system was designed according to NFPA 13. The fire alarm and detection system throughout the building was reviewed. The notification device in Room 300 does not meet required candela rating. The smoke management system analysis indicates <b>door</b> magnetic <b>holder</b> for the exit enclosure on the third floor does not work properly. The analysis of the structural fire protection demonstrates that the building is in accordance to the requirements of the IBC 2015 for Type I-B construction. A performance based analysis of the Orfalea College of Business was performed to evaluate a design fire scenario. The fire scenario was modeled using Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS), Pyrosim and Pathfinder. The tenability results of the simulation are compared to the established tenability criteria to determine the available safe egress time (ASET) for the scenario. Then, (ASET) is compared to the required safe egress time (RSET). The fire scenario evaluated an upholstered three seat sofa in a break room on the fourth floor. The required safe egress time (RSET) was calculated as 249 seconds and the available safe egress time (ASET) was determined to be 42 seconds when the visibility tenability criterion was exceeded. As part of the evaluation process, there are additional recommendations in the report including exit sings locations on the third floor, obstructions in the corridor on the fourth floor, smoke detection system and notification appliances coverage, and several other recommendations are discussed in more detail in the report...|$|R
50|$|The British A-level {{qualifications}} such as GCE A-level and International A-level {{are widely}} accepted in Hong Kong {{as an alternative}} to the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education for both admission and employment purposes. It is notably one of the most popular qualifications used for university admission via the non-JUPAS channel. For example, average non-JUPAS offers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology require one to three A*s (the mid-50% range). Since the introduction of the high distinction grade (A*) in 2010, the British A-level examination has regained its power to differentiate the very top levels of ability. According to the British Department for Education, in the academic year 2014/15, approximately 7.3%, 2.7%, 1.0% and 0.3% of all the candidates from the GCSE cohort (548,480) achieved one to four A*s or a better result in the GCE A-level examination. This percentile rank is one important input for equating the levels in both examinations. On the sole basis of percentile ranks and the grade statistics from HKEAA in 2017, a score of 29/35 from the best five subjects in HKDSE is comparable to 1A*2A in the best three British A-levels, 32/35 to 2A*1A, 33/35 to 3A* and 34/35 to 4A*. In deriving inferences from these statistics, it is important to note that slightly more than a third of the GCSE candidates can go on to study in sixth form before applying to universities via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) while almost all Hong Kong students can study Form 6 before sitting the HKDSE examination. Relevant authorities such as the Hong Kong Examination and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) and UCAS also sought to connect the results from both exam systems to open <b>doors</b> for the <b>holders</b> of these qualifications who wish to study locally or overseas. Officially, the top distinction levels, A* in A-level and 5** in HKDSE, are currently recognized as broadly equivalent. In particular, in the light of statistical evidence, the 1% cut-off line is often set by admission offices at 2A*1A but the Uniform Mark Scale (UMS) instead of the letter grades would be used in many cases to offer a much more subtle view of the candidate's academic potential. Typical offers from Cambridge Medical School require 2A*1A and Oxford Medical School require 1A*2A whereas those from the medical schools of the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong require 4A* in A-level due to very intense competition.|$|R
