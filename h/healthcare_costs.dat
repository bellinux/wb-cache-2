5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} a reduced quality of life, and people with the condition incur increased <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs,</b> largely due to hospital admissions including observation and treatment on intensive care units.

40|$|Objective: To {{provide an}} {{accurate}} {{representation of the}} economic burden of arthritis by estimating the adjusted incremental <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> of arthritis at multiple percentiles and reporting the cost trends across time. Methods: A <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> study based on health survey and linked administrative data, where costs were estimated from the government's perspective in dollars per person per year. Quantile regression was used to estimate the adjusted incremental cost at the 25 th, 50 th, 75 th, 90 th, and 95 th percentiles. Results: Data from 4287 older Australian women were included. The median incremental <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> of arthritis was, in 2012 Australian dollars, $ 480 (95 % CI: $ 498 - 759) in 2009; however, 5 % of individuals had 5 -times higher costs than the 'average individual' with arthritis. <b>Healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> of arthritis did not increase significantly from 2003 to 2009. Conclusion: <b>Healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> of arthritis represents a substantial burden for the governments. Future research should continue to monitor the economic burden of arthritis...|$|R

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs,</b> insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs</b> and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{widespread}} in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs,</b> lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.|$|E

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> and productivity losses as a result of diabetes and diabetes-related chronic complications in Sweden in 1987 and 2005. Research design and methods Published estimates on relative risks and Swedish age-specific diabetes-prevalence rates were used to calculate the proportions of diabetes-related chronic complications that are attributable to diabetes. These attributable risks were applied to cost estimates for diabetes-related chronic complications based on data from Swedish population registers. Results The estimated total costs for Sweden in 1987 and 2005 were EUR 439 m and EUR 920 m, respectively. The increase of 110 % was as a result of a 69 % increase in the estimated prevalence from 150 000 (1. 8 % of the population) to 254 000 (2. 8 %) and of an increase in the estimated annual cost per person diagnosed with diabetes by 24 %. Healthcare accounted for 45 % of the estimated cost in 1987 and for 37 % in 2005. The estimated diabetes-related <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> accounted for approximately 1. 0 % of total <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> in Sweden in 1987 and for 1. 4 % in 2005. Diabetes per se accounted for 57 % of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> in 1987 and for 50 % in 2005. The most important chronic complication was cardiovascular disease. Conclusions The cost of diabetes is substantial and increasing even in a fairly low-prevalence country such as Sweden. Measures to curb the increase in prevalence and to improve individual control of his or her diabetes seem to be the most important challenges...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the asthma prevalence rate, the total healthcare and asthma-related treatment costs, {{and the medical}} and pharmacy costs associated with different asthma medication usage patterns in a managed-care organisation (MCO). Study design and participants: The medical and pharmacy claims databases from a 400 000 member MCO were used. The medical claims database was searched from 1994 to 1996 for patients having at least one asthma medical claim in either {{the first or second}} diagnosis field of the medical claims, and the total <b>healthcare</b> and asthma-related <b>costs</b> were determined. A subpopulation with a more restrictive asthma definition was identified and their costs were also determined. In addition, the patterns of drug treatment were identified. Study perspective: MCO perspective. Results: The mean total <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> of caring for patients with asthma was significant and approximately twice the mean cost of all patients enrolled in the MCO. Using a broad definition of asthma, the mean (+- standard deviation) annual total per patient <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> was $US 2511 +- 7314 and the annual asthma-related cost was $US 679 +- 2247 (1996 values). Using a more restrictive definition of asthma, the mean annual total per patient <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> was $US 2653 +- 5268 and the asthma-related cost was $ 1026 +- 2447.
