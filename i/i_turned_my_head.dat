2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at {{the sound}} of a {{footstep}} upon the gravel path. The doctor was standing beside me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was the Recording Angel. He had a weary look; I judged {{him to be}} tired.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and see it, in its {{beautiful}} serenity, beside me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{get on my}} back,' he said to Paul, 'and when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to the right, cut a slice off the bullock {{that hangs}} on that side, {{and put it in}} my mouth, and when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to the left, draw a cupful of wine from the cask that hangs on that side, and pour it down my throat.' ...|$|R
60|$|In lazy wonder, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> on the pillow, {{and look}} {{on the other side}} of my bed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Christian George King again, and treachery again! Sea- {{water had}} been {{conveyed}} into the magazine, and every grain of powder was spoiled! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't look at him!' said my aunt, as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> indignantly, 'but {{get me a}} coach, my dear, {{and wait}} for me in St. Paul's Churchyard.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt the}} blood rush {{into my face}} for the first time, {{but it was only}} an {{instantaneous}} emotion. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> aside, and it was gone.|$|E
60|$|The grave {{face of a}} not too {{recently}} washed angel peeps shyly at {{me through}} the railings, then, as <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> darts back and disappears.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> aside <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in silence, for my {{thoughts}}, at that moment, {{were not}} the thoughts which can be spoken by man to man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{do not ask}} me such {{questions}} Lady Scudamore, said <b>I</b> <b>turning</b> away <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> for it is not fit for me to answer them." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} her flow {{of language}} ceased--the bomb-shell fell! Mrs. Bundercombe's face became unlike anything I {{have ever seen}} or dreamed of. Even Eve's eyes were round and her expression dubious. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|But behind me, {{coming from}} the village, I {{heard the sound of}} light and rapid footsteps. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was Blanche Moyat, short-skirted, a stick in her hand, a feather stuck through her Tam-o'-Shanter.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> away in {{bitterness}} as I {{thought of}} my own folly. Why had I never happened to walk out this way with fifty thousand dollars in my pocket and buy all this beautiful mud? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> sharply <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> away, {{partly because}} his {{presence}} utterly displeased me, {{and partly because}} I wished to shun questions: lest, in my present mood, the effort of answering should overmaster self-command.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> hesitating, {{and when}} I {{looked up again}} I saw that her {{beautiful}} eyes were full of tears. Naturally that settled the matter, so I only said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If it {{had been}} anyone but you, Agnes,' said <b>I,</b> <b>turning</b> away <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> 'I should not have minded it half so much. But {{that it should have}} been you who saw me! I almost wish I had been dead, first.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to the Signor Dellombra, and {{saw that}} he was dressed in black, and had a {{reserved}} and secret air, and was a dark, remarkable-looking man, with black hair and a grey moustache.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him without answering; for, to my thinking, his sudden {{appearance}} (or rather, I should say, his unexpected approach) had, amidst the gathering shadows and lingering light, something in it which was wild and ominous.|$|E
6000|$|And never <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> alack, [...] While {{these things}} met my gaze [...] Through the pane's drop-drenched glaze, To see the more {{behind my back}} [...] . O never I turned, but let, alack, [...] These less things hold my gaze! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the rood!" [...] {{cried the}} fierce man-at-arms, [...] "I {{will see the}} color of their blood ere <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> mare's <b>head</b> for the mountains. Am I a child, that I should ride for three days and nought but words at the end of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No need,” <b>I</b> growled, without <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> “I {{can find}} my {{hat in the}} hall by myself, after I’ve {{finished}} picking up [...] . ” ...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{a four-month}} visit to Antarctica {{as a member}} of the External Territories Committee in May 2006 Joyce {{promoted}} mining of Antarctica, banned under the Antarctic Treaty. Joyce justified his proposal by saying:There's minerals there, there's gold, there's iron ore, there's coal, there's huge fish resources and what you have to ask is: 'Do <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and allow another country to exploit my resource ... or do I position myself in such a way as I'm going to exploit it myself before they get there'.In defending his position Joyce argued that other nations did not recognise Australia's 42 per cent claim over Antarctica. The proposal was roundly criticised including by Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell and Labor Opposition spokesman, Anthony Albanese.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a beggar}} in the street, when I went down; and as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> towards the window, {{thinking}} of her calm seraphic eyes, he made me start by muttering, {{as if he were}} an echo of the morning: 'Blind! Blind! Blind!' ...|$|E
60|$|My blood {{seemed to}} stand still. A deadly paralysing coldness stole {{all over me}} as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> round on the pillow and {{determined}} to test whether the bed-top was really moving or not, by keeping my eye on {{the man in the}} picture.|$|E
60|$|Lady Dedlock {{had taken}} {{shelter in the}} lodge before our arrival there and {{had come out of}} the gloom within. She stood behind my chair with her hand upon it. I saw her with her hand close to my {{shoulder}} when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|My new {{regiment}} formed part of {{the force}} which, under Marshal Lannes, was then besieging the Spanish town of Saragossa. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> horse's <b>head</b> in that direction, therefore, and behold me {{a week or so}} later at the French headquarters, whence I was directed to the camp of the Hussars of Conflans.|$|R
60|$|She had {{the mercy}} to spare me the actual words, yet her tone told me as plainly {{as if she}} had uttered them that I could go with her or not, as I should choose. In silence, very sore at heart, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> mule's <b>head</b> once more towards the lights of the town.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kari," [...] <b>I</b> said, without <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "what {{are they}} going to do with us? Set us in yonder temple to be worshipped with nothing to eat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{snapped the}} fingers of my hand that was free, in his face. [...] "That for my promise!" [...] I said. [...] "Your contemptible {{weakness}} is putting her happiness in peril as well as yours." [...] <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> towards the door, and called to her. [...] "Lucilla!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and spoke}} towards the hut, [...] "Chief," [...] I said, [...] "your Ehlose is kind to you to-night, for {{he has given}} you a maid fair as the Lily of the Halakazi"--here Nada glanced up wildly. [...] "Come, then, and take the girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{away from}} that meeting, and {{did not look at}} them again till I heard Miss Haldin's voice uttering his name in the way of introduction. Mr. Razumov was informed, in a warm, low tone, that, besides being a {{wonderful}} teacher, I was a great support [...] "in our sorrow and distress." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{that instant}} came a thud like the thud of a gun, {{and then a}} thing happened--it still haunts me in <b>my</b> dreams. <b>I</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> to look at Cavor's face, and thrust out my {{hand in front of}} me as I did so. And my hand met nothing! I plunged {{suddenly}} into a bottomless hole! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did I not die under Red Dog?" [...] the boy moaned. [...] "My {{strength}} is gone from me, {{and it is}} not any poison. By night and by day I hear a double step upon <b>my</b> trail. When <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> it is as though one had hidden himself from me that instant. I go to look behind the trees and he is not there. I call and none cry again; but it is as though one listened and kept back the answer. I lie down, but I do not rest. I run the spring running, but I am not made still. I bathe, but I am not made cool. The kill sickens me, but I have no heart to fight except I kill. The Red Flower is in my body, my bones are water--and--I know not what I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|The princess exclaimed: 'You {{have done}} well so to do; but you must know that your wager is not yet won, for my father will change me and my maidens into ducks, and will ask you, [...] "Which of these ducks is the princess?" [...] Then <b>I</b> will <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> back, and with my bill will clean my wings, so that you may know me.' ...|$|R
