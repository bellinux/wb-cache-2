50|$|<b>Glibornuride</b> (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug {{from the}} group of sulfonylureas. It is {{manufactured}} by MEDA Pharma and sold in Switzerland under the brand name Glutril.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>glibornuride</b> (25 mg i. v.) and {{the accompanying}} insulin and glucose responses were characterized in eight human subjects in the presence and absence of steady-state tenoxicam (20 mg p. o. /day for 2 weeks). Tenoxicam affected neither the pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>glibornuride</b> (systemic clearance, volume of distribution and biological half-life) nor the responses of plasma insulin and blood glucose to <b>glibornuride.</b> The single i. v. dose of <b>glibornuride</b> had no detectable effect on the kinetics of tenoxicam...|$|E
40|$|<b>Glibornuride</b> is an {{addition}} to the second-generation sulphonylureas, that {{has been shown in}} clinical trials to be effective and non-toxic. Twenty-three diabetics who were poorly controlled on other oral hypoglycaemic agents and seven newly diagnosed diabetics were treated with <b>glibornuride.</b> The efficacy and lack of toxicity of this drug was confirmed, but there was no evidence to suggest that it is significantly more potent than other sulphonylureas. It does not seem to represent a significant therapeutic advance...|$|E
40|$|All 98 {{cases of}} sulfonylurea-induced {{hypoglycemia}} {{reported by the}} 30 regional drug-monitoring centers between 1985 and 1990 were analyzed: 46 with gliclazide, 40 with glibenclamide, 5 with glipizide, 1 with <b>glibornuride</b> and 6 with first-generation sulfonylureas. These cases of hypoglycemia were often serious. The patients were 61 % female and their mean age was 78. 9 years. The average number of medications being taken was 3. 4, but ranged up to 14. The risk factors were: reduced food intake (4. 2 %), renal failure (4. 2 %), prescription error (3. 2 %), voluntary or accidental overdose (5. 2 %), alcohol (1. 1 %), suspected drug interactions (50 %), unknown (32. 6 %). The most frequent drug interactions involved miconazole (8 cases), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (9 cases), lipid-regulating agents (fibrates) (7 cases), co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 5 cases), metformin (4 cases), histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (4 cases). The mechanisms of these interactions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The binding of the sulphonylurea [3 H]-glibenclamide, a blocker of {{adenosine}} 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) -sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels), was {{studied in}} endothelium-denuded rings from rat aorta. [3 H]-glibenclamide labelled {{two classes of}} binding sites with KD values of 20 ± 5 [*]nM and 32 ± 1 [*]μM. The high affinity component, which comprised 17 % of total binding at 1 [*]nM [3 H]-glibenclamide, had an estimated binding capacity of 150 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 wet weight. Other sulphonylureas such as glipizide and <b>glibornuride</b> and the sulphonylurea-related carboxylate, AZ-DF 265, inhibited high affinity [3 H]-glibenclamide binding with the potencies expected from their K+ channel activity. At very high concentrations, AZ-DF 265 and glipizide started to interact also with the low affinity component of [3 H]-glibenclamide binding. Openers of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel belonging to different structural groups inhibited only the high affinity [3 H]-glibenclamide binding; the potencies in this assay {{were similar to those}} obtained in functional (i. e. vasorelaxation) studies. High affinity [3 H]-glibenclamide binding was abolished by prolonged hypoxia combined with metabolic inhibition. The data indicate that the high affinity component of [3 H]-glibenclamide binding mediates the block of the KATP channel by the sulphonylureas in rat aorta; hence, it represents the sulphonylurea receptor in this vessel. The pharmacological properties of this binding site resemble those of the binding site for the openers of the KATP channel; present evidence suggests that these two classes of sites are negatively allosterically coupled...|$|E
40|$|The binding of [3 H]-P 1075, {{a potent}} opener of adenosine- 5 ′-triphosphate-(ATP) -sensitive K+ channels, was studied in a crude heart {{membrane}} {{preparation of the}} rat, at 37 °C. Binding required MgATP. In {{the presence of an}} ATP-regenerating system, MgATP supported [3 H]-P 1075 binding with an EC 50 value of 100 [*]μM and a Hill coefficient of 1. 4. In saturation experiments [3 H]-P 1075 binding was homogeneous with a KD value of 6 ± 1 [*]nM and a binding capacity (Bmax) of 33 ± 3 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein. Upon addition of an excess of unlabelled P 1075, the [3 H]-P 1075 -receptor complex dissociated in a mono-exponential manner with a dissociation rate constant of 0. 13 ± 0. 01 [*]min− 1. If a bi-molecular association mechanism was assumed, the dependence of the association kinetics on label concentration gave an association rate constant of 0. 030 ± 0. 003 [*]nM− 1 [*]min− 1. From the kinetic experiments the KD value was calculated as 4. 7 ± 0. 6 [*]nM. Openers of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel belonging to different structural classes inhibited specific [3 H]-P 1075 binding in a monophasic manner to completion; an exception was minoxidil sulphate where maximum inhibition was 68 %. The potencies of the openers in this assay agree with published values obtained in rat cardiocytes and are on average 3. 5 times lower than those determined in rat aorta. Sulphonylureas, such as glibenclamide and <b>glibornuride</b> and the sulphonylurea-related carboxylate, AZ-DF 265, inhibited [3 H]-P 1075 binding with biphasic inhibition curves. The high affinity component comprised about 60 % of the curves with the IC 50 value of glibenclamide being ≈amp; 90 [*]nM; affinities for the low affinity component were in the μM concentration range. The fluorescein derivative, phloxine B, showed a monophasic inhibition curve with an IC 50 value of 6 [*]μM, a maximum inhibition of 94 % and a Hill coefficient of 1. 5. It is concluded that binding studies with [3 H]-P 1075 are feasible in rat heart membranes in the presence of MgATP and of an ATP-regenerating system. The pharmacological profile of the [3 H]-P 1075 binding sites in the cardiac preparation, which probably contains sulphonylurea receptors (SURs) from cardiac myocytes (SUR 2 A) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SUR 2 B), differs from that expected for SUR 2 A and SUR 2 B...|$|E
