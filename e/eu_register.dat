40|$|European Union (EU) {{funding of}} civil society {{organizations}} (CSOs) is a substantial and important part of EU governance, but study of such funding is scarce and theoretically underdeveloped. To fill this gap, this article analyzes the main features of EU funding of CSOs {{and its effects on}} the EU system of interest representation, drawing on policy documents and the <b>EU</b> <b>register</b> of interest representatives. The resulting analysis shows that EU funding of CSOs in the social sector tends to reflect many of the characteristics of the model of associative democracy. European funds are being directed to groups that voice the concerns of excluded groups and, in this way, address imbalances in EU interest representation. The EU also promotes certain healthy features among CSOs, since it restricts access to funding opportunities to interest groups fulfilling key normative criteria. Hence, the EU helps sustain, but does not significantly constrain, the development of European CSOs...|$|E

The OSR-PSP allows the detection of all GM oilseed rape events listed in the <b>EU</b> <b>register</b> of authorised GM events as of February 2017 and one not authorised event. The plate includes a total of 12 assays, consisting of 11 event-specific assays and one taxon-specific assay selected from those validated and approved by the EU Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed (EURL GMFF). The reaction conditions were standardised and the performance of the assays, in terms of specificity and sensitivity, were re-assessed in a single-laboratory study. The results confirm that the assays, under the new reaction conditions, fulfil the EU requirements for GMO testing and can be used for the detection of single and stacked oilseed rape GM events in food and feed samples.

40|$|We {{stress the}} basic pillars of EU's Maritime Policy: 'competition, quality ships, and short sea shipping'. EU {{expressed}} its dissatisfaction with IMO, destined, by shipping community, to safeguard safety. This emerged after 1985, when national flags created parallel registries. The common maritime policy was absent from 1957 till 1986, {{due to the}} unanimity principle, as argued. The qualified majority adopted, but unfortunately, for decisions in maritime matters, it remained {{as it was when}} the Union was established. This paper found it fair to propose a new allocation of votes among MS, when maritime matters are decided, based on fleet owned under national flag. Great achievement for the Union in 1986 was the four regulations, 4055 - 4058, reinforcing competition and recognised as the foundation of EU Maritime Policy.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of the recycling process “INTERSEROH Step 2 ”, <b>EU</b> <b>register</b> number RECYC 070. The process recycles pre-washed damaged food contact re-usable polypropylene crates (RPC) or parts of crates which {{have been used in}} a closed and controlled product loop into new recycled crates. Through this process, pre-washed damaged RPC and parts of crates are ground into flakes. The flakes are compounded, extruded into pellets then used up to 100 % for the production of new recycled PP crates by injection moulding. The Panel considered that repeated grinding and injection moulding of PP crates {{which is part of the}} recycling process, under conditions described by the applicant, is not of safety concern. The Panel concluded that the input of the process “INTERSEROH Step 2 ” originates from a product loop which is in a closed and controlled chain designed to ensure that only materials and articles which have been intended for food contact are used and that any contamination can be ruled out when run under the conditions described by the applicant. The recycling process “INTERSEROH Step 2 ” is therefore able to produce recycled PP suitable for manufacturing PP crates intended to be used in contact with whole fruits and vegetables at room temperature or below...|$|E

The input to this process is hot washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5 % PET from non-food consumer applications. In this technology, post-consumer washed and dried PET flakes are heated in a continuous reactor under vacuum before being extruded. Having examined the results of the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the continuous reactor step (step 2) is the critical step that determines the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters controlling its performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure and residence time. It was demonstrated that, depending on the operating conditions, the recycling process under evaluation is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0. 15 lg/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for toddlers. The Panel concluded that recycled PET obtained from the process is not of safety concern when the final thermoformed trays and containers manufactured with the recycled sheets and not used for packaging water contain up to 100 % recycled post-consumer PET.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety assessment of the recycling process Aliplast Buhler B (<b>EU</b> <b>register</b> number RECYC 044). The input of the process is hot caustic washed and dried PET flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, mainly bottles, containing no more than 5 % of PET from non-food consumer applications. Through this process, washed and dried PET flakes are heated to the decontamination temperature and subsequently are further decontaminated in a continuous countercurrent reactor under high temperature and inert gas flow. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the third step, the decontamination in continuous countercurrent reactor for solid state polymerisation (SSP) is the critical step that determines the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters to control its performance are the temperature, the inert gas flow and the residence time. The operating parameters of this {{step in the process}} are at least as severe as those obtained from the challenge test. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 μg/kg food. Therefore, the recycled PET obtained from this process, intended to be used up to 100 % for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill, is not considered of safety concern...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the EREMA recycling process (the EREMA Multi-Purpose Reactor (MPR), EREMA Basic and EREMA Advanced technologies), with <b>EU</b> <b>register</b> number RECYC 0134. The input to this process is hot washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5 % PET from non-food consumer applications. In the MPR technology, post-consumer washed and dried PET flakes are heated in a continuous reactor under vacuum. The EREMA MPR decontamination technology can be combined with an extrusion line for pellets or sheet (EREMA Basic) or with an additional reactor (EREMA Advanced). The decontamination efficiency of the main continuous reactor (EREMA MPR technology) {{was determined by the}} challenge test. The Panel noted that this reactor is the critical step that determines the decontamination efficiency of these three EREMA technologies. The operating parameters controlling its performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure and residence time. It was demonstrated that, depending on the operating conditions, the recycling process under evaluation is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 mu g/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for infants, and 0. 15 mu g/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for toddlers, when recycled PET is used at up to 100 %.

The input to the process is hot caustic washed PET flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET bottles and containing no more than 5 % of PET from non-food consumer applications. In this process, washed post-consumer PET flakes are dried with desiccant air at high temperature before being extruded at high temperature and vacuum into pellets. The amorphous pellets are crystallised and solid state polymerised. Having examined the results of the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the three steps, pre-drying and drying, extrusion and crystallisation and SSP are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters to control the performance of these critical steps are temperature, gas flow and residence time for the pre-drying and drying step 2, temperature, pressure and residence time for extrusion step 3 and crystallisation and SSP step 4. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below the conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 μg/kg food. The Panel concluded that the recycled PET obtained from the process FPR intended to be used at up to 100 % for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill is not considered of safety concern.

The decontamination efficiency of the process was demonstrated by a challenge test. The input of this process is washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, mainly bottles, containing no more than 5 % of PET from non-food consumer applications. In this technology, washed and dried PET flakes are preheated before being submitted to solid-state polycondensation (SSP) in a continuous reactor at high temperature under vacuum and gas flow. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the preheating (step 2) and the decontamination in the continuous SSP reactor (step 3) are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control their performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure, residence time and gas flow for step 2 and 3. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process under evaluation, using the Starlinger Decon technology, is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 lg/kg food. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process intended to be used up to 100 % for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill, is not considered of safety concern.
