5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic <b>influence,</b> <b>as</b> the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E

5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} <b>influence,</b> <b>as</b> there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|From the 6th to 3rd century BC, Bahrain {{was part}} of the Persian Empire ruled by the Achaemenian dynasty. By about 250 BC, Parthia brought the Persian Gulf under its control and {{extended}} its <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> far as Oman.

5|$|George IV came to {{the throne}} in 1820 {{intending}} to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain. George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions. George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E

He also helped quell violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|Taiko have a mythological {{origin in}} Japanese folklore, but {{historical}} records suggest that taiko {{were introduced to}} Japan through Korean and Chinese cultural <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> early as the 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the Kofun period.

5|$|Angkor, {{the seat}} of the Khmer Empire was {{subjected}} to Vietnamese <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> early as the 13th century. Vietnamese influence spread gradually and indirectly, and {{it was not until the}} early 19th century that Vietnam exercised direct control. In 1813, Nak Ong Chan gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a protectorate. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese ‘province’. Throughout the 1830s, Vietnam attempted to erase Khmer culture, which had derived the basis of Cambodian society, dress and religion from India rather than China. The trend of Vietnamese dominance continued during French colonization, under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its southern cone (which would later be Saigon, the Mekong Delta and Tây Ninh) to the Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia had lost during the previous centuries.|$|E
5|$|As {{a patron}} of poets and authors James V (r. 1513–42) {{supported}} William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose.

George Buchanan (1506–82) had a major <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century. Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland (1537–95), reformer Andrew Melville (1545–1622), John Johnston (1570?–1611) and David Hume of Godscroft (1558–1629).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the events}} of the summer, Alonso made a {{confident}} start to the season and both his peers and the press praised his strength of character, citing his <b>influence</b> <b>as</b> a factor in the team's strong opening to the season. Alonso's importance to the team was further underlined when he scored the only goal, through a deflection, in a 0–1 victory against Chelsea, making Liverpool the first away team to win at Stamford Bridge in over four years. Statistical analysis reflected Alonso's good form: on 11 December, figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1,000 successful passes in the season. His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1–3 away win at Hull City on 25 April, striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall.|$|E
