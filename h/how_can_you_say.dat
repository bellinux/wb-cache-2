He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> such a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop.

[...] "I was very {{conflicted}} about it," [...] Truesdale later said. [...] "But I worked for the NLRB for almost 50 years. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> no?" [...] The administration's rationale for picking Truesdale was his acceptability to employers, conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress as well as a desire to avoid the contentious relationship Gould had with these groups during his tenure as chair. Administration officials also hoped Truesdale would smooth relationships among NLRB members themselves, who often had an unhappy relationship with Gould.|$|E

This resulted in him missing out by one stroke on an 18-hole playoff with Hale Irwin and Mike Donald. Faldo refused {{to come to the}} press tent after his final round and later, en route to the locker room, snapped at a journalist who suggested that he had hit his putt too hard on the final green.

In an interview with East Coast Rocker, Joey explained: [...] "What Reagan did was fucked up. Everybody told him not to go, all his people told him not to go, and he went anyway. How can you fuckin' forgive the Holocaust? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> 'Oh well, it's OK now?' That's crazy!"

[...] "We'd just had these skinheads at or gigs, punks walking around wearing swastikas." [...] Johnny disliked the song and went so far as to never play the song live, saying Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime.|$|E

[...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero.

He {{was one of the}} Wu scholars who debated with Zhuge Liang over Sun Quan's decision to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao before the Battle of Red Cliffs. Lu Ji argued, [...] "Even though Cao Cao controls the Emperor and holds sway over the lords, he is still a descendant of the chancellor Cao Shen. Liu Bei may be a descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan, but there is no proof for this. As far as we see, he {{is no more than a}} straw mat weaver and shoe seller. How can he compete with Cao Cao?" [...] Zhuge Liang replied, [...] "Aren't you the 'Young Man Lu' who hid oranges in his sleeve at Yuan Shu's house? Please sit down and listen to me. Since Cao Cao is a descendant of Chancellor Cao, he is therefore a subject of the Han Empire. However, he monopolises state power and bullies the Emperor. This is a disgrace to his ancestor. He is not only a villain of the Han Empire, but also a miscreant of the Cao family! Liu Bei is a member of the imperial clan. His Majesty the Emperor checked the family records and granted him a title. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> there is no proof? Emperor Gaozu started off as a minor patrol officer, but yet he became an Emperor eventually. What is disgraceful about weaving straw mats and selling shoes? Your opinions are those of a child.

2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y.

College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E

The letter is also notable for mentioning {{the role of}} women in churches, that for instance they must remain silent (1 Cor. 11:2-16, 14:34-35), and the role of prophecy and speaking tongues in churches. After discussing his views on worshipping idols, Paul finally ends with his views on resurrection. He states that Christ died for our sins, and was buried, and rose on the third day according to the scriptures (1 Cor. 15:3). Paul then asks: [...] "Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> some of <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that there is no resurrection of the dead?"

In the litigious society that we live, it has become more important to find someone {open_quotes}at fault{close_quotes} for an accident than it is to find out <b>how</b> we <b>can</b> prevent it from ever happening again. Most successful companies subscribe to the theme that {open_quotes}all accidents can be prevented. {close_quotes} They institute training and qualification programs, safe performance incentives, and culture-change-driven directorates such as the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); yet we still see construction accidents that result in lost time, and occasionally death, which is extremely costly in the shortsighted measure of money and, in real terms, impact to the worker`s family. Workers need to be properly trained in safety and health protection before they are assigned to a job that may expose them to safety and health hazards. A management committed to improving worker safety and health will bring about significant results in terms of financial savings, improved employee morale, enhanced communities, and increased production. But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> this happen, <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> Reduction in injury and lost workdays are the rewards.
