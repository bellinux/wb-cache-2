40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to propose a model capable to provide, by <b>the</b> {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical series <b>of</b> municipal solid waste disposed of in landfills, sufficiently reliable <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> this type of waste being disposed of in landfills in the future. The forecasting model proposed draws from the consideration that a landfill facility could be placed only in an area satisfying specific requirements, for example with regard to geological, hygienic, landscape and urban matters. Since eligible areas are limited, a natural limit to <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> dumping ground exists. <b>The</b> main assumption <b>of</b> this study is that <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> waste disposed of in landfills follows a trend that can be described with <b>the</b> mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Logistic function. <b>The</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical series describing <b>the</b> streams <b>of</b> municipal solid waste landfilled in Italy are used as input data.

40|$|Data Assimilation through Kalman {{filtering}} [1, 2] is {{a powerful}} statistical tool which allows to combine modeling and observations to increase <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> knowledge of a given system. We apply this technique to <b>the</b> <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> solar wind parameters (proton speed, proton temperature, absolute value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field and proton density) at 1 AU, using the model described in [3] and ACE data as observations. The model, which relies on GOES 12 observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meridional slice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun covered by coronal holes, grants 1 -day and 6 -hours in advance <b>forecasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned <b>quantities</b> in quiet times (CMEs are not taken into account) during <b>the</b> declining phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar cycle and is tailored for specific time intervals.

40|$|This study aims at {{developing}} an intra-firm prediction market system for obtaining {{not only a}} point estimate but also a continuous <b>forecast</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demand <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> a certain product in a future time period based on <b>the</b> collective knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm's sales people. The system uses the variable-interval prediction security (VIPS) as the prediction security to be traded in the market, and possesses a computerized market maker which evaluates each unit of VIPS with a Gaussian price density and updates the price density function, or the forecast distribution, intermittently every time a certain condition is met according to the transactions in the market. In earlier work, a market maker with a simple weighted average updating logic {{has been found to}} be vulnerable to arbitrage. Thus, this paper refines the market maker by introducing the inventory-based updating logic and book value constraint in order to fix the vulnerability.

The forecast has been prepared basing on <b>the</b> many-year <b>of</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> water and, methods of mining operations applied in the said mine in consideration with the planned changes in the main drainage system. Hitherto <b>the</b> projects <b>of</b> closing down a coal mine have concentrated mainly on <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety conditions in mines neighbouring this mine. However the more frequent idea <b>of</b> changing <b>the</b> existing water – drainage station with submersible pumps requires detail defining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groundwater regime which occurs after <b>the</b> partial flooding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underground workings. <b>The</b> <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> water in <b>the</b> closing down mine described in the article may be useful not only to asses <b>the</b> scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> danger in neighbouring mines but also for making <b>the</b> optimum selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submersible pumps along with their piping system.

40|$|Thisstudy isconcernedwith {{the impact}} that {{inaccuracy}} in <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent variable and one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independent variables has on the price elasticityof demand estimate. Two diagnostics- the regression coefficient bounds and the bias correction factor- are introduced to assess the effect that such measurement errors have on <b>the</b> estimated coefficients <b>of</b> demand relationships. In considering the demand for diesel fuel per acre by farmers in the United States, both <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> demanded and <b>the</b> price data available contain measurement error. The regression coefficient bounds diagnostic is used to indicate a range over which the true price responsiveness of farmers to changes in energy prices lies. The results suggest that each 1 percent increase (decrease) in <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> energy will result in between a 1. 15 and 0. 26 percent decrease (increase) in <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> diesel fuel demanded. The bias correction factor is computed to evaluate <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underestimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diesel fuel <b>quantity</b> demanded per acre {{to a change in}} <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> output and precipita-tion. For <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> output, <b>the</b> underestima-tion is approximately 61 percent while for precipitation, it is 45 percent.

40|$|We {{consider}} a basic model of multi-period trading, {{which can be}} used to evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a trading strategy. We describe a framework for single-period optimization, where the trades in each period are found by solving a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk, transaction cost and holding cost such as the borrowing cost for shorting assets. We then describe a multi-period version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trading method, where optimization is used to plan a sequence of trades, with only the first one executed, using estimates of future quantities that are unknown when the trades are chosen. The single-period method traces back to Markowitz; the multi-period methods trace back to model predictive control. Our contribution is to describe the single-period and multi-period methods in one simple framework, giving a clear description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development and the approximations made.
