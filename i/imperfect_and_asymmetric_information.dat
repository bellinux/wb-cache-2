40|$|ABSTRACT Wine varies {{greatly in}} price and quality. In the limited sample we study here, 2001 California Cabernet Sauvignon wines rated by {{an expert in}} Wine Spectator, price ranges from $ 7 to $ 300 per bottle. Similarly, quality ratings on a 100 -point scale range from 68 to 96 points. Our purpose here is twofold. First, we wish to {{estimate}} empirically a relationship between price and quality rating. Second, we hope to provide a discussion of characteristics of wine markets that might help refocus theoretical economic research on the wine price-quality relationship. Specifically, we suggest a movement away from hedonic pricing methods and their reliance on assumptions of competitive markets and perfect information. Rather, we suggest that <b>imperfect</b> competition <b>and</b> <b>imperfect,</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information</b> characterize wine markets, and that the theoretical underpinnings of empirical work need to recognize this fact. The Wine Price-Quality Relationship in the Wine Literature Most explorations {{of the relationship between}} wine price and wine quality appeal to hedonic pricing, where the price of a good is a function of its characteristics (Lancaster, 1966; Rosen, 1974).

30|$|Another {{strand of}} {{research}} compares the tenure-earning profiles across groups of workers. The {{idea is that}} the profiles should be steeper in situations where <b>imperfect</b> monitoring <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information</b> make the use of deferred compensation necessary to motivate workers. Lazear and Moore (1984) compare independent contractors (in business for themselves) and employees doing the same job. They argue that the extent of deferred compensation can be examined by this comparison because the employer has an incentive to rearrange the compensation for employees but that self-employment eliminates any reason to defer compensation. Indeed, the earnings profile of the employees emerges as much steeper supporting the presence of deferred compensation for the employees. Kotlikoff and Gohkale (1992) compare sales workers with more nearly verifiable productivity with their managers with less clearly verifiable productivity. The earnings profiles of the managers show greater deferred compensation with earnings below productivity early in career and above productivity late in their career. The earnings of sales workers essentially match their productivity over their career.|$|R

We organize the discussion around three "grand themes" that reveal {{the richness of}} agricultural development as an intellectual endeavor. First, we explore the role of agriculture in the broader development process from a macroeconomic and political economy perspective. We then examine the role of technological and institutional change in successful agricultural development. Finally, the focus turns to a microeconomic perspective on agricultural household decision making and the problems of <b>imperfect</b> <b>and</b> missing markets, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> transactions costs that lead to widespread apparent inefficiency and disequilibrium.

40|$|The author shows that, {{in credit}} relationships, {{the choice of}} a lender may become a {{determinant}} of the extent of competition in downstream industries. In the presence of <b>imperfect</b> output markets <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information</b> in financial markets, members of an industry may achieve a partial collusion in the output market by borrowing from the same bank. In an oligopoly, debt is procompetitive as it gives incentives to the borrowing firm to undertake an aggressive output strategy. As both firms borrow, the industry becomes more competitive and riskier. The firms' debt value is decreased. A common lender can better control these incentive effects and hence limit the extent of competition in the output market. ...|$|R

40|$|Public {{economics}} studies how government taxing {{and spending}} activities affect the economy—economic efficiency {{and the distribution}} of income and wealth. This comprehensive text on public economics covers the core topics of market failure and taxation as well as recent developments in both policy and the academic literature. It is unique not only in its broad scope but in its balance between public finance and public choice and its combination of theory and relevant empirical evidence. The book covers the theory and methodology of public economics; presents a historical and theoretical overview of the public sector; and discusses such topics as departures from efficiency (including <b>imperfect</b> competition <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information),</b> issues in political economy, equity, taxation, fiscal federalism, and tax competition among independent jurisdictions. Suggestions for further reading, from classic papers to recent research, appear in each chapter, as do exercises. The mathematics has been kept to a minimum without sacrificing intellectual rigor; the book remains analytical rather than discursive. This second edition has been thoroughly updated throughout. It offers new chapters on behavioral economics, limits to redistribution, international taxation, cost-benefit analysis, and the economics of climate policy. Additional exercises have been added and many sections revised in response to advice from readers of the first edition...|$|R
40|$|Case {{studies of}} self-enforcing {{cooperation}} in repeated interactions usually {{find that the}} punishments inflicted on deviators are mild to start with, and increase only if {{there is evidence of}} persistent deviation. We model this using a combination of <b>imperfect</b> monitoring <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information</b> in a one-sided prisoner’s dilemma. Call the player with the temptation to cheat player B, and the other player A. Player B can be one of several types, distinguished by the size of this temptation; B’s type is his private information. A’s payoff may be high or low, and the probability of a low payoff is higher if B has cheated. If player A receives the low payoff, he can inflict an immediate punishment on B, at a cost to himself. We find that A’s optimal choice of punishment is generally a non-concave problem, and the comparative statics can be discontinuous <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric.</b> If the temptation of each type of B is non-stochastic, A’s optimal choice of punishment is not lowered after a high payoff, and may be raised or lowered after a bad payoff depending on the prior distribution of B’s types. With stochastic temptations, as the prior probability of B being a bad type increases, the optimal level of punishment chosen by A is initially low and decreasing, but then jumps to a higher level and increases further thereafter, and for very high levels of this probability the relationship may be terminated. Non-extreme levels of punishment are most informative about B’s type, and the value of this information to A is highest when the prior probabilities are also non-extreme. ∗ This is an extremely preliminary statement of work still in progress.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in public economics {{have largely been}} {{in the direction of}} reaffirming the limits of the market and of establishing new ones. The possible existence of fundamental non-convexities, <b>imperfect</b> <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information,</b> incentive compatibility, imperfect competition, strategic complementarity, and scale economies led to the conclusion that a large set of market failures exist; such situations also imply government failure. Acocella, considers this complicated picture and provides a discussion of the different approaches to establishing social 'rankings' of the possible situations and the underlying principles. The arguments for and against different institutions are then analysed at a micro and macroeconomic level. The market and the government are recognised as imperfect, and thus complementary, institutions. Specific policy targets and instruments are considered in the areas of micro and macro-economic policy. Special attention is devoted to questions of policy management in an open economy. Finally, problems of domestic and international policy co-ordination are considered...|$|E

40|$|One vital {{means of}} raising energy {{efficiency}} is to introduce district heating in industry. The {{aim of this}} paper is to study factors which promote and inhibit district heating collaborations between industries and utilities. The human factors involved showed to affect district heating collaborations more than anything else does. Particularly risk, <b>imperfect</b> <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information,</b> credibility and trust, inertia and values are adequate variables when explaining the establishment or failure of industry-energy utility collaborations, while heterogeneity, access to capital and hidden costs appear to be of lower importance. A key conclusion from this study is that in an industry-energy utility collaboration, it is essential to nurture the business relationship. In summary, successful collaboration depends more on the individuals and organizations involved in the relationship between the two parties than on the technology used in the collaboration.

40|$|The {{potential}} for {{increased energy efficiency}} in shipping is evident. Still, ship owners appear reluctant to act on these seemingly cost-efficient measures. This situation is seen in many sectors and is commonly called an "energy-efficiency gap". Decades of research in other sectors have focused on developing taxonomy of barriers using a multitude of research frameworks; from mainstream neo [...] classical economics, to organizational theory and social psychology. Research has been directed to informing policy makers as well as managers of firms.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a stochastic interaction model based on Gibbs random fields to analyze technological competition {{in a population}} of heterogeneous adopters with local or global externalities. The relationships between both heterogeneity and externalities and <b>imperfect</b> <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information</b> are first emphasized. When local externalities and heterogeneity coexist, the technological landscapes of the industry are then shown {{to depend on the}} relative influence of these two parameters, with a phase transition: technologies coexist either in approximately equal market shares when heterogeneity is high enough or with one of the technologies only surviving in technological niches when local externalities dominate. Niches do also spontaneously appear: technological options survive in economic space due to the existence of some amount of heterogeneity among agents. On the contrary, when global externalities are added, pure standardization almost always occurs. We finally argue that different public policies should be designed so as to fit with different technological landscapes.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the ways an independent Central Bank committed to medium term achievement {{of a mixed}} objective can manage its short term degrees of freedom. We suppose <b>imperfect</b> <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information</b> between a Bank playing leader in a Stackelberg game and agents reacting to its initiatives. Agents are heterogeneous according their inflationary expectations and their aversion to inflation: once combined those two characteristics determine the relative weight of bulls and bears in the economy. Central Banks adapts its dynamical path to the initial distribution of opinions, but also influences inflation aversion and animal spirits by its previous actions. The style of monetary policy the Bank chooses to implement is not independent {{of the nature and}} the transformation of opinions of Agents. This policy can be of a Lucasian style: in this case, the Bank through its actions has to convince agents that there is an inverse relationship between inflation and growth. It can as well be of a renewed Phillips ' style: in this case, agents consider that, even in a world where time-inconsistencies are not costless, an adequate level of inflation does not preclude growth. These two kinds of monetary policies are both associated to the gradual improvement of the confidence that Central bank is able to generate during its medium term mandate...|$|E
40|$|A revisitation of the {{peculiar}} Breit-Lange model of 1934, where production was organized in large self-managed trusts. In order {{to break the}} market power and the restrictive tendencies of the latter, a peculiar institution was envisaged, that of workers’ right {{to become a member}} of the trust of his choice. I discuss in particular the following issues: where did Breit and Lange took this peculiar institution from? What would happen in a market economy, socialist or otherwise, in case of introduction of such an institution? As to the first question it turned out that the feature of employment on demand was typical, with different connotations, of a family of non-Marxian socialist models, following that of Marx’s arch-enemy Eugen Dühring. In Breit and Lange however an important aspect of these models is missing, the belief of the lack of justification of land rent and the belief that free access to land, unhindered by rent, could provide a kind of “outside option”, allowing to avoid both the miseries of unemployment and those of industrial employment, a sort of reversal of the process of expulsion from land following the enclosures. In the specific world of Breit and Lange, there no such a need, since full employment is automatically guaranteed, together with self-management, in the industrial economy. As to the introduction of some form of employment on demand providing a guaranteed outside option for the unemployed, this seems a fascinating idea, but one that could not work in practice because of the specificities of the employment relationship and of the consequences of <b>imperfect</b> <b>and</b> <b>asymmetric</b> <b>information...</b>|$|E
