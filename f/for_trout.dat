40|$|Growth and {{condition}} were analysed <b>for</b> brown <b>trout</b> from the streams from Coruh Basin, Norteastrean Turkey from summer to Fall in 2008. There were slightly variability both length and weight <b>for</b> brown <b>trout</b> among the streams. The highest instantenous Growth rate for Length (GFL) and total weight (GW) occured between 0 and 1 age for all streams with highest values in Kocun Bogazi stream. The lowest condition coefficient (K) <b>for</b> brown <b>trout</b> {{was observed in}} Cenker stream with mean value of 1. 16 whereas the highest value was recorded in Yagli stream with mean value of 1. 24 and there was statistical differences among the streams with analyses of one-way ANOVA (p< 0. 05). Also, length-weight relationship was calculated <b>for</b> brown <b>trout</b> from streams. It varied 3. 008 - 3. 166. Fishes in streams of Cenker and Mulk displayed isometric growth whereas those in other streams had positive allometric growth characteristic. Von Bertalanffy equation also was calculated to analyse growth in length <b>for</b> brown <b>trout.</b> Variability in growth and nutrition <b>for</b> brown <b>trout</b> among the stream might be attributed to physical envirionmental variables...|$|R
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek was {{historically}} {{stocked with}} trout from {{near the border}} between Columbia County and Schuylkill County downstream {{to the mouth of}} the creek. The creek was surveyed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission nine times between 1939 and 1985. The first survey was performed in 1936. This {{was the first time that}} the creek was recommended <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> stocking.

5|$|The lake is {{well known}} <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> fishing from its banks and the fleet of 18 rowing boats for hire. The suction tanks which {{originally}} supplied water to the steam boilers for the pumping engines are now used as rearing pools for the fish before they are transferred into the lake.

5|$|From Alaska to Northern California, coastal {{cutthroat}} trout in sea-run, resident stream and lacustrine forms are sought by anglers. Puget Sound in Washington is a stronghold of sea-run {{cutthroat trout}} fishing with its many tributaries and protected saltwater inlets and beaches. Fly anglers search for sea-run cutthroat trout along beaches, river mouths and estuaries year round. In the lower reaches of larger rivers, anglers in drift boats float the rivers searching <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> along the wooded shorelines. In {{addition to a}} cutthroat trout sport fishery managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Federal Subsistence Management Program manages coastal cutthroat trout subsistence fisheries in Southeast Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek {{was found by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to have good {{temperatures}} <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> habitation, {{but there was no}} aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek {{is considered to be a}} cold-water fishery between its headwaters and its confluence with Rattling Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Water-based {{recreation}} {{is available}} near the pass as well, {{particularly on the}} Roaring Fork side. At the Grottos climbing cliffs eight miles (14.4km) {{to the west of}} the pass, a short trail leads to an area along the river known as the Devil's Punchbowl, with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls. It is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters. The river is popular with anglers casting <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> as well, and some even make the hike from the pass up to Blue Lake for its lake and cutthroat trout stocks.|$|E

5|$|Still {{other animals}} seem to thrive {{regardless}} of the maturity of the forest or {{the presence of the}} understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to timber rattlesnake, eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled fritillary, monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.|$|E

The barons built summer cottages on both streams, fished <b>for</b> <b>trout</b> in the waters, and built small dams for recreational swimming and ice skating.
