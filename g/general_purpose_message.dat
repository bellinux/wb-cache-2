Building on <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>messaging</b> system software (NaradaBrokering) and generalized collaboration services (GlobalMMCS), we are developing a diverse set of interoperable capabilities. These include dynamic information systems for managing short-lived collaborative service collections (“gaggles”), stream filters to support the integration of Geographical Information Systems services with data analysis applications, streaming video to support collaborative geospatial maps with time-dependent data, and video stream playback and annotation services to enable scientific collaboration...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} prototype implementation of Cross-Application signaling protocol (CASP). CASP [2] is a general-purpose protocol for managing state information in network devices. It {{can be used}} for inter-domain and intra-domain QoS signaling, configuration of middle-boxes, for collecting measurement data and any other application where state management is required. The framework for CASP is defined as a modular protocol, which includes a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>messaging</b> layer (M-layer), that in turn supports a number of client layers for particular signaling applications (e. g. QoS, MIDCOM). There is also a special purpose client component for next-peer discovery. My objective in this project was to implement a secure interface for a CASP implementation using OpenSSL [6] library, to develop some of the functionality for Messaging layer and to integrate various components of CASP prototype developed by others involved in CASP development [5]. 1...|$|R
40|$|In all-to-all {{personalized}} communication (AAPC), every node of {{a parallel}} system sends a potentially unique packet {{to every other}} node. AAPC is an important primitive operation for modern parallel compilers, since {{it is used to}} redistribute data structures during parallel computations. As an extremely dense communication pattern, AAPC causes congestion in many types of networks and therefore executes very poorly on <b>general</b> <b>purpose,</b> asynchronous <b>message</b> passing routers. We present and evaluate a network architecture that executes allto -all communication optimally on a two-dimensional torus. The router combines optimal partitions of the AAPC step with a selfsynchronizing switching mechanism integrated into a conventional wormhole router. Optimality is achieved by routing along shortest paths while fully utilizing all links. A simple hardware addition for synchronized message switching can guarantee optimal AAPC routing in many existing network architectures. The flexible communication a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Currently many {{interconnection}} {{networks and}} parallel algorithms exist for message passing computers. Users of these machines wish {{to determine which}} message passing computer is best for a given job, {{and how it will}} scale with the number of processors and algorithm size. This paper describes a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> simulator for <b>message</b> passing multiprocessors (Parsim), which facilitates system modelling. A structured method for simulator design has been used which gives Parsim the ability to easily simulate different topologies and algorithm combinations. This is illustrated by applying Parsim to a number of algorithms on a variety of topologies. Parsim is then used to predict the performance of the new IBM SP 2 parallel computer, with topologies ranging up to 1024 processors.
