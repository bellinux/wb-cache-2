25|$|The {{pilot of}} Santa Cruz, John P. Hamill {{identified}} Cuyahoga, and {{neither he nor}} the ship's Captain Abdelardo Albornoz were concerned as the two ships appeared to be passing port-to-port. When the two vessels were 1,200yards apart Cuyahoga turned west, {{into the path of}} Santa Cruz, to enter the Potomac River to moor for the night. Hamill immediately sounded Santa Cruzs whistle signaling that he would maintain course and speed and that the cutter should return to its original course. After waiting 30 seconds without any response from Cuyahoga Hamill sounded a <b>danger</b> <b>warning</b> of five short blasts.|$|E

50|$|A {{heat wave}} {{commenced}} on July 7, with temperatures in inland locations, {{such as the}} Central Valley soaring above 115 F. Lake Berryessa recorded a high temperature of 126 F, prompting weather agencies like the National Weather Service to issue high fire <b>danger</b> <b>warnings.</b> These near to record-breaking temperatures concerned many firefighters, who feared that the high heat, low humidity, and high-elevation winds could make firefighting more strenuous.|$|R
50|$|Some {{proponents of}} {{stranger}} danger propose telling children {{that it is}} safe to talk to strangers in circumstances where the child is in danger, such as if the child is lost or injured. In such circumstances, avoiding potentially helpful strangers could, itself, be dangerous. Conversely, other proponents of stranger <b>danger</b> <b>warnings</b> propose teaching children never to approach others without parental permission. This admonishment extends to not entering a car, even if the child recognizes the driver.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to stranger <b>danger</b> <b>warnings,</b> programs from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, {{local law enforcement}} agencies and other organizations offer free fingerprinting services usually done in schools, child care centers, shopping malls, fairs, and festivals. Parents/guardians are provided with child identification sheets to use in cases of child abduction and other emergencies. Child identification sheets include the child's fingerprints, photo and other personal data. Neither the FBI nor any other law enforcement agency retains this information. DNA samples are also provided to parents.|$|R

Gretna was at the time one of 21 towns in Tasmania with permanent <b>danger</b> <b>warnings</b> on their water supply.|$|R
50|$|Civil Emergency Message (SAME CODE: CEM) is {{a warning}} created by the National Weather Service meant to warn of an in-progress or {{imminent}} significant threat(s) to public safety and/or property. The CEM is a higher priority message than the Local Area Emergency (LAE), but the hazard is less specific than the Civil <b>Danger</b> <b>Warning</b> (CDW). For example, the CEM {{could be used to}} describe an alert issued by the National Terrorism Advisory System.|$|E

50|$|Law Enforcement Warning (SAME CODE: LEW) is {{a warning}} created by the National Weather Service meant to replace the {{issuance}} of Civil Emergency Messages and Civil <b>Danger</b> <b>Warnings</b> {{for the purpose of}} bomb explosions, jailbreaks, riots, or other criminal events. Law Enforcement Warnings are issued by a public official such as a police office, or county emergency management, and relayed by the NWS with the Emergency Alert System (EAS) tone and SAME heading. During a Law Enforcement Warning, an authorized law enforcement agency may blockade roads, waterways, or facilities, evacuate or deny access to affected areas, and arrest violators or suspicious persons.|$|R

50|$|Civil <b>Danger</b> <b>Warning</b> (SAME CODE: CDW) is {{a warning}} issued by {{authorized}} public officials in the United States and is relayed by the National Weather Service for an event that presents a danger to a significant civilian population. The CDW, which usually warns of a specific hazard and gives specific protective action, has a higher priority than the Local Area Emergency (LAE). Examples include contaminated water supply, major accidents, and imminent or in-progress military or terrorist attack. Public protective actions could include evacuation, shelter in place, or other actions. Related warnings such as an Evacuation Immediate (EVI) or Shelter in Place Warning (SPW) may follow.|$|E
5000|$|ANSI Z535-style {{communications}} {{are becoming}} more prevalent in society. Identified by {{their use of the}} signal words <b>DANGER,</b> <b>WARNING,</b> CAUTION, NOTICE, or SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS, ANSI-style signs most often include specific details {{about the nature of the}} hazard, the consequence of interaction with the hazard, and avoidance procedures. Product manufacturers and facility owners in a wide array of industries use the ANSI Z535 standards in their efforts to assure a safer workplace and the safe use of their products so both accidents and lawsuits are minimized. The ANSI Z535 standards are often cited in U.S. court decisions as the state-of-the-art benchmark against which safety markings and their adequacy are judged.|$|E
50|$|Both the Vienna Convention and the Geneva Protocol {{reflected}} a common consensus on road traffic signs that evolved primarily in Europe in the mid-20th century. Most jurisdictions outside Europe have not adopted either treaty, and maintain their own systems of road traffic signals. For example, the U.S. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) {{does not follow}} the symbol policy espoused by the Vienna Convention; for example signs for speed limits and forbidden parking {{are among the most}} visible differences. In order to make it accepted in as many countries as possible, the convention allows some variations, for example <b>danger</b> <b>warning</b> signs can have triangular or square diamond shape and road markings can be white or yellow.|$|E
