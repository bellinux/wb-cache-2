5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which <b>helps</b> <b>students</b> from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that <b>helps</b> <b>students</b> to participate in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is more effective than the other.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This <b>helps</b> <b>students</b> gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

40|$|The Living Consensus {{framework}} includes five key {{teaching and}} learning strategies that are facilitated through student-centred learning. This means that students are involved in activities and discussion during their programme of study. The students are involved in many decisions with the teacher about how we should work together as a class. This way of working with <b>students</b> <b>helps</b> develop personal skills and attitudes that can be transferred to other learning experiences and their future workplaces. These skills include: Independent learning skills that <b>help</b> the <b>students</b> learn to think and act for themselves and show initiative in the workplace. Problem solving skills that <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to think through and solve problems they may see in the work place. Team work will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to learn to work in teams like they will do in the workplace. Developing an understanding of different cultures and world views will <b>help</b> the <b>students</b> {{to work with people}} from other countries and understand customers from around the world. Developing ethical practice will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> think about and agree on how they should conduct themselves in a global workplace. This will help prepare them for business with people from around the world. Developing self-awareness will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to notice when they could be doing something better and enable them to self-correct their practice or behaviour when necessary. Self-direction will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to set and achieve their own goals for learning and the workplace. Employers in New Zealand look for graduates with these skills and attitudes. During this presentation we will talk about the five key strategies that <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to develop them. ...|$|R
