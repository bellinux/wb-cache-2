Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead <b>designer</b> for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and <b>designer,</b> he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead <b>designer.</b> Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a <b>designer</b> was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to examine the male and female <b>designer’s</b> {{cognitive}} pattern during the conceptual stage of design process. We proposed the linkography approach in order to study the cognitive behaviour for both male and female <b>designers</b> by capturing their monologue, gestures and eye-movement data during the conceptual stage of design process. The obtained data was then will be further analysed by constructing a linkograph pattern. The commonalities and differences between male and female <b>designer’s</b> cognitive pattern will be studied based on their linkograph pattern. The results of the research concluded that female <b>designers</b> have a lower chance for idea generation in terms of novelty than male <b>designers</b> because female <b>designers</b> have a higher number of web link patterns than male <b>designers.</b> Secondly, based on the number of link pattern of sawtooth, male has a higher chance for new ideal development than female because male <b>designers</b> have a higher number of sawtooth. Lastly, male <b>designers</b> tend to have more opportunities for development of good ideas than female <b>designers</b> based on their number of ‘chunk link’ pattern because male <b>designers</b> have higher number of chunk compared to female <b>designers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The design {{industry}} {{like any}} other industry could benefit from process support for its practitioners. However, what constitutes legitimate process support for <b>designers</b> is a difficult research question. In order to support <b>designers</b> in their processes, first one needs to know what <b>designers</b> do. This {{is not only a}} question of knowing what <b>designers</b> do in general, but also what particular <b>designers</b> do in their own individual design practice. How to find out what <b>designers</b> do, that is, how to acquire knowledge about their design processes, is also a difficult research question. Providing process support for <b>designers</b> is seen as a task, which cannot be divorced from design process acquisition. That is, one is unlikely to provide process support, without acquiring an understanding, what individual <b>designers</b> actually do, and conversely, one is unlikely to acquire an understanding of what <b>designers</b> do, without providing process support for <b>designers.</b> An application whose goal it is to provide both design process support for <b>designers</b> working in collaborative design teams, and also acquires a particular type of design process representation of design processes, is described...|$|R
