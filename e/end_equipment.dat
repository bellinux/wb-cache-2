There are no NRE costs and the final design is completed much faster than that of a custom, fixed logic device.|$|E

A pawnshop in a low-income neighborhood that pays a customer $300 for a power amplifier with a used value of $2000 {{may find the}} unit hard to sell alongside much less expensive merchandise. They may sell the amplifier to a used audio equipment store whose customers expect higher <b>end</b> <b>equipment.</b> Some pawnshops sell specialty items online, on eBay or other websites.

The Washington-Chicago Express required a leisurely 18Â½ hours for its 767 mi journey, compared to the faster Capitol Limiteds 16-hour pace.

In order to keep up with growing data demands, there is a never-ending need to establish quality resources. For maintaining the quality of resources we require high processing power and high <b>end</b> <b>equipments</b> that are sometimes expensive and unavailable. In order to meet the requirements, most of the end users and organizations have been led to the deployment of Cloud Computing which offers affordability, mobility, agility, and effective use of high priced infrastructure resources with reduced cost.|$|R

50|$|The {{switches}} have {{an integrated}} time-domain reflectometer (TDR) built into every copper port, providing {{the ability to}} accomplish diagnostic monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities of the connected cables. This allows the equipment manager the ability to test and troubleshoot the cables for defects (crimped, cut, shorted or damaged cables) without {{going out to the}} switch room to test the cables from the switch to the <b>end</b> <b>equipment.</b> The tests can be accomplished on a single port or on multiple ports at the same time. The test can be accomplished through the command line or through one of several Graphical user interfaces called Device Manager (DM), Java Device Manager (JDM) or Enterprise Device Manager (EDM).|$|E
5000|$|He also {{states that}} he is most {{comfortable}} using the two-inch tape, as he is familiar with what this process does to the recordings. Processing the sound in this manner according to Gilles, gives the music the studio mixes and masters a unique thumbprint, and an authentic sound. But depending on the client request or specification, the team does use digital recordings, and {{are not limited to}} either process singularly. Big Blue Meenie has worked exclusively with Apple and uses their software Logic Pro for mixing after analog recording. Other high <b>end</b> <b>equipment</b> and devices used in the studio include an Amek Mozart RN, ADAM S3A monitors, Yamaha NSTO's, and SL1200 turntables, as well as an extensive mic locker with limited and vintage microphones, and [...] "boutique" [...] outboard equipment.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{xerography}} and {{inkjet printing}} employ a halftone process and ink to reproduce digital images on paper, digital-C is a photographic continuous tone process rather than halftone or error diffusion which are common on offset press or ink-jet. The device natively supports 24-bit RGB raster files, and is capable printing vector based files when fronted by a photographic Raster Image Processor (RIP). 24 bit color continuous-tone devices use large multitudes of colors, up to 16,777,216, {{rather than the}} small number of colors available to 4-color press and 8-color ink-jet type devices. Therefore, posterization and banding are unlikely from these types of prints when provided with a file of good integrity. Due to slight halation of the light source, digital C-prints produced on high <b>end</b> <b>equipment</b> have true continuous tones not possible with images created with ink or pigments (due to CMYK halftone limitations).|$|E

50|$|The company {{ventured into}} the high end stereo market in 1976 with the {{introduction}} of high end receivers, amplifiers, speakers, turntables and cassette players. The Optonica line as it was called, consisted of high quality and technically advanced components, that was expanded in 1979, to cover a broader selection of high <b>end</b> <b>equipment.</b> During this run, Sharp introduced digital technology to some of the Optonica products, along with the traditional analogue products, and offered a complete selection of models ranging from low power high end receivers to very powerful models. The line was again changed, in 1981, and moved mainly into digital high end, complete stereo systems with advanced technological features setting the trend towards the digital age. The line was discontinued after 1981, but the Optonica line was again re-introduced in the late 1980s for a high end line of television receivers and higher quality mass market audio products such as VCR's, surround sound receivers, CD cassette boom boxes, and portable cassette players.|$|E
5000|$|When {{cards are}} designed, {{they are given}} bleeds if color extends {{to the edge of}} the {{finished}} cut size. (A bleed is the extension of printed lines or colors beyond the line where the paper it is printed on will be cut.) This is to help ensure that the paper will cut without white edges due to very small differences in where the blade cuts the cards, and it is almost impossible to cut the cards properly without. Just being a hair off can result in white lines, and the blade itself will pull the paper while cutting. The image on the paper can also shift from page to page which is called a bounce, which is generally off by a hairline on an offset press, but can be quite large on lower <b>end</b> <b>equipment</b> such as a copier or a duplicator press. Bleeds are typically an extra 3.175 (...) to 6.35 mm ( [...] in) to all sides of the card.|$|E
5000|$|A {{patch cord}} is always fitted with {{connectors}} at both ends. A pigtail {{is similar to}} a patch cord and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. In the context of copper cabling, these cables are sometimes referred to as blunt patch cords and the non-connectorized end ("the pigtail") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. Optical fiber pigtails, in contrast to copper pigtails, can be more accurately described as a connector than a cable or cord. A fiber pigtail is a single, short, usually tight-buffered, optical fiber that has an optical connector pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end. The end of the fiber pigtail is stripped and fusion spliced to a single fiber of a multi-fiber trunk. Splicing of pigtails to each fiber in the trunk [...] "breaks out" [...] the multi-fiber cable into its component fibers for connection to the <b>end</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
