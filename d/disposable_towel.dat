Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet <b>disposable</b> <b>towel</b> of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use.

5000|$|A <b>disposable</b> <b>towel</b> (or {{non-woven}} towel) is a towel {{intended for}} a single user, but not necessarily {{for a single}} use, {{as it can be}} reused but not washed. It is often made of non-woven fibers, and popular for the hospital, hotel, geriatric and salon or beauty industries because it guarantees cleanliness and hygiene every time.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{tattooing}} {{in modern times}} is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle {{or a group of}} needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit.

50|$|<b>Disposable</b> <b>towels</b> are a {{relatively}} new invention {{in the field of}} disposable convenience products , made from nonwoven fibres. They were first popularised by the hospital supply industry, but now relatively common in resorts, hotels, beauty salons, day cares and similar fields. Their main advantage is the hygiene and cleanliness that they guarantee for each user. Often, they are made from some recycled content, and can be recycled after use. <b>Disposable</b> <b>towels</b> save hotel and salon owners times and money by preventing the necessity of washing and drying traditional, cotton towels.|$|R

5000|$|Sheath {{cleaning}} is a hygienic process occasionally {{needed by}} male horses, both geldings and stallions, wherein a caretaker, groom or veterinarian checks the horse's [...] "sheath," [...] {{the pocket of}} skin that protects the penis of the horse {{when it is not}} in use for urination (or, in the case of stallions, breeding). [...] This area may need to be cleaned, starting at a young age after breeding and the birth season, but particularly in geldings. Not only can smegma, a waxy substance that includes dirt and dead skin cells, accumulate, but some geldings (and occasionally, stallions) may also form a [...] "bean," [...] a hardened ball of smegma inside the sheath or even the urethra that, in extreme cases, can interfere with urine flow. Although a gelding retains the same beneficial microorganisms in the sheath as a stallion, they seem to accumulate smegma and other debris at a higher rate, probably because geldings rarely fully extrude the penis, and thus dirt and smegma build up in the folds of skin. [...] Thus, it is recommended that the sheath be cleaned once or twice a year. [...] Cleaning the sheath is a specialized task requiring a mild cleaner with grease-cutting properties, generally designed specifically for the process, along with warm water and many clean (usually <b>disposable)</b> <b>towels.</b> Rubber gloves for the handler are recommended, as the job is rather smelly and messy.|$|R

Therefore, field trials were carried out in a large self-service store. Comparisons were made of the various cleaning efficiencies, as determined by bacterial plate counts, of detergent and disinfectant solutions and machine cleaning oils applied with either clean cloths or <b>disposable</b> paper <b>towels</b> to items of equipment. The most satisfactory results were always obtained when anionic detergent (0 · 75 % w/v) and hypochlorite (200 p. p. m. available chlorine) solutions were applied in a `two-step' procedure...|$|R

40|$|This paper briefly {{describes}} the various stages used {{to perform the}} life cycle analysis (LCA) of a product or process. The analysis is simplified in its outputs in that it focuses only on energy usage and carbon and sulfur dioxide emissions. The main point however, is to provide examples to first year engineering and science students that illustrate the principle of LCA {{without the need for}} extensive spreadsheet analysis that is so often required. Two examples are given and are staged in their complexity. Firstly, the task of choosing which option for drying hands after washing is explored. Air drying, washable cloth <b>towel</b> and <b>disposable</b> paper <b>towels</b> are assessed based on their carbon dioxide emission. This example provides a quantitative approach to determining impacts as well as an introduction to creating flowsheets and manipulation of unit equations. The second example, dealing with the location of a manufacturing plant, extends the LCA approach to sulfur dioxide impacts at both a local and global scale. It introduces the not-in-my-back-yard (NIMBY) concept and how this might be overcome by an optimisation (minimisation) of impacts at both local and global scales...|$|R

Recent findings indicate norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis (2, 3). Of all gastroenteritis outbreaks reported in the Netherlands during 2002, 54 % were caused by norovirus (4). Norovirus is predominantly transmitted through the fecal–oral route, either indirectly through contaminated food or surfaces or directly from person to person (5). It can be transmitted through small infectious droplets (aerosols) after a vomiting episode (6, 7) and can survive for a very long time in the environment (5, 8). Most norovirus outbreaks are seen in settings where clusters of vulnerable, susceptible persons live closely together, such as nursing homes, hospitals, and daycare centers (4) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposable}} sanitary protection (sanpro) {{market in}} the UK was worth £ 373 million in 2008 (Disposable Paper Products, Key Note Ltd 2010). This huge figure does not complete the whole sanpro market however, as there are {{a wide variety of}} reusable products also available. The disposable market has a great, negative environmental impact in terms of energy to produce (‘Life Cycle Assessment of Sanitary Pads and Tampons’, Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, 2006) and end of life waste, it is therefore timely for a new, more environmentally friendly product suitable for a wide spectrum of women. This paper will investigate the essential properties and requirements of the textile required for a new sanitary product and will determine how relevant these properties are in terms of user experience both for wear and for disposal or after care. Two main products are investigated; <b>disposable</b> sanitary <b>towels</b> and reusable sanitary towels. Examining the physical characteristics such as absorbency, wicking, density and antimicrobial properties of the textile gives an indication of the suitability of the material choices. Users’ experience is also explored, as experiential data such as perceived comfort, dryness and reliability can only be determined by using the products. Research techniques have included focus groups and questionnaires. This paper will establish the key criteria for external sanitary protection based on research and investigation into traditional and newly developed textiles with a focus on the importance of women’s experience of existing product. ...|$|R
40|$|Foram realizados dois experimentos para avaliar a eficiÃncia do prÃ-dipping na reduÃÃo da contaminaÃÃo bacteriana da pele dos tetos dos animais e na contagem bacteriana do leite e a eficiÃncia de higienizaÃÃo das teteiras da ordenhadeira mecÃnica. Avaliou-se tambÃm o perfil de suscetibilidade a antimicrobianos, de Staphylococcus sp coagulase negativo isolados de amostras de leite do tanque de refrigeraÃÃo. Para avaliar a eficiÃncia do prÃ-dipping, foram escolhidos 12 animais e distribuÃdos aleatoriamente em 3 grupos. Cada grupo recebeu um tratamento quanto higienizaÃÃo dos tetos antes da ordenha: nenhuma higienizaÃÃo, higienizaÃÃo com Ãgua e secagem com papel toalha descartÃvel e prÃ-dipping com iodo e secagem com papel toalha descartÃvel. Para avaliar a eficiÃncia de higienizaÃÃo das teteiras da ordenhadeira mecÃnica, foram coletadas amostras das teteiras antes da ordenha, apÃs utilizaÃÃo em um animal, apÃs utilizaÃÃo em dois animais e apÃs utilizaÃÃo em trÃs animais. Foi realizada pesquisa participativa com um grupo de estudantes oriundos da Agricultura Familiar, durante a qual, realizou-se um mini curso intitulado Boas PrÃticas na Ordenhaâ, com aulas teÃricas e prÃticas. Durante as aulas prÃticas, os estudantes coletaram {{material}} de pontos diversos da sala de ordenha. Foi aplicado um questionÃrio referente a pontos crÃticos na ordenha para avaliar a percepÃÃo dos estudantes antes e depois do mini curso. Dados de uma questÃo foram analisados estatisticamente quanto Ã frequÃncia de escolha das respostas. Houve diferenÃa significativa de percepÃÃo antes e depois em relaÃÃo a sete respostas. No experimento que testou a eficiÃncia do prÃ-dipping houve diferenÃa significativa quanto ao nÃmero de tetos com Staphylococcus sp. e tambÃm Bacilos Gram Positivos entre os tratamentos sem higienizaÃÃo ou higienizaÃÃo com Ãgua e prÃ-dipping. Quanto Ã contagem bacteriana do leite dos quartos mamÃrios, houve diferenÃa significativa entre os tratamentos sem higienizaÃÃo e prÃ-dipping, sendo que o tratamento no qual foi utilizada apenas Ãgua manteve-se semelhante estatisticamente aos demais. No experimento que testou a eficiÃncia de higienizaÃÃo das teteiras, houve diferenÃa significativa entre as mÃdias obtidas antes da ordenha, apÃs ordenha de duas e de trÃs vacas, sendo que a mÃdia obtida apÃs ordenha de uma vaca apresentou diferenÃa significativa apenas em relaÃÃo a trÃs vacas. Quanto Ã suscetibilidade bacteriana a antimicrobianos, dos oito antimicrobianos testados, observou-se resistÃncia a cinco, em pelo menos uma amostra, sÃo eles: amoxicilina+Ãcido clavulÃnico, enrofloxacina, gentamicina, penicilina G e vancomicina, sendo que a gentamicina apresentou a maior frequÃnciaTwo {{experiments were}} carried {{to evaluate the}} efficiency of the predipping on bacterian contamination reduction of the animal teats and on the milk bacterian count, as well as the sanitation efficiency of the mechanical milking machineâs teatcups. Also has been evaluated, the profile of susceptibility to antimicrobials of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp isolated from milk samples from the refrigeration tank. To evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} pre-dipping, 12 animals were chosen and randomly divided into 3 groups. Each group received a treatment regarding the sanitation of the teats before the milking: no sanitation, sanitation using water followed by <b>disposable</b> paper <b>towel</b> drying and pre-dipping using iodine followed by <b>disposable</b> paper <b>towel</b> drying. To evaluate the sanitation efficiency of the mechanical milking machineâs teatcups, were collected samples from them before the milking, after use on an animal, after use on two animals and after use on three animals. A participatory survey was held with a group of students from Family Farming, during which was also held a mini course named âGood Practices on Milkingâ, with theoretical and practical classes. During the practical classes, the students collected material from diverse spots of the milking room. It was applied a questionnaire referent to critical points on milking to evaluate the perception of the students before and after the mini course. Data from one question was statistically analyzed as to the frequency of choice of the answers. There were different perceptions, before and after, on all seven answers. On the experiment that tested the efficiency of the predipping there was significant difference as to the number of teats with Staphylococcus sp. and also positive Gram bacilli between treatments with no sanitation or with water sanitation and predipping. As to the milk bacterian count of the mammary quarters, there was significant difference between the treatments without sanitation and pre-dipping, although the treatment with only water kept statistically similar to the others. On the experiment that tested the sanitation efficiency of the mechanical milking teatcups, there was significant difference between the averages obtained before the milking, after milking of two and three cows, although the average obtained after the milking of one cow showed significant difference only if compared to the periods with three cows. As to the bacterian susceptibility to antimicrobials, it showed resistance to five, from the eight that were tested, in at least one sample, being them: amoxilicin+clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, G penicillin and vancomycin, with the highest frequency being showed by the gentamici...|$|R
