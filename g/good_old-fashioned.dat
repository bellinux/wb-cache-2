Ramsey Isler of IGN said the emergency staff subplot working on a cure was not [...] "quite perfect parody". But he praised Kyle in the ending scene, as well as the way South Park found a new, literal twist on [...] "toilet humor" [...] by featuring rivers and tsunamis of pee. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said that the episode was overly offensive, rather than an ironic commentary on racism. Although O'Neal said previous South Park episodes like [...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson" [...] were effective, [...] "Pee" [...] and its references to minority park attendees and the Italian waterpark owner [...] "came off less like ironic racism and more as <b>good,</b> <b>old-fashioned,</b> butter-your-cornbread-with-it racism".

For too long, it was too rare to see dykes, fags, trans people, and breeders hanging out together, and Munro changed that." [...] Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy. Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, and The Gossip. At the height of the event's popularity, Munro appeared on the cover of Now magazine (made up to look similar to David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album cover), musical guests included Carole Pope, Tracy + the Plastics, Vaginal Davis, Glen Meadmore and Nina Hagen, and Vazaleen appeared on [...] "best-of" [...] nightclub lists internationally.|$|E

Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating Hellblazers John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a [...] "'post-gay' approach to sexual themes" [...] and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance. For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that [...] "unlike virtually every other TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual.

[...] The third award won for Torchwood, after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented [...] "Torchwood is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack’s case [...] "omnisexual") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it’s also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter-of-fact way.

In his review, he wrote, [...] "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of The French Connection, The Godfather, Serpico and Prince of the City – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." [...] In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, [...] "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." [...] In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars. Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that American Gangster is [...] "never dull, {{but it could have}} used more <b>good</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> melodramatic intrigue." [...] Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have [...] "a ghastly ingenuity". Empires Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was [...] "undeniably enjoyable" [...] and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that [...] "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks" [...] and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination. Slant Magazine journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was [...] "dumb as a rock", and that it was [...] "far too convinced of its import to be any fun." [...] Giving American Gangster a two out of five stars, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, [...] "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." [...] He resumed: [...] "He never has the menace of his dirty cop in Training Day, and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in Malcolm X.

Matusavage further criticized the repetition of the songs and dance routines which had been previously performed during the singer's other concerts as the tour's [...] "most notable problem". Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the singer [...] "tore through her... set with the ferocity of a grown woman who has something to prove" [...] and felt that she tried [...] "her damnedest to win the crowd over with an equal dose of sex appeal and <b>good</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> hyping" [...] further showcasing [...] "unequaled showmanship and those killer vocals" [...] which placed her {{at the top of}} R music. However Halperin criticized the show's set list mainly due to the majority of the songs from the album 4, writing, [...] "Bey sounded terrific on all, of course, but with a... ready-to-party audience angling to groove in the aisles, rather than sway with their hands to the heavens, overall it missed the mark." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey praised the high-energy nature of the show with vigorous dancing and [...] "blistering" [...] pace but felt that {{there was a lack of}} hits performed in the show's first half. NME editor Emily Mackay echoed his statements giving a mixed review for the tour, further criticizing the lack of hits in the set list and adding that only a [...] "paucity of material" [...] was incorporated in the set.

A negative review came from San Jose Mercury News Jim Harrington who called the tour [...] "flawed", criticized its set list consisting of [...] "plenty of filler" [...] and the many dissipating costume changes she went through for the show. He further noted that the singer looked and sounded well but blamed the way the show and the production were choreographed.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings from}} a research project investigating the relative data quality and administration costs for three different modes of surveying bus passengers that produce results generalizable to the full passenger population. The three modes, all of which used survey methods distributed or administered onboard the transit vehicle, were: self-complete paper surveys, self-complete online surveys, and interviewer-assisted tablet-based surveys. Results from this study indicate several implications for practitioners choosing a survey mode. First, and most importantly, the analysis reinforces the point {{that there is no}} single, best survey mode. The choice of mode must depend on an agency’s priorities for what questions most need to be answered, what population groups are most important to represent, and exactly how the agency chooses to define concepts like a “complete” survey or a “usable” address. Findings suggest several general recommendations for current survey practice: (1) online surveys administered via an invitation distributed on the transit vehicle are not a <b>good</b> option; (2) <b>old-fashioned,</b> low-tech paper survey may still be the best option for many bus passenger surveys; (3) changes in survey results that accompany changes in survey methods should be interpreted with caution; and (4) using a new survey method, especially one relying on more complex technologies, may create unexpected glitches...|$|R
6000|$|For once Wanhope {{was not to}} {{be tempted}} off on another scent. [...] "There was a <b>good</b> deal of <b>old-fashioned</b> fiction of the suspiratory and exclamatory sort, like Mackenzie's, and Sterne's and his followers, full of feeling, as people {{understood}} feeling a hundred years ago. But what Ormond rejoiced in most were the poets, good and bad, like Gray and Collins and Young, and their contemporaries, who personified nearly everything from Contemplation to Indigestion, through the whole range of the Vices, Virtues, Passions, Propensities, Attributes, and Qualities, and gave them each a dignified capital letter to wear. She said he used to come roaring to her with the passages in which these personifications flourished, and read them off with mock admiration, and then shriek and sputter with laughter. You know the way he had when a thing pleased him, especially a thing that had some relish of the quaint or rococo. As nearly as she would admit, in view of his loss, he bored her with these things. He was always hunting down some new personification, and when he had got it, adding it to the list he kept. She said he had thousands of them, but I suppose he had not so many. He had enough, though, to keep him amused, and she said he talked of writing something for the magazines about them, but probably he never would have done it. He never wrote anything, did he?"

500|$|Lage Raho Munna Bhai was an {{acclaimed}} film. Subhash K. Jha {{said that}} [...] "Munna and Circuit, arguably cinema's most adorable and roguish reformists since Laurel and Hardy go {{about the business}} of generating humour out of the pathos of the human condition. The sequences, all fiercely and famously path-breaking have us in splits [...] Watch the love-lorn Munnabhai answer a Gandhian quiz on a phone-in radio quiz with the help of kidnapped professors' it's one of the most comically animated sequences seen in the movies of the new millennium." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out five stars, calling it [...] "a sparkling example of qualitative cinema" [...] arguing that it [...] "not only entertains, it also enlightens." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India observes that [...] "Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel..." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: [...] "Like those <b>good</b> <b>old-fashioned</b> Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride." [...] Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, [...] "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both {{to the quality of the}} writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own." [...] Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it [...] "cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu without a hint of the déjà vu downer. And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year." [...] He commended the it for showing [...] "the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters. Lage [...] raho, guys." ...|$|E
