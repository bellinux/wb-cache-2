40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Efalizumab</b> (anti-CD 11 a), a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody, blocks multiple T-cell-dependent functions {{implicated in}} the pathogenesis of psoriasis, including T-cell activation, migration to the skin, reactivation in psoriatic skin and interactions with keratinocytes. OBJECTIVES: This multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous <b>efalizumab</b> 1. 0 mg kg- 1 once weekly for 12 weeks compared with placebo in a population that included high-need patients, defined as those for whom at least two systemic therapies were unsuitable {{because of lack of}} efficacy, intolerance or contraindication. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [involvement of >or= 10 % of total body surface area and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) >or= 12. 0 at screening] were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive <b>efalizumab</b> or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving >or= 75 % PASI improvement (PASI- 75 response) at week 12 in the intention-to-treat population; secondary endpoints included changes in PASI, static Physician's Global Assessment, Physician's Global Assessment of change from baseline and percentage of body surface area affected. Results We enrolled 793 patients (529 received <b>efalizumab</b> and 264 placebo), including 526 high-need patients (342 received <b>efalizumab</b> and 184 placebo). Week 12 PASI- 75 rates were 29. 5 % for <b>efalizumab</b> compared with 2. 7 % for placebo among high-need patients (P < 0. 0001) and 31. 4 % for <b>efalizumab</b> compared with 4. 2 % for placebo in the full study population (P < 0. 0001).

OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of the efficacy, safety and adverse events of etanercept and <b>efalizumab</b> treatment in daily practice. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out for patients treated with etanercept or <b>efalizumab</b> between February 2005 and March 2006. RESULTS: Over the past 13 months 45 individuals were treated with etanercept and 17 subjects were treated with <b>efalizumab.</b> The cohort represented a high-need population. At week 12, 82 % of the subjects treated with 2 x 50 mg etanercept/week and 71 % of the subjects treated with 2 x 25 mg etanercept/week reached a PASI- 50.

40|$|<b>Efalizumab</b> (anti-CD 11 a) {{interferes with}} LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 binding and {{inhibits}} several key steps in psoriasis pathogenesis. This study characterizes {{the effects of}} <b>efalizumab</b> on T-cell activation responses and expression of surface markers on human circulating psoriatic T cells during a therapeutic trial. Our data suggest that <b>efalizumab</b> may induce a unique type of T-cell hyporesponsiveness, directly induced by LFA- 1 binding, which is distinct from conventional anergy described in animal models. Direct activation of T cells through different activating receptors (CD 2, CD 3, CD 3 / 28) is reduced, despite T cells being fully viable. This hyporesponsiveness was spontaneously reversible after withdrawal of the drug, and by IL- 2 in vitro. In contrast {{to the state of}} anergy, Ca+ 2 release is intact during <b>efalizumab</b> binding. Furthermore, lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) blockade resulted in an unexpected downregulation of a broad range of surface molecules, including the T-cell receptor complex, co-stimulatory molecules, and integrins unrelated to LFA- 1, both in the peripheral circulation and in diseased skin tissue. These observations provide evidence for the mechanism of action of <b>efalizumab.</b> The nature of this T-cell hyporesponsiveness suggests that T-cell responses may be reduced during <b>efalizumab</b> therapy, but are reversible after ceasing <b>efalizumab</b> treatment...|$|E

Objective: To evaluate the impact of <b>efalizumab</b> on HRQOL and other patient-reported outcomes in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, including a large cohort of High-Need patients for whom at least 2 other systemic therapies were unsuitable {{because of lack of}} efficacy, intolerance, or contraindication. Methods A total of 793 patients were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive <b>efalizumab</b> 1 mg/kg/wk (n = 529) or placebo (n = 264) for 12 weeks. The study population included 526 High-Need patients (342 <b>efalizumab,</b> 184 placebo). The treatment was evaluated by patients using the HRQOL assessment tools Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Other patient-reported assessments included the Psoriasis Symptom Assessment (PSA), a visual analog scale (VAS) for itching, and the Patient's Global Psoriasis Assessment (PGPA). Results <b>Efalizumab</b> was associated with improvements at Week 12 from baseline in patient-reported outcomes, both in the total study population and in the High-Need cohort.

Data from patients who received subcutaneous injections of <b>efalizumab</b> or placebo were stratified for analysis into phases according to the nature and duration of treatment. These included: the ‘first treatment’ phase (0 – 12 -week data from patients who received either <b>efalizumab,</b> 1  mg/kg once weekly, or placebo in the five placebo-controlled studies); the ‘extended treatment’ phase (13 – 24 -week data from seven trials for all efalizumab-treated patients); and the ‘long-term treatment’ phase (data from efalizumab-treated patients who received treatment for up to 36  months in two long-term trials). Descriptive statistics were performed and the incidence of arthropathy AEs per patient-year was calculated using 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). During the first treatment phase, a similar proportion of patients had an arthropathy AE in the <b>efalizumab</b> group (3. 3 %; 58 / 1740 patients) compared with the placebo group (3. 5 %; 34 / 979 patients); the incidence of arthropathy AEs per patient-year was 0. 15 in the <b>efalizumab</b> group (95 % CI 0. 11 – 0. 19) and 0. 16 {{in the placebo group}} (95 % CI 0. 11 – 0. 22).

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} polyarthritis in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis undergoing treatment with <b>efalizumab,</b> a humanized anti-CD 11 a monoclonal antibody. METHODS: In a multicenter study, we retrospectively analyzed patients who developed arthritis during treatment with <b>efalizumab.</b> The relationship between joint manifestations and psoriatic disease was addressed by using different classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The course of arthritis and its response to treatment were also investigated. RESULTS: Sixteen patients developed de novo inflammatory rheumatic disease, with a mean delay of 15 weeks following the start of treatment, and with exclusive asymmetric peripheral monarthritis or oligoarthritis (8 patients), inflammatory spinal disease (1 patient), or both (7 patients), associated in some cases with enthesitis and dactylitis. All patients fulfilled at least 2 different sets of classification criteria for PsA. In most of them, an improvement in skin lesions was observed {{at the onset of}} PsA, as measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mean score 24. 88 before <b>efalizumab</b> versus 18. 78 at the time of arthritis). <b>Efalizumab</b> treatment was stopped in 11 patients and was followed by the elimination of rheumatologic symptoms in 1 patient, while 8 patients required treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs with or without methotrexate, with 2 later being switched to tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Efalizumab</b> {{is a human}} anti-CD 11 a {{monoclonal}} antibody used {{in the treatment of}} patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Some of the patients develop new papular lesions during treatment, which are predominantly located in the flexural regions. OBSERVATION: Four patients with recalcitrant psoriasis undergoing treatment with <b>efalizumab</b> presented with erythematous, partly scaly papules and small plaques on previously unaffected areas after 4 to 10 weeks of <b>efalizumab</b> therapy. Tissue sections of biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and immunohistochemical staining was performed using monoclonal antibodies against CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1, granzyme B, neutrophil elastase, CD 68, CD 1 a, CD 11 c, HLA-DR, CD 25, CD 20, and CD 56. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the lesions showed features consistent with psoriasis and activation of various leukocyte subtypes including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils.

40|$|Background and Design: <b>Efalizumab</b> is a recombinant, humanized IgG 1 {{monoclonal}} antibody {{used in the}} treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Recently, because of the cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, the marketing authorisation for <b>efalizumab</b> is suspended. This study is designed to examine the problems that we have faced in our patients that had to discontinue <b>efalizumab</b> and their responses to transition treatments. Material and Method: Patients (n= 31) treated with <b>efalizumab</b> were evaluated in the study. After <b>efalizumab</b> was discontinued, patients received transitional treatments of cyclosporine (n= 7), methotrexate (n= 15), acitretin (n= 4), narrowband UVB (n= 4) and topical therapy (n= 1) for 12 weeks. Efficacy of these treatments were assessed by using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index(PASI) scores and their affects on the occurrence of rebound and relapse. Results: <b>Efalizumab</b> was used for 9 - 161 weeks (mean, 31. 8 ± 33. 3). Efalizumab-associated relapse or rebound was observed in 12 (38. 7 %) and 7 (22. 6 %) of the patients at the end of 3 -month of transition treatments. After 3 -months of treatments, 71. 4 % of cyclosporine, 6. 7 % of methotrexate, 50 % of acitretin and 75 % of narrowband UVB users did not experience efalizumab-associated relapse or rebound events.

Bacteriophage φX 174 {{was used as a}} model neoantigen to assess T-cell-dependent humoral immunity. Tetanus booster vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and intracutaneous skin tests were administered to further evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses. During <b>efalizumab</b> treatment, both primary and secondary antibody responses to φX 174, including IgM/IgG isotype switch, were reduced. There appeared to be naïve T-cell anergy to a neoantigen (φX 174) during active CD 11 a blockade, without tolerance to the antigen after <b>efalizumab</b> withdrawal. Secondary humoral immune responses to tetanus booster during treatment were reduced, but antibody titer increases led to protective levels. Responses to pneumococcal vaccination 6 weeks after withdrawal from <b>efalizumab</b> were not affected. Cellular immune responses to intracutaneous recall antigens were reduced during treatment and returned to pretreatment conditions after withdrawal. These results expand our knowledge of how immune responses are modulated in humans by CD 11 a blockade and have implications for vaccinations of patients treated with this agent...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Severe {{psoriasis}} vulgaris can {{be extremely}} difficult to treat in some patients, even with the newer biological therapies available today. Case presentations We present two patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis who received numerous systemic anti-psoriatic therapies with varied results. Both responded well to initial treatment with <b>efalizumab</b> (anti-CD 11 a), but then experienced a flare of their disease after missing a dose. However, after disease stablization, both patients responded well to re-introduction of <b>efalizumab,</b> one patient requiring concurrent treatment with infliximab (anti-TNF-α). Conclusion These cases are presented to characterize this "flare" reaction, and to inform health care providers that <b>efalizumab</b> can still be administered after disease flare, and again may be a successful therapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>efalizumab</b> in continuous or interrupted therapy of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who had {{failed to respond to}} or were intolerant of other systemic therapies, including methotrexate, ciclosporin and psoralen plus UVA phototherapy, or for whom such therapies were contraindicated. Methods. Patients received a conditioning dose of <b>efalizumab</b> 0. 7 mg/kg followed by once-weekly open-label <b>efalizumab</b> 1. 0 mg/kg for 11 weeks. Responders (Physician Global Assessment [PGA] score of “good ” or better at Week 12) could continue <b>efalizumab</b> for a further 8 weeks (continuous-treatment period). Nonresponders transitioned to alternative anti-psoriasis medication or stopped treatment. Responders who discontinued <b>efalizumab</b> could restart treatment if symptoms worsened. PGA response was evaluated at Weeks 12 (primary endpoint) and 20, as were the proportions of patients achieving an improvement from baseline of � 50 %, � 75 % and � 90 % in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90, respectively). Results. A total of 1, 255 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. At Week 12, 68. 0 % of patients had a PGA rating of “good ” or better. Of 688 patients who entered the continuous-treatment period, 79. 5 % had a PGA rating of “good ” or better at Week 20. At Week 12, median improvement in PASI score wa...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Therapies {{targeting}} the T cell-mediated pathology of psoriasis {{have been found}} to achieve remarkable clinical improvement and have confirmed the crucial role of the immune system either in peripheral blood (PB) or in skin. No analyses of T-cell counts in both compartments have been conducted in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized shifts between them. OBJECTIVES: To gain more insight in the dynamics of compartmentalization of T cells between PB and lesional skin of patients with psoriasis, in response to immune-targeted antipsoriatic therapies. METHODS: Eighteen patients with psoriasis received either <b>efalizumab</b> (n = 9) or etanercept (n = 9) for 12 weeks. Biopsies were taken for immunohistochemical analysis of T-cell subsets and simultaneously T-cell subsets were isolated from PB specimens by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index declined significantly after 12 weeks of etanercept, but not for <b>efalizumab.</b> After treatment with <b>efalizumab,</b> a significantly decreased number of all T-cell subsets was found in the dermis. In the epidermis, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 25 +, CD 45 RO+ and CD 161 + T-cell subsets were significantly decreased. With respect to etanercept, few significant changes in T-cell subsets were found. The percentage of lymphocytes in PB was significantly elevated after <b>efalizumab</b> treatment regardless of responder status. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <b>efalizumab</b> establishes successful recompartmentalization of T-cell subsets with modest clinical efficacy after 12 weeks, whereas in etanercept-treated patients, a significant clinical response is no guarantee for significant changes in T-cell subsets in the different compartments. Reductions in T-cell subsets cannot be used as predictive markers for the clinical response to therapy. Interference with the studied T-cell populations in its own right seems not to be responsible for the clinical efficacy of <b>efalizumab</b> and etanercept...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{treatment}} of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory immune-mediated pathology of huge social impact, {{has become a}} recent revolutionizing breakthrough {{in the management of}} the disease. Apart from anti-TNF-alpha biologics, recombinant proteins-inhibitors of the T lymphocytes-antigen presenting cells interaction, <b>Efalizumab</b> among them, have been successfully used in the therapy of psoriasis. Serious concern regarding safety and efficacy of biologics remains because they induce numerous adverse effects and a significant number of patients are non-responders. Up-to-now, there are no biochemical or/and immunological markers of the clinical efficacy of these drugs. This study searches for immunological and redox markers of the clinical response in the group of psoriatic patients treated with <b>Efalizumab.</b> Clinical response to <b>Efalizumab</b> was assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and correlated with suppression of T-cell functions, plasma cytokines, membrane-associated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), antioxidant enzymes and markers of oxidative stress. A 12 -week <b>Efalizumab</b> therapy did not affect abnormal plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower-than-normal content of PUFAs esterified in phospholipids of red cell membranes. It did, however, suppress T-cell-mediated functions and decrease nitrites/nitrates and malonyl dialdehyde levels independently on the clinical outcome. On contrast, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase in granulocytes were remarkably increased and catalase decreased exclusively in non-responders vs complete or partial responders. High baseline GPx in erythrocytes decreased in responders. It is concluded that clinical response to <b>Efalizumab</b> correlates with GPx activity in the blood cells, suggesting that high hydroperoxide levels are involved in psoriasis persistenc...|$|E
40|$|<b>Efalizumab</b> is an mAb {{directed}} against CD 11 a, a molecule involved in T-cell activation and extravasation from blood into tissue. Ten patients with severe atopic dermatitis {{were treated with}} <b>efalizumab</b> for 84 days, and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were analyzed for expression of activation and adhesion markers. <b>Efalizumab</b> treatment led to decreases in CD 11 a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on naive, central memory, and effector memory CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets. MFI for CD 18 was decreased in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Percentages of cells positive for cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) were increased fourfold in all CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets. Increases in the percentages of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells expressing β 7 and CD 49 d were also observed. No significant changes were observed in the percentages of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells that produced either IFN-γ or IL- 4. In summary, <b>efalizumab</b> treatment resulted in (i) decreases in CD 11 a and CD 18 expression in all circulating T-cell subsets and (ii) increases in the percentages of blood T cells expressing tissue homing markers (CLA, β 7, CD 49 d). These data suggest that blockade of T-cell extravasation into tissue is the major pathway by which <b>efalizumab</b> leads to improvement in cutaneous inflammation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{previous}} paper we described 2 patients {{treated with a}} sequential biologic therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis. We used infliximab as an induction treatment followed by <b>efalizumab.</b> We extended this approach to 3 other patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to show the feasibility of a sequential approach with biologicals. METHODS: Five patients received three infusions of infliximab followed by weekly injections of <b>efalizumab</b> from week 10 on. RESULTS: The most important findings, summarized in a table, show {{that none of the}} patients continued the treatment {{for more than a year}} either because of non-responsiveness or because of spontaneous stopping. Moreover, 4 out of 5 patients did not respond or had serious adverse events on reintroduction of infliximab. CONCLUSION: Overall, we cannot recommend sequential therapy using infliximab and <b>efalizumab...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The humanized {{antibody}} <b>efalizumab</b> {{is currently}} the only T-cell directed biologic approved {{for the treatment of}} moderate-to-severe psoriasis by both American and European authorities. Binding to and blocking the function of the adhesion molecule leukocyte function associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1), it is believed to interfere with T-cell activation in the lymph node, migration through the circulation into the skin, and re-activation in-loco, all of these representing central steps in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. A comprehensive clinical development program provided large and consistent evidence that <b>efalizumab</b> induces a major clinical benefit in psoriasis. <b>Efalizumab</b> rapidly and substantially improves psoriatic skin symptoms and leads to profound gain in quality of life. It allows safe and effective long-term control of psoriasis. Therefore, evidence-based treatment guidelines recommend its use in moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis...|$|E

It acts by blocking the T-lymphocyte pathogenetic mechanisms of psoriasis. Thrombocytopenia is an adverse event that occurs during therapy. Thrombocytopenia can be mild and can occur quite early during treatment, together with leukocytosis. Both adverse events tend to normalize with ongoing therapy, or, in cases worsening, with therapy suspension. There have been multiple reports of thrombocytopenia associated with <b>efalizumab</b> therapy {{for the treatment}} of psoriasis. The general recommendation is to check platelet counts monthly for the first 3 months of <b>efalizumab</b> therapy, then every 3 months for the duration of therapy. According to our experience {{on a wide range of}} patients, it is useful to check platelets every month for the first 6 months of therapy. We report a case of efalizumab-associated thrombocytopenia that occurred after 16 weeks of therapy together with clinical worsening of skin lesions. The peculiarity of our case is the absence of signs and symptoms linked to thrombocytopenia and the quick return to normal platelet count without corticosteroid therapy.
