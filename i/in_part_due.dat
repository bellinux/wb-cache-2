5|$|Columbia {{has many}} bars and {{restaurants}} that provide diverse styles of cuisine, which is <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to it being a college town with three colleges.

5|$|During this period, {{there was}} also {{substantially}} more interaction among the various poetic traditions, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> {{to the spread of}} European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to frustration, and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to differing views {{of the future of}} computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Magnus co-ruled with Olaf {{following}} his brother's return to Norway, {{but less than}} three years into his reign, Magnus became ill and died. His kingship has been downplayed in later history <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to this. Magnus had only one child, Haakon Toresfostre who was king briefly after Olaf, but who also died young, and without issue.|$|E
5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{was also}} known as a writer of fiction and {{became one of the first}} American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is {{particularly}} respected in France, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.|$|E

5|$|The Chakri Dynasty of Thailand has {{included}} marriages between royal relatives, but marriages between dynasts and foreigners, including foreign royals, are rare.

5|$|The {{definitive}} {{version of}} the Hunter was the FGA.9, on which the majority of export versions were based. Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government, the Hunter proved far more successful, and had a lengthy service life with various operators, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to its low maintenance requirements and operating costs.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Philip invaded Pergamon; {{although}} {{unable to}} take the easily defended city, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications, he demolished the surrounding temples and altars.|$|E
5|$|This {{rapid rise}} {{in the power of}} Macedon was <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to Philip's {{exceptional}} military and diplomatic skills. However, it was also <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece. Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, as discussed above, was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power. Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they had too many other problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC.|$|E

5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and is the cause of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest.|$|E
