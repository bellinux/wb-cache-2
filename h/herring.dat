5|$|Edmund Francis <b>Herring,</b> {{known as}} Ned to his family, {{was born in}} Maryborough, Victoria, on 2September1892, the third of five {{children}} of Edmund Selwyn <b>Herring,</b> a solicitor, and his Irish-born wife Gertrude Stella <b>Herring,</b> formerly Fetherstonhaugh. He was educated at Maryborough College and High School and at Melbourne Grammar, where he excelled at tennis and cricket, and was both School Captain and Dux in 1910. While at Melbourne Grammar, {{he served in the}} Commonwealth Cadet Corps, reaching the rank of sergeant.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the victory}} at Buna, for which <b>Herring</b> and Eichelberger were {{appointed}} Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Blamey {{ordered him to}} return to Australia for a rest. While in Melbourne, <b>Herring</b> had an attack of malaria, but recovered to resume command in New Guinea in May. Blamey charged him with responsibility for the next phase of Operation Cartwheel, the capture of Lae. <b>Herring</b> would command I Corps, which would be part of New Guinea Force, under Blamey and later Mackay. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on Madang.|$|E
5|$|<b>Herring</b> died at a Camberwell, Victoria, {{nursing home}} on 5 January 1982. He {{was given a}} state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, planned by his wife, Dame Mary Ranken <b>Herring,</b> who had died three months before.|$|E

5|$|<b>Herring,</b> a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of <b>herring</b> {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for <b>herring,</b> generally between late August and December. <b>Herring,</b> along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Immigrants to Israel have {{incorporated}} {{elements of the}} cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came. During approximately fifty years before 1948, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration, which brought with them {{a whole range of}} foods and cooking styles. Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels, while Russian Jews brought borsht and <b>herring</b> dishes, such as schmaltz <b>herring</b> and vorschmack (gehakte <b>herring).</b>|$|E
5|$|In Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Army in April 1942, <b>Herring</b> {{was given}} command of Northern Territory Force. At this time Darwin was {{being subjected to}} Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or air was impractical, <b>Herring</b> developed a land line of communications running across the outback from Alice Springs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{dismissal}} of Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell for insubordination, Blamey ordered <b>Herring</b> to join him in Port Moresby as the new commander of I Corps. Before departing, <b>Herring</b> met with General Douglas MacArthur, who emphasised that the first duty of a soldier was obedience to his superiors.|$|E
5|$|When Blamey {{relieved}} Rowell {{of command}} of I Corps in New Guinea, he nominated <b>Herring</b> as successor. Blamey proposed Mackay {{as a second}} choice but preferred <b>Herring</b> as he was much younger, and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate. When Blamey relinquished command of New Guinea Force on 30 January 1943, he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable <b>Herring</b> to go on leave. The period was a quiet one, with no major operations being carried out, and Mackay handed back to <b>Herring</b> and returned to command of the Second Army at Parramatta, New South Wales, in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} {{operations}} were in train {{to drive the}} Japanese back to Salamaua. Once again, the difficulties of supplying the attacking force were formidable. Out of sensitivity towards the sensibilities of the Americans, <b>Herring</b> left the command arrangements between Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division and units of the American 41st Infantry Division ambiguous. This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders. <b>Herring</b> prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General Frank Berryman determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.|$|E

50|$|Pickled <b>herrings</b> {{have been}} a staple in Northern Europe since Medieval times, being a way to store and {{transport}} fish, especially necessary in meatless periods like Lent. The <b>herrings</b> would be prepared, then packed in barrels for storage or transportation.|$|R
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic <b>herring,</b> hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, <b>herring,</b> or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). <b>Herring</b> was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, <b>Herring</b> and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to <b>Herring,</b> was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, <b>Herring</b> and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, <b>Herring</b> once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, <b>Herring</b> {{commanded}} the 6th Division Artillery in the Western Desert Campaign and the Battle of Greece. In 1942, as a corps commander, he {{commanded the}} land {{forces in the}} Kokoda Track campaign. The following year, he directed operations at Lae and Nadzab. <b>Herring</b> left his corps to become the longest-serving Chief Justice and Lieutenant Governor of Victoria, serving for three decades. In the latter capacity, he was patron of many charitable organisations.|$|E
50|$|The oldest known seal {{dates from}} 1361. The <b>herrings</b> stand upright. They {{probably}} symbolise {{the importance of}} fishery. Besides the <b>herrings</b> the seal also shows two six pointed stars. The seal was used until 1478. A new seal was created in 1538. This seal shows the <b>herrings</b> placed horizontally on a shield. This shield - or escutcheon - is held by a woman standing on the side. In 1816 Enkhuizen received a new coat of arms, acknowledged by the High Council of Nobility.|$|R

50|$|Pickled <b>herrings</b> {{are part}} of Scandinavian, Nordic, Dutch, German (Bismarckhering), Polish, Baltic, Eastern Slavic and Jewish cuisine. Most cured <b>herrings</b> uses a two-step process. Initially, the <b>herrings</b> are cured with salt to extract water. The second stage {{involves}} removing the salt and adding flavorings, typically a vinegar, salt, sugar solution to which ingredients like peppercorn, bay leaves and raw onions are added. Other flavors can be added, such as sherry, mustard and dill. The tradition is strong in Scandinavia, The Netherlands, Iceland and Germany.|$|R
5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled <b>herring</b> from Eastern Europe. <b>Herring</b> is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|In November, <b>Herring</b> flew {{across the}} {{mountains}} {{to take control of}} the fighting around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea. <b>Herring</b> planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda. He struggled to amass enough troops, equipment, guns, and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area.|$|E
5|$|On 14August1942, <b>Herring</b> {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that <b>Herring</b> was an elitist.|$|E
60|$|Hereabouts {{they begin}} to talk of <b>herrings</b> and the fishery; and we find in the ancient records that this town, which was then equal to a large city, paid, among other tribute to the government, fifty {{thousand}} of <b>herrings.</b> Here also, and at Swole, or Southole, the next seaport, they cure sprats {{in the same manner}} as they do <b>herrings</b> at Yarmouth; that is to say, speaking in their own language, they make red sprats; or to speak good English, they make sprats red.|$|R

5|$|On 6 October 1939, <b>Herring</b> was {{informed}} that Major General Sir Thomas Blamey had decided to appoint him as Commander, Royal Artillery, of the 6th Division, of the new Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) being raised for service overseas. A week later, <b>Herring</b> was promoted to substantive colonel and temporary brigadier, and given the AIF serial number VX15. His first task was to organise his new command, which was equipped with World War I vintage 18 pounder guns and 4.5 inch howitzers. <b>Herring</b> left for Palestine on 15April1940, along with the 6th Division's commander, Major General Iven Mackay and his headquarters. Training was difficult as the old ammunition was in short supply. His command was only partially reequipped with the new 25 pounders before being committed to the Western Desert Campaign in December 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, <b>herring,</b> dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or <b>herring</b> {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or <b>herring</b> just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
5|$|Arctic {{explorer}} Lincoln Ellsworth became {{fascinated with}} the Earp legend. Ellsworth completed four expeditions to Antarctica between 1933 and 1939, using a former Norwegian <b>herring</b> boat as his aircraft transporter and base that he named Wyatt Earp after his hero.|$|E
