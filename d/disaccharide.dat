5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated <b>disaccharide</b> of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E

25|$|When two monosaccharides undergo {{dehydration}} synthesis whereby {{a molecule}} {{of water is}} released, as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are lost from the two monosaccharides, the new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a <b>disaccharide</b> and is conjoined together by a glycosidic or ether bond. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a <b>disaccharide</b> and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed hydrolysis. The most well-known <b>disaccharide</b> is sucrose, ordinary sugar (in scientific contexts, called table sugar or cane sugar to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important <b>disaccharide</b> is lactose, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. As most humans age, the production of lactase, the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and galactose, typically decreases. This results in lactase deficiency, also called lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, a <b>disaccharide</b> {{composed}} of one D-galactose molecule and one D-glucose molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The systematic name for lactose is O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include maltose (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides {{can be classified}} into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing <b>disaccharide</b> or biose.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the <b>disaccharide</b> sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the <b>disaccharide</b> trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disaccharides</b> {{are one of}} {{the four}} {{chemical}} groupings of carbohydrates (monosaccharides, <b>disaccharides,</b> oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides). The most common types of disaccharides—sucrose, lactose, and maltose—have twelve carbon atoms, with the general formula C12H22O11. The differences in these <b>disaccharides</b> are due to atomic arrangements within the molecule.|$|R

25|$|Lactase (also {{known as}} lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), {{a part of}} the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a {{glycoside}} hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the <b>disaccharide</b> lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.|$|E
30|$|The {{peaks in}} Fig.  2 present at around 30  min RT {{could not be}} identified. However, the {{characteristic}} ions of their mass fragments {{are very similar to}} the identified <b>disaccharides.</b> Therefore, these unknown peaks must come from <b>disaccharides</b> composed of glucose.

50|$|Both <b>disaccharides</b> and monosaccharides {{can form}} sugar {{alcohols}}; however, sugar alcohols derived from <b>disaccharides</b> (e.g. maltitol and lactitol) {{are not entirely}} hydrogenated because only one aldehyde group is available for reduction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Disaccharides</b> {{are formed}} from two monosaccharides {{and can be}} {{classified}} as either reducing or nonreducing. Nonreducing <b>disaccharides</b> like sucrose and trehalose have glycosidic bonds between their anomeric carbons and thus cannot convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group; they are stuck in the cyclic form. Reducing <b>disaccharides</b> like lactose and maltose have only one of their two anomeric carbons involved in the glycosidic bond, meaning that they can convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group.|$|R
25|$|Nectar is {{collected}} by foraging worker bees {{as a source}} of water and carbohydrates in the form of sucrose. The dominant monosaccharides in honey bee diets are fructose and glucose but the most common circulating sugar in hemolymph is trehalose which is a <b>disaccharide</b> consisting of two glucose molecules. Adult worker honey bees require 4mg of utilizable sugars per day and larvae require about 59.4mg of carbohydrates for proper development.|$|E
25|$|Two joined monosaccharides {{are called}} a <b>disaccharide</b> {{and these are}} the {{simplest}} polysaccharides. Examples include sucrose and lactose. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a covalent bond known as a glycosidic linkage formed via a dehydration reaction, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group from the other. The formula of unmodified disaccharides is C12H22O11. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.|$|E

The lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories. Lactose is a <b>disaccharide</b> composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous lactose, which amounts to about 50% {{of the total}} solids of skimmed milk.

40|$|Crystal {{structures}} of jacalin in complex with GlcNAc beta-(1, 3) Gal-beta-OMe and Gal beta-(1, 3) Gal-beta-OMe have been determined. The binding of the ligands to jacalin {{is similar to}} that of analogous -substituted <b>disaccharides.</b> However, the beta-substituted beta-(1, 3) linked <b>disaccharides</b> get distorted at the anomeric center and the glycosidic linkage. The distortion results in higher internal energies of the ligands leading to lower affinity to the lectin. This confirms the possibility of using ligand distortion as a strategy for modulating binding affinity. Unlike in the case of alpha-substituted monosaccharides bound to jacalin, where a larger distortion at the anomeric center was observed, smaller distortions are distributed among two centers in the {{structures of}} the two beta-substituted beta-(1, 3) linked <b>disaccharides</b> presented here. These <b>disaccharides,</b> like the unsubstituted and alpha-substituted counterparts, bind jacalin with the reducing Gal at the primary binding site, indicating that the lower binding affinity of beta-substituted <b>disaccharides</b> is not enough to overcome the intrinsic propensity of Gal -(1, 3) Gal-based <b>disaccharides</b> to bind jacalin with the reducing sugar at the primary site.

40|$|<b>Disaccharides</b> {{are well}} known for their {{membrane}} protective ability. Interaction between sugars and multi-component membranes, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence microscopy to study the effect of mono- and <b>disaccharides</b> on membranes that phase separate into Lo and Ld domains. We find that non-reducing <b>disaccharides,</b> sucrose and trehalose, strongly destabilize the phase separation leading to uniformly mixed membranes as opposed to monosaccharides and reducing <b>disaccharides.</b> To unveil the driving force for this process, simulations were performed in which the sugar linkage was artificially modified. The availability of accessible interfacial binding sites that can accommodate the non-reducing <b>disaccharides</b> is key for their strong impact on lateral membrane organization. These exclusive interactions between the non-reducing sugars and the membranes may rationalize why organisms such as yeasts, tardigrades, nematodes, bacteria and plants accumulate sucrose and trehalose, offering cell protection under anhydrobiotic conditions. The proposed mechanism might {{prove to be a}} more generic way by which surface bound agents could affect membranes...|$|R
25|$|The {{diarrhoea}} {{is caused}} by multiple activities of the virus. Malabsorption occurs because {{of the destruction of}} gut cells called enterocytes. The toxic rotavirus protein NSP4 induces age- and calcium ion-dependent chloride secretion, disrupts SGLT1 transporter-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of brush-border membrane disaccharidases, and possibly activates the calcium ion-dependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system. Healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection, which can persist for weeks. A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child's diet, due to bacterial fermentation of the <b>disaccharide</b> lactose in the gut.|$|E
25|$|Fibrocartilage is {{composed}} of small, chained bundles of thick, clearly defined, typeI collagen fibers. This fibrous connective tissue bundles have cartilage cells between them; these cells {{to a certain extent}} resemble tendon cells. The collagenous fibers are usually placed in an orderly arrangement parallel to tension on the tissue. It has a low content of glycosaminoglycans (2% of dry weight). Glycosaminoglycans are long, unbranched polysaccharides (relatively complex carbohydrates) consisting of repeating <b>disaccharide</b> units. Fibrocartilage does not have a surrounding perichondrium. Perichondrium surrounds the cartilage of developing bone; it has a layer of dense, irregular connective tissue and functions in the growth and repair of cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, the <b>disaccharide</b> sugar {{component}} of all milk, must be cleaved {{in the small}} intestine by the enzyme lactase, in order for its constituents, galactose and glucose, to be absorbed. Lactose intolerance is {{a condition in which}} people have symptoms due to not enough of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. These may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Severity depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. Those affected are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
40|$|Extracellular matrix {{molecules}} such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) {{are typical}} targets for some pathogenic bacteria, which allow adherence to host cells. Bacterial polysaccharide lyases depolymerize GAGs in β-elimination reactions, {{and the resulting}} unsaturated <b>disaccharides</b> are subsequently degraded to constituent monosaccharides by unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases (UGLs). UGL substrates are classified as 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -types based on the glycoside bonds. Unsaturated chondroitin and heparin <b>disaccharides</b> are typical members of 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -types, respectively. Here we show the reaction modes of bacterial UGLs with unsaturated heparin <b>disaccharides</b> by x-ray crystallography, docking simulation, and site-directed mutagenesis. Although streptococcal and Bacillus UGLs were active on unsaturated heparin <b>disaccharides,</b> those preferred 1, 3 - rather than 1, 4 -type substrates. The genome of GAG-degrading Pedobacter heparinus encodes 13 UGLs. Of these, Phep_ 2830 {{is known to be}} specific for unsaturated heparin <b>disaccharides.</b> The crystal structure of Phep_ 2830 was determined at 1. 35 -Å resolution. In comparison with structures of streptococcal and Bacillus UGLs, a pocket-like structure and lid loop at subsite + 1 are characteristic of Phep_ 2830. Docking simulations of Phep_ 2830 with unsaturated heparin <b>disaccharides</b> demonstrated that the direction of substrate pyranose rings differs from that in unsaturated chondroitin <b>disaccharides.</b> Acetyl groups of unsaturated heparin <b>disaccharides</b> are well accommodated in the pocket at subsite + 1, and aromatic residues of the lid loop are required for stacking interactions with substrates. Thus, site-directed mutations of the pocket and lid loop led to significantly reduced enzyme activity, suggesting that the pocket-like structure and lid loop are involved in the recognition of 1, 4 -type substrates by UGLs...|$|R

It was shown that NMR spectra of treated vesicles totally disappeared indicating the decomposition of bilayer. The presence of <b>disaccharides</b> in vesicles dispersions during their treatment prevented {{the disappearance of the}} spectra.

KSPGs have {{also been shown to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting nerve regeneration. Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating <b>disaccharide</b> galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited.|$|E

It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is <b>disaccharide</b> is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E
