40|$|Given {{the role}} of <b>Gas-Graphite</b> <b>reactors</b> as the fourth {{generation}} reactors and their recently renewed importance, in 2002 the IAEA proposed a set of Benchmarking problems. In this work, we propose a model both efficient in time and resources and exact to simulate the HTR- 10 reactor using MCNP- 4 C code. During the present work, all of the pressing factors in PBM reactor design such as the inter-pebble leakage, fuel particle distribution and fuel pebble packing fraction effects have been taken into account to obtain an exact and easy to run model. Finally, the comparison between {{the results of the}} present work and other calculations made at INEEL proves the exactness of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{as part of}} the Global Nuclear Material Control Model effort, the author estimated the maximum quantity of plutonium that could be produced in thermal research reactors in the potential nuclear weapon states (including North Korea), based on their declared power level. D. Albright has estimated the amount of plutonium the North Koreans may have produced since 1986 in the 5 -megawatt-electric power reactor at Yongbon. Albright provided an upper-bound estimate of 53 kilograms of weapon-grade plutonium produced cumulatively if the <b>gas-graphite</b> (magnox) <b>reactor</b> had achieved a load factor of 0. 80. This cumulative estimate of 53 kilograms ignores the potential plutonium production in the 8 -megawatt-thermal research reactor, IRT-DPRK. To better quantify the cumulative North Korean production, the author conducted a study to estimate the amount of plutonium that could have been produced in the IRT-DPRK research reactor operating at the declared power level during the entire period it has operated, including a period it was not safeguarded. The author estimates that, at most, an additional 6 to 33 kilograms of plutonium could have been produced cumulatively in the research reactor operating at the declared power level during the entire period it has operated, including a 12 -year period it was not safeguarded, resulting in a total of 13 to 47 kilograms of plutonium possibly produced in both the research and power reactors...|$|R

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 January 1987 at 9 h 30, due to the {{exceptional}} frost of Loire, ice clogged the water taken from the central A1 (GCR) and resulted {{in the loss of}} normal cooling. This caused the automatic shutdown of the <b>gas-graphite</b> <b>reactor.</b> The cooling system needed to remove the residual power failed as the diesel generators failed to start. It was necessary to feed it by the western power grid of France. The generators were eventually returned to service, just before the collapse of the power grid which took place around noon after a failure of the thermal power Cordemais. The army was then called in in order to destroy the ice that was blocking the water intakes with explosives.|$|E
