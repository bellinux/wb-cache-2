40|$|To {{overcome}} serious {{weaknesses in}} determining the performance of initiating devices, a novel 'ignitability test method', representing actual design interfaces and ignition materials, has been developed. Ignition device output consists of heat, light, gas an burning particles. Past research methods have evaluated these parameters individually. This paper describes the development and demonstration of an <b>ignitability</b> <b>test</b> method combining all these parameters, and the quantitative assessment of the ignition performance of two widely used percussion primers, the M 42 C 1 -PA 101 and the M 42 C 2 - 793. The ignition materials used for this evaluation were several powder, granule and pellet sizes of black powder and boron-potassium nitrate. This test method should be useful for performance evaluation of all initiator types, quality assurance, evaluation of ignition interfaces, and service life studies of initiators and ignition materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two standard primers for initiating small-caliber ammunition are {{compared to that}} of a primer for initiating aircraft escape-system components. Three testing methods are employed including: (1) firing the primer to measure total energy delivered; (2) monitoring output in terms of gaseous product-mass flow rate and pressure as a function of time; and (3) firing the primer onto ignition material to study gas pressure produced during ignition and burning as a function of time. The results of the test demonstrate differences in the ignitability factors of the standard primers and time peak pressures of less than 100 microseconds. One unexpected result is that two percussion primers (the FA- 41 and the M 42 C 1) developed for different applications have the same ignitability. The <b>ignitability</b> <b>test</b> method is shown to yield the most useful data and can be used to specify percussion primers and optimize their performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, fire {{reaction}} improvement of an epoxy polymer mortar (PM) formulation, induced by polymer modification {{with three different}} flame retardant (FR) systems, was analyzed and quantified. For this purpose, several epoxy PM formulations, modified with different contents and/or types of phosphate, metal hydroxide and brominated based FR systems, were manufactured and tested for both, fire reaction and flexural strength. The results were {{compared with those of}} plain epoxy PMs. Fire reaction of PM formulations was assessed by means of the Oxygen Consumption Calorimeter test, also known as Cone Calorimeter test. This test allows the determination of the main parameters that assess fire reaction behaviour of combustible materials: heat release rate, smoke extinction area, carbon dioxide and monoxide release rates, and <b>ignitability.</b> <b>Test</b> results revealed that all FR systems, in particular the phosphate based one, are effective in improving fire reaction performance of epoxy PMs. Moreover, this improvement is attained without significant losses of bearing carrying capacity of PM materials...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Ignitability</b> <b>tests</b> were {{completed}} on three materials using the ISO ignitability apparatus and the Cone Calorimeter. A {{large number of}} repli-cate tests were made at each heat flux level to obtain reliable standard devia-tion values for the results. The possible errors in results were minimized using the very same external conditions. Both methods {{can be used to}} measure ignit-ability, although there is some systematic difference in the measured ignition times. The ISO <b>ignitability</b> <b>tests</b> give slightly shorter ignition times caused by difference in convective heat flow. These results show, however, that it is possi-ble to find a simple relation between the results of the two test methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignitability}} {{of various}} forest species {{was measured with}} a specifically designed apparatus, under precisely controlled temperature and airflow conditions. The <b>ignitability</b> <b>tests</b> were based on ignition delay time versus temperature measurements using five different forest species: Pin its halepensis, Pistacia lentiscus, Cupressus sempervirens, Olea europaea, Cistus incanus. These species are common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The ignition characteristics of the forest fuels examined were related to thermogravimetric analysis data. The DTG curves showed that the mass changes related to cellulose decomposition in the temperature range of 320 - 370 degreesC are greatly responsible for the ignition behavior of the species tested. In addition, the mass of volatiles evolving between 120 - 160 degreesC has {{a significant effect on}} the ignitability, On the contrary, the inorganic ash content of forest fuels, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, seems to play an insignificant role on the ignitability characteristics of the forest fuels examined.

40|$|Four triazene {{derivatives}} {{have been}} synthesized, i. e. bis- 4, 4 '-(3, 3 '-dimethyltriazene) -diphenyl ether (1), bis- 4, 4 '-(3, 3 '-diethyltriazene) -diphenyl ether (2), 2, 2, 6, 6,-tetramethyl- 1 -phenylazo-piperidine (3) and 4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -phenylazopiperidine (4). Their thermal properties {{were determined by}} differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the fragmentation patterns were analysed by simultaneous mass spectrometry (MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry of off-gases from a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The triazenes exhibited an exothermic decomposition peak at temperatures between 230 and 280 Â°C when the triazene units were homolytically cleaved into various aminyl, resonance-stabilized aryl radicals and different CH fragments with simultaneous evolution of elemental nitrogen. The potential of triazenes as {{a new class of}} flame retardants for polypropylene films was investigated by performing <b>ignitability</b> <b>test</b> in accordance to DIN 4102 - 1 /B 2 standard. Polypropylene samples containing very low concentration of only 0. 5 wt% of any of these triazene (R-N 1 = N 2 N 3 R'R") additives passed the test with B 2 classification. Notably, no burning dripping could be detected. The average burning times are very short with exceptionally low weight losses. Based on this preliminary FR testing we have shown that the triazene compounds constitute a new and interesting family of radical generators for flame retarding of polymeric materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} procedure {{has been}} developed to correlate the room fire test process and results from the proposed IS 0 small scale laboratory tests. The analysis assumes that the full scale room fire test follows the proposed ASTM method, implying that the lining material covers ceiling and walls. The procedure requires that the heat release measurement response time of the test room is evaluated and for a specific material linked to results from the <b>ignitability</b> <b>test.</b> From the same test, a value of koc must be calculated. From a small scale {{rate of heat release}} test are evaluated specific characteristics describing the RHR-curve. The derived test room and material characteristics are used as input data to an uncomplicated mathematical expression, essentially describing the full scale test fire process as a concurrent flame spread phenomenon. Undetermined parametors in the model have boon derived using regression analysis and results from seven full scale room tests. In these the tested materials were of such thickness that no burning through occurred. The quantitative accuracy was thought acceptable but further experimental confirmation and sensitivity studies are needed to assess the inherent variability. Qualitatively the procedure predicted the same relative ranking of materials as the room test. For thin surface finish materials on a non-combustible base it was possible to derive a radically simple expression to be used as indication of the risk of flashover. Again, the final usefulness can only be evaluated on the basis of further experimental evidence. In summary, it is thought that a first step has been taken in the efforts to use results from small scale tests to rationally predict full scale fire growth (for one specified scenario) and rank materials...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} research evaluates the radiant ignitability of New Zealand upholstered furniture composites using the ISO <b>Ignitability</b> <b>Test</b> (ISO 5657). It {{is a part}} of a larger research project on the combustion of domestic upholstered furniture at the University of Canterbury. The project aims to predict the ignition time of New Zealand upholstered furniture composites. Fourteen fabrics, one of which was fire retardant cotton, were chosen for testing according to their compositions and content. They represented the most common used fabrics in the manufacture of upholstered furniture in New Zealand. One foam was chosen as it is the most commonly used foam for domestic and commercial furniture. In total, the study tested fourteen types of fabric-foam combination composites, of which there were 750 specimens in this project. The time-to-ignition data are presented in a statistical way with mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and included the ratio of standard deviation to mean. The Flux Time Product concept and linearized thermal ignition model were applied to predict the time-to-ignition, the critical heat flux for ignition and the ignition temperature for the fabric foam composites. Predicting the ignition of upholstery composites by applying the thermally thin theory obtains a reasonably good comparison to the measured ignition data. Therefore, it is applicable to apply the thermally thin theory in engineering calculations and design. The prediction by the thermally thick theory is not as accurate as that by the thermally thin theory. In this research, it was found that Flux Time Product index is smaller than 1. 0 for melting fabrics and greater than 1. 0 for charring fabrics, when the best-fit linear correlation is achieved. There needs to be further research to justify these values for the FTP index for the fabric-foam composites. The ignition data obtained by the ISO Ignitability Apparatus in this study was compared with that obtained from previous research in the Cone Calorimeter. The comparison shows that the two test methods have a good agreement...|$|E
40|$|To perform fire {{engineering}} analysis, data on how {{an object}} {{or group of}} objects burn is almost always needed. This data should be collected and stored in a logical and complete fashion to allow for meaningful analysis later. This thesis details {{the design of a}} new fire test Data Base Management System (DBMS) termed UCFIRE which was built to overcome the limitations of existing fire test DBMS and was based primarily on the FDMS 2. 0 and FIREBASEXML specifications. The UCFIRE DBMS is currently the most comprehensive and extensible DBMS available in the fire engineering community and can store the following test types: Cone Calorimeter, Furniture Calorimeter, Room/Corner Test, LIFT and <b>Ignitability</b> Apparatus <b>Tests.</b> Any data reduction which is performed on this fire test data should be done in an entirely mechanistic fashion rather than rely on human intuition which is subjective. Currently no other DBMS allows for the semi-automation of the data reduction process. A number of pertinent data reduction algorithms were investigated and incorporated into the UCFIRE DBMS. An ASP. NET Web Service (WEBFIRE) was built to reduce the bandwidth required to exchange fire test information between the UCFIRE DBMS and a UCFIRE document stored on a web server. A number of Mass Loss Rate (MLR) algorithms were investigated and {{it was found that the}} Savitzky-Golay filtering algorithm offered the best performance. This algorithm had to be further modified to autonomously filter other noisy events that occurred during the fire tests. This algorithm was then evaluated on test data from exemplar Furniture Calorimeter and Cone Calorimeter tests. The LIFT test standard (ASTM E 1321 - 97 a) requires its ignition and flame spread data to be scrutinised but does not state how to do this. To meet these requirements the fundamentals of linear regression were reviewed and an algorithm to mechanistically scrutinise ignition and flame spread data was developed. This algorithm seemed to produce reasonable results when used on exemplar ignition and flame spread test data...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of treatments {{of the surface}} layer of novel foam core particleboards were evaluated by means of Cone calorimeter tests. Foam core particleboards with variations of surface layer treatment, adhesives and surface layer thicknesses under similar processing conditions were used to produce the test specimen for the Cone calorimeter <b>tests.</b> <b>Ignitability,</b> heat release rate profile, peak of heat release rate, total heat released, effective heat of combustion, mass loss rate, gaseous emissions and specific extinction area were measured using the cone irradiance of 50 kW/m 2. Additional analysis of this data provided fuel composition information that could reveal the pyrolysis events of the composite boards. Thermocouples at various depths were used to provide further verification of pyrolysis events. The unprotected foam core panels generally had much higher heat release rates, somewhat higher heat of combustion and much higher smoke production due to the EPS-foam component of tested panels, whereas time to ignition and total heat release were not pronounced from the veneer treated boards. Adding the commercial FRT veneer to the face particleboard provided a dramatic improvement to the measured flammability properties. It worked sufficiently well with a 3 mm thick surface layer to improve the predicted flame spread rating of the foam core particleboards...|$|R

The coating formulation was optimized by poly sulphide based epoxy resin as binder, ceramic material, carbohydrate and halogen free fire retardant which forms an insulating layer on the surface and blowing agent. In order to evaluate the flame retardancy properties the optimized coating was coated on the surface of plywood and bamboo composites and flame retardancy properties was carried as per both IS/BS Specifications. The data revels that the excellent flame retardancy properties like flame penetration, flammability was achieved, however the rate of burning was satisfactorily when tested as per IS: 5509. A Flame of LPG was allowed to play on the surface of coated and uncoated specimen to <b>test</b> <b>Ignitability.</b> and surface spread of flame. Result shows excellent flame retardancy properties compare to conventional flame retardant coating used. From physical observation it was observed that Thick coatings insulate the treated material against high temperatures. the coating melts under the action of heat, covering the treated material with an impermeable insulating crust that deprives the wood of oxygen. However the study reveals the generation of some gases on event of fire though there was no halogen and ammonium gases and coating was intumscent in nature.

40|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a polymer with {{outstanding}} performance, particularly concerning temperature resistance, {{chemical resistance}} and mechanical characteristics. Literature shows {{a gap in}} the knowledge with regards to PEEK flammability and decomposition products. The aim of this thesis is to describe the decomposition and flammability behaviour of PEEK, in order to develop new fire safe PEEK-based materials. By relating the measured thermal decomposition behaviour and changes in physical properties of PEEK materials to their performance in standard flammability tests, the dependence of these tests has been investigated with regards to orientation, thickness, presence of fillers, moisture absorption and absorption of infrared radiation. This understanding can inform the development of modified PEEK materials with enhanced fire safety. Various industry standard tests have been utilised to examine PEEK such as the Cone Calorimeter (ISO 5660), UL- 94 (EN 60695 - 10 - 11), Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in both air and inert atmospheres and the Small Flame <b>Ignitability</b> <b>Test</b> (ISO 11925). PEEK decomposition has been investigated using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Simultaneous Thermal Analysis coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared (STA-FTIR) and Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (pyGC/MS). Residue analysis has been carried out using Diamond Attenuated Total Reflectance coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared (dATR-FTIR), Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Electron Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDX). Thermal analysis shows a rapid mass loss around 580 Â°C followed by a slower mass loss of the resultant char. The stages of decomposition have been investigated by using FTIR and NMR on the condensed phase residues. Samples subjected to various temperature regimes have been observed in the dATR-FTIR and MAS-NMR and the results shows differences in the structures of the residue during decomposition. Generally, filled PEEK materials (with glass fibre, carbon fibre and talc) tend to have lower flammability in the Cone Calorimeter with a longer time to ignition and a lower peak heat release rate compared to the unfilled materials. The same is true in the LOI, where filled materials give a higher oxygen index, and in the UL- 94 test where shorter burn times are recorded. PEEK shows inconsistent behaviour in some flammability tests, possibly due to the critical heat flux for ignition of PEEK being so close to the heat fluxes employed in many industry standard tests. The presence of moisture within the samples also reduces the time to ignition of PEEK in the Cone Calorimeter and increases the burning time in the UL- 94, possibly due to the formation of a foamed sample close to the melting temperature of the polymer...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{reaction}} to fire performanceof wood and other building products, andparticularly thematerial fire properties time to ignition, rate of heat releaseand smoke production. These properties have been measured by asmall-scale fire test method, the Cone Calorimeter, andpresented for different types of building products. Uncertainty analysis, included instrument and assumptionuncertainty, has been performed for the case that both O 2 andCO 2 are measured for calculation of {{the rate of heat}} release inthe Cone Calorimeter. The partial derivatives for theuncertainty analysis are given. The relative uncertainty forthe rate of heat release measurements in the Cone Calorimeteris between Â± 5 % to Â± 10 % for rate of heat releasevalues larger than about 50 kW/m 2. The time to ignition in the Cone Calorimeter is compatiblewith the time to ignition in the ISO <b>Ignitability</b> <b>test,</b> whichis the main test method for measuring time to ignition. Thetime to ignition is an increasing linear function of density. The rate of heat release in the Cone Calorimeter is dependentof material thickness and of use of retainer frame. Thematerial thickness gives the heat release curve duration andshape. Thin materials have short burning time and two maximumvalues. Thick materials have long burning time and when thematerial is thicker than about 35 mm no second maximum appears. When the retainer frame is used the actual exposed surface isreduced from 0. 01 m 2 to 0. 0088 m 2, the rate of heat release isreduced and the burning time is increased. A comparison ofresults with and without use of the retainer frame gives thenequal results when the exposed area is set to 0. 0088 m 2 in thecase of using the retainer frame. The time to flashover in the full-scale room corner test waspredicted on the basis of Cone Calorimeter data at 50 kW/m 2 bya power law of ignition time, the total heat release calculatedover 300 s after ignition and the density of the product. Therelation gives a simple relation to evaluate if a productreaches flashover in the room corner test. The smoke production has also been measured in the ConeCalorimeter. The white light and the laser smoke measurementsystems have shown similar results. There is a correlationbetween Cone Calorimeter and room corner test smoke productionwhen the products are divided into groups: those that reachflashover in the room corner test in less than 10 min and thosethat have more than 10 min to flashover. Temperature profilesin wood have been measured in the Cone Calorimeter by a simpletechnique. The effect of fire protective gypsum plasterboardson the charring of wood frame members has been determined andcompared with fullscale furnace wall tests. The protectiveeffects of twenty different boards have been presented. ConeCalorimeter and furnace tests show similar charring of wooduntil the boards fall down in furnace tests. After that, thecharring of wood is higher in the furnace, because the wood isexposed directly to the fire.
