60|$|The Maine was an armoured, twin-screw battle-ship of {{the second}} class, 318 feet in length, 57 feet in breadth, with a draught of 21 feet, 6 inches; of 6,648 tons displacement, with engines of 9,293 <b>indicated</b> <b>horse-power,</b> giving her a speed of 17.75 knots. She {{was built in the}} Brooklyn navy yard, {{according}} to act of Congress, August 3, 1886. Work on her was commenced October 11, 1888; she was launched November 18, 1890, and put into commission September 17, 1895. She was built after the designs of chief constructor T. D. Wilson. The delay in going into commission {{is said to have been}} due to the difficulty in getting satisfactory armour. The side armour was twelve inches thick; the two steel barbettes were each of the same thickness, and the walls of the turrets were eight inches thick.|$|E
50|$|The Cartela (Tasmanian {{aboriginal}} {{name for}} Bull Seal) was built at Battery Point, Hobart by Purdon & Featherstone in 1912 for the Huon, Channel and Peninsula Steamship Company Pty. Ltd. {{to operate as}} a cargo and passenger vessel in the coastal and riverine trades south and south-east of the city. She was primarily constructed to replace an earlier vessel the Awittaka that had recently been sold to the Solomon Islands Government, and was especially designed to be the fastest vessel in the premier excursion trade. This was achieved by fitting the vessel with both powerful triple-expansion steam engines (500 <b>indicated</b> <b>horse-power)</b> and a large capacity boiler that allowed lengthy periods of operation at maximum speed without losing pressure - a problem faced by both her predecessor and her chief rival the 152-ton SS Togo. The Cartela and Togo competed in an unofficial race held on Christmas Day regularly until 1931, and both won five races each. In 1926 the two vessels collided off Battery Point and the Togo was forced aground. As the vessels had passed out of (State-controlled) harbour waters into (Federal Government-controlled) coastal waters {{during the course of}} the race, a Royal Commission was held into whether the Marine Board of Hobart was entitled to hold an inquiry.|$|E
5000|$|... {{operated}} by the Collins Line (trans-Atlantic packet) {established 1848 New York} commissioned 1857, and {{was among the first}} ships to be depicted on a postage stamp when used on a 12c value of the United States in 1869. The line began with four paddle wheel steamships, the Atlantic, the Arctic, the Baltic, and the Pacific. Each were 282 feet in length and 2,680 tons burthen. They were built by W.H. Brown of New York at a cost of $700,000 each. The last addition to the fleet was the Adriatic in 1857, the finest and fastest vessel afloat at that time. She was built by Steers in New York and was 355 feet long, 50 feet broad, with a gross tonnage of 3,670 tons. Her machinery, which was constructed at the Novelty Iron Works of New York, consisted of two oscillating cylinders, each 100 inches diameter working up to 3,600 <b>indicated</b> <b>horse-power,</b> with a steam pressure of 20 pounds to the square inch. Her paddles were 40 feet in diameter and at 17 revolutions per minute gave her a speed of 13 knots on a daily consumption of 85 to 90 tons of coal. The company broke up after losses due to ship wrecks. In September, 1854, The SS Arctic collided with a small steamer, the Vesta, off the coast of Cape Race in a dense fog. She sank with a loss of 323 lives including the wife, the only son, and a daughter of Mr. Collins. The loss of the SS Pacific two years later proved the death knell of the Collins Line. The Adriatic was laid up after making a few fine voyages, and finally came to an end as a coal-hulk in West Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ship was}} built by Earle's Shipbuilding of Hull for the Great Eastern Railway and {{launched}} on 21 May 1883. [...] She {{was one of a}} pair of new steamers ordered by the Great Eastern Railway, the other being [...] She was launched by the Mayoress of Ipswich. She was described in the Essex Standard on 26 May 1883. She is built of iron, and will be rigged as a fore-and-aft schooner, with two pole masts; and, having fine lines, she will have a very smart and pleasing appearance, besides being in other respects a most valuable additions to the Great Eastern Railway Company’s fleet. The comford and convenience of passengers have been studied in every way. The saloons and state rooms will be superbly fitted, and the ventilation, lavatories, &c., have been provided on a most ample scale. The accommodation for first-class passengers, 84 in number, is arranged under a long bridge amidships and forward of the engine and boiler space, and for the passengers the bridge deck will afford a spacious promenade. The second-class, 42 in number, will have their accommodation under the poop aft, with ample promenade space on the poop deck. The first-class saloon and state rooms, ladies’ cabin, engine room, &c., are to be lighted by electricity. The upper deck is almost entirely covered by the long poop, bridge and top-gallant forecastle, only a small space or well deck being reserved between each of these for working cargo. The engines which are designed to drive the vessel at a speed of 14 knots, are of the condensing type. Each pair of engines has cylinders 30 inches and 57 inches diameter, by 36 inches stroke, and expected to <b>indicate</b> 1,600 <b>horse-power</b> collectively. Steam will be supplied by two double-ended boilers, 13 feet diameter by 18 feet 3 inches long, at a working pressure of 80lb per square inch. Both the hull and engines have been constructed by Earles’ Company, under the superintendence of the Great Eastern Railway’s Consulting Engineer, Mr. W.G. Ramsden of Liverpool. She was placed on the Harwich to Rotterdam and Antwerp route.|$|R
5000|$|More {{works in}} those days {{described}} the diagram and its origin, {{such as in the}} 1865 Handbook of the steam-engine by the British engineer John Bourne. In the chapter on [...] "The power and performance of engines" [...] he introduced the device and made extensive use of indicator diagrams. In the first chapter of his 1869 work Burgh gave a general description {{of the state of the}} art on this subject {{in those days}}: A VERY large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession look at an indicator diagram as a mysterious production; and even supposing that they comprehend how it is formed, they do not understand the causes for the various forms of figures. There is, therefore undoubtedly, room for a practical work on the subject which shall deal with the matter just as a learner requires : leading him on step by step without slipping, and impressing on his mind all the realities of the case... The best course of instruction for the young engineer then is, that the truth of each minute portion of the subject before him be laid bare, so that he can comprehend it. When he understands thus far, obviously his knowledge will enable him to put the same into practice boldly : for by being acquainted with the ground-work of the subject, he is master also to a great extent of the result of his labours.In the preface Burgh explained, that the book describes all inns and outs of the PV diagram in the following ten steps:* Chapter I. contains the description and use of the indicator, illustrating, at a working scale, Messrs. Maudslays' and Mr. Richards' Indicators (see image). * Chapter II. is under the heading, [...] "How to take an indicator diagram correctly:" [...] which treats of the action of the steam in the cylinder the definition of the diagram correct indicator gear for horizontal, vertical, and oscillating engines, and indicating notes. * Chapter III. deals with the proof of atmospheric pressure and particulars of steam pressures, and includes rules and tables bearing on the subject, with practical examples and illustrations. * Chapter IV. is a complete description and illustration of the theoretical geometry of the indicator diagram in a more practical manner than hitherto published. * Chapter V. is the practical geometry of the indicator diagram, which fully explains the frontispiece plate and other figures in connection with it. * Chapter VI. commences the illustrations of indicator diagrams and gear constructed by the firms I have mentioned, and others whose names are noted under the figures : this chapter contains twenty-one diagrams from ordinary modern screw engines of all classes; three from compound engines three of steam-launch engines and two illustrations of indicator gear for return acting engines. * Chapter VII. is devoted to diagrams taken from the most modem paddle-engines, and contains eighteen illustrations of them; also the most improved indicator gear by Messrs. Penn and Napier, for oscillating engines. * Chapter VIII. treats of land-engine indicator diagrams, showing eleven examples taken from various classes, including locomotive engines. * Chapter IX. fully explains and illustrates air and water pump diagrams. * Chapter X. closes this work, with the explanation of the <b>indicated</b> <b>horse-power</b> in connection with the diagram.This work was republished several times in Burgh's days. The fourth edition of this work was published in 1876, and the fifth edition in 1879.|$|E
