Despite him being a terrorist, he is still attached to his brother. He too has a brother complex towards his brother. To the point where he want to destroy the Japanese police department because it takes too much of his brother's time. He has a weak body and is very lazy, stating that he is a pro at being lazy. Haruka refers to Hiroshi as [...] "Nii-ni" [...] and apparently can't look at red things without seeing his brother. He is the 'head' of NORA. It is hinted that besides wanting to destroy the police, so that his brother will not ever chose them over him, that he has another reason for being in NORA. His power is the ability to hear a person's thoughts, including their most inner thoughts those you did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> had. He too is said be able to transform into a wolf, just like Sōmei and Hiroshi but usually the transformation only drains his energy.|$|E
5000|$|Revival's menu {{includes}} unique housemade cocktails, {{a selection}} of local beers, and a more than sixty bottle wine list. Nat Harry, Revival's head mixologist, won the East Bay Express' award for [...] "Best Bartender" [...] in 2012. [...] The award describes Harry as [...] "relentlessly adventurous" [...] and as [...] "the kind of bartender to whom you can rattle off a vague list of likes, dislikes, and current cravings and who will then make exactly the drink you didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> wanted." [...] Additionally, Harry has invested {{a significant amount of}} her time figuring out how to produce vegan versions of traditional favorites, a process which has required her to stock extensive supplies of alternative ingredients such as gelatin-free sakes, honey-free liquors, and char-free sugar, as well as to come up with suitable alternatives for ingredients which cannot be produced in a vegan fashion. Revival's wine menu focuses on small, family owned wineries (generally with production runs less than 10,000 cases) that have an emphasis on sustainable practices, and their beer menu focuses on local and unusual brews. Revival's sommelier also attempts to choose wines that are high quality while remaining affordable, so that his selection is accessible, rather than exclusive.|$|E
5000|$|Although Sandler {{does not}} {{actually}} mention Schneider by name {{as part of}} the song, he mentions Deuce Bigalow, a character played by Schneider, in the lyric, [...] "we can do it all night long, with Deuce Bigalow" [...] (the [...] "you can do it" [...] line is also a reference to Schneider's recurring [...] "townie" [...] character that originally appeared in The Waterboy). As Sandler mentions Bigelow, Schneider walks on stage, yells, [...] "I'm Jewish!", and joins in for an abbreviated chorus. After the chorus, he sings a Jewish reference for the song (Mickey Raphael, see above), using an Elvis-esque vocal tic, to which Sandler seemingly ad libs [...] "tiny Elvis, ladies and gentlemen, tiny Elvis!" [...] (a reference to a Saturday Night Live skit Schneider performed with Nicolas Cage; and possibly also to Elvis Presley, who was halakhically Jewish on account of his maternal great-great-grandmother) In the rehearsal version, Sandler then gives an aside of, [...] "Schneider, I did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were Jewish," [...] to which Schneider replies, [...] "I'm a Filipino Jew, in fact, I've gotta run home and light the first pig!" [...] In the aired version, Schneider states, [...] "I'm a Filipino Jew." [...] When Sandler muses, [...] "Filipino Jew?" [...] Schneider responds, [...] "There are four of us." [...] He then puts on a blonde wig and joins the [...] "Drei-dels," [...] the backing chorus of children, to whom he is already similarly dressed.|$|E

5000|$|While playing Mingo on television, Ames {{developed}} some skill in throwing a tomahawk. This led {{to one of}} the most memorable moments of his career, when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on April 29, 1965. During the course of the show, Ames and Johnny Carson were discussing Ames' tomahawk throwing abilities. When Ames claimed that he could hit a target from across the room, Carson asked Ames if he could demonstrate this skill. Ames agreed, and a wood panel with a chalk outline of a cowboy was brought on to the stage. As the studio band played a bar of the Adventures of Pow Wow theme, Ames proceeded to throw the tomahawk, which hit the [...] "cowboy" [...] square in the groin with the handle pointing upward. This led to a very long burst of laughter from the audience, which has been called the longest sustained laugh by a live audience in television history. After a moment, Ames proceeded to walk toward the target to retrieve the tomahawk but Carson stopped him and allowed the situation to be appreciated for its humor. Carson ad-libbed: [...] "I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were Jewish!" [...] and [...] "Welcome to Frontier Bris." [...] Ames then asked Carson if he would like to take a turn throwing, to which Carson replied: [...] "I can't hurt him any more than you did." [...] The clip became a favorite of Carson's own yearly highlight show and subsequent blooper television specials.|$|E
5000|$|El Camino {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. According to review aggregator website Metacritic, the album received an average review score of 84/100 based on 37 reviews, indicating [...] "Universal acclaim". Critics mainly praised the instrumentation {{of the songs}} on the album, {{as well as the}} album production. Spin gave the record an 8/10 rating, calling it [...] "irresistibly gaudy" [...] and [...] "catchier, glitzier, ballsier". The reviewer said the songs contain [...] "classic cock-rock sonic tchotchkes: handclaps, talk-box guitar breaks, rainbow keyboards. The overall effect is something akin to ZZ Top with glitter in their beards." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly gave the record an [...] "A-", writing that the group [...] "make a small-room racket that sounds massive enough for a bigger-is-better world". Maerz said that [...] "El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll". James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph rated the album four-stars-out-of-five, praising Danger Mouse for [...] "sharpening up the sweet, melodic choruses that offset the duo's unholy racket" [...] and give each song a [...] "timeless quality, as suited to a Seventies mid-west saloon as a students' indie disco". Despite what Lachno judged to be [...] "tawdry" [...] lyrics, he said that [...] "the Black Keys are here to rock, not talk. On this evidence, few bands right now do it better." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times assigned the album a maximum four-star rating, calling it [...] "butt-shaking music" [...] and [...] "an album with lyrics that are both unpretentious and un-dumb". Roberts praised the nostalgic elements of the group's music and said that the album [...] "scratches an itch you didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> had".|$|E

Nonetheless, he sets out on a quest to find his wife’s killer, aided {{by the use of}} notes, annotated polaroids, and (for the most important pieces of information obtained) body tattoos. Using these resources he attempts to build up a stock of new beliefs and to thus piece together the puzzle of his wife’s death.
