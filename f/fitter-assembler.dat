With {{the assistance of the}} vibrometer Octava- 101 -U there were studied hygienic parameters of pulsed local vibrations in mechanical workshops of the State Enterprise "Antonov" and the State Enterprise "Plant 410 civil aviation" according to the procedure set out in SSN 3. 3. 6. 039 - 99 "State sanitary norms of general and local production vibration".
