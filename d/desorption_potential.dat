40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a larger {{research}} project where two metal hydride forming AB 5 type alloys have been investigated. A slightly non-stoichiometric alloy with mischmetal on A-site and nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminium on B-site, La 0. 60 Ce 0. 29 Pr 0. 04 Nd 0. 07 Ni 3. 37 Co 0. 79 Mn 0. 25 Al 0. 74, has been characterized. The composition of this material, which will be referred to as Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15, is close to the normal battery composition. The other alloy characterized is LaNi 5 based, where nickel is partly substituted with tin, LaNi 4. 76 Sn 0. 24. This material will later be referred to as La(NiSn) 5. These materials were produced by melt spinning to vary the cooling rate during solidification. The main purpose of the study has been to characterize the electrochemical properties related to battery performance. The production as well as the metallurgical and structural characterization of the materials were performed in another part of the project. For Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 the unit cell volume was dependent on the cooling rate before heat treatment, while the unit cell volume was almost independent of the cooling rate for La(NiSn) 5. For both alloy compositions, the electrochemical properties seemed to change with varying cooling rate. The <b>desorption</b> equilibrium <b>potential,</b> the discharge capacity when discharging at a low current and the deterioration rate were found to be reduced with decreasing unit cell volume and increased with increasing unit cell volume, before heat treatment of Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15. The self discharge rate was observed to be inversely proportional to the unit cell volume for this material. For not heat treated La(NiSn) 5, produced at different cooling rates, the <b>desorption</b> equilibrium <b>potential</b> decreased when the self discharge rate and the discharge capacity increased after cycling for 300 cycles. The deterioration rate decreased when the <b>desorption</b> equilibrium <b>potential</b> was reduced for La(NiSn) 5. The electrochemical parameters both before and after heat treatment of La(NiSn) 5, did not seem to be related to the structural parameters, because the unit cell volume was almost independent of the cooling rate. After heat treatment of both melt spun Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 and La(NiSn) 5, the unit cell volume and the electrochemical properties seemed to be almost independent of the cooling rate, within the experimental error. La(NiSn) 5 showed an effect of storage of the materials. For Mm(NiCoMnAl) 5. 15 this effect was weaker. The unit cell volume and the electrochemical parameters after aging were less affected when the cooling rate was varied. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

For the three thiol compounds, the multiwave voltammetric responses at polycrystalline are discussed {{on the basis of the}} behaviours observed at well-defined single-crystal electrodes. The sequence of reductive <b>desorption</b> (RD) <b>potentials</b> follows qualitatively the sequence of the potential of zero charge (pzc) of the uncovered electrodes in the case of MBIS. Such a sequence may be altered when attractive lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules, leading to an enhancement of the self-assembled monolayer stability, can be established. The RD peaks are therefore no longer simply directly related to the pzc of the substrate since the amplitude of lateral interactions depends on the atomic roughness of the substrate. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{structures}} of 1,n-alkanedithiol (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a Au(111) substrate were investigated by electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations. The {{results of the}} experimental techniques indicated that the dithiols, except n = 2, showed an upright molecular structure in the SAMs, in which alkanedithiols were bound to the Au surface via only one thiol functionality {{and the other one}} faced up to the air. The results also suggested that the formed dithiol SAMs were densely packed and highly oriented. Except ethanedithiol, which was thought to form a bilayer, the reductive <b>desorption</b> peak <b>potentials</b> of 1,n-alkanedithiol (n = 4, 6, 8, 10) SAMs were more negative than those of the corresponding monothiol ones in 0. 1 M KOH solutions.

The major part of the high stability may be attributed to the van der Waals interaction among the sulfur atoms on top of the dithiol SAMs. The molecular modeling calculation showed that the {{structures of}} dithiol SAMs were {{similar to those of the}} corre-sponding monothiol SAMs and that all the dithiol SAMs, except ethanedithiol, were more stable than the corre-sponding monothiol SAMs. The calculated energy differences between dithiol and monothiol SAMs decreased wit...|$|R

40|$|In surface-based biosensors, the nonspecific or {{undesired}} adsorption of {{the probe}} {{is an important}} characteristic that is typically difficult to measure and therefore to control or eliminate. A methodology for measuring and then minimizing or eliminating this problem on gold surfaces, readily applicable to many common surface modifications is presented. Combining electrochemical perturbation and fluorescence microscopy, we show that the potential at which the adsorbed species is removed {{can be used as}} an estimate of the strength of the adsorbate−surface interaction.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) allowing the prediction of the fate of organic compounds in the environment from their molecular properties was done. The considered processes were water dissolution, dissociation, volatilization, retention on soils and sediments (mainly adsorption and desorption), degradation (biotic and abiotic), and absorption by plants. A total of 790 equations involving 686 structural molecular descriptors are reported to estimate 90 environmental parameters related to these processes. A significant number of equations was found for dissociation process (pKa), water dissolution or hydrophobic behavior (especially through the KOW parameter), adsorption to soils and biodegradation. A lack of QSAR was observed to estimate <b>desorption</b> or <b>potential</b> of transfer to water. Among the 686 molecular descriptors, 5 {{were found to be}} dominant in the 790 collected equations and the most generic ones: four quantum-chemical descriptors, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), polarizability (α) and dipole moment (μ), and one constitutional descriptor, the molecular weight (MW). Keeping in mind that the combination of descriptors belonging to different categories (constitutional, topological, quantum-chemical…) led to improve QSAR performances, these descriptors should be considered for the development of new QSAR, for further predictions of environmental parameters.

Downstream of the 6.44  km sampling point the exposure duration varied, which was likely attributed to sorption and dispersion of applied copper, {{as well as}} the differing background concentrations throughout the canal (<[*] 0.04 – 0.07  mg Cu/L). The initial increase in exposure time is likely attributed to differing flow rates vertically and horizontally within the canal spreading the applied mass of copper.

The underlying mechanism was revealed by investigating the effect of doping on the bond strength of graphene and on the electron transfer and the coulomb interaction between the hydrogen monomer and graphene. The kinetic properties of H and D monomers on doped graphene layers during both the annealing process (annealing time t_ 0 = 300 s) and the constant-rate heating process (heating rate α = 1. 0 K/s) were simulated. Both electron and hole dopings were found to generally increase the desorption temperatures of hydrogen monomers. Electron doping was found to prevent the diffusion of hydrogen monomers, while the hole doping enhances their diffusion. Macroscopic diffusion of hydrogen monomers on graphene can be achieved when the doping-hole density reaches 5. 0 × 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2.

The results revealed that compared with the Ni catalysts with a NiO loading of 40 wt% prepared by co-impregnation (CI) and sequential impregnation (SI) methods, the Ni catalyst synthesized by DP method showed enhanced catalytic performance for CO methanation at atmospheric pressure and an extremely high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 240 000 mL g(-) 1 h(- 1). In a 50 h high-pressure life-test, this catalyst showed a high resistance to both coking and sintering. It was found that CeO 2 nanoparticles were selectively deposited {{on the surface of}} NiO rather than on Al 2 O 3 due to the electrostatic interaction during the DP process, effectively preventing Ni particles from sintering during the reduction and reaction at high temperatures, and inhibiting coke formation by increasing the supply of active oxygen species on the nickel surface.

The results revealed that compared with the Ni catalysts with a NiO loading of 40 wt% prepared by co-impregnation (CI) and sequential impregnation (SI) methods, the Ni catalyst synthesized by DP method showed enhanced catalytic performance for CO methanation at atmospheric pressure and an extremely high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 240 000 mL g(-) 1 h(- 1). In a 50 h high-pressure life-test, this catalyst showed a high resistance to both coking and sintering. It was found that CeO 2 nanoparticles were selectively deposited on the surface of NiO rather than on Al 2 O 3 due to the electrostatic interaction during the DP process, effectively preventing Ni particles from sintering during the reduction and reaction at high temperatures, and inhibiting coke formation by increasing the supply of active oxygen species on the nickel surface. As a result, the formed CeO 2 -decorated Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance and stability in CO methanation. This work demonstrated that catalytic properties could be much improved for a usual catalyst with a well-designed structure...|$|R

On the contrary, the deposited carbon over the catalyst without ZrO 2 reached 1. 5 wt% after a 60 h life time test. The improved catalytic performance was attributed to the selective deposition of ZrO 2 nanoparticles on the surface of NiO rather than Al 2 O 3, which could be well controlled via changing the electrostatic interaction in the DP procedure. This unique structure could enhance the dissociation of CO 2 and generate surface oxygen intermediates, thus preventing carbon deposition on the Ni particles in syngas methanation.

40|$|The soil-solution {{partitioning}} of dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) within mineral soil horizons is primarily controlled by processes of adsorption and desorption. These abiotic processes largely occur within a short equilibration time of seconds to minutes, which generally occur faster than microbial processes. To characterise the adsorption of DOC to mineral soils, I used the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which holds several advantages to the commonly used linear initial mass (IM) isotherm. One advantage to using the Langmuir isotherm is an estimation of the maximum DOC adsorption capacity (Qmax). The Qmax estimates the number of remaining DOC binding sites available on the mineral soil particle surfaces. I modified the traditional Langmuir isotherm in order to estimate the DOC <b>desorption</b> <b>potential</b> of native soil organic matter (SOC). Sorption characteristics were derived for {{a broad range of}} 52 mineral soils collected from 17 soil profiles spanning across Canada from British Columbia to Quebec. Mineral horizons with the greatest Qmax included the Fe-enriched B horizons of acidic Podzols and Volcanic soils, followed by B horizons not enriched in Fe, followed by A and C horizons. Podzol B horizons were distinct from all other horizons due to significantly higher <b>desorption</b> <b>potential.</b> Soil properties predicting the adsorption characteristics of DOC also predicted the adsorption characteristics of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Adsorption of DOC and DON was tightly coupled (R 2 = 0. 86), however the ratio of DOC:DON in the final equilibrium solution lowered for 48 out of 52 minerals horizons. These results suggest that DON may be slightly more mobile than DOC. A short-term (32 day) incubation was perform to establish the fate of indigenous soil C, relative to newly adsorbed soil C to four mineral soils with different adsorption characteristics. Soil columns were leached periodically and sampled for DOC and CO 2 production. Two Fe-enriched mineral horizons with high adsorption capacity released low amounts of old SOC, yet released almost all of the newly adsorbed SOC. In contrast, two B horizons without Fe-enrichment released greater amounts of old SOC, and retained a greater fraction of the newly adsorbed SOC than the Fe-enriched horizons. These results identify a contrast between the fate of indigenous and newly adsorbed SOC on mineral soils with differing Qmax. The final component of this study examined changes to the molecular structure of DOC after equilibration with mineral soils. Multiple techniques were used to assess changes in the molecular composition of DOC, including the analysis of aromatic content by specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and fluorescence spectroscopy, analysis of molecular weight distribution (MWD) with high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and functional group analysis with Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The solution phase DOC generally showed a reduced aromatic content, along with the removal of organic compounds with carboxyl groups. The MWD of DOC was reduced after equilibration to mineral soils, and the reduction in average molecular weight was related to the Qmax of mineral soils. The various components of this thesis have contributed to the overall understanding of controls on the adsorption of DOC and DON species to mineral soils of the Canadian temperate and boreal forest...|$|E

Soil cores were taken from a clay soil profile and samples taken from 0. 0 to 0. 3 m (surface), 1. 0 - 1. 3 m (mid) and 2. 7 - 3. 0 m (deep) and treated with the chloroacetanilide herbicide, acetochlor. Freundlich isotherms revealed that sorption and desorption behaviour varied with each depth sampled. As soil depth increased, the extent and strength of sorption decreased, indicating that the potential for leaching was increased in the subsoils compared with the surface soil. Hysteresis was evident at each of the three depths sampled, although no significant correlations between soil properties and the hysteresis coefficients were evident. Desorption studies using soil fractions with diameters of > 2000, 250 - 2000, 53 - 250, 20 - 53, 2 - 20, 0 - 2 and 0 - 1 ?m separated from each of the three soil depths showed that differential desorption kinetics occurred and that the retention of acetochlor significantly correlated (R 2 = 0. 998) with organic matter content. A greater understanding of the influence of soil components on the overall sorption and <b>desorption</b> <b>potential</b> of surface and subsurface soils is required to allow accurate prediction of acetochlor retention in the soil.

40|$|AbstractSoil {{phosphorus}} (P) fractionation, adsorption, and desorption isotherm, {{and rice}} yield and P uptake were investigated in flooded tropical rice (Oryza sativa L.) following 42 -year fertilizer and manure application. The treatments included low-input [unfertilized control without N, P, or K (C 0 N 0) ], farmyard manure (FYM) (C 1 N 0), NP (C 0 NP), NPK (C 0 NPK), FYM+NP (C 1 NP), and high-input treatment, FYM+NPK (C 1 NPK). Grain yield was increased significantly by 74 % over the control under the combined application of FYM+NPK. However, under low- and high-input treatments, yield {{as well as}} P uptake was maintained at constant levels for 35 years. During the same period, high yield levels and P uptake were maintained under the C 0 NP, C 0 NPK, and C 1 NPK treatments. These are unique characteristics of a tropical flooded ecosystem, which is a self-sustaining system for rice production. The Fe–P fraction was highest compared to the Ca–P and Al–P fractions after 42 years of fertilizer application and was significantly higher under FYM+NPK treatment. The P adsorption capacity of soil was highest under the low-input treatment and lowest under long-term balanced fertilization (FYM+NPK). In contrast, P desorption capacity was highest under NPK and lowest in the control treatment. Long-term balanced fertilization {{in the form of}} FYM+NPK for 42 years lowered the bonding energy and adsorption capacity for P in soil but increased its <b>desorption</b> <b>potential,</b> increasing P availability to the plant and leading to higher P uptake and yield maintenance...|$|E
40|$|In recent experiments, the {{rotational}} {{alignment of the}} laser induced nonthermal desorption of CO adsorbed on an epitaxially grown film of Cr 2 O 3 (0001) has been studied [Beauport, Al-Shamery, and Freund, Chem. Phys. Lett. 256, 641 (1996) ]. At low-rotational quantum numbers J, the molecules desorb like helicopters (J-vector perpendicular to the surface) while at high J-values cartwheel motion is preferred (J-vector parallel to the surface). These stereodynamic effects and the experimental state resolved velocity distributions of the desorbing species are simulated {{by means of an}} exact time-dependent wave packet method in three dimensions. As a basis for this quantum-mechanical treatment of the CO <b>desorption</b> ab initio <b>potential</b> energy surfaces (PES) were used. The PES for the electronic ground state of the CO-Cr 2 O 3 (0001) system has been calculated previously by Pykavy [Surf. Sci. 479, 11 (2001) ] in an embedded cluster approach. As the intermediate state, generated by the laser irradiation, an internal CO excited state (5 sigma [...] > 2 pi*) was considered. The PES of this a (3) Pi -like state of CO adsorbed on Cr 2 O 3 (0001) was calculated at the ab initio CASSCF-level. Our key findings in the subsequent wave packet calculations are (1) a high-dimensional treatment of the photodesorption process is very important in this system, essentially the angular coordinates, very often neglected in similar studies, are responsible for a "successful" desorption event; (2) the change from the strongly tilted equilibrium geometry in the electronic ground state to the preferred upright position in the electronically excited state after laser irradiation is essential for the mechanistic picture of the desorption process; (3) the experimental phenomemon of {{rotational alignment}} can only be explained if the topologies of the PES of both the electronically excited and the ground state are accounted for; (4) the lifetime of the CO*-intermediate is in the order of 10 fs; (5) the molecule-surface vibrations in the electronic ground state do not much influence the asymptotic results at the experimental temperature of T= 100 K.

40|$|The {{combination}} of electrochemical research methods like cyclic voltammetry and chrono-coulometry with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the electron synchrotron BESSYII was suited {{to examine the}} impact of thymine on the underpotential deposition (upd) of lead and bismuth on the gold (111) electrode. Using this method, new insight was gained concerning the potential dependence of the thymine adsorption state on different layers of copper and silver – which previously had been electrochemically deposited on a gold single crystal. Moreover, these techniques were employed to examine the underpotential deposition of bismuth and copper on different layers of silver which had been electrochemically depos-ited on gold (111) -electrodes. The following summary is graphically depicted in figure 6. 1. The presence of thymine in the electrolyte is leading to a stabilization of metallic lead situated on the gold (111) -electrode at - 650 mV vs. ref. Due to the lead adsorption on Au (111), the electrode’s potential of zero charge (pzc) changes, which, in turn, leads to thymine being modified to a chemisorbed state. At the electrode potential of 850 mV vs. ref, the stabiliza-tion is cancelled out because it comes to a change of charge (due to the potential in relation to the pzc) of the electrode surface as well as to a reorientation of thymine. At the bulk deposi-tion of 1150 mV vs. ref., thymine is physisorbed on the electrode surface. On the basis of the <b>desorption</b> <b>potentials</b> in the cyclic voltammogramme, the upd shift of lead on Au (111) in 100 mM perchloric acid was found to be 175 mV. The Pb 4 f 7 / 2 -binding energy of a lead monolayer on Au (111) comes to 137, 6 eV, whereas the one of the metallic lead sums up to an amount of 136, 8 eV. Thymine stabilizes metallic bismuth on the Au (111) -electrode at - 250 mV vs. ref. From the beginning of the bismuth-upd onwards, this potential lies positively on Au (111). In contrast to the previously described experiment of the lead deposition, it is not possible- because of the XPS dates- to say whether thymine is chemisorbed or physisorbed on the electrode surface. At more negative deposition potentials, thymine is fully desorbed by the electrode surface, although a chemisorption, meaning an interaction via the deprotonated N(3) - atom, could be expected because of the position of the pzcs as well as the positive charge which is related to the latter. The upd-shift of bismuth on Au (111) amounts ca. 140 mV in 100 mM perchloric acid solu-tion. The Bi 4 f 7 / 2 -binding energy of the bismuth mono layer has a value of 158, 5 to 158, 7 eV. In the case of metallic bismuth, the Bi 4 f 7 / 2 -binding energy comes to ca. 156, 9 eV. Compared to other systems, the silver- UPD has a special characteristic: It is possible to sepa-rate two mono layers at different points in the underpotential region. During the presence of thymine, the first silver- UPD is favoured, whereas the second monolayer’s deposition is in-hibited. The determination of the absorption state of thymine on silver was acted out on the first and second monolayer {{as well as on the}} bulk deposition of silver on Au (111) at - 700 mV vs. ref. On the second monolayer as well as on the bulk silver, thymine interacts with the electrode surface via the deprotonated N(3) -atom. On the first monolayer, this interaction takes place via the O(4) -atom. The N(3) -atom is protonated. The cyclovoltammogrammes show a needle peak at - 900 mV vs. ref. which results from the deposition of thymine. Thymine is chemisorbed at the deposition potentials of co-adsorption of silver and thymine (at - 15 mV vs. ref. (upd) and - 145 mV vs. ref. (bulk)). It interacts with the substrate via its deprotonated N(3) atom. Hence, the interaction between the silver monolayer and thymine undergoes a change from the deprotonated N(3) to the O(4) atom. In absence of thymine, the upd shift of the first silver monolayer amounts 500 mV, whereas the upd shift for the second silver monolayer amounts 35 mV. In presence of thymine, the upd shift of the silver monolayer is 415 mV. The Ag 3 d 5 / 2 -binding energy of the silver monolayer is 367, 9 eV, which is about 0, 2 eV smaller than the binding energy of metallic silver. The copper deposition in perchloric acid is kinetically hindered at underpotentials as well as at overpotentials. It was shown that the hindrance is caused by the deposition of the copper mono layers. They are the basis for three dimensional copper growth (Stranski-Krastanov-growth). If the copper upd is conducted at - 700 mV vs. ref. on a pre-adsorbed copper mono-layer, it can be observed that the copper opd starts earlier (at around 500 to 600 s). The copper electrodeposition is accelerated and stabilized in the presence of thymine in the electrolyte. Thymine is physisorbed on the Au (111) surface at the deposition potential of the copper upd (- 480 mV vs. ref.). The electrodeposition of copper leads to a change of the pzc of the electrode and causes a reorientation of thymine into the chemisorbed state. In contrast, thymine is physisorbed on different copper layers on Au (111) at - 700 mV vs. ref. (upd) and 750 mV vs. ref. (bulk), respectively. The upd shift of copper is 165 mV in absence and 225 mV in presence of thymine. The Cu 2 p 3 / 2 -binding energy of a copper monolayer is 931, 5 eV. It is increased by 0, 3 eV in pres-ence of thymine. The electrodeposition of a single silver monolayer on gold (111) leads to a variation of the electronic work function of the substrate. Due to this modification, a copper upd could be ob-served on a silver substrate for the first time ever! The upd leads to a copper coverage of 0. 24 with respect to the underlying gold substrate. Neither in the presence of thymine in the elec-trolyte, nor in the presence of sulphate, the copper upd could be observed. Moreover, it could not be observed on the second silver monolayer nor on bulk silver. The copper opd is accelerated on the pre-deposited silver monolayer. On this substrate, it is not necessary for the three dimensional growth of copper to have a complete underlying cop-per monolayer. The copper upd-shift on the first silver monolayer amounts 95 mV. The upd of bismuth shows a significantly different behaviour in the first silver monolayer compared to the clean Au (111) substrate. On the silver layer, it proceeds in two distinguish-able steps. It reaches a degree of coverage close to 1. Whereas on Au (111) the degree of cov-erage is 0, 76. Contrary to the upd on the first silver monolayer, the bismuth upd on bulk silver takes place in one step only. The coverage which was obtained is close to 1, too. A second deposition step is not stabilized. The upd shift of the bismuth upd on AgML / Au (111) and AgVOL / Au (111) is 110 mV and 85 mV, respectively. The copper upd and the bismuth upd on the silver substrates fulfil the forecasts, which could be set on the basis of the empirical rule of D. M. Kolb et al...|$|R

As imagens obtidas por microscopia de varredura por tunelamento (STM â Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) indicam um arranjo prÃximo do {{hexagonal}} com exceÃÃo da iTNA cujas imagens nÃo foram conclusivas. Adicionalmente, as imagens indicam a existÃncia de defeitos nas SAMs mesmo apÃs longos perÃodos de imersÃo (24 h). Os estudos termodinÃmicos e cinÃticos dos processos de adsorÃÃo foram realizados por desorÃÃo redutiva em meio alcalino e QCM. Os valores dos potenciais de desorÃÃo redutiva, Edr, foram observados em &# 8722; 0, 9, &# 8722; 0, 8 e &# 8722; 0, 5 V vs. Ag/AgCl/Cl- para a desorÃÃo de iTNA, TNA e Hpyt, respectivamente. Comparativamente Ãs espÃcies 1, 4 -dt (&# 8722; 0, 8 V) e pyS (&# 8722; 0, 5 V), o valor de Edr da SAM de Hpyt indica uma interaÃÃo sigma ao passo que aqueles observados para iTNA e TNA sugerem uma contribuiÃÃo pi adicional. Os valores de quantidade de material adsorvido (gama) e da taxa de recobrimento da superfÃcie (teta), calculados por desorÃÃo redutiva e impedÃncia eletroquÃmica, respectivamente, foram consistentes com as imagens de STM. Comparativamente aos resultados de desorÃÃo, os maiores valores de gama determinados por QCM foram atribuÃdos Ã presenÃa de molÃculas de Ãgua co-adsorvidas visto que foi observada uma relaÃÃo linear entre o excesso de massa e o momento de dipolo das espÃcies modificadoras. As curvas de desorÃÃo obtidas para pyS indicam a decomposiÃÃo da monocamada nÃo possibilitando, portanto, a determinaÃÃo dos parÃmetros termodinÃmicos e cinÃticos de adsorÃÃo. A correlaÃÃo com os resultados obtidos apÃs imersÃo do eletrodo de ouro em soluÃÃo de Na 2 S sugere que este processo estÃ associado Ã quebra da ligaÃÃo C&# 9472;S com formaÃÃo de uma camada de enxofre atÃmico e/ou oligomÃrico. As isotermas de adsorÃÃo obtidas para os processos de formaÃÃo das SAMs de Hpyt, TNA e iTNA, adequaram-se ao modelo de Langmuir permitindo a determinaÃÃo da variaÃÃo da energia livre de adsorÃÃo, &# 916;Gads, como &# 8722; 35, 9, &# 8722; 38, 5 e &# 8722; 34, 9 kJ mol&# 8722; 1, respectivamente. Estes valores sÃo indicativos de interaÃÃo forte sendo caracterÃsticos de processos de quimissorÃÃo. Para o modelo de Frumkin, os dados apresentaram melhores correlaÃÃes quando o parÃmetro de interaÃÃo (g) foi fixado em &# 8722; 0, 45, &# 8722; 0, 30 e &# 8722; 0, 10, respectivamente, para as SAMs de Hpyt, TNA e iTNA indicando interaÃÃes repulsivas entre as molÃculas adjacentes. Os valores de pKa das SAMs de Hpyt (4, 2), TNA (5, 0 e 8, 5) e iTNA (4, 5 e 7, 9) foi determinado por voltametria utilizando-se o Ãon complexo [Fe(CN) 6] 3 &# 8722;. Neste estudo, foram sugeridas modificaÃÃes, uma vez que o mÃtodo proposto na literatura dificulta a determinaÃÃo de mais de um valor de pKa como observado para as molÃculas de TNA e iTNA. As reaÃÃes de transferÃncia de elÃtrons (TE) das metaloproteÃnas citocromo c (cyt c) e mioglobina (Mb) foram estudadas utilizando-se as SAMs de Hpyt, TNA, iTNA, pyS e 1, 4 -dt. Para as SAMs de TNA e iTNA, o deslocamento positivo de 0, 2 V no valor do potencial de meia-onda do cyt c (pH~ 7, 0) em relaÃÃo a forma nativa, foi atribuÃdo Ã densidade de carga positiva resultante da protonaÃÃo do grupo NH 2 (pKa ~ 8, 0). Resultados de QCM e SPR indicaram que hÃ a formaÃÃo de uma monocamada de cyt c sobre as SAMs estudadas. Esta monocamada, embora nÃo sendo redox ativa, permite o estudo da reaÃÃo de TE das molÃculas de cyt c em soluÃÃo sugerindo que este processo pode envolver os orbitais das molÃculas modificadoras. Para a metaloproteÃna Mb, utilizou-se uma SAM formada pelo aminoÃcido L-cisteÃna (cys), uma vez que nenhuma das SAMs estudadas acessou a reaÃÃo de TE. O processo redox foi observado em 0, 086 V o que sugere a forma nativa. Os dados de QCM e SPR indicaram, tambÃm, a formaÃÃo de uma monocamada sobre a SAM de cys (Au/cys/Mb). Valores de â 49, 67 kJ mol&# 8722; 1 e &# 8722; 0, 15 para &# 916;Gads e g, respectivamente, foram calculados para a formaÃÃo da monocamada de Mb sobre a SAM de cys. O eletrodo Au/cys/Mb apresentou atividade catalÃtica em relaÃÃo a reaÃÃo de oxidaÃÃo do Ãcido ascÃrbico com uma diminuiÃÃo de 400 mV no sobrepotencial e uma reaÃÃo cineticamente controlada com uma constante de velocidade, kf, de ~ 2, 0 x 10 ^ 4 L mol- 1 s- 1. Electrochemical techniques, {{quartz crystal}} microbalance (QCM) and surface plÃsmons resonance (SPR) {{were used to}} study the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 1, 4 -ditiano (1, 4 -dt), 4 -mercaptopyridine (pyS), 5 -(4 -piridinyl) - 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole- 2 -thiol (Hpyt), thionicotinamide (TNA) and thioisonicotinamide (iTNA) {{as a result of}} the immersion of gold substrates into the respective solutions. STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) images indicate the sulfur atom as the adsorption site of these molecules and a hexagonal conformation on surface. For the iTNA molecule, the images were not conclusive. In addition, the images indicated the existence of defects even after longer immersion times (24 h). Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the adsorption process were evaluated by reductive desorption in alkaline media and QCM. The reductive <b>desorption</b> <b>potentials,</b> Edr, were observed at &# 8722; 0. 9, &# 8722; 0. 8, and &# 8722; 0. 5 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the desorption of iTNA, TNA and Hpyt, respectively. In comparison to 1, 4 -dt (&# 8722; 0. 8 V) and pyS (&# 8722; 0. 5 V) species, the Edr value of Hpyt indicates a sigma interaction whereas those of iTNA and TNA indicate an additional pi contribution. The values of the concentration of adsorbed material, gama, and fractional coverage (teta ~ 0. 9), determined, respectively, by reductive desorption and impedance are consistent with the STM images. In comparison to the desorption data, the higher values of gama calculated by QCM were assigned to the presence of water molecules since a linear relation was observed between the dipole moment and the mass change calculated by QCM. The desorption curves acquired for the pyS SAM indicated the decomposition of the monolayer thus not allowing the determination of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of adsorption. In comparison with the results obtained for the electrode modified after immersion in Na 2 S solution, it was suggested that this process is associated to the cleavage of the C&# 9472;S bond which results in the formation of an adlayer composed of atomic and/or oligomeric sulfur species. The adsorption isotherms for Hpyt, TNA and iTNA fitted the Langmuir model of adsorption allowing the determination of the free energy of adsorption, &# 916;Gads, as &# 8722; 35. 9, &# 8722; 38. 5 and &# 8722; 34, 9 kJ/mol, respectively. These values are indicative of strong interaction being typical of chemisorption. For the Frumkin model, the best correlation was found when the interaction parameter, g, was established as &# 8722; 0. 45, &# 8722; 0. 20 and &# 8722; 0. 10 for Hpyt, TNA and iTNA, respectively, indicating repulsive interactions between the adjacent molecules. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determinate the pKa of the SAMs of Hpyt (4. 2), TNA (5. 0 and 8. 5) and iTNA (4. 5 and 7. 9) by using [Fe(CN) 6] 3 &# 8722; as a probe molecule. For this study, some changes were suggested since in the method proposed in the literature the existence of more than one protonation site was not considered thus not allowing the determination of more than one pKa value as was observed for TNA and iTNA molecules. Electron transfer reactions (TE) of cytochrome c (cyt c) and myoglobin (Mb) metalloproteins were studied by using the SAMs of Hpyt, TNA, iTNA, pyS and 1, 4 -dt. For the SAMs formed with TNA and iTNA, the positive shift of 0. 2 V on the half-wave potential of cyt c in relation to that of the native protein, was assigned to the positive charge density on surface in consequence of the protonation of NH 2 groups (pKa~ 8. 0) since these measurements were carried out in physiological medium. QCM and SPR data indicated the formation of a monolayer of cyt c on the studied SAMs. This monolayer, although not being electroactive, allows the study of the TE reaction of the cyt c molecules in solution suggesting that this process involves the orbitals of the modifier molecules. For the Mb metalloprotein, a SAM of L-cysteine amino acid was used since none of the studied sulfur molecules was able to access the TE reaction. The redox process was observed at 0. 086 V suggesting the native form of Mb. QCM and SPR data indicated, also, the formation of a monolayer of Mb on the cys SAM (Au/cys/Mb). Values of â 49. 67 kJ mol&# 8722; 1 and &# 8722; 0. 15 for &# 916;Gads and g, respectively, were calculated for the formation of the monolayer of Mb on the cys SAM. The electrode Au/cys/Mb presented catalytic activity toward the oxidation reaction of ascorbic acid presenting a decrease of 400 mV in the overpotential and a kinetic controlled with a rate constant, kf, of 2. 0 x 104 L mol- 1 s- 1...|$|R
