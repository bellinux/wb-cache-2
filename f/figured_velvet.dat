[...] "For {{their holiday}} suits they had coats of <b>figured</b> <b>velvet,</b> crimson, green, blue, {{and all other}} gay colors, embroidered with gold or silver lace. Their waistcoats, which were five times as large as modern ones, were very splendid. Sometimes the whole waistcoat, which came down almost to the knees, was made of gold brocade." ...|$|E
40|$|Much {{historical}} velvet {{was designed}} to be figural, often in elaborate curvilinear floral motifs, and multiple colours. These complex patterns could be efficiently designed for and executed on the available drawlooms and their successors, the jacquard looms. Faced with such complexity, and the unavailability of jacquard looms and drawlooms, few handweavers have attempted to add velvet technique to their repertoire. However, the basic principles and weave structures of velvet are relatively simple and can be executed on simpler handlooms. Pick-up techniques and simple loom modifications make <b>figured</b> <b>velvet</b> accessible for weavers without access to complex jacquard velvet looms, allowing them to explore velvet techniques, including some of the design potential that historical textiles did not exploit...|$|E

The company {{still has the}} capability of weaving by hand using century old wooden looms to recreate 18th- and 19th-century-style brochés (a type of brocade) and velours ciselé, <b>figured</b> <b>velvets.</b> Some of these fabrics, depending on {{the complexity of the}} pattern, will only yield 12 inches of material per day, and lead times for this rarefied fabric can extend to years.|$|R

You won’t get anything newer than that anywhere. It’s an exclusive design.” ...|$|R

In May 1852 red flock wallpaper designed to simulate 16th-century Italian velvets was supplied from J. G. Crace & Co. It survived until the 1960s and in 1987 new wallpaper was reprinted from the original [...] "Rutland blocks", using distempered colours. Wool and silk brocade curtains by Crace have a pattern based on 15th-century Italian <b>figured</b> silk <b>velvets</b> devised by Pugin in 1844.|$|R

500|$|Appliqué {{work was}} {{popular in the}} Tudor era, {{especially}} for large-scale works such as wall hangings. In Medieval England, rich clothing had been bequeathed to the church to be remade into vestments; following {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries at the Reformation, the rich silks and velvets of the great monastic houses were cut up and repurposed to make hangings and cushions for private homes. [...] Shapes cut from opulent fabrics and small motifs or slips worked on fine linen canvas were applied a background fabric of <b>figured</b> silk, <b>velvet,</b> or plain wool and embellished with embroidery, in a style deriving from the later, simpler forms of Medieval work.|$|R
50|$|Prof. Eng. Valtr Komarek , MD. (10 August 1930 - 16 May 2013) was a Czech economist, {{forecaster}} and politician.

60|$|The {{reception}} {{rooms were}} less adorned than the lady's private apartment. There were {{pictures on the}} walls, and long ranks of chairs ranged round, and card-tables were set out in order. The ladies sat in rows, and the gentlemen stood in knots and talked, all in full dress, resplendent <b>figures</b> in brilliant <b>velvet,</b> gold lace, and embroidery, with swords by their sides, cocked hats, edged with gold or silver lace, under their arms, and gemmed shoe buckles. The order of creation was not yet reversed; the male creature was quite as gorgeous in colour and ornament as the female, who sat in her brocade, powder and patches, fan in hand, to receive the homage of his snuff-box.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the riders}} one was young, graceful, and fair, clad in plain doublet and hosen of blue Brussels cloth, which served {{to show his}} active and well-knit <b>figure.</b> A flat <b>velvet</b> cap was drawn forward to keep the glare from his eyes, and he rode with lips {{compressed}} and anxious face, as one who has much care upon his mind. Young as he was, and peaceful as was his dress, the dainty golden spurs which twinkled upon his heels proclaimed his knighthood, while a long seam upon his brow and a scar upon his temple gave a manly grace to his refined and delicate countenance. His comrade was a large, red-headed man upon a great black horse, with a huge canvas bag slung from his saddle-bow, which jingled and clinked with every movement of his steed. His broad, brown face was lighted up by a continual smile, and he looked slowly {{from side to side}} with eyes which twinkled and shone with delight. Well might John rejoice, for was he not back in his native Hampshire, had he not Don Diego's five thousand crowns rasping against his knee, and above all was he not himself squire now to Sir Alleyne Edricson, the young Socman of Minstead lately knighted by the sword of the Black Prince himself, and esteemed by the whole army {{as one of the most}} rising of the soldiers of England.|$|R
60|$|When {{he was no}} {{more than}} thirteen, his father had him affianced to Isabella, virgin-widow of our Richard II. and {{daughter}} of his uncle Charles VI.; and, two years after (June 29, 1406), the cousins were married at Compiégne, he fifteen, she seventeen years of age. It was in every way a most desirable match. The bride brought five hundred thousand francs of dowry. The ceremony was of the utmost magnificence, Louis of Orleans <b>figuring</b> in crimson <b>velvet,</b> adorned with no less than seven hundred and ninety-five pearls, gathered together expressly for this occasion. And no doubt it must have been very gratifying for a young gentleman of fifteen to play the chief part in a pageant so gaily put upon the stage. Only, the bridegroom might have been a little older; and, as ill-luck would have it, the bride herself was of this way of thinking, and would not be consoled for the loss of her title as queen, or the contemptible age of her new husband. Pleuroit fort ladite Isabeau; the said Isabella wept copiously.[23] It is fairly debatable whether Charles was much to be pitied when, three years later (September 1409), this odd marriage was dissolved by death. Short as it was, however, this connection left a lasting stamp upon his mind; and we find that, in the last decade of his life, and after he had re-married for perhaps the second time, he had not yet forgotten or forgiven the violent death of Richard II. Ce mauvais cas--that ugly business, he writes, has yet to be avenged.|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} was as fine as the {{arrangement}} could possibly require. As the sun passed the meridian and declined westward, the tall shadows from the scaffold-poles of Barnet's rising residence streaked the ground {{as far as to}} the middle of the highway. Barnet himself was there inspecting the progress of the works for the first time during several weeks. A building in an old-fashioned town five-and-thirty years ago did not, as in the modern fashion, rise from the sod like a booth at a fair. The foundations and lower courses were put in and allowed to settle for many weeks before the superstructure was built up, and a whole summer of drying was hardly sufficient to do justice to the important issues involved. Barnet stood within a window-niche which had as yet received no frame, and thence looked down a slope into the road. The wheels of a chaise were heard, and then his handsome Xantippe, in the company of Mrs. Downe, drove past on their way to the shore. They were driving slowly; there was a pleasing light in Mrs. Downe's face, which seemed faintly to reflect itself upon the countenance of her companion--that politesse du coeur which was so natural to her having possibly begun already to work results. But whatever the situation, Barnet resolved not to interfere, or do anything to hazard the promise of the day. He might well afford to trust the issue to another when he could never direct it but to ill himself. His wife's clenched rein-hand in its lemon-coloured glove, her stiff erect <b>figure,</b> clad in <b>velvet</b> and lace, and her boldly-outlined face, passed on, exhibiting their owner as one fixed for ever above the level of her companion--socially by her early breeding, and materially by her higher cushion.|$|R
