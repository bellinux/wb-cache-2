40|$|International audienceThis article {{introduces}} the socio-anthropological concept of <b>international</b> <b>representations</b> {{to examine the}} relationship between a civilizational rhetoric, the West European and the international politics of otherization and containment of Southeast Europe, and an essentialist and timeless bias in international relations theory, including both radical and constructivist trends. We first explore the different narrative perspectives on the Balkan wars from the beginning to the end of twentieth century. Their subsequent problematization is aimed at challenging the way how they have constructed commonplace and time-worn <b>representations,</b> which <b>international</b> society shares with different consequences in international affairs. This is a limited conception since <b>international</b> <b>representations</b> as a socio-anthropological concept are always socially, culturally and politically constructed, contested and negotiated. They do not neutrally refer to a reality in the world; they create a reality of their own. Moreover, this limited conception ignores the fact that how, by whom and in whose interest <b>international</b> <b>representations</b> are constructed is itself a form of power in international relations. Therefore, the way <b>international</b> <b>representations</b> are constructed can be problematized as an example of political and ideological projects that operate in the West as well as in the Southeast European countries that are the object of Western foreign policy...|$|R

40|$|As a {{regional}} power, Turkey aspires {{to become an}} influential international actor. As a small state, Qatar seeks to enhance its security and sovereignty and become an indispensable regional middle power. The Arab Spring protests have created an ideal context for both actors to realize their geopolitical goals. However, adverse political developments have turned most Arab Spring countries into battlegrounds wherein old geopolitical rivalries deepened and new regional alliances were constructed.

40|$|In {{this article}} the Viking motif in children’s {{literature}} is explored—from {{its roots in}} (adult) nationalist and antiquarian discourse, over pedagogical and historical texts for children, to the eventual diversification (or dissolution) of the motif into different genres and forms. The focus is on Swedish Viking narratives, but points of comparison are established with Viking children’s literature in the English-speaking world. Differences and similarities are pointed out, but more importantly, patterns of reciprocity and influence are examined. Finally, it is shown how <b>international</b> <b>representations</b> of Vikings to a growing extent have replaced {{the ones that are}} nationally and regionally determined. The Viking has ultimately become a deracinated and commodified symbol: a free-floating signifier and a wayward warrior...|$|R
