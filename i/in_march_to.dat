5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
5|$|Prince George {{was back}} in action on 12 and 13 July, {{supporting}} French troops with gunfire support from off of Krithia and Achi Baba. On 18 and 19 December she covered the evacuation of Allied troops from Suvla Bay, and the evacuation from West Beach on 8 and 9 January 1916; she {{was hit by a}} torpedo off Cape Helles on 9 January, but it failed to explode and she suffered no damage.

Pugliese and DeNucci {{continued}} to challenge for the title, and they defeated Arakawa and Sato <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> win the belts. They dropped the belts to Don and Johnny Fargo in May but regained them in a rematch the same month. Later that month, however, the Fargos regained the belts. Pugliese and DeNucci were unable to regain them, but Pugliese teamed up with Luis Martinez to win the title in December.

He received basic flight training at Oberschleissheim and Lechfeld Air Base <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> June 1918 and advanced training at Valenciennes in France in October. On 14 October, {{he was assigned to}} Jagdstaffel 35b, a Bavarian fighter squadron equipped with Fokker D.VII biplanes.

5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places were hard to find.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, Hely {{was attached to the}} operations room at RAF Coastal Command. On his return to Australia in January 1940, he was appointed Staff Officer Plans at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In October, he joined the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, as a delegate to a defence conference in Singapore. The Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Hely was promoted to temporary wing commander the following January, and was the ranking Air Force delegate at a series of staff talks in Batavia and Singapore regarding the defence of the Dutch East Indies. He became Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters in August. His promotion to acting group captain was announced on 17February 1942. Two days later, the Japanese bombed Darwin, Northern Territory; Hely circulated a memo early the next month to all commands on the lessons learnt from the raid. He was posted to Darwin in May to join North-Western Area headquarters as senior air staff officer, and was granted the temporary rank of group captain in January 1943. Hely returned to RAAF Headquarters <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> become Director of Air Staff Plans.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2012, Mancera {{resigned}} {{as attorney general}} to become candidate for the Head of Government in the July 1, 2012 election. Jesús Rodríguez Almeida took his place as Attorney General. On January 8, Mancera registered as a precandidate for Mayor of Mexico City, {{as a member of}} the PRD. On January 19, he became the official Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) candidate for Mayor of Mexico City, running against Alejandra Barrales, Gerardo Fernández Noroña, Martí Batres and Joel Ortega Cuevas, representing the leftist Progressive Movement coalition, which is formed by the PRD party, the Labor Party, and the Citizen's Movement Party. The adversaries of Mancera were Beatriz Paredes Rangel, for the Commitment to Mexico coalition, an alliance of political parties Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), Isabel Miranda de Wallace for the National Action Party (PAN), and Rosario Guerra for the New Alliance Party (PANAL). According to surveys made in late January, Mancera was between 18 and 30 points ahead of Paredes. However, the following month, electoral preferences that favored him decreased by nine points. Electoral preference for Mancera then increased from 36% <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>to</b> 41% in April in an El Universal daily poll. In May, Mancera favorability increased to 57.5%; in the same month, Adolfo Hellmund, Luis Mandoki, and Costa Bonino, in the house of Luis Creel, borrowed six million dollars on behalf of Mancera and López Obrador, but both politicians disassociated themselves from the incident, and Mancera filed a complaint against the people responsible for using his name without authorization with the Attorney General of Mexico City.|$|E
