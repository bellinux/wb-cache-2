25|$|The last {{remnants}} of the Old Park Wood were felled during the General Strike of 1926 for firewood. The Parkwood <b>Ganister</b> and Coal Mine operated between 1938 and 1963, the coal being sold to the power station and the <b>ganister</b> to make fire bricks. Neepsend suffered damage from air raids in 1940 during World War II; the gas works was severely damaged as three million cubic feet of gas stored in four gas holders was ignited. Neepsend Lane was badly damaged by bombing and the main gas main hit; nine cottages were destroyed by a large bomb in Parkwood Road.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{extraction}} {{has also}} occurred above St John's Chapel with {{the extraction of}} <b>ganister</b> which {{was used in the}} steel process at Consett. Around Frosterley, limestone, sand (crushed sandstone) and Frosterley Marble have been worked and the Broadwood Quarry recently expanded into ground held on an old licence. The crushing plant continues to operate. A quarry at Bollihope was also mooted on a similar basis but plans seem to have been discontinued. Frosterley Marble was used extensively in church architecture, there are local examples in St Michael's church Frosterley and Durham Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{presents}} a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old <b>ganister</b> mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is {{compounded by the fact that}} the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|E
50|$|Like fireclays, <b>ganisters</b> {{are found}} within Carboniferous and other {{sedimentary}} strata independent of coal beds. Thus, as {{in case of}} fireclays, not all <b>ganisters</b> are seatearths. <b>Ganisters</b> are indurated, fine-grained quartzose sandstones {{which can be used}} in the manufacture of silica brick. They are cemented with secondary silica and have a characteristic splintery fracture.|$|R
50|$|As defined, <b>ganisters</b> can {{be created}} by either the {{cementation}} of quartzose by surficial soil-forming processes to form silicrete, or by diagenetic cementation within the subsurface. Detailed studies of <b>ganisters,</b> which occur either as seatearths or elsewhere within coal-bearing strata, have {{found them to be}} ancient paleosols, which are equivalent in both physical characteristics and origin to modern silica-cemented soils, called silcretes. Modern formation of <b>ganisters</b> has been observed in the Okavango Delta of Botswana.|$|R
500|$|Sheffield's situation—amongst fast-flowing {{rivers and}} streams {{surrounded}} by hills containing raw materials such as coal, iron ore, <b>ganister,</b> and millstone grit for grindstones—made it an ideal place for water-powered industries to develop.

2500|$|For {{a period}} of 130 years from 1784 the common was in private hands and was an area of mining and quarrying, with coal and <b>ganister</b> being mined and {{sandstone}} quarried for building. There were two drift mines on the common, the Bower mine and the Top mine. The Bower mine was owned by the Oughtibridge Silica Firebrick Company and operated between 1890 and 1940 while the Top mine probably ceased production in 1943.|$|E

50|$|The Tuscarora {{may have}} been used as a <b>ganister</b> for making furnace liners in 19th century iron {{smelting}} blast furnaces of central Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{industrial use}} of <b>ganister</b> was as the lining bricks for the acid Bessemer converter, a steel-making process developed in 1856. The process could not initially be used successfully by steelworks other than Bessemer's though, owing to its {{need for a}} low phosphorus iron ore. This {{led to the development}} of the basic Bessemer or Gilchrist-Thomas process, which used a calcined dolomite lining instead of the siliceous <b>ganister.</b> This alkaline lining with a lime flux reacted with the molten iron to form a slag that removed the phosphorus impurities.|$|E
50|$|During the 1800s the Loxley Valley {{became an}} {{important}} producer of refractory bricks for the expanding Sheffield steel industry. The bricks were used to line the furnaces and were made from <b>ganister,</b> a sort of sandstone and from fireclay from the Stannington pot clay seam which was prevalent in the Loxley area. Many <b>ganister</b> and fireclay mines existed in the area supplying the local firms of Siddons Bros. (<b>Ganister),</b> Thomas Wragg & Sons (Old Wheel Brick Works) and Thomas Marshall and Co. (Storrs Bridge Brick Works) and later Hepworths, which sprang up in the district and produced the bricks. Refractory production ceased {{in the area in}} the 1990s. Wraggs and Marshalls along with Dysons at nearby Stannington, specialised in manufacturing fireclay based casting pit refractory holloware for the steel industry worldwide. Carblox, part of the Marshall group, shared the Storrs Bridge Works site manufacturing carbon blocks for use in hearths in blast furnaces.|$|E

50|$|During the 1800s the Stannington area {{together}} with the nearby Loxley Valley became an important producer of refractory bricks for the expanding Sheffield steel industry. The bricks were used to line the furnaces and were made from <b>ganister,</b> a sort of sandstone and from fireclay from the Stannington pot clay seam which was prevalent in the area. Many <b>ganister</b> and fireclay mines and quarries existed in the area with the major ones being owned by the local firms of Siddons Brothers. (High Matlock Road <b>ganister</b> quarry) and J & J Dyson (firebrick works, Griff's Works, Stopes Road) which sprang up in the district. Refractory production ceased in 2012. Dyson's along with Wragg's and Marshall's (both in the Loxley Valley) specialised in manufacturing fireclay-based casting pit refractory holloware for the steel industry worldwide. All three refractory plants (Dyson's, Marshall's and Wragg's) closed following a collapse in demand for casting pit refractories of the type made locally {{mainly because of the}} introduction of continuous casting of steel worldwide and the general demise of the British steel industry.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>ganister</b> (or {{sometimes}} gannister [...] ) is hard, fine-grained quartzose sandstone, or orthoquartzite, used in {{the manufacture}} of silica brick typically used to line furnaces. Ganisters are cemented with secondary silica and typically have a characteristic splintery fracture.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{apparent}} today, Beeley Wood {{was once an}} area of industry with mining and quarrying taking place. <b>Ganister</b> was the material that was mined, this {{is a type of}} hard sandstone used in the manufacture of silica bricks used to line industrial furnaces. The Drift mining method was used because of the slope of the land in Beeley Wood and the mines went into the hillside for a long way and to a great depth. The fact that the wood is on a slope enabled gravity trackways to be used to transport the <b>Ganister</b> down to the valley bottom. The <b>Ganister</b> was also quarried in at least one location in the woods and the overgrown remnants of a large quarry can still be seen today. The largest of the mines was the Beeley Wood Mine, owned by the Silica Fire Brick Company and managed by J.T. Minnis for many years, in the 1920s and 1930s over 30 workers were employed and 12 ponies were used. In recent years the Coal Authority have inspected and fenced off various old shafts in {{the upper part of the}} wood.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1920s, the Wisewood {{area was}} a rural {{location}} of mostly farmers fields. There were scattered small cottages and farm buildings with the population employed as farm labourers, quarrymen, steel workers, <b>ganister</b> miners {{or in the}} manufacturing of pocket knives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganister</b> {{mining and}} {{quarrying}} were other industries that grew in the area. Quarrying developed {{from the middle of}} the 17th century when there was an expansion of farming in the area and farmhouses and cottages needed to be built for the workers. The biggest quarry in the area was the Middlewood quarry off Mowson Lane which was owned by George Turner. Local historian Joe Castle has suggested that stone from this quarry was used to build the Wicker Arches in Sheffield. The quarry closed at the start of World War II and is now a new housing development. There were three <b>ganister</b> mines in the immediate Worrall area. The Yews Mine and the Langhouse Mine were owned by Charles Bramall, while the Stubbin Mine was owned by the Oughtibridge Silica Firebrick Company and was the last to close in November 1927.|$|E
50|$|High-temperature applications, such as masonry ovens and the like, {{generally}} {{require the}} use of a refractory cement; concretes based on Portland cement can be damaged or destroyed by elevated temperatures, but refractory concretes are better able to withstand such conditions. Materials may include calcium aluminate cements, fire clay, <b>ganister</b> and minerals high in aluminum.|$|E
50|$|Besides lead, {{silver and}} {{fluorspar}} were extracted from Weardale. Large amounts of ironstone were taken, {{especially from the}} Rookhope area, during the Industrial Revolution to supply ironworks at Consett and other sites in County Durham. Local deposits of other minerals were also found on occasion. <b>Ganister</b> (hard sandstone) and dolerite (whinstone, basalt) have also been quarried {{in the past in}} Weardale.|$|E
50|$|From {{detailed}} {{studies of}} ganisters, geologists {{have concluded that}} the typical <b>ganister</b> is the silicified surface horizon, i.e. E horizon, of a buried soil, called “paleosol”, developed in sandy sediments. These and other studies have found ganisters to contain abundant evidence of having once been the upper horizon of a soil, which has developed in loamy or sandy sediments. The evidence includes some combination of carbonized roots and rootlets, rhizoliths, illuvial clay cutans, silcrete-like silica cements, and the leaching and alteration of the sandy sediments by weathering and plants. These studies argue that the destruction of easily weathered minerals, i.e. feldspar, within the surface horizon of a soil by soil-forming processes is what creates the quartz-rich nature of ganisters. The silica-cementation that creates a <b>ganister</b> typically results from dissolution of plant opal within a soil profile and its redeposition as silica cement within it. The formation of ganisters have been observed within modern soils, such as in the Okavango Delta of Botswana.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{employer}} is Cenveo, {{in the northwest}} end of the borough. In 2011 Cenveo purchased the Williamsburg location of MeadWestvaco. In 2006, MeadWestvaco reopened the former Sweetheart/Fonda building as a new West Plant. Other business include a Martin General Store, a Williamsburg C&S Market (groceries), branches of the Clearfield Bank and Trust and First National Bank, Martins, Nic's Grab n Go, and a laundromat. In addition to sandwiches and groceries, two pizza shops (the Sizzler and OIP) {{are located in the}} borough. Several mechanics offer car repairs, and gasoline is available at one convenience store. Bicycle rentals were available at Past to Present at the trailhead, but are no longer. McFarland Bicycle in <b>Ganister</b> now fills that need. Dairy cattle and other agricultural farms surround Williamsburg. Grannas Brothers operate a large stone quarry just outside Williamsburg, in nearby <b>Ganister.</b> White Deer Run has a D&A treatment center in nearby Cove Forge. Many residents are employed in the surrounding larger communities such as Altoona, Hollidaysburg, and Huntingdon.|$|E
50|$|As {{the iron}} {{industry}} in the region faded in the early 1900s, the railroad came to subsist on coal traffic for about 90% of its revenue. Large plants for the manufacture of silica brick were developed at Mount Union {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, and these became major customers for coal and also for <b>ganister</b> rock, which was quarried at multiple points along the railroad.|$|E
50|$|Where a <b>ganister</b> {{underlies}} coal as a seatearth, {{it typically}} is penetrated by numerous root traces. These root traces typically consist of carbonaceous material. Ganisters that contain {{an abundance of}} fossil roots, which appear as fine carbonaceous, pencil-like streaks or markings, are called “pencil ganisters”. In other cases, the root traces consist of fine, branching nodules, called “rhizoliths”, which formed around the roots before they decayed.|$|E

50|$|Mount Union is a borough in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, {{approximately}} 44 mi {{southeast of}} Altoona and 12 mi southeast of Huntingdon, on the Juniata River. In the vicinity are found bituminous coal, <b>ganister</b> rock, fire clay, and some timber. A major Easter grass factory {{is located in}} the northern quadrant of the borough limits; until May 2007, the facility was owned by Bleyer Industries.
