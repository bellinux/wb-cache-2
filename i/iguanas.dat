5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban <b>iguanas</b> was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population. As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of <b>iguanas</b> by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban <b>iguanas</b> held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and <b>iguanas,</b> octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{are also}} widely {{distributed}} among host taxa, which include marsupial and placental mammals, birds, reptiles such as snakes, <b>iguanas</b> and lizards, and amphibians.|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} a marked {{preference}} for the green <b>iguana</b> (<b>Iguana</b> <b>iguana)</b> over the black <b>iguana</b> (Ctenosaura pectinata) in the region, though both are eaten. [...] The native Mexican green <b>iguana</b> is becoming scarce because of habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{only known}} host species is the Green <b>Iguana</b> lizard <b>Iguana</b> <b>iguana.</b>|$|R
5|$|Cuban <b>iguanas</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana {{makes its}} burrow near cacti or thistles, {{sometimes}} {{even within the}} cactus itself. These thorny plants offer protection and their fruit and flowers offer the <b>iguanas</b> food. In areas without cacti, the lizards make their burrows in dead trees, hollow logs, and limestone crevices.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several <b>iguanas</b> sunning themselves in a canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E

25|$|Cyclura ricordi, {{commonly}} known as the Hispaniolan ground <b>iguana,</b> Ricord's ground <b>iguana,</b> Ricord's <b>iguana,</b> or Ricord's rock <b>iguana,</b> is a critically endangered species of rock <b>iguana.</b> It is found on the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and is the only known species of rock <b>iguana</b> to coexist with the rhinoceros <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta). Its natural habitat is dry savanna within three subpopulations in the southwestern Dominican Republic. It is threatened by habitat loss due to agricultural encroachment.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the wild}} {{population}} is in decline because of predation by feral animals and habitat loss caused by human agricultural development, {{the numbers of}} <b>iguanas</b> have been bolstered {{as a result of}} captive-breeding and other conservation programs. Cyclura nubila has been used to study evolution and animal communication, and its captive-breeding program has been a model for other endangered lizards in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev William Buckland, a {{professor}} of geology at Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus {{and became the first}} person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal. The second dinosaur genus to be identified, Iguanodon, was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell– the wife of English geologist Gideon Mantell. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern <b>iguanas.</b> He published his findings in 1825.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} and famous animal of Puerto Rico {{is probably the}} common coquí, a small endemic frog, {{and one of the}} 86 species that constitute Puerto Rico's herpetofauna. Some native freshwater fish inhabit Puerto Rico, but some species, introduced by humans, have established populations in reservoirs and rivers. The low richness-high diversity pattern is also apparent among invertebrates, which constitutes most of the archipelago's fauna. Also there are <b>iguanas.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Lesser Antilles <b>iguana</b> {{has a more}} blocky, {{shortened}} face {{than the}} green <b>iguana</b> and lacks the distinctive stripe pattern present along the green <b>iguana's</b> tail. The feature that most easily distinguishes these two species is the large, round scale that the green <b>iguana</b> has below each ear hole but which the Lesser Antillean <b>iguana</b> lacks.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} {{geological}} features, the reserve is home for Xerophyte plant life comprising many plant species. Animal species are also {{noted in the}} reserve. The endemic animal species recorded are Skink Désirade, the Gaïac, and <b>Iguana</b> Lesser Antilles (<b>Iguana</b> delicatissima). There are also few Green <b>Iguana</b> (<b>Iguana</b> <b>iguana),</b> considered an invasive species which needs to be excluded from the reserve.|$|R
5|$|The {{strategy}} proved successful, {{according to}} Alberts, when the released head-started <b>iguanas</b> reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved like their wild-born counterparts. This {{strategy has been}} implemented with great success with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America, notably the Jamaican iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana, Ricord's iguana, Allen Cays iguana, Acklins ground iguana, and Anegada iguana.|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban <b>iguanas</b> {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet {{of smoke}} from a {{recently}} active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land <b>iguanas.</b> Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E
50|$|The blue <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura lewisi), {{also known}} as the Grand Cayman <b>iguana,</b> Grand Cayman blue <b>iguana</b> or Cayman Island blue <b>iguana,</b> is an {{endangered}} species of lizard endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. Previously listed as a subspecies of the Cuban <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura nubila), it was reclassified as a separate species in 2004 because of genetic differences discovered four years earlier. The blue <b>iguana</b> is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69 years). The record is 67 years.|$|R

5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of <b>iguanas</b> and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine <b>iguanas,</b> sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as <b>iguanas,</b> monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{naturally}} distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout {{as many as}} 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast, which {{has one of the}} most robust populations. Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland. These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, Desembarco del Granma National Park, Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban <b>iguanas</b> cannot be determined. The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base. An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, eight <b>iguanas</b> {{were moved}} from Anegada to Guana Island, British Virgin Islands, {{to start a}} second {{population}} in part of the species' former range. Guana Island is not a limestone island, and does not provide as many natural retreats as Anegada does. The <b>iguanas</b> appear to be doing well and reproducing in areas free of feral sheep, which is its only competitor for vegetation. Approximately 20 adult <b>iguanas</b> are estimated to inhabit Guana and offspring have been seen each year since 1987. Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep, which may improve the habitat for <b>iguanas.</b>|$|E
