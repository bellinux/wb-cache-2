Thus, a model to calculate the <b>external</b> pressure of <b>casing</b> is established with finite element method. In the model a contact is built between the outer wall of the casing and the inner wall of the cement sheath. The <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure can be got through extracting contact force of results. The numerical results and analysis show that: The largest <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure exists {{in the direction of}} minimum horizontal stress of formation rather than {{in the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. There exists such matching between the cement sheath elastic modulus and formation elastic modulus: When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is small, reducing its value is conducive to reduce the <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure and to prolong casing service life. When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is large, increasing its value is conducive to reduce the <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure and to prolong casing service life. The <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure will become large with the increase of Poisson's ratio of cement sheath. With the increase of the degree of the formation stress unevenness, the maximum <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure increases and the smallest external decreases. The increasing of the non-uniformity degree of formation stress makes the non-uniformity degree of <b>casing</b> <b>external</b> pressure and the risk of casing failure increase.

Such an entertainment of course does not supply to the arena that element of the exquisite which I spoke of as wanting. The exquisite at Nimes is mainly represented by the famous Maison Carree. The first impression you receive from this delicate little building, as you stand before it, is that you have already seen it many times. Photographs, engravings, models, medals, have placed it definitely in your eye, so that from the sentiment with which you regard it curiosity and surprise are almost completely, and per- haps deplorably, absent. Admiration remains, how- ever, - admiration of a familiar and even slightly patronizing kind. The Maison Carree does not over- whelm you; you can conceive it. It is not one of the great sensations of the antique art; but it is perfectly felicitous, and, in spite of having been put to all sorts of incongruous uses, marvellously preserved. Its slender columns, its delicate proportions, its charming com- pactness, seemed to bring one nearer to the century that built it than the great superpositions of arenas and bridges, and give it the interest that vibrates from one age to another when the note of taste is struck. If anything were needed to make this little toy-temple a happy production, the service would be rendered by the second-rate boulevard that conducts to it, adorned with inferior cafes and tobacco-shops.

Following an April 2008 workshop by the Turkish Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Submarine Institute of Australia, the recommendation was made against raising the wreck.

Moving AE2 would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard. Instead, the workshop advised that the submarine be preserved through the use of sacrificial anodes to reduce corrosion, along with buoys and a surveillance system to mark the wreck and detect unauthorised access and potential damage.|$|R
