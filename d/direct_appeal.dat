Their appeals were dismissed, as was a <b>direct</b> <b>appeal</b> to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped. Vietnamese Buddhists reacted to the incident by contending that Diệm's men were planning to assassinate monks, while Madame Nhu repeated earlier claims that the US government had been trying to overthrow her brother-in-law.|$|E

5|$|In 1528, {{sweating}} sickness {{broke out}} with great severity. In London, {{the mortality rate}} was great and the court was dispersed. Henry left London, frequently changing his residence; Anne Boleyn retreated to the Boleyn residence at Hever Castle, but contracted the illness; her brother-in-law, William Carey, died. Henry sent his own physician to Hever Castle to care for Anne, and shortly afterwards, she recovered. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment from Catherine. Henry had set his hopes upon a <b>direct</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Holy See, acting independently of Cardinal Wolsey, to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans related to Anne. In 1527 William Knight, the King's secretary, was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, {{on the grounds that}} the dispensing bull of Pope Julius II permitting him to marry his brother's widow, Catherine, had been obtained under false pretences. Henry also petitioned, in the event of his becoming free, a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in the first degree of affinity, whether the affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection. This clearly referred to Anne.|$|E

50|$|The Supreme Court has appellate {{jurisdiction}} over <b>direct</b> <b>appeals</b> from the Superior Court, Family Court, and Court of Chancery.

25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{statutory}} new trial motions, the availability of <b>direct</b> <b>appeal,</b> {{and the expansion of}} the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis had, by the 1930's, become a remedy practically obsolete except in the most rare of instances and applicable to only a very limited class of cases. The statutory motion for new trial has, for most purposes, superseded the common law remedy; and, until recent years, coram nobis was virtually obsolete in California.|$|E
50|$|Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California, 528 U.S. 152 (2000), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court decided an {{appellant}} who was the defendant in a criminal case cannot refuse the assistance of counsel on <b>direct</b> <b>appeals.</b> This case is in contrast to Faretta v.

40|$|The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) {{contains}} a provision restricting federal courts from considering any authority other than holdings of the Supreme Court {{in determining whether}} to grant a state prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s petition for habeas corpus. Through an empirical study of cert filings and cases decided by the Supreme Court, we assess this provision 2 ̆ 7 s impact {{on the development of}} federal constitutional criminal doctrine. Before AEDPA and other restrictions on federal habeas corpus, lower federal courts and state courts contributed to doctrinal development by engaging in a 2 ̆ 2 dialogue 2 ̆ 2 (as described by Robert M. Cover and T. Alexander Aleinikoff in a 1977 article). This dialogue served to articulate the broad constitutional principles set forth in Supreme Court precedent. AEDPA has effectively ended the conversation, because under AEDPA federal courts lack the power to resolve emerging constitutional issues in the context of state prisoners 2 ̆ 7 federal habeas petitions. Now that only Supreme Court precedent can provide the basis for federal habeas relief under AEDPA, it is more important for open questions to be presented to the Supreme Court. Unless cert is sought and granted in cases arising out of state criminal proceedings, constitutional criminal doctrine may be frozen. Current certiorari practice is out of step with this reality. Our analysis of the procedural posture of criminal cases in which certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court over the past twelve years demonstrates that, since 1995, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s certiorari grants in criminal cases have been tilting away from federal prisoners’ <b>direct</b> <b>appeals</b> and towards state prisoners 2 ̆ 7 federal habeas and (to a lesser degree) state court <b>direct</b> <b>appeals.</b> Because the Court is not, as a general matter, using certiorari grants in state prisoners 2 ̆ 7 federal habeas cases to develop doctrine, it appears that certiorari from state court <b>direct</b> <b>appeals</b> is poised to become the primary vehicle for such development. Yet an empirical analysis of certiorari petitions filed in the October 2006 Supreme Court term reveals a gap between this opportunity for doctrinal development and practitioners 2 ̆ 7 current certiorari-seeking behavior. We coded 347 2 ̆ 2 paid 2 ̆ 2 certiorari petitions and a sample of 300 in forma pauperis petitions, categorizing cases by procedural posture. Although certiorari grants in federal prisoners 2 ̆ 7 <b>direct</b> <b>appeals</b> are declining dramatically, the leading category of cert filings remains federal prisoners 2 ̆ 7 <b>direct</b> <b>appeals.</b> Given that there are far more state criminal proceedings each year than federal prosecutions, we argue these trends demonstrate an opportunity to file more and better certiorari petitions from state criminal proceedings. We urge the criminal defense community to close this 2 ̆ 2 cert gap, 2 ̆ 2 both to ensure a better standard of review for individual clients and to promote continued development of the law...|$|R
25|$|Sandiford {{had seven}} days to {{lodge an appeal}} {{following}} the sentence. An initial letter of appeal drafted by diplomats was rejected by court officials because guidelines require an appeal to be filed from the prison. On 28 January Gede Ketut Rantam, registrar of Denpasar District Court in Bali confirmed his office had received an appeal request from Sandiford. She was then given a further fourteen days to file a more detailed appeal. The appellate system of Indonesia has three levels; the High Court, the Supreme Court, and a <b>direct</b> <b>appeal</b> for clemency to the President.|$|E
25|$|The main {{distinction}} between the MCA and AEDPA, the Court went on to explain, was that AEDPA applies in practice to those prisoners serving a sentence after having been tried in open court and whose sentences have been upheld on <b>direct</b> <b>appeal,</b> whereas the MCA suspends {{the application of the}} writ to those detainees whose guilt has not yet been legally determined. In other words, the comparison to AEDPA was found by the majority to be misplaced, in that AEDPA's limitations on habeas review stemmed from cases that had already been to trial, whereas the cases involving MCA had not been to trial and therefore habeas review would have been appropriate.|$|E
25|$|When Dowler {{failed to}} return home, she was {{reported}} missing to the police at 7:00pm. A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a <b>direct</b> <b>appeal</b> to Dowler {{in the hope that}} she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that her daughter had run away, but said that she could not think of a reason why she would want to do so. The Independent reported in 2011 that Dowler had, some time previously, written a mock leaving-home letter and notes showing she had been unhappy.|$|E
