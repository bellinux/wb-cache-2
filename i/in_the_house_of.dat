5|$|A {{statement}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and {{a detailed}} White Paper {{was published in}} December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report was introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E

5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the Republican majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E
