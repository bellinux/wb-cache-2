5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E
5000|$|Marier once <b>said</b> <b>he</b> [...] "got {{hooked on}} chant" [...] {{as a college}} student in the 1930s when he heard a 78 rpm {{recording}} of the choir of the Abbey of Solesmes, France. [...] "It was the most beautiful music I had ever heard", <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> <b>later</b> studied at Solesmes under Dom Joseph Gajard.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>later</b> <b>said</b> {{his years}} in school were the darkest and most bitter of his life. At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home, where he was abused, being told that it was [...] "to improve his character". <b>He</b> <b>later</b> <b>said</b> the faculty had {{discouraged}} him from writing, driving him into a depression.|$|R
5000|$|... "Of all of it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>later</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "the {{travel was}} of most value." ...|$|R
25|$|On August 7, 1973, {{while he}} was out on patrol in the park, Sullivan saw a storm cloud forming and drove away quickly. But the cloud, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> seemed to be {{following}} him. When he finally thought he had outrun it, he decided {{it was safe to}} leave his truck. Soon after, he was struck by a lightning bolt. Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has been}} a great source of {{inspiration}} for Michael Stipe of R.E.M. Listening to her album Horses when he was 15 made a huge impact on him; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> [...] "I decided then that I was going to start a band." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1864, Rockefeller married Laura Celestia [...] "Cettie" [...] Spelman (1839–1915), {{daughter}} of Harvey Buell Spelman and Lucy Henry. They had four daughters and one son together. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> [...] "Her judgment was always better than mine. Without her keen advice, I {{would be a}} poor man." ...|$|E

5|$|In May 1984, Larson {{used most}} of his savings to fly to Los Angeles to {{audition}} for Press Your Luck. Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer Bill Carruthers overruled him, a move <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>later</b> regretted. Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of the taping session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984.|$|R

500|$|Although {{he disliked}} the Beaux-Arts {{emphasis}} at MIT, Pei excelled in his studies. [...] "I certainly don't regret {{the time at}} MIT", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later.</b> [...] "There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture." [...] Pei received his B.Arch. degree in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Pei's ancestors' success {{meant that}} the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was [...] "not {{cultivated}} {{in the ways of}} the arts". The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. [...] "I have cultivated myself", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1952 Pei and {{his team}} began work {{on a series of}} {{projects}} in Denver, Colorado. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than twenty-five percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas. One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography. [...] "I learned the process of development," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> [...] "and about the city as a living organism." [...] These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.|$|E
50|$|On December 17, 1922, Jenks Harris, {{a would-be}} cowboy actor, and {{a gang of}} {{partners}} in crime, robbed the bank in Piru of $11,000. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> when <b>later</b> caught in Los Angeles, that he conceived of the idea while on location at Piru with the film company Universal.|$|R
5000|$|James Mackay of Decatur {{was one of}} 32 state House {{members who}} opposed the flag change. [...] "There was only one reason for putting the flag on there. Like the gun rack {{in the back of}} a pickup truck, it {{telegraphs}} a message," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> decades <b>later.</b>|$|R
500|$|Those in the {{situation}} room reportedly laughed when they heard him say [...] "I am in control here". <b>He</b> <b>later</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|R
500|$|At one point, Chabon {{submitted}} a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. [...] "It was really scary," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later.</b> [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, because I thought, What if I {{have to give the}} money back?" [...] "I used to go down to my office and fantasize about all the books I could write instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Koenig {{asked to}} {{audition}} for the part of Dr. Keniclius, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that it was [...] "lip service" [...] {{and they were not}} seriously considering him. He did manage to include a reference to himself in the episode, as the walking plant is called a Retlaw – Walter spelt backwards. This was a reference to aliens in the 1940s comic book Planet Comics who spoke backwards. He later used a similar idea in [...] "The Stranger", a Land of the Lost episode he wrote, in which Koenig introduced the character Enik. This character was originally called Eneg, backwards for Gene as a reference to Gene Roddenberry.|$|E
500|$|Elected by the College of landowners in Dorohoi County to {{the ad hoc}} Divan, a newly {{established}} assembly through which Moldavians had gained {{the right to decide}} their own future, he kept in line with the Wallachian representatives to their respective Divan, and resumed his campaign in favor of union and increased autonomy, as well as the principles of neutrality, representative government, and, as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> rule by [...] "a foreign prince". However, both Kogălniceanu and Alecsandri initially presented themselves as candidates for the regency title of Caimacam—Alecsandri, who was more popular, renounced first in order to back Costache Negri. Negri's candidature was dismissed by the Ottomans, who preferred to appoint Teodor Balș (June 1856).|$|E

5000|$|Lapchick was rangy at 6-foot-5, {{making him}} a {{valuable}} commodity {{at a time when}} a jump ball was held after every basket. “I played one manager against the other,” <b>he</b> <b>said</b> years <b>later.</b> “I bargained with the managers for every game. When there was a clash of dates, I took the best offer.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Fordice {{offended}} Jewish {{groups such}} as B'nai B'rith by referring to America as [...] "a Christian Nation" [...] during a Republican governors conference. South Carolina governor Carroll Campbell quickly offered a correction, adding [...] "Judeo-" [...] as a prefix to Christian, but Fordice snapped back that he meant what <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> <b>later</b> apologized for any offense. Fordice refused to discuss any increase in public school pay rates across the state, even though Mississippi ranked 49th in the nation. When teachers discussed striking he ordered that any teacher who went on strike be immediately fired.|$|R
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from colitis-X, {{a disease}} of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning. It {{infected}} many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and {{did not return to}} the Quarter Horse business for 15years. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>later</b> that [...] "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses." [...] Another time, Pollard remarked that [...] "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{suffered}} a setback, however, when Wentz had an emotional breakdown in February 2005, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. He had {{withdrawn from the}} rest of the group, with his condition only apparent through his lyrics, and had also become obsessed with the recent Indian tsunami and his own self-doubt. [...] "It is particularly overwhelming when you are on the cusp of doing something very big and thinking that it will be a big flop," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later.</b> Wentz swallowed a handful of Ativan anxiety pills (he described the act as [...] "hypermedicating") in the Chicago Best Buy parking lot. After being rushed to the hospital and having his stomach pumped, Wentz moved back home to Wilmette to live with his parents.|$|E

5000|$|... "It {{was an odd}} feeling," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> years <b>later.</b> [...] "The {{nearer the}} finish line came, the more I had to tell myself I was just in a kermesse, {{although}} with a few more spectators than usual. I had to forget that I was riding for a world title because if I'd realised that, I'd never have won." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>later</b> <b>said</b> {{that his}} {{attraction}} to the company {{was based on the}} reputation it had for encouraging creativity and independence among its staff.|$|R
500|$|The growing {{popularity}} of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, he designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large mobile sculpture by American artist Alexander Calder was later added to the lobby. Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting {{to the public in}} the same way as the central room of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The modern museum, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later,</b> [...] "must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young".|$|E
500|$|Two {{types of}} traditions exist {{regarding}} Ali's awareness of his fate {{long before the}} assassination. This foreknowledge was through his own [...] "premonition of it" [...] or by Muhammad. Based on numerous traditions, Ali's beard staining with [...] "blood flowing from his head" [...] had been revealed by Muhammad or Ali. Another set of traditions by Muhammad says that [...] "the most evil man among the ancients was he who had killed the camel of the prophet Salih and among his contemporaries, he who would kill Ali." [...] The night of the assassination, Ali said that his fate was about to come true, and when he left home in the morning, [...] "geese followed him, cackling" [...] weeping for his funeral, as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
500|$|When Gatski graduated, Sam Clagg, a {{teammate}} at Marshall, helped {{get him a}} tryout with the Cleveland Browns after contacting John Brickels, an assistant coach with West Virginia ties. The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility. [...] "I didn't know what was going to happen," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>later.</b> [...] "I just went up there to see what would happen." ...|$|E
