The project starts with a leaching process of sludge in sulphuric acid solution in three stages followed by copper cementation step, using iron scrap as precipitating agent. It was found that metals dissolution was almost completed for the three stages of leaching process. Extraction rates of 99 % for Cu and Ni were achieved under the leaching. The solid residue separated from the leaching solution is mostly constituted by gypsum (CaSO 4), and presents heavy metal content below 1 %. Copper cementation process was performed at a pH of 2. Such pH level led to insignificant precipitation of other metals present in the leaching solution, particularly chromium. The recovery rate of copper is about 99 % with a purity grade of 99 % which enables its application as a commercial product. Nickel hydroxide precipitation was performed by adding sodium hydroxide solution. Results showed a successfully nickel hydroxide extraction obtaining 99 % with a purity grade of more than 98 %.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of recovering copper from electronic industrial waste mud (<b>galvanic</b> <b>sludge)</b> {{using a combination}} of leaching and electrowinning has been examined. Leaching with sulfuric acid was found to be the most efficient and cost-effective way of extracting the copper from the sludge, and the optimum acid concentration and time were determined. The copper was then extracted by electrowinning in a batch recirculation electrochemical reactor (Porocell™) employing a three-dimensional carbon felt cathode. The influence of applied current, flow rate and the presence of other metal ion contaminates on the rate and current efficiency of copper electrowinning was investigated. An analysis of the experimental data showed that the current efficiency was lower than unity even though the limiting current for copper deposition was not exceeded. This low current efficiency was attributed to the occurrence of a side reaction, most likely the reduction of dissolved oxygen or oxygen-induced corrosion. The influence of this side reaction can be minimized by operating at relatively high currents and low flow rates...|$|R

In this sense, there are some doubts {{on the part of}} the scientific community as well as of the fertilizer production sector, whether the extractor requested by the government (Normative Instruction No. 28, called 2 nd extractor), which is citric acid 2 % (2 % CA) (Brasil, 2007 b), is effective in predicting the plant availability of Zn via mineral fertilizers and about the agronomic significance of the required minimal solubility of 60 % compared to the total content (HCl) (Brasil, 2007 a). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the alternative extractors DTPA, EDTA, neutral ammonium citrate (NAC), buffer solution pH 6. 0, 10 % HCl, 10 % sulfuric acid, 1 % acetic acid, water, and hot water to quantify the contents of Zn available for maize and compare them with indices of agronomic efficiency of fertilizers and industrial by-products when applied to dystrophic Clayey Red Latosol and Dystrophic Alic Red Yellow Latosol with medium texture. The rate of Zn applied to the soil was 5 mg kg- 1, using the sources zinc sulfate, commercial granular zinc, ash and <b>galvanic</b> <b>sludge,</b> ash and two brass slags. Most Zn was extracted from the sources by DTPA, 10 % HCl, NAC, 1 % acetic acid, and 10 % sulfuric acid. Recovery by the extractors 2 % CA, EDTA, water, and hot water was low. The agronomic efficiency index was found to be high when using <b>galvanic</b> <b>sludge</b> (238 %) and commercial granular zinc (142 %) and lower with brass slag I and II (67 and 27 %, respectively). The sources galvanizing ash and brass ash showed solubility lower than 60 % in 2 % CA, despite agronomic efficiency indices of 78 and 125 %, respectively. The low agronomic efficiency index of industrial by-products such as brass slag I and galvanizing ash can be compensated by higher doses, provided there is no restriction, as well as for all other sources, in terms of contaminant levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury as required by law (Normative Instruction No 27 / 2006).

Em diversos países do mundo crescentes quantidades de resíduos industriais são geradas anualmente. Dependendo das características do resíduo, o mesmo pode tornar-se uma importante fonte de matéria-prima em substituição aos materiais convencionais. O processo de Solidificação/Estabilização (S/E) é uma tecnologia de gerenciamento de resíduos industriais bastante empregada em países desenvolvidos. O sucesso do tratamento depende da interferência causada pelo resíduo e, {{principal}}mente, da fixação dos eventuais poluentes tóxicos no produto final obtido. Neste estudo o cimento sulfo-aluminoso (CSA) e a cinza pesada (CZP) foram empregados no tratamento do lodo galvânico (LDG), o qual apresenta o Cr como principal poluente. Os produtos obtidos da S/E foram avaliados quanto ao tempos de pega, à resistência mecânica, à solubilização e ao potencial de lixiviação de contaminantes. As modificações ocorridas durante o processo de hidratação do CSA, em função da presença do LDG e da CZP foram investigadas fazendo-se uso de técnicas analíticas para investigar a formação do principal composto de hidratação (a etringita) e o consumo das principais fase mineralógicas do CSA (yelimita e a gipsita). A eficiência deste cimento quanto à retenção do Cr também foi investigada, empregando sais sintéticos. Os resultados mostraram que a presença do LDG nos cimentos CSA reduziu inicialmente o consumo de sulfato de cálcio (gipsita) e, conseqüentemente, reduziu a formação da etringita. A yelimita e a gipsita foram totalmente consumidas quando a cinza pesada foi empregada. O encapsulamento do Cr nas fases hidratadas formadas e nas partículas de CZP foi verificado. Nos ensaios com sais sintéticos ocorreu a formação da fase U em função da presença do Na no sal empregado e constatou-se que a retenção do Cr está mais relacionada às condições de formação de etringita do que da quantidade formada. ABSTRACT Every year increasing {{amounts of}} industrial waste are generated in the whole world. Thus, researches that study the treatment and ways to reuse the by-products are becoming even more important. Depending {{on the characteristics of}} the waste, it can be an important source of raw material in order to replace the natural ones. The success of the treatment depends on the interference of the waste in the properties of the product, and, especially, the fixation of possible pollutants on the final product. In this study the sulfoaluminate cement and the bottom ash were used for the treatment of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>sludge</b> (LDG), which presents Cr as the main pollutant. Two ways of valorization had been studied. In the first one this waste was incorporated to CSA, in the quantity of 25 %, by weight, to compose new CSA cement (CSA’) with 25 % LDG and 75 % CSA. In second one the sulfoaluminate cement was added to the bottom ash, in order to treat the <b>galvanic</b> <b>sludge.</b> The setting time, the compressive strength, the hydrated phases formed and leaching were determined. The efficiency of the CSA to retain Cr, in both oxidation states were also investigated, using synthetic salts. The results show that the presence of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>sludge</b> (LDG) in cements CSA reduced the calcium sulphate consumption (gypsum) and consequently reduced the formation of the ettringite (main hydrated phase of cement CSA). In solid matrices MS, the main phase of the CSA was consumed and the bottom ash served as alumina source for the formation of the ettringite. The retention of the Cr in the hydrated phases of the CSA' and the MS also was verified. In the tests with synthetic salts, the formation of U phase was verified according to the presence of Na in the utilized salt and it showed that the retention of the metal is more related to the conditions of formation than the amount of ettringite formed...|$|R

These materials have a significant potential {{for the production of}} clay ceramic bricks. This paper focuses on the viability of the inertization of heavy metals from GSW mixed with clays. The original materials were obtained by mixing three types of raw clay (red, yellow and black) in equal parts with GSW. These mixtures were characterized by XRD, XRF, and chemical elemental analysis CHNS. The dosage of GSW in the clay–GSW bricks was up to 5 wt. %. The bricks were then manufactured using conventional processes. The influence of the amount of GSW was evaluated after firing the clay–GSW composites at 950 °C for 1 h. The engineering properties of the fired samples, such as density, water absorption, open porosity, water suction and compressive strength, with and without the GSW, were determined. The incorporation of GSW into the clay mix clearly decreased the linear shrinkage and bulk density of the bricks in comparison with the fired clay used as a control. These GSW–clay composites also showed lower open porosity. According to the results obtained for the bulk density of the bricks, samples with GSW addition showed slightly lower values of open porosity than clay bodies, indicating that the GSW–clay samples had slightly higher closed porosity values. This was also shown by SEM. The open porosity, SEM and pore size distribution tests indicated that the porosity generated by the addition of GSW was mainly closed and, therefore, GSW bricks had excellent mechanical properties. The environmental risks of the incorporation of GSW, rich in heavy metals (Cr, Zn, Ni and others), to a clay matrix were evaluated by leaching tests of the fired products. The results indicated a successful inertization of the pollutants. Peer reviewe...|$|R
