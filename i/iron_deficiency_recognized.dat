40|$|Background &Objective: Micronutrient {{deficiencies}} are {{the most}} common nutritional disorders in the world in which <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is the most important one. This study was done for investigating the prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and its anemia in children and their mothers in Birjand city in 2011. Materials & Methods: 143 children of 1 - 5 years old who referred to the health care centers of Birjand city were chosen by multistage cluster random sampling method and both the children and mothers were studied. After filling the questionnaire about demographic characteristics of children and mothers, the hemoglobin and ferritin of both children and their mothers were measured. Results: 12. 6 % of the children and 16. 1 % of the mothers had <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency,</b> 16. 8 % of children and 15. 4 % of mothers had <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia in both children and mothers was significantly higher especially among working mothers.

40|$|Introduction: Stroke is a {{neurological}} deficit with an acute onset of vascular origin. It {{is the third}} {{leading cause of death}} in western industrialized countries. There occur some 150, 000 - 200, 000 strokes per year in Germany. About one third of stroke patients are in a permanent need of care. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is the most common and clinically relevant deficiency state in the world. Worldwide, an estimated two billion people have been affected by <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The prevalence in Europe is approximately 5 - 10 %. In about 80 % <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is the cause of anemia. The clinical symptoms of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> are very diverse, ranging up to derating and physical weakness. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and its relation to the functional status in stroke patients during the early rehabilitation in connection with the clinical picture of patients prospectively. Methods: 664 patients of an early rehabilitation facility were examined for the presence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Out of these patients, the parameters of iron metabolism of 155 patients have been examined at the end of the rehabilitation again. Furthermore, a possibly existing <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was split up in absolute (ferritin ≤ 100 μg/l) and functional (ferritin 101 - 300 μg/l and TSAT ≤ 20 % or ferritin > 300 μg/l, TSAT ≤ 20 % and CRP ≥ 5 mg/l) <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> To compare the subgroups with regard to their functional status the diagnostic tests Frührehabilitations-Barthel-Index (FRB) and Motricity-Index (MI) were used at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. Results: <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was identified in 44. 7 % of the study patients at the beginning of the rehabilitation. Women showed a higher percentage of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> (53 %) than men (37 %) (p < 0. 001). Upon completion of the rehabilitation, an <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was found in 41. 3 % of the study patients. In the used assessment methods for functional status, significantly higher results were obtained both at the beginning and at the end of the rehabilitation of patients without <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> compared to patients with <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: This study showed for the first time that an <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is common among stroke patients and is associated with a negative impact on the course of the functional status during early rehabilitation. The prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> shown here, are similar to the <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> prevalence in cardiovascular diseases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{peptide hormone}} gastrin has been {{identified}} as a major regulator of acid secretion and a potent mitogen for normal and malignant gastrointestinal cells. The importance of gastric acid in the absorption of dietary iron first became evident 50 years ago when <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia was <b>recognized</b> as a long-term consequence of partial gastrectomy. This review summarizes the connections between circulating gastrins, iron status and colorectal cancer. Gastrins bind two ferric ions with micromolar affinity and, in the case of non-amidated forms of the hormone, iron binding is essential for biological activity in vitro and in vivo. The demonstration of an interaction between gastrin and transferrin by biochemical techniques led to the proposal that gastrins catalyze the loading of transferrin with iron. Several lines of evidence, including the facts that the concentrations of circulating gastrins are increased in mice and humans with the iron overload disease hemochromatosis and that transferrin saturation positively correlates with circulating gastrin concentration, suggest the potential involvement of gastrins in iron homeostasis. Conversely, recognition that ferric ions play an unexpected role in the biological activity of gastrins may assist in the development of useful therapies for colorectal carcinoma and other disorders of mucosal proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in most devel-oping countries. However, its detection is often obscured by infections and inflammatory disorders {{that are common}} in the same populations. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> with or without concurrent anemia in different pop-ulation groups from Côte d’Ivoire and to evaluate the influence of infectious and inflammatory disorders on iron-status indexes. Design: Blood samples from 1573 children, women, and men were analyzed for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, zinc protopor-phyrin, and serum transferrin receptor. C-reactive protein was used as the indicator of inflammation or infection, and samples were screened for malarial parasites and hemoglobinopathies. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was defined as 2 of 3 iron-status indexes outside the cutoff values, and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> anemia (IDA) was defined as <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> with concurrent anemia. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the influence of malaria and inflammation on iron-status indexes. Results: The prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was 41 – 63 % in the women and children and 13 % in the men, whereas the prevalence of IDA was 20 – 39 % in the women and children and 4 % in the men. The detection of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and IDA was obscured by the high prevalence of inflammatory disorders. Conclusions: <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and IDA are highly prevalent in the women and children in Côte d’Ivoire. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was detected in 50 % of anemic women and children, which indi-cates that hemoglobin alone is not a good indicator of iron status when inflammatory disorders are highly prevalent. The serum transferrin receptor is the most useful single indicator of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> because it was the only iron-status index unaffected by malaria or inflammation.
