[...] "Here's the queen, my dears, in her gilt coach, drawn by six horses. Do you see her scepter poking out of the carriage window? She governs the nation with that. Bow to the queen. And now look at the beautiful bright water. There's the island where the ducks live. Ducks are happy creatures. They have their own way in everything, and they're good to eat when they're dead. At least they used to be good, when we had nice dinners in papa's time. I try to amuse the poor little things, Lizzie. Their papa is dead. I'm obliged to be papa and mamma to them, both in one. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> cold, my dears?" [...] She shivered as she questioned her imaginary children. [...] "Now we are at home again," [...] she said, and led the dolls to the empty fireplace. [...] "Roaring fires always in my house," [...] cried the resolute little creature, rubbing her hands cheerfully before the bleak blank grate.|$|E
6000|$|And if we {{lose sight}} of it as we {{grow up to be}} men and women, it is not because heaven goes farther off, but because we grow less heavenly. Even now, so close is heaven to us, that any one of us might enter into heaven this moment, without {{stirring}} from his seat. One real cry from the depths of your heart--"Father, forgive thy sinful child!"--one real feeling of your own worthlessness, and weakness, and emptiness, and of God's righteousness, and love, and mercy, ready for you--and you are in heaven there and then, as near the feet of the blessed Lord Jesus, as Mary Magdalen was, when she tried to clasp them in the garden. I am serious, my friends; I am not given to talk fine figures of poetry; I am talking sober, straightforward, literal truth. And the Lord sits at God's right hand too? you believe that? Then how far off is God?--for as far off as God is, so far off is the Lord Jesus, and no farther. What says St. Paul? That [...] "God is not far off from any one of us--for in Him we live, and move, and have our being" [...] . IN Him [...] . How far off is that? And is not God everywhere, if indeed we can say that He is any where? Then the Lord Jesus, who is at God's right hand, is everywhere also--here, now, with us this day. One would have thought that {{there was no need to}} prove that by argument, considering that His own blessed lips told us: [...] "Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world;" [...] and again: [...] "Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." [...] And this is the Lord whom people fancy is gone away far above the stars, till the end of time! Oh, my friends, rather bow your heads before Him here this moment. For here He is among us now, listening to every thought of our poor sinful hearts. [...] . He is where God is--God IN whom we live, and move, and have our being--and that is everywhere. Do you wish Him to be any nearer, my friends? Or do you--do you--take care what your hearts answer, for He is watching them--do you in the depth of your hearts wish that He were a little farther off? Does the notion of His being here on this earth, watching and interfering (as we call it nowadays in our atheism) with us and everything, seem unpleasant and burdensome? Is it more comfortable to you to think that He is away far up beyond the stars? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> lighter and freer for fancying that He will not visit the earth for many a year to come? In short, is it in your HEARTS that you are saying, The Lord delays His coming? ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I Need Your Love" [...] {{received}} primarily positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy rated the song {{four out of}} five stars, stating that [...] "it's Goulding's distinctively soft-yet-throaty vocal that lifts it from the generic into something special." [...] Sam Lansky of Idolator wrote that Goulding's [...] "characteristically fragile, twee vocals ... sound even more haunting in the context of Harris' futuristic electro instrumentation", adding that Harris is [...] "in fine form here." [...] Billboard commented that Goulding's [...] "fragile voice carries so much warmth that no amount of synthetic clutter can dim a line like, 'Tell me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same?/Hold me in your arms again'", but felt that [...] "Harris' beat is a bit too strenuous here".|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1969, I {{enrolled}} in a children's literature course, Ed CI 319, under Dr. Mary E. Reddin. After {{a discussion about the}} Newbery Award, as one unit of study, the class was assigned to read a Newbery Award book and a runner-up of a particular year and do a comparative study of included of these two books. The guide questions posed by the instructor included <b>the</b> following: 1) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that these books were of literary merit? What are the individual strengths and weaknesses of these books? 2) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>the</b> Award should have been given to the book that won <b>the</b> award? Or, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>the</b> runner-up deserved the award? Why? The purposes of this assignment were to have the students engage in critical analyses of books for children and to employ criteria by which children's books could be reviewed, evaluated, and judged. I chose to do my comparative study of books that received Newbery honors during 1959. The two books selected were The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare and The Family Under the Bridge by Natalie Savage Carlson...|$|R
