30|$|The {{elliptic}} equations with discontinuous coefficients {{are often}} used to describe phenomena appearing in material sciences and fluid dynamics when there are two or more distinct materials or fluids with different densities or conductivities or diffusivities. Since the solutions of these interface problems are required to satisfy interface jump conditions from conservation laws, {{it is difficult to}} find the exact solutions and construct high accuracy numerical methods. In addition, if the interface is smooth enough, then the solution of the interface problem is also smooth in individual regions where the coefficient is smooth. But due to the jump of the coefficient along the interface, the global regularity of the solution is usually low and the solution belongs to H^ 1 +α(Ω), 0 ≤α< 1. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy by using standard finite element methods. Several articles are devoted to developing methods to solve these problems, such as fitted finite element methods [1 – 3], proposed by Chen and Zou in [4], discontinuous Galerkin methods [5, 6], weak Galerkin finite element methods [7, 8], proposed by Wang and Ye in [9 – 11], immersed boundary methods [12, 13], the extended/generalized finite element methods [14], immersed interface methods, which are a kind of finite difference methods, proposed by LeVeque and Li in [15], and <b>immersed</b> finite <b>volume</b> methods [16, 17].|$|R

Within the project it became evident that an appropriate characterization of the neutron beam path is essential for the goodness of the evaluated residual stress data.

40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an <b>immersed</b> <b>volume</b> method that {{accounts}} for solid conductive bodies (hat-shaped disk) in calculation of time-dependent, three-dimensional, conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow. Design/methodology/approach - The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the heat transfer equations are discretized using a stabilized finite element method. The interface of the immersed disk is defined and rendered by the zero isovalues of a level set function. This signed distance function allows turning different thermal properties of each component into homogeneous parameters and it is coupled to a direct anisotropic mesh adaptation process enhancing the interface representation. A monolithic approach is used to solve a single set of equations for both fluid and solid with different thermal properties. Findings - In the proposed immersion technique, only a single grid for both air and solid is considered, thus, only one equation with different thermal properties is solved. The sharp discontinuity of the material properties was captured by an anisotropic refined solid-fluid interface. The robustness of the method to compute the flow and heat transfer with large materials properties differences is demonstrated using stabilized finite element formulations. Results are assessed by comparing the predictions with the experimental data. Originality/value - The proposed method demonstrates the capability of the model to simulate an unsteady three-dimensional heat transfer flow of natural convection, conduction and radiation in a cubic enclosure with the presence of a conduction body.

40|$|International audienceThe {{cost and}} quality of complex parts {{manufactured}} by thermoplastic injection is traditionally limited by design constraints on the cooling system of the mold. A possible solution is to create the mold by additive manufacturing, which {{makes it possible to}} freely design the cooling channels. Such molds normally contain hollow parts (alveoli) in order to decrease their cost. However, the complex geometry of the cooling channels and the alveoli makes it difficult to predict the performance of the cooling system. This work aims to compute the heat exchanges between the polymer, the mold and the cooling channels with complex geometries. An <b>Immersed</b> <b>Volume</b> approach is taken, where the different parts of the domain (i. e. the polymer, the cooling channels, the alveoli and the mold) are represented by level-sets and the thermo-mechanical properties of the materials vary smoothly at the interface between the parts. The energy and momentum equations are solved by a stabilized Finite Element method. In order to accurately resolve the large variations of material properties and the steep temperature gradients at interfaces, state-of-the art anisotropic mesh refinement techniques are employed. The filling stage of the process is neglected. In a first step, only the heat equation is solved, so that the packing stage is also disregarded. In a second step, thermo-mechanical effects occurring in the polymer during the packing stage are taken into account, which results in the injection of an additional amount of polymer that significantly influences the temperature evolution. The method is validated on the simple geometry of a center-gated disk and compared with experimental measurements. The agreement is very good.
