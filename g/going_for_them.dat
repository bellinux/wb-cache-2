25|$|A single {{draught horse}} can {{normally}} pull a single-furrow plough in clean light soil, but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} furrow. For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sod– and that makes hard <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down. It is usual to rest such horses every half-hour for about ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} {{was no better}} for Butler going 6 for 37 to end the game. On the other hand, University of Connecticut came out a little hot. They started how they left off, with a huge three. After that shot fell {{the rest of the}} players on Connecticut started to heat up, {{including}} star, Kemba Walker. Although they didn't go on any huge runs to extend the lead tremendously, they were able to push it up to 14 when they had the score 30-44 with about three to four minutes left in the second half. Butler was able to get within nine making 49-40 but at that point with 1:31 left on the clock it was out of reach with the way their shooting was <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Connecticut's last 8 points were all free throws concluding the game and sealing the deal for the win with a final score of 53-41.|$|E
500|$|With Watchmen, Alan Moore's {{intention}} was to create four or five [...] "radically opposing ways" [...] to perceive {{the world and to}} give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of [...] " [...] regurgitated morals" [...] down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, [...] "What we wanted to do was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> and even the best of them had their flaws." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, Blair {{received}} attention from Forbes, which interviewed her via the series' writers. Television Without Pity listed Meester in their [...] "Golden Globes 2009: Overlooked TV Shows and Performances" [...] article, labeling Blair [...] "so multi-faceted, well-dressed and beautifully played that she elevates this teen soap to something we don't even {{feel guilty about}} admitting we love."

2500|$|GameSpot's Alex Navarro {{scored the}} PC version 7 out of 10 and the Xbox 360 version 7.4 out of 10, calling the game [...] "a well-made genre {{exercise}} that's more often entertaining than not." [...] Whilst he praised Ray's levels, he {{was critical of}} Billy's, especially {{the implementation of the}} whip. He concluded that [...] "it does enough right to transcend its various issues and turn in a pleasing shooter. It does the Old West motif well, the gunslinging (and bible slinging) are a lot of fun, and the capable multiplayer modes have enough <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to give the game a bit of staying power. It doesn't quite rise past the ceiling established by other recent western shooters, but it's good, solid fun all around." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{of early}} 2017, Cardi B began {{publicly}} dating fellow American rapper Offset, {{of the southern}} hip hop group Migos, and the two quickly became a prevalent couple in the music industry. When speaking on her relationship with Offset, Cardi B told The Fader, [...] "It’s been a blessing, me meeting him and meeting his friends. I see how hard they work.

50|$|Denny also pitched well in 1978, going 14-11 with a 2.96 ERA, but he {{fell off}} badly in 1979 and {{was traded to}} Cleveland.
