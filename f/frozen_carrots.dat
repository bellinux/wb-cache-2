40|$|The textural {{quality of}} carrots {{subjected}} to pretreatments affecting the pectin structure {{in combination with}} different freezing conditions was studied. Carrot samples frozen under different conditions were extensively studied by light microscopy quantifying the freezing damage based on the analysis of different parameters (number, area, perimeter, and shape factor of tissue particles) associated with carrot tissue damage. The reduced texture loss of rapidly or cryogenically <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots,</b> compared to slowly frozen samples, {{was associated with the}} reduction in cell wall damage in the carrot tissue. In case no pretreatment was used, carrot texture was only slightly improved by using high-pressure shift freezing instead of slow freezing. Detailed analysis of the different steps involved showed that severe tissue damage occurred during the completion of the high-pressure freezing process at atmospheric pressure. However, tissue damage, and thus texture loss, of high-pressure <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> could be minimized by applying pretreatments consisting of a thermal treatment at 60 degrees C and a high-pressure treatment at 300 MPa and 60 degrees C. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Frozen {{vegetables}} represent high {{added value}} and convenience. Nevertheless, damages induced on raw matrices by processing may, however, limit their technological, sensory and nutritional characteristics. The use of solutes with thermoprotective and cryoprotective properties may {{improve the quality of}} the final products. The aim of this work was thus to evaluate the effect of trehalose and storage temperature on mechanical and functional properties of blanched and <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots.</b> METHODOLOGY 1 cm-thick sliced carrots were blanched (80 °C, 10 min) in water (control), and in 1 and 4 %w/w trehalose solutions and then frozen at different temperatures (- 18, - 40 and - 80 °C) and stored at the same temperature conditions up to 60 days. The following determinations were carried out: water gain/water loss, texture measurements (shear test), total carotenoids content and radical scavenging activity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Carrots mechanical properties and carotenoids content resulted to be affected mostly by the blanching treatment rather than the trehalose concentration. Despite the decrease in carotenoids upon blanching, the antiradical activity of the blanched samples was not significantly different in comparison to the fresh one. At all storage temperatures and for all the differently blanched samples a significant decrease of hardness was shown in the first 15 days of storage; longer storage time did not exert any further meaningful effect. At all storage temperature an increase of b-carotenoids content in all the samples occurred (ranking: trehalose 1 % > Trehalose 4 % > Control > Fresh); the antiradical activity showed an increase over storage time in the control and in the samples blanched in 1 % trehalose solutions. CONCLUSIONS Trehalose showed under the tested conditions a limited effect in limiting physical damages of <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots.</b> However, b-carotenoids content and the antiradical activity in blanched <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> seems to be related to a thermoprotective and cryoprotective effect in the vegetable tissue...|$|E

40|$|Polyacetylenes are a {{group of}} phytochemicals that have {{attracted}} significant interest in recent years due to their range of potential health-promoting bioactivities however, {{little is known about}} the effects of food processing on them. In addition, their low abundance and relative instability requires rapid and very sensitive methods for analysis and characterization. Therefore the present work demonstrated the potential of ESI-MS, in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) -quantitative methods for characterization of polyacetylenes and polyacetylene degradation. Polyacetylenes in water immersion cooked carrot disks were significantly reduced at 50 - 60 Â°C, but levels were higher at 70 - 100 oC (p 0. 05). FaDOH was particularly susceptible to degradation during aerobic storage following blanching. Oxidized forms of FaOH, e. g. falcarindione, dehydrofalcarinol, dehydrofalcarinone were detected in thermally processed samples. Boiling and roasting decreased levels of all polyacetylenes in fennel bulb. And the presence of hydroxymethylfurfural was confirmed in roasted samples of fennel. Kinetic analysis of high pressure-temperature (HPT) processing of carrot disks revealed that FaDOAc was the most barosensitive while FaDOH was the most thermosensitive. Nonetheless, HPT yielded higher retention of polyacetylenes than SV-processing. Ultrasound pretreatment followed by hot air drying (UPHD) was shown to be a promising technique for retention of polyacetylenes and carotenoids in carrot disks in comparison to blanching followed by hot air drying. In fresh cut products unit operations (mainly peeling) decreased polyacetylene retention, due to the high polyacetylene content of peels. Washing, after minimal processing, reduced polyacetylene content but retention was relatively high during storage and higher in parsnips than in <b>carrots.</b> Freezing and <b>frozen</b> storage of <b>carrot</b> disks revealed that blast <b>frozen</b> <b>carrot</b> disks retain higher amounts of polyacetylenes compared to their slow frozen counterparts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Raman spectroscopy, in its {{confocal}} micro-Raman variation, {{has been}} recently proposed as a spatially resolved method to identify carotenoids in various food matrices, being faster, non-destructive, and avoiding sample extraction, but no data {{are present in}} the literature concerning its application to the evaluation of carotenoid pattern changes after thermal treatment of carrots. RESULTS: The effect of three cooking methods (i. e. boiling, steaming and microwaving) was evaluated on <b>frozen</b> <b>carrot,</b> comparing changes on carotenoid profiles measured by means of Raman spectroscopy with their high-performance liquid chromatographic determination and colour. A more pronounced detrimental effect on carotenoids was detected in steamed carrots, in accordance with colour data. Conversely, boiling and, to a lesser extent, microwaving caused an increase in carotenoid concentration. Cooking procedures affected the Raman spectral features of carotenoids, causing a shift of vibration frequencies towards a higher energy, increase in the spectral baseline and peak intensities as well as a broadening of their width, probably in relation to the thermal degradation of longer carotenoids (i. e. the all-trans form) and the isomerization process. In particular, steamed samples showed a significantly higher increase of centre frequency, in accordance with a more pronounced isomerization and changes in colour parameters. CONCLUSION: This work showed that the evolution of Raman spectral parameters could provide information on carotenoid bioaccessibility for carrots cooked using various methods. This paves the way for a future use of this technique to monitor and optimize cooking processes aimed at maximizing carotenoid bioaccessibility and bioavailability. </p...|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{reducing}} sugars from raw and previously frozen carrot cortex tissue immersed {{in warm water}} was studied {{as a function of}} temperature (40 – 100 °C). Leaching was described as a diffusional mechanism by application of Fick's 2 nd law. This approach successfully modeled losses from raw carrots at temperatures higher than 60 °C. At low temperatures diffusion was much slower, due to a high resistence of the tissues to mass transfer, and Fick's 2 nd law could not be applied. Previously <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> showed a Fickian behaviour through the range of temperatures and diffusivities were much higher. Dependence of diffusivity on temperature followed an Arrhenius type equation for the two cases.

40|$|Freezing causes texture loss of tissue-based {{systems such}} as fruits and vegetables. To {{evaluate}} the potentials of high-pressure freezing for minimizing freezing damage, the effects of high-pressure shift freezing and regular freezing conditions on the texture of carrot cylinders were investigated.

The reduced freezing time of high-pressure shift freezing compared with conventional freezing results in a limited positive effect on the hardness of non-pretreated carrots.

40|$|Although {{freezing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important preservation methods for fruits and vegetables, the evolution of texture in frozen fruits and vegetables is very complex and difficult to understand. As freezing damage is the consequence of many separated processes, it is not always clear whether the damaging step occurs during pretreatment, freezing, storage or thawing. For each of these steps, but especially for the pretreatment and the conventional freezing step, a lot of research has been carried out in order to optimize the final quality of the frozen products. At the level of pretreatment, enzyme technology offers, among other treatments, some possibilities to improve the suitability of fruits and vegetables to be frozen. In this context, a controlled activity of pectinmethylesterase is sometimes desired because the enzyme catalyzed de-esterification of pectin creates the possibility of intermolecular interactions between Ca++ ions and low esterified pectin and can consequently reinforce cell-cell adhesion. At the level of optimization of the freezing and thawing step, high pressure-low temperature processes are relevant to mention. Of the latter emerging processes, the most promising processes in the food domain are high pressure shift freezing and high pressure thawing as a tool to increase the freezing and thawing rate and high pressure induced crystallization processes as a tool to reduce the microbial load of frozen foods. The experimental part of the work is hypothesis driven: throughout the work a number of hypotheses concerning the optimization of textural quality of frozen fruits and vegetables by the use of different high pressure-low temperature processes as well as pectin modifying treatments were evaluated. In the context of these pectin modifying treatments, two case studies were selected: carrots, a system where mainly endogenous pectinmethylesterase is responsible for pectin conversions and strawberries, a system suitable for enzyme infusion. Next to this, the use of a microscopy based approach including image analysis and detailed tissue particle parameter analysis to study freezing damage in fruits and vegetable was examined. In this way, evaluating the hypothesis that textural quality of frozen fruits and vegetables is closely related to their tissue integrity is included in the work. First it was investigated whether the freezing damage of frozen fruits and vegetables could be reduced (compared to slow, rapid, and cryogenic freezing at atmospheric pressure) by the use of high pressure shift freezing. This question was answered negatively: although the freezing time was remarkable reduced by high pressure shift freezing, the extensive hardness loss of slowly <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> and strawberries could not significantly be reduced by the application of high pressure shift freezing. This observation was correlated with serious microstructural damage that arose mainly during the completion of the freezing process (at atmospheric pressure). Rapid and cryogenic freezing on the other hand could reduce the structural damage of <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> and thus could be used to improve the textural quality of <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots.</b> This was however not the case for frozen strawberries. Secondly, it was studied to what extent textural and structural changes during different freezing processes were related to pectin conversions and thus whether pectin modifying pretreatments could enhance the suitability of fruits and vegetables to be frozen. Calcium soaking followed by a thermal (60 °C) or high pressure (300 MPa/ 60 °C) treatment and vacuum infusion with pectinmethylesterase and Ca++ reduced the degree of esterification of respectively carrot and strawberry pectin. These respective pretreatments were effective in minimizing the structural damage and thus in obtaining an improved textural quality of high pressure <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> and of rapidly, cryogenically and high pressure frozen strawberries. Adding pectinmethylesterase and Ca++ by the use of vacuum in osmodehydrated and osmodehydrofrozen strawberry fruits resulted in a minor positive effect in terms of hardness values, but the positive effects on drip loss and visual appearance after thawing were obvious. Next, the use of another high pressure-low temperature process, namely high pressure thawing, for texture preservation was studied. High pressure thawing noticeably reduced the thawing time of both carrots and strawberries, but remarkable textural quality improvements were not observed when compared to thawing at atmospheric pressure. This observation, together with the finding that textural and structural quality of both carrots and strawberries were not altered considerably during frozen storage, led to the statement that the combination of pretreatment and freezing conditions is the most important factor for texture preservation/optimization of frozen fruits and vegetables. The last high pressure-low temperature process, whose possibilities in the food domain were studied, is high pressure induced crystallization. Although post-freezing high pressure induced crystallization processes have recently been proven to reduce the microbial load of frozen products, the possibility of these processes to replace a pre-freezing blanching step for fruits and vegetables seemed rather limited. Post-freezing high pressure induced crystallization processes above 200 MPa (up to 500 MPa) in combination with temperatures of - 10 °C down to - 26 °C were able to sufficiently inactivate lipoxygenase in frozen model and real systems but were not able to sufficiently inactivate other quality related enzymes such as pectinmethylesterase, polygalacturonase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase. Moreover, volume changes during high pressure induced crystallization due to the transformation of ice I to ice III crystals negatively affected the textural and structural quality of pectinmethylesterase/Ca++-infused, frozen strawberries and pretreated, <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots.</b> Throughout the work, a high correlation between textural quality, measured as instrumental hardness, and structural integrity, analyzed by light microscopy followed by image analysis, was observed. Moreover, the detailed image analysis step allowed detecting changes in tissue particle size and shape and thus quantifying the tissue damage due to cell wall breakage. Therefore it could be concluded that the the microscopy based approach evolved in this work is, in addition to conventional analytical tools, useful to study freezing damage in frozen fruits and vegetables. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Blanching and {{freezing}} effects {{are focused on}} the microscopic structure, whether the softening of <b>frozen</b> vegetables (<b>carrots)</b> is related to changes in pectic substances or to firmness. Under light and electron microscopy, in the frozen raw samples, some cells were disrupted, producing cavities. The cytoplasm was destroyed and enclosed in a very thin layer inside the cell, and the organelles attached to the plasmalemma had almost disappeared. The formation of a transparent region close to the plasmalemma was observed, {{as a result of the}} extraction of some altered materials (hemicellulose, cellulose, pectin). The cell walls in the blanched samples appeared quite different from those in the frozen samples. They did not display tissue disruption as in the frozen samples, but the organelles in the cytoplasm were also altered. We also report substantial vesicle formation (swollen walls) in the cell wall, and a dark granular material inside. When the blanched samples were also frozen, compartmentalization of the material inside was observed. The pectin content was higher in the frozen and frozen blanched samples than in the raw and blanched samples. The semithin and ultrathin structure was in accordance with the objective values obtained by Kramer/Shear cell, where the greatest damage occurred to the samples in the freezing process.

Blanched and unblanched samples were packaged in retort pouches and frozen stored at $-$ 20 $ sp circ$C, and evaluated for peroxidase activity, texture and color before and after blanching, and after 3. 5 and/or 7 months frozen storage. Kinetics of peroxidase activity and texture softening due to blanching was described by semi-logarithmic models. All frozen products, except unblanched samples, were of good quality at the end of 7 months storage. Small quality differences were detected in the blanched frozen samples during storage; samples blanched for intermediate times were superior. Temperature distribution profiles were determined for model foods consisting of a starch gel with different concentrations of protein and fat, as well as commercial frozen and refrigerated prepared foods. Microwave heating of model foods showed considerable nonuniformity in temperature distribution and alarmingly low center temperatures. Prolonged lower power heating or holding after microwave heating did not always elevate center temperatures to safe levels. Addition of protein to the starch gel reduced temperature uniformity and heating rate, while added fat resulted in an opposite trend. For the commercial foods, center temperatures reached after heating according to manufacturer's instructions were below 70 $ sp circ$C indicating some safety concerns. However, longer heating time at lower power levels improved the temperature uniformity as well as the quality and appearance of these foods...|$|R

40|$|Carrots are {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} crop in Ireland. High yields can be obtained, particularly on peat soils, but little information is available, as yet, on crop quality. Three carrot cultivars were grown in peat and mineral soil in 1969 and 1970 and samples of each were harvested three times in 1969 and twice in 1970 at 2 -week intervals. Chemical analyses showed that cultivars grown in mineral soil had higher levels of carotene, alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) and dry matter (DM) in all harvests than those grown in peat; values for shear were also generally higher.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} treatments at - 25 degrees C between 150 and 300 MPa, indicated as high-pressure induced crystallization (HPIC) processes if formation of ice III occurs during pressurization, on the texture {{and structure of}} frozen strawberries and carrots were studied. The formation of ice III, which has been proven to inactivate the microbial load of a frozen food, occurred when pressure was increased to 250 MPa or higher. Volume changes related {{to the formation of}} ice III affected the cell wall integrity of infused frozen strawberries and caused a 42 - 46 % reduction of the fruit's hardness. These textural and structural changes were not affected by the pressure holding time (30 s versus 10 min), and thus by partial thawing during the pressure holding time, and were absent in frozen fruits treated at pressures lower than 250 MPa. The structure and texture of <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots</b> were respectively not and only slightly altered during high-pressure-low-temperature (HP-LT) treatments at all pressure levels studied. However, if carrots were blanched (30 min at 60 degrees C, 2 min at 90 degrees C and a combination of both) prior to freezing, structural damages during pretreatment and freezing made the tissue, in terms of both structural and textural quality, unsuitable for a post-freezing HP-LT treatment. These observations should be taken in mind when analyzing the possibilities of HPIC processes as a tool for post-freezing microbial reduction when applied to tissue based systems.

40|$|Dietary {{antioxidants}} (AO) {{are believed}} {{to contribute to the}} overall health benefits seen from fruit and vegetables. Despite increased public awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetables through campaigns such as 5 A DAY, consumption remains low. Freezing is usually regarded as destructive to AO and ascorbic acid (AA) and this has fostered a belief that fresh vegetables are nutritionally superior to frozen. In this study, AO and AA activity in commercially bought fresh and frozen vegetables were investigated and compared after a typical home cooking practice (boiling). Five different vegetables were examined: carrots, broccoli, green beans, peas and spinach. Each vegetable was bought four times from a selection of local supermarkets and green grocers in the Wirral, United Kingdom to account for variation. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay and 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) assay were utilised to measure total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and AA content respectively. The results showed both fresh and frozen vegetables to contain AO and AA after cooking. Cooked fresh spinach and peas contained significantly (p<. 05) higher levels of total AO than cooked frozen spinach and peas. However the remaining fresh and <b>frozen</b> vegetables (broccoli, <b>carrots</b> and green beans) did not appear to differ in AO content after cooking. Furthermore {{there was no difference between}} AA content in fresh and frozen cooked vegetables. The current study provides evidence against the misconception that fresh is always nutritionally superior to frozen at the point of consumption. Frozen vegetable promotion may be the way forward to increase fruit and vegetable consumption as they are generally nutritionally comparable to fresh but, cheaper, result in less waste, are more convenient and, if packaged correctly, taste the same as fresh.

40|$|Frozen {{vegetables}} represent high {{added value}} and convenience. Blanching is a thermal pre-treatment usually applied for stabilizing vegetable products to be stored in frozen conditions. However, this process may induce negative effects {{on the quality of}} frozen vegetables by impairing their mechanical, sensory and functional characteristics. The use of thermo- and cryo-protective solutes as trehalose during blanching could positively affect the quality of the final products by reducing the thermal damages induced by the pretreatment and subsequent freezing and frozen storage. The aim of this work was thus to evaluate the effect of trehalose and storage temperature on quality attributes and functional properties of blanched and <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots.</b> Sliced carrots (1 cm) were blanched for 10 min at two temperatures (75 and 90 °C), in water (control) and in 4 and 10 % w/w trehalose solutions. Samples were frozen at - 40 °C and stored at - 18 and - 40 °C up to 12 months of storage. The following determinations were carried: texture analysis (recovered energy), total carotenoids, total polyphenols content and radical scavenging activity of both the carotenoid and polyphenolic fractions. Blanching generally caused a significant decrease of the functional compounds under investigation with major effect on the polyphenolic fraction; despite this decrease, the antiradical activity of the phenolic compounds was not impaired by the blanching treatment and was not affected by the presence of threalose. On the contrary, the antiradical activity of carotenoids resulted to be impaired by the blanching treatment even though samples blanched in trehalose solutions resulted to exert higher antioxidant activity. Freezing and frozen storage dramatically affected the mechanical properties of sliced carrots. At both the storage temperatures, the use of trehalose exerted some positive effect on carrots texture. From the functional point of view, both the storage temperature and the use of trehalose affected the antiradical properties and the effect differed {{as a function of the}} different pre-treatment applied...|$|E
40|$|Environmental impact {{originating}} from food production {{is of great}} concern since it is related to every single customer in the world. Food is cultivated, transported, stored and processed in different ways, and every step in the life cycle {{has an impact on}} the environment whereas the nutritional value of food is altered in many of the steps. Waste of food is also an important aspect. A majority of the food waste in households and large-scale catering establishments is related to vegetables and it may be assumed that fresh vegetables have a higher waste than frozen at consumer stage. Further on, whether fresh or frozen vegetables provide consumers with most nutrients for every g of CO 2 -equivalent (eq) generated during production of the vegetables may be a concern. This study aimed to answer whether there is any difference in nutritional value of fresh and frozen coarse vegetables and if the production of these has different global warming potential. The vegetables investigated were carrots and turnips. Nutritional content was measured by nutrient index score, NRF 9. 3 (Nutrient Rich Food). Global warming potential was investigated by Life Cycle Assessment. Cultivation, storage, processing, packaging and transportation were investigated; from harvest to processing plant, wholesaler and restaurants and large-scale catering establishments, including storage losses and preparation waste. The results show that frozen root products has a lower nutritional content than fresh before cooking but after cooking the difference in nutritional content between fresh and frozen is decreased due to increased solubility and extractability of nutrients, and disrupted cell membranes. Fresh carrots provide consumers with the highest nutritional value for every g CO 2 -equivalent generated during production of these products, followed by (in descending order) <b>frozen</b> <b>carrots,</b> fresh turnips and frozen turnips, independent of cooked or uncooked state. Thus, from an environmental and nutritional perspective (bioavailability disregarded)) fresh carrots are the best choice of the products examined in current study.
