40|$|This paper {{describes}} a master-slave visual surveillance system that uses stationary-dynamic camera assemblies to achieve wide {{field of view}} and selective focus of interest. In this system, the fish-eye panoramic camera is capable of monitoring a large area, and the PTZ <b>dome</b> <b>camera</b> has high mobility and zoom ability. In order to achieve the precise interaction, preprocessing spatial calibration between these two cameras is required. This paper introduces a novel calibration approach to automatically calculate a transformation matrix model between two coordinate systems by matching feature points. In addition, a distortion correction method based on Midpoint Circle Algorithm is proposed to handle obvious horizontal distortion in the captured panoramic image. Experimental results using realistic scenes have demonstrated the efficiency and applicability of the system with real-time surveillance...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} how to assess the rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) of a multi-component repairable system and improve its reliability. A procedure was developed and tested on closed-circuit television <b>dome</b> <b>cameras</b> operated in an airport in the United Arab Emirates. Optimum replacement times for critical components were calculated, and then a practical preventive maintenance schema was suggested to reduce the overall cost. Finally, a control chart was developed to monitor the time between failures (TBFs) on the basis of the calculated ROCOF. The results of the case study show that optimising the maintenance renewal intervals generated a saving of approximately 77 % in maintenance costs, reduced the ROCOF by approximately 94 %, and increased the level of planned maintenance by approximately 97 %. Furthermore, monitoring the TBFs of repairable systems could detect changes that might lead to failures over time, thus improving the reliability and ensuring the effectiveness of preventive maintenance.

The LAM vertically launched flawlessly, transitioned to stable flight and performed several maneuvers during the short flight test. Test objectives were successfully achieved. The Lockheed Martin-designed LAM was flown without a Laser Radar (LADAR) seeker or warhead. A solid rocket motor vertically launched the , 100-pound missile from a closed breach canister mounted in a Lockheed Martin prototype launcher. Control surfaces and a pivoting wing deployed as planned as the missile began its programmed assent-phase roll and pitch maneuver. Protective covers on the forward <b>dome,</b> scoring <b>camera</b> and turbojet inlet were ejected properly and engine start sequence began as scheduled. Turbojet ignition sequence completed approximately five seconds after launch, and the engine came up to speed as the prototype approached apogee. For the next eight minutes, the LAM prototype executed preprogrammed maneuvers over the Eglin test range, demonstrating impressive stability and validating aerodynamic performance, navigation and autopilot performance design parameters.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{installation}} {{and operation of}} a telescope in Antarctica represent particular challenges, in particular the requirement to operate at extremely cold temperatures, to cope with rapid temperature fluctuations and to prevent frosting. Heating of electronic subsystems is a necessity, but solutions must be found to avoid the turbulence induced by temperature fluctua- tions on the optical paths. ASTEP 400 is a 40 cm Newton telescope installed at the Concordia station, Dome C since 2010 for photometric observations of fields of stars and their exoplanets. While the telescope is designed to spread star light on several pixels to maximize photometric stability, we show that it is nonetheless sensitive to the extreme variations of the seeing at the ground level (between about 0. 1 and 5 arcsec) and to temperature fluctuations between − 30 ◦C and − 80 ◦C. We analyze both day-time and night-time observations and obtain {{the magnitude of the}} seeing caused by the mirrors, <b>dome</b> and <b>camera.</b> The most important effect arises from the heating of the primary mirror which gives rise to a mirror seeing of 0. 23 arcsec K− 1.

40|$|In {{the near}} future ELTs (Extreme Large Telescopes) will be built. Preferably these telescopes should operate without {{obstructions}} in the near surrounding to reach optimal seeing conditions and avoid large turbulences with wind-gust accelerations around large obstacles. This applies also to future large solar telescopes. At present two foldable dome prototypes have been built on the Canary Islands: the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT, La Palma) and the GREGOR Telescope (Tenerife), having a diameter of 7 and 9 meter, respectively. The domes are usually fully retracted during observations. The research consists of measurements on the two <b>domes.</b> New <b>camera</b> systems are developed and placed inside the domes for precise dome deformation measurements within 0. 1 mm over the whole dome size. Simultaneously, a variety of wind-speed and-direction sensors measure the wind field around the dome. In addition, fast sensitive air-pressure sensors placed on the supporting bows measure the wind pressure. The aim is to predict accurately the expected forces and deformations on up-scaled, fully retractable domes to make their construction more economically. The dimensions of 7 and 9 meter are large enough for realistic on-site tests in gusty wind and will give much more information than wind tunnel experiments...|$|R

30|$|While the {{selected}} Axis 215 camera offers an outdoor dome enclosure, a dilemma was faced {{as there were}} no discreet outdoor enclosures for them; {{we had to find}} a way to make the cameras relatively weatherproof to withstand humidity and moisture. By choosing the Axis 215, we had to compensate for the lack of an available outdoor enclosure and improvise using the supplied flush-mount enclosures with smoked domes and surface-mount enclosures with clear domes, both designed for indoor installation. The solution was to use the surface-mount enclosures and make them weather-resistant by sealing the plastic seams with silicone sealant. In addition, the clear domes were interchanged with the smoked domes. The end result was a non-threatening <b>camera</b> <b>dome</b> suitable for surface-mounting at any of the 37 locations (see Figure 4 (c)). Long-term effects of humidity, heat, and moisture on the cameras despite the sealed domes remains to be seen.|$|R
40|$|Tactile sensory {{information}} {{is an important}} design criterion in designing algorithm for robotic manipulation or physical interaction with surrounding environment. Nowadays, several basic sensing principles are commonly used in tactile sensor such as piezoelectric sensor, capacitive sensor, inductive sensor and opto-electrical sensor. However, there are still lack of {{information that can be}} obtained from these tactile sensors especially for surface characterization. The aim of this research is to develop a new automated technique for an optical tactile sensor in measuring normal and shear force for surface characterization. A new mathematical modelling and computer algorithm is developed and calibrated which are based on image processing methods. The forces were calibrated by analysing the captured deformation image of the silicone tactile sensor inner <b>dome</b> using <b>camera,</b> fibre-scope and light source. The tactile sensor is designed similarly like a human finger and it was made from silicone rubber. Then, the tactile sensor is attached to the end effector of the CRS Catalyst 5 Robot arm for surface characterisation. Based on the information of the processed images, the result of the surface characterisation with respect to the force value is obtained. The result of this research work will improve the use of silicone based optical tactile sensor in robotic manipulation for surface characterization. The tactile sensor can characterize the surface condition with forces information of soft, hard, smooth and rough surface which is non-existent in the previous tactile sensor...|$|R
40|$|The {{bidirectional}} texture function (BTF) {{has proven}} a valuable {{model for the}} representation of complex spatially-varying material reflectance. Its image-based nature, however, makes material BTFs extremely cumbersome to acquire: in order to adequately sample high-frequency details, many thousands of images of a given material as seen and lit from different directions have to be obtained. Additionally, long exposure times are required {{to account for the}} wide dynamic range exhibited by the reflectance of many real-world materials. We propose to significantly reduce the required exposure times by using illumination patterns instead of single light sources (“multiplexed illumination”). A BTF can then be produced by solving an appropriate linear system, exploiting the linearity of the superposition of light. Where necessary, we deal with signal-dependent noise by using a simple linear model derived from an existing database of material BTFs as a prior. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method for a number of real-world materials in a <b>camera</b> <b>dome</b> scenario...|$|R

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the reactor vessel is of utmost importance in both the PRISM and SAFR concepts. The reactor vessel operates at elevated temperatures and contains molten liquid sodium. To ensure safe operation of the reactor, a periodic, visual inspection of {{the walls of the}} containment vessel is required by ASME specifications. This inspection would be conducted during a time when the reactor is shut down for refueling or maintenance. Nuclear Systems Associates, Inc. (NSA) was issued a PRDA contract by the Department of Energy to design, develop, and test a Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera system. The purpose of the system is to inspect the welds and wall surface of the Reactor Vessel/Container Vessel for both the PRISM and SAFR type reactors. The system was designed to function at the reactor&#x 27;s normal shutdown temperature, and provide a clear indication of flaws in the wall&#x 27;s weld seams and any cracks that might develop. The project was performed in three phases. The first phase concentrated the efforts on producing a compact camera system with the required resolution, self -contained lighting, and remote control focus and viewing angle. The proposed camera was then tested in a vessel mock-up and found to perform to required specifications at room (cold) temperatures. Simulated flaws, cracks, and a sodium leak were observed with required clarity on both a commercial and blackened stainless steel surfaces. The camera was tested with a single clear glass dome, a single coated glass dome, and a dual-glass <b>dome</b> covering the <b>camera</b> lens and mirror. The second phase of the project was conducted in two parts. The first part involved testing the vessel mock-up at elevated temperatures to verify that the required temperatures can be obtained. The mock-up was constructed with imbedded heaters and both control and indicating thermocouples. Stable operating temperatures over 400 °F were achieved. During the second part of this phase, the camera was inserted into the heated mock-up to verify proper operation at elevated temperatures. Several methods were employed to maintain a temperature within the camera assembly below the camera&#x 27;s maximum rating. In the final configuration, the in-annulus time of the camera substantially exceeded requirements. Picture resolution and clarity were not compromised. In the final phase, the camera was subjected to increasing temperatures within the mock-up until image degradation was observed. This occurred at a camera temperature significantly above the rated value. The camera was then returned to the manufacturer for a complete factory evaluation of any permanent damage. Their report indicated that no discernible damage had occurred. Suggestions are offered for further refinement of the techniques described in this report. One improvement is the use of digital image processing to readily detect cracks and flaws, and to objectively compare the current surface condition to that. of a previous inspection...|$|R
30|$|The optical {{picture of}} the {{substorm}} just presented conforms generally to the interpretation in Connors et al. (2014). However, there is clearly organized auroral activity prior to the nominal onset time, much as that study suggested there was magnetic activity. Starting about 4 : 16 UT (just left of, or before, the white bar which is missing data), a band of aurora brightened and moved poleward in a very systematic manner, remaining very narrow. It moved from one keogram to the other but appeared to stall in its motion as the nominal onset time approached. Since structuring of auroras can aid in establishing onset times (as for example in Liang et al. (2008)), and this structuring is not obvious in keograms, we now inspect all-sky image sequences near the potential times of interest. Figure 5 shows RANK and GILL for the minute 04 : 12 UT, and those stations and the more easterly one KUUJ in the several minutes following 04 : 26 UT (we return to the RANK 04 : 38 UT set below). The earlier pair shows an arc which had actually formed in the 04 : 11 UT minute near GILL but was not bright enough to present. This arc {{is seen in the}} top part of the GILL images, as it brightens and structures. The RANK images are essentially devoid of aurora although some remant of faded growth phase arcs is seen below the Moon (brightest spot in lower left). There is no indication that an auroral streamer from the north initiated the activity near GILL, as Nishimura et al. (2010) found to sometimes be the case. Although there are lunar reflections (in the optical system including the <b>dome</b> housing the <b>camera)</b> present in the images, the arc visible from GILL formed clearly in the 04 : 11 UT minute equatorward of the growth phase arcs, much in the fashion described by Akasofu (1964). As discussed, after a small amount of initial equatorward motion, it brightened and rapidly moved northward. However, the auroras did not become extremely active, nor did magnetic field perturbations as reflected by indices or any individual station records, until near the nominal onset time of Connors et al. (2014). As discussed in the “Introduction” section, there seems to be considerable overlap in the literature in the descriptions of pseudobreakups and full expansive phase onsets (especially in cases of “double onset”). We tend to regard this weak event as a pseudobreakup. The initiation of full onset seems to be indicated by the formation of a new arc between two pre-existing ones shown in the KUUJ 04 : 26 panel of Fig. 5. This arc structured and moved toward the east (right) rapidly within the 04 : 26 UT minute as seen from KUUJ. In the next minute, the arc which had developed out of the pseudobreakup brightened in the northern sky of GILL and also as seen on the southern horizon from RANK. The KUUJ and RANK/GILL images do not overlap, so we cannot determine the exact relation of the arc at KUUJ to the pre-existing one further west. As the keograms of Fig. 4 indicate, a very full expansion of aurora was observed after this time, and a strengthening of electric currents leading to perturbations large enough that (as also indicated by AMPERE current density integrations) Connors et al. (2014) identified 04 : 30 UT as the nominal onset time. We now proceed to examine ground magnetic fields for the event, both with a meridian inversion technique and as individual magnetograms.|$|R
