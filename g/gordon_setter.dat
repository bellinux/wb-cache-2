Under the Turnpike Act of 1795 the minimum distance between toll bars was six miles. The Toll of Birness (the junction of the A952 Fraserburgh road and A92 Peterhead road) to the south of Ardallie is six miles from Clola.

50|$|Setters and {{pointers}} hunt {{over long}} distances to find game birds like {{members of the}} pheasant and quail family, using their noses to find the prey and then sneaking up on them in the brush, showing the hunter exactly where the bird is hiding. Most of this family comes from Europe, and would include the Shorthaired, Wirehaired, Shorthaired German Pointers and Weimaraner from Germany, The Viszla from Hungary, Bracco Italiano from Italy, and field bred Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, English Pointers, English <b>Setters,</b> and <b>Gordon</b> <b>Setters</b> from the British Isles. Many in this group share traits with spaniels {{in terms of the}} coat they have: it is easier to pick out bits of nettle from a long coat than a short one and the coat itself offers some protection from damp and thorny conditions.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gordon</b> <b>Setters,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "black and tans", have a coal-black coat with {{distinctive}} markings of a rich chestnut or mahogany colour on their paws and lower legs, vents, throat, and muzzles; one spot above each eye; and two spots on their chest. A small amount of white is allowed on the chest. Although uncommon, red Gordons are occasionally born to normal-coloured parents, the result of expression of a recessive red gene. Predominantly tan, red, or buff dogs are ineligible for showing. A Gordon's coat is straight or slightly waved (but not curly), long and silky, with chest, stomach, ear, leg, and tail feathering. According to the AKC breed standard, [...] "the bearing is intelligent, noble, and dignified". They are the heaviest of the setter breeds, with males reaching 27 in at the withers and up to 80 lb in weight.|$|R
50|$|The term soft {{mouth is}} used by breeders and users of hunting dogs {{to refer to a}} {{behavioral}} tendency to pick up, hold, and carry quarry gently. It is not a preferred characteristic of terriers and ratters, who are expected to roughly shake and mangle pests such as rats and snakes in order to kill them quickly and efficiently. It is desirable in gundogs such as retrievers and spaniels which are expected to produce quarry intact and in good condition, and is a notoriously difficult behavior to teach to a dog without an inborn temperament to do so. As a result, breeders and users of gun dogs arrived on this term to describe a characteristic important to this enterprise. Dogs breeds known for producing more soft-mouthed individuals include Golden Retrievers, Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, and <b>Gordon</b> <b>Setters,</b> but in any litter some individuals may be much less soft-mouthed than others, as there may be relatively soft-mouthed individuals in a litter of even classically hard-mouthed breeds such as Jack Russell Terriers or Mastiffs.|$|R
40|$|Canine hip {{dysplasia}} (CHD) results from incorrect coxofemoral joint development in dogs. Although CHD {{has been described}} in many breeds of dog, it is generally regarded as being associated with larger breeds. The breed-susceptibility of the condition prompted the suggestion {{that there may be}} genetic component associated with CHD, which has led to a number of investigations being undertaken to calculate heritability values for CHD in a range of breeds of dogs (eg, Wood and others 2000, Wood and others 2002, Lewis and others 2010). The values obtained reiterate the belief that CHD results from a combination of polygenic interactions, where each gene possibly makes variable contributions to the final phenotype (Wilson and others 2011). Various papers have resulted in different heritability scores for different breeds, for example, labrador retrievers (Wood and others 2002) and <b>Gordon</b> <b>setters</b> (Wood and others 2000); maternal versus paternal effects (Wood and others 2000); and some reporting symmetry of hip scores (Wilson and others 2011) and others a difference between left and right hips (eg, Tsai and others 2007). Hence, it is possible that there may be slight differences in the major causal genes/alleles in different breeds, and in order that a better understanding may be obtained for CHD generically, an argument could be made for individually studying as many breeds as possible. The current work makes a contribution to the understanding of this disorder by investigating {{hip dysplasia}} in the Irish water spaniel. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|It will {{be obvious}} {{to the reader}} that these changes {{significantly}} affected the status of Setters and Pointers, not least that of the Gordon. Though often used as a general purpose gundog, the <b>Gordon</b> <b>Setter</b> is essentially a wide-ranging dog employed in the UK to locate red grouse and ptarmigan on the Scottish or North of England moors and partridges on the stubble-fields of the south of England. Up to the late 1930s most Gordons were kept {{for this type of}} work, so that the majority were to be found in Scotland and the north of England; but now they are more evenly distributed and there are no large working kennels.|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>Gordon</b> <b>Setter</b> is a {{predominantly}} black dog with rich tan marking on the muzzle, legs and chest. A little bigger and heavier {{than either the}} Irish or English, he is nevertheless descended from the same genetic mixing pot, which undoubtedly has its origins among those setting spaniels we met earlier. The Kennel Club applied the name 'Gordon Setter' to the breed in 1924. Before that they were known as black and tan setters, and were found in many kennels beside those of the Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon (1743-1827). Indeed, as we shall see, {{there is plenty of}} evidence {{that the majority of the}} setters at Gordon Castle during the Duke's time were tri-coloured rather than pure black and tan.|$|E
5000|$|The AKC {{describes}} the <b>Gordon</b> <b>Setter</b> temperament as [...] "alert, interested, and confident. He is fearless and willing, intelligent, and capable. He is loyal and affectionate, and strong-minded {{enough to stand}} the rigors of training". Gordons are intensely loyal to their owners; thrive in an attentive, loving environment; and are good family dogs. Puppies and adult dogs can be quite boisterous, and although they are patient by nature, may not be suitable for households with very young children. Gordons are sensitive and empathic, eager to learn, and need firm but gentle handling. Early socialisation and obedience training is important. The breed {{is one of the}} slowest to mature, not hitting prime until three years of age or more, and will show puppy-like characteristics well into their older years.|$|E
50|$|The Scotch Collie is a {{landrace}} {{breed of}} dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland. The breed consisted {{of both the}} long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie. It is generally believed to have descended {{from a variety of}} ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors include the <b>Gordon</b> and Irish <b>Setters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Irish Red and White Setter (An Sotar Rua agus Bán) is a {{breed of}} dog, more {{specifically}} a setter. As {{with all the}} setters and the Pointer, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and {{is included in the}} sporting group in America and Canada. It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter and its other <b>setter</b> cousins, the <b>Gordon</b> and English <b>setters,</b> but is more often found as a working gun dog.|$|R
5000|$|The {{list was}} {{originally}} compiled in January 2006, and included 28 breeds. Later in 2006, the Miniature Bull Terrier was added. In 2007, after {{consultation with the}} breed clubs involved, the Bloodhound, <b>Gordon</b> <b>Setter</b> and King Charles Spaniel were re-classed as [...] "Viable" [...] rather than vulnerable. The English Setter is the newest addition to the list, having been added {{for the first time}} in 2012. However, during 2012 the number of English Setter puppies registered increased to 314, so the breed was moved to the Kennel Club's 'At Watch' list, which is for breeds with registrations from 300-450. Breeds on the 'At Watch' list included in 2013 the English Setter, the Old English Sheepdog, the Irish Terrier, the Irish Wolfhound, the Welsh Springer Spaniel, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and the Welsh Terrier.|$|E
