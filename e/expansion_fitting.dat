The same cross-cultural process extends to the example of Malta, where the survival of an Arabic dialect arguably assisted the retention of the raḥl as a living model for placenaming.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a new method for {{forecasting}} arrival times and speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at any location in the inner heliosphere. This new approach enables {{the adoption of a}} highly flexible geometrical shape for the CME front with an adjustable CME angular width and an adjustable radius of curvature of its leading edge, i. e., the assumed geometry is elliptical. Using, as input, Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) heliospheric imager (HI) observations, a new elliptic conversion (ElCon) method is introduced and combined with the use of drag-based model (DBM) fitting to quantify the deceleration or acceleration experienced by CMEs during propagation. The result is then used as input for the Ellipse Evolution Model (ElEvo). Together, ElCon, DBM fitting, and ElEvo form the novel ElEvoHI forecasting utility. To demonstrate the applicability of ElEvoHI, we forecast the arrival times and speeds of 21 CMEs remotely observed from STEREO/HI and compare them to in situ arrival times and speeds at 1 AU. Compared to the commonly used STEREO/HI fitting techniques (Fixed-phi, Harmonic Mean, and Self-similar <b>Expansion</b> <b>fitting),</b> ElEvoHI improves the arrival time forecast by about 2 to +/- 6. 5 hr and the arrival speed forecast by approximate to 250 to +/- 53 km s(- 1), depending on the ellipse aspect ratio assumed.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{wide-angle}} imaging of the inner heliosphere, a plethora of techniques {{have been developed to}} investigate the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of solar wind transients, such as coronal mass ejections, from their signatures in single- and multi-spacecraft imaging observations. These techniques, which range from the highly complex and computationally intensive to methods based on simple curve ﬁtting, all have their inherent advantages and limitations. In the analysis of single-spacecraft imaging observations, much use has been made of the ﬁxed φ ﬁtting (FPF) and harmonic mean ﬁtting (HMF) techniques, in which the solar wind transient {{is considered to be a}} radially propagating point source (ﬁxed φ, FP, model) and a radially expanding circle anchored at Sun centre (harmonic mean, HM, model), respectively. Initially, we compare the radial speeds and propagation directions derived from application of the FPF and HMF techniques to a large set of STEREO/Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations. As the geometries on which these two techniques are founded constitute extreme descriptions of solar wind transients in terms of their extent along the line of sight, we describe a single-spacecraft ﬁtting technique based on a more generalized model for which the FP and HM geometries form the limiting cases. In addition to providing estimates of a transient’s speed and propagation direction, the self-similar <b>expansion</b> <b>ﬁtting</b> (SSEF) technique provides, in theory, the capability to estimate the transient’s angular extent in the plane orthogonal to the ﬁeld of view.

40|$|The NASA STEREO mission {{opened up}} the {{possibility}} to forecast the arrival times, speeds and directions of solar transients from outside the Sun-Earth line. In particular, {{we are interested in}} predicting potentially geo-effective Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) from observations of density structures at large observation angles from the Sun (with the STEREO Heliospheric Imager instrument). We contribute to this endeavor by deriving analytical formulas concerning a geometric correction for the ICME speed and arrival time for the technique introduced by Davies et al. (2012, ApJ, in press) called Self-Similar <b>Expansion</b> <b>Fitting</b> (SSEF). This model assumes that a circle propagates outward, along a plane specified by a position angle (e. g. the ecliptic), with constant angular half width (lambda). This is an extension to earlier, more simple models: Fixed-Phi-Fitting (lambda = 0 degree) and Harmonic Mean Fitting (lambda = 90 degree). This approach has the advantage {{that it is possible to}} assess clearly, in contrast to previous models, if a particular location in the heliosphere, such as a planet or spacecraft, might be expected to be hit by the ICME front. Our correction formulas are especially significant for glancing hits, where small differences in the direction greatly influence the expected speeds (up to 100 - 200 km/s) and arrival times (up to two days later than the apex). For very wide ICMEs (2 lambda > 120 degree), the geometric correction becomes very similar to the one derived by Möstl et al. (2011, ApJ, 741, id. 34) for the Harmonic Mean model. These analytic expressions can also be used for empirical or analytical models to predict the 1 AU arrival time of an ICME by correcting for effects of hits by the flank rather than the apex, if the width and direction of the ICME in a plane are known and a circular geometry of the ICME front is assumed.

Four two-stage pipe expansions using standardly available materials were constructed and tested at common irrigation flow rates. These expansions require less space and cost less than optimum two-stage expansions. Pressure change across the pipe expansions were measured.

Beginning with the 75 - 150 mm size and increasingly with the next two larger sizes, optimum two-stage fittings became economically competitive. Optimum two-stage expansions operated most efficiently, but because of their high cost were only practical for high electricity costs and long irrigation seasons. The three largest two-stage expansions tested are improvements over abrupt or single-stage expansions when constructing a pump discharge.

We determine line strengths and escape velocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation of the correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies.

For Mgb we find that this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but also inside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. The relation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the global relation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsic scatter in the local gradients. We transform our line strength index measurements to the single stellar population (SSP) equivalent age (t), metallicity ([Z/H]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]) and carry out a principal component analysis of our SSP and Vesc data. We find that in this four-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a good approximation confined to a plane, given by $\log \mathrm({V}_{\mathrm{esc}}/ 500 \mathrm{km/s}) = 0. 85 \mathrm{[Z/H]} + 0. 43 \log (\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{Gyrs}) $ - 0. 20.

40|$|Antenna array {{design has}} {{recently}} focused on non-periodic structures. The possibility of having arbitrary antenna positions provides additional {{degrees of freedom}} that allow one to achieve radiation characteristics {{that would not be}} possible with periodic arrays made of the same number of elements. The sparse nature of non-periodic arrays avoids the overlap of effective areas at lower frequencies (and, hence, coupling efficiency issues) and the non-periodicity discards the presence of eigenmodes. This type of array can be used for imaging, radioastronomy, telemetry and defense applications. This calls for the development of efficient numerical methods for the analysis of non-periodic antenna arrays. In this dissertation, an efficient Method of Moments solution of non-periodic arrays has been addressed using a class of non-iterative methods that reduce the effective number of unknowns. The reduction of unknowns is achieved assuming that the currents on one of the antennas in the array can be decomposed in terms of a limited number of current distributions or Macro Basis Functions (MBFs). Then, one may perform an LU decomposition of the reduced system of equations and solve for multiple right-hand sides. This is useful as it provides a complete description of the array, i. e., the array impedance matrix and all the embedded element patterns. For most practical cases, the reduction of the MoM system of equations using MBFs becomes the dominant contribution to computation time. Two novel methods have been developed to overcome this limitation. The first one exploits multipole expansions to compute the reaction integral between MBFs. The reaction integral between two MBFs is efficiently obtained integrating over the unit sphere the scalar product between the (pre-computed) far-field patterns of these MBFs multiplied by a translation operator. In the second method, the reaction integrals between MBFs are fitted, after three physically-based transformations, to a low-order harmonic-polynomial form, using a small number of sampling points. Then, while filling the reduced MoM impedance matrix, the computational complexity devoted to obtain the interaction between two MBFs is completely independent from the number of elementary basis functions per antenna. This process is independent of the array geometry, which enables the optimization of the antennas' positions at a very low computational cost, while taking into account mutual coupling. The aforementioned methods can also be applied to the case of antenna arrays in a planar layered medium. This is possible after expressing the spatial-domain Green's function in closed-form as a finite sum of cylindrical waves and one spherical wave. In the multipole-based method, the computation of the reaction integrals is dominated by the operations associated with the spherical wave term. Thus, the presence of a planar layered medium can be accounted for without significantly increasing the computational complexity one would have {{in the case of a}} homogeneous medium. Regarding the second method, the number of harmonic-polynomial expressions that need to be evaluated is higher than in the homogeneous medium case. However, this method remains competitive and is more efficient than the one based on multipole <b>expansions,</b> after the <b>fitting</b> process. Finally, the efficient calculation of the array factors and the radiation patterns of non-periodic antenna arrays has been also addressed. First, the Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NFFT) is used to evaluate array factors. Second, it is shown how the NFFT can be combined with the Macro Basis Function method to express the embedded element patterns as a series of pattern multiplication problems, each term being related to a macro basis function. The proposed formulation leads to the efficient calculation of the array factors and the array patterns of non-periodic antenna arrays. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
