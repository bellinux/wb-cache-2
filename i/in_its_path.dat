5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation.

5|$|Tracking {{generally}} west-southwestward, {{the storm}} entered {{a stage of}} rapid deepening on August10, despite forecasts of an only marginally favorable environment. On August11, Flossie became a major hurricane, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h). With cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path,</b> the hurricane weakened steadily, deteriorating to a tropical depression by August16. The storm's center became devoid of strong thunderstorms later that day, indicating Flossie no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane David was an {{extremely}} deadly hurricane which caused massive devastation and loss {{of life in the}} Dominican Republic in August 1979. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that reached Category5 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, David was the fourth named tropical cyclone, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, traversing through the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and East Coast of the United States during late August and early September. David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966. With winds of 175mph (280km/h), David was the only storm of Category5 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century and the deadliest since the 1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane, San Zenon, killing over 2,000people <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path.</b> The hurricane was the deadliest Dominican tropical cyclone since a hurricane killed over 200 in September of the 1834 season.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path.</b> Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E

5|$|On October4, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa with a large associated circulation. Unfavorable wind shear prevented any development, and the wave continued westward, entering the Caribbean Sea on October11. Two days later, the wave axis encountered a pre-existing low pressure area in the southwest Caribbean. It quickly developed a well-defined circulation, becoming {{a tropical}} depression on October14 off the east coast of Nicaragua. Due to an upper-level low in the Gulf of Mexico, the system tracked to the northwest, brushing Central America <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path.</b> The depression developed banding features as the pressure gradually dropped, and intensified into Tropical Storm Lili at around 0600UTC on October16. During this time, the storm executed a small cyclonic loop while a few hundred miles north of the Swan Islands. By early on October17, Lili had attained hurricane status while it was turning to the north.|$|E
5|$|Operation Storm {{started at}} 5a.m. on 4 August 1995 when coordinated attacks were {{executed}} by reconnaissance and sabotage detachments {{in concert with}} Croatian Air Force (CAF) air strikes aimed at disrupting ARSK command, control, and communications. UN peacekeepers, known as United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO), were notified three hours {{in advance of the}} attack when Tuđman's chief of staff, Hrvoje Šarinić, telephoned UNCRO commander, French Army General Bernard Janvier. In addition, each HV corps notified the UNCRO sector <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path</b> of the attack, requesting written confirmations of receipt of the information. The UNCRO relayed the information to the RSK, confirming the warnings RSK received from the Yugoslav Army General Staff the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this amount of precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path,</b> including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in Manatee County.|$|E

5|$|Upon developing, the depression, {{small in}} {{physical}} size, moved slowly west-northwestward. Initially, the NHC faced difficulties in forecasting {{the future of}} the system due to the potential for resumed strong wind shear, as well as uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path</b> of direction. It gradually organized and intensified, and based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters, the NHC assessed the depression as a tropical storm late on September11; upon doing so, they gave it the name Gordon. As it strengthened, Gordon developed more substantial outflow and increasing banding features. On September12, the storm slowed and turned toward the north through a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by Florence. Wind shear decreased further, and the storm's convection became more symmetric with an intermittent eye feature in the center. Based on the presence of the eye and estimates from satellite imagery, it is estimated that Gordon intensified into a hurricane early on September13.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path.</b> A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{began as}} a {{tropical}} depression over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 while traversing the Bahamas, it regained its Category 5 status before making landfall in Florida on Elliott Key and Homestead on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (27.23 inHg) {{at the time of}} landfall in Florida, Andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at Category 4 strength, with the Gulf Coast of the United States <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>path.</b> After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City, Louisiana, as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains on August 28.|$|E
