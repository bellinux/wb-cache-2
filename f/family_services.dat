25|$|DSPD often {{coordinates}} and collaborates {{with other}} state agencies {{to provide care}} for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest inter-agency partnership exists between the Division and the Division of Child and <b>Family</b> <b>Services.</b> These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations.

Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where these children have no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship of Child and <b>Family</b> <b>Services.</b> Division and Child and <b>Family</b> <b>Services</b> staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and {{that the child is}} safe and healthy.|$|E
