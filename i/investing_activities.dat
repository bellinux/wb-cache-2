40|$|This paper investigates how {{investments}} in {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) activities affect firm value. We categorise firms’ CSR activities as strategic or opportunistic based on consistency, and analyse the differential value relevance effect. We use the Egyptian Economic Justice Index (EEJI) as the most representative measure for firms’ CSR activities in Egypt. To measure valuation effect, we adopt an earnings response coefficient (ERC) model. Our main explanatory variables are interaction variables with unexpected earnings and two dummy variables; one indicating CSR activities, and one indicating their consistency. We document these variables as positively and negatively significant. Our findings show that <b>investing</b> in CSR <b>activities</b> consistently and strategically may increase firm’s profitability and firm value. However, firms that sporadically <b>invest</b> in CSR <b>activities</b> show a smaller relationship between unexpected earnings and stock returns than firms that consistently <b>invest</b> in CSR <b>activities...</b>|$|R
