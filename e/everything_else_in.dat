5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
25|$|The Huron {{way of life}} is very gender-specific in practice. Men in most {{societies}} are the clear hunters of the tribe; they search for game to feed their people. Women were <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the tribe, they made all clothes, they cooked the game brought back by the men, and {{they were the ones who}} watched over the children.|$|E
25|$|Irving Cliff, 300feet high, {{named for}} Washington Irving who loved its prominence, overlooks {{the town and}} offers a {{compelling}} view of {{the confluence of the}} Lackawaxen River and Dyberry Creek and virtually <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the valley. The cliff is surmounted by Gibbons Memorial Park with a 50foot electric framework for a Christmas Star and Easter Cross that are visible for miles during holiday nights.

25|$|Qutb's mature {{political}} views always centered on Islam – Islam {{as a complete}} system of morality, justice and governance, whose sharia laws and principles should be the sole basis of governance and <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> life – though his interpretation of it varied. Qutb's political philosophy {{has been described as}} an attempt to instantiate a complex and multilayer eschatological vision, partly grounded in the counter-hegemonic re-articulation of the traditional ideal of Islamic universalism.|$|E
25|$|Loss and the {{different}} ways people deal with it are a major theme of Ordinary People. Conrad loses not only his brother but {{a good portion of}} his then-self when Buck dies. His father finds himself re-examining his life and seeing it more the result of random chance and accident than any ability on his part. Beth tries to control it like <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> her life. She and Conrad were, Calvin notes, the only people not to cry at Buck's funeral.|$|E
25|$|Among postmodernist photographers, the Australian Bill Henson {{photographs}} controversial nudes in low-key, Elad David works {{mainly with}} male nudes {{and in some}} of them only the busts – no head – of young men, is highlighted, leaving <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> pitch black. Another artist who created a series of low-key photos exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world, is the Finnish photographer Juha Arvid Helminen. He names his series The Invisible Empire, and refers to the shield that black colour offers, like a mask between who we truly are and the way society perceives us.|$|E

Khamenei regularly meets with president, cabinet members, head and officials of the judiciary branch, parliamentarians, among others, and tells them what to do. Khamenei has also fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. Khamenei meets with foreign dignitaries, however he does not travel overseas; if anyone wishes to see him, that person must travel to Iran. Apart from his time in Najaf as a student, Khamenei travelled to Libya during his time as President.|$|E
25|$|Avatars {{may take}} any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a {{combination}} thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves {{as they are in}} real life. They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. Second Life Culture consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as alts).|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} reading, Moses {{instructed}} {{that when the}} Israelites approached to attack a town, they were to offer it terms of peace, and if the town surrendered, then {{all the people of}} the town were to serve the Israelites as slaves. But if the town did not surrender, then the Israelites were to lay siege to the town, and when God granted victory, kill all its men and take as booty the women, children, livestock, and <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the town. Those were the rules for towns that lay very far from Israel, but for the towns of the nations in the land — the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites — the Israelites were to kill everyone, lest they lead the Israelites into doing all the abhorrent things that those nations had done for their gods.

25|$|The Leader of the Revolution ("Supreme Leader") is {{responsible}} for delineation and supervision of {{the policies of the}} Islamic Republic of Iran. The current longtime Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on the economy, environment, foreign policy, education, national plannings, and <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the country. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections, and has fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments. The Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei directly chooses the ministries of Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs, as well as certain other ministries, such as the Science Ministry. Iran’s regional policy is directly controlled by the office of the Supreme Leader with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ task limited to protocol and ceremonial occasions. All of Iran’s ambassadors to Arab countries, for example, are chosen by the Quds Corps, which directly reports to the Supreme Leader.|$|E
500|$|In May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral.

500|$|Where the {{southern}} city gates were, is today the Slussen area. [...] The sluice and the locks of Karl Johanslussen had to be rebuilt regularly, {{and the appearance of}} the city's southern approach changed constantly.

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} critically. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper noted that fans and critics {{had begun to}} lose interest in the series by this point, but felt that [...] "even at its most strained and obtuse, [...] displays more imagination and effort than almost <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> TV land". He added that viewers may have been {{put off by the}} series' frame of time, explaining that only two weeks of narrative time had elapsed since [...] "Pilot", a slow pace contrasted with the [...] "fast-forward, instant payoff philosophy of most television". AllRovi's Andrea LeVasseur described the installment as [...] "pivotal", noting that it [...] "answers some of the series' long-running questions".|$|E

Iovine called Stefani, telling her, [...] "You can cancel <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> your life, but don't cancel this session."

Despite a Christmas period blip including a 5–1 loss to Aston Villa, Liverpool won their tenth League title. The 1977 European Cup Final was Liverpool's first. McDermott, Smith and Neal goals gave a 3-1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach. They lost the 1977 FA Cup Final 2-1 to Manchester United to miss out on a trophy treble.|$|E

He argued that [...] "determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will." [...] Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics, and political science to create a [...] "science of liberty." [...] Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: For a New Liberty, published in 1973, and The Ethics of Liberty, published in 1982.
