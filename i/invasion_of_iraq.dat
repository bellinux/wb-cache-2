5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein's alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E

5|$|Canada sent {{troops to}} Afghanistan in 2001, but {{declined}} to join the U.S.-led <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003.

5|$|Many {{protests and}} marches {{have been held}} in {{response}} to the 2003 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> There were several anti-war rallies in 2001 through 2003, including 20,000 at a January 18, 2003 rally, and 20,000–45,000 for the March 15, 2003 rally. Groups broke off from the protest to block roads and the Morrison Bridge; these splinter groups were broken up by the police. John Lewis spoke at the rally.|$|E

Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Australia committed a special forces task group and an air-to-air refuelling aircraft to operations in Afghanistan, and naval warships to the Persian Gulf as Operation Slipper. In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, took part in the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E

5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on the one side}} and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, one about the military contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Malik desisted {{from further}} {{attempts}} to seize Iraq following the debacle at Khazir, and instead focused on winning over disaffected tribal chieftains throughout the province.

By then, many of Iraq's ashraf had accepted Umayyad sovereignty, and following the Umayyad victory in the Battle of Maskin, in which both Mus'ab and Ibn al-Ashtar were slain, Umayyad rule in Iraq was reestablished.|$|E

Perceived as a leftist-nationalist {{at the onset of}} his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
5|$|Canada and the United States {{share the}} world's longest undefended border, co-operate on {{military}} campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner. Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba since, and declining to officially {{participate in the}} 2003 <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E
