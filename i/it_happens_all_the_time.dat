In 1997 the Boston Herald reported that Coulier [...] "admitted the lines are very close to home. Especially the one about 'an older version of me' and bugging him Coulier 'in the middle of dinner.'" [...] Coulier's former television co-star Bob Saget said in one interview that he was present when Morissette made that call during dinner, although it was not clear whether Saget was joking.|$|E

5000|$|Hard Candy was {{released}} on April 25, 2008, in the European countries of Germany, Ireland, Austria and Netherlands. On April 28, the album {{was released}} in the United Kingdom, Brazil and {{throughout the rest of}} Europe, and on April 29, in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Billboard reported that the title of the album was Licorice, as announced on the Sirius Satellite Radio programme OutQ. In an interview with MTV Australia, Madonna explained that a prominent theme of the Hard Candy album was about incorporating the image of a boxer, an idea which has been repeated within the song [...] "Give It 2 Me". According to her, [...] "It 2 Me' is basically in meaning. I'm not ..., 'give me all you got' of person, so it's quite a sort of tough stance." [...] Hence, initially Madonna decided that the title of the song was to be used for the then-unnamed album. This was changed following the release of a similarly named song by Timbaland. After that, Madonna decided to call the album Black Madonna, and even shot a photograph for the cover art, wearing blackface make-up with white eyes. In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone Madonna commented:"I did a photoshoot with Steven Klein for my last album cover, and I painted my face black, except for red lips and white eyes.

Indeed, from reading his review it appears that he did little more than crack the title page and table of contents—if that. As a result, his review misrepresents the thesis and topic of the book and even misstates its title. The title of my book is not Signature of the Cell as Ayala repeatedly refers to it, but Signature in the Cell.

40|$|With the {{advanced}} technology in this information requisite world, {{the way of}} communication has been changed into using multiple media. People use different media to publish their ideas, not just on paper. The same information may be presented in different formats because of different purposes or situations. However, {{each of the four}} major media (print, Web, CD-ROM, and video) has different capabilities for displaying image information. Images optimized for one will not necessarily work well with the others. <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that people spend much time remanipulating an image which has already been made for another media. For example, it is necessary to reduce the color depth and resolution of an image once it is moving from paper output to the World Wide Web because of the monitor limitation and the need for faster transfer rate. The problem exists when switching images among different output media such as video, multimedia CD-ROM, the World Wide Web and print. Quality and performance are the criteria for good publishing. This thesis project would establish guidelines for the designer, which would show the way to manipulate images once and have them work well in all media, including how to optimize images for print, the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, and video. The parameters which would be explored are: resolution, gamma correction, and color depth. After tests have been run on, an image format with 266 pixel per inch, 24 -bit color depth, and no gamma correction could be established to satisfy the needs for image quality of print, Web, CD-ROM, and video publishing with extra gamma correction of 70 percent at midtone of 50 percent for video production...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{sentences}} (in the language of Set Theory) preserved by the construction usually used to prove {{the independence of the}} axiom of foundation can be characterised syntactically: they are precisely the formulae naturally expressible in the language of simple type theory. The permutation construction that concerns us here is familiar to students of ZF as the technique used in the standard proof of the independence of the axiom of foundation. The technique is originally due to Rieger [1957] and Bernays [1954]. If we have a model 〈V,∈ 〉 of ZF and let σ be the transposition exchanging the empty set and its singleton. Then we define x ∈σ y by x ∈ σ(y). It turns out that in the model V σ consisting of the old universe and the new membership relation ∈σ the “old ” empty set has become an object identical to its own singleton, and foundation has failed.

5|$|The {{policy of}} attacking London after the {{successful}} 7 September raid quickly became counter-productive, {{and in this}} matter the Luftwaffe suffered from serious misjudgement resulting from their intelligence service. The crews had been told the RAF was down to its last reserves and that one more assault would clinch victory. This was incorrect which meant bomber crews would {{be in for a}} shock on 15 September. The RAF had been given much needed rest after intense operations by the shift in German strategy. British radar, having been virtually untouched, was still able to follow the slow German build ups over France long before the first German aircraft reached British airspace. It would give the rested Fighter Command units plenty of warning. Moreover, by choosing to attack London, it exposed the bombers to greater danger by forcing them to fly greater distances in hostile air space. German crews would be forced to fight <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to London and back. As <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> German bomber units were at least intercepted on 15 September, and were then scattered as they withdrew.|$|R
