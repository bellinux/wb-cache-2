5000|$|The {{other common}} {{element in the}} stunts was {{to get one of}} the contestants messy in some way often {{involving}} whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn't even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond [...] "get whipped cream in their face". Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a bathing cap on his head [...] "to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> out of <b>your</b> eyes" [...] before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.|$|R

It’s Grim Up North spoofs the kitchen sink realism films of the early 1960s, with working class Northern English settings, such as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. (Enfield noted in an interview that the popular later film Billy Elliott was done in the same style: [...] "rainy British cinema.") <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hair</b> On, Daddio parodies Cliff Richard's early 1960s rock musical films, especially The Young Ones.

It is the most awful thought in all our anarchy, {{that most of the}} ancient blows struck for freedom would not be struck at all to-day, because of the {{obscuration}} of the clean, popular customs from which they came. The insult that brought down the hammer of Wat Tyler might now be called a medical examination. That which Virginius loathed and avenged as foul slavery might now be praised as free love. The cruel taunt of Foulon, [...] "Let them eat grass," [...] might now be represented as the dying cry of an idealistic vegetarian. Those great scissors of science that would snip off the curls of the poor little school children are ceaselessly snapping closer and closer to cut off all the corners and fringes of the arts and honors of the poor. Soon they will be twisting necks to suit clean collars, and hacking feet to fit new boots. It never seems to strike them that the body is more than raiment; that the Sabbath was made for man; that all institutions shall be judged and damned by whether they have fitted the normal flesh and spirit.

But {{the very first time}} he wore it the boys made fun of it, and that was enough. After that he wore it several times with {{streaming}} tears; and then he was allowed to lay it aside, and compromise on an unstylish cap of velvet, which he had despised before. I do not know why a velvet cap was despised, but it was; a cap with a tassel was babyish. The most desired kind of cap was a flat one of blue broadcloth, with a patent-leather peak, and a removable cover of oil-cloth, silk if you were rich, cotton if you were poor; when you had pulled the top of such a cap over on one side, you were dressed for conquest, especially if you wore <b>your</b> <b>hair</b> <b>long.</b> My boy had such a cap, with a silk oil-cloth cover, but his splendor was marred by his short hair.|$|R

John Fernald directed him once again in London, playing Razumikhin, with Kenneth Griffith as Raskolnikov, in Crime and Punishment.

Michael Benthall offered him a season at The Old Vic, but only small parts and understudying were on offer, [...] except for a stint at the 1954 Edinburgh Festival as Donalbain in Macbeth, with Paul Rogers and Ann Todd in the leading roles. [...] In 1955, when Regent's Park Open Air Theatre offered him {{the chance to play}} Ferdinand in The Tempest, [...] Amer persuaded Benthall to release him. He played Ferdinand for a second time, this time with Robert Eddison as Prospero and James Maxwell as Ariel, and with June Bailey as Miranda, [...] and then on alternate nights playing Percinet opposite Hilda Schroder in Rostand's The Romanticks (Les Romanesques), [...] with character actors Russell Thorndike and Robert Atkins as the two fathers. He also performed Shakespeare live on TV, including playing Sebastian in BBC Sunday Night Theatre's Twelfth Night (1957) with Dilys Hamlett as Viola in a production by Michael Elliott and Caspar Wrede. [...] He showed his versatility by also appearing in the 1958 musical <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hair</b> On at the Apollo Theatre in London, directed by John Cranko and with settings and costumes designed by Tony Armstrong-Jones (later 1st Earl of Snowdon) and Desmond Heeley.|$|R

These works, as well as his appearance in a much-lauded commercial for Sudso washing detergent, help establish him as one of his generation's foremost actors. Smith marries Mazie Mitford and, in 1955, founds the Norbert Studios, which produce British Westerns such as They Called Him Stranger (1955) as well as a series of British comedies including Passport to Puddlewitch (starring the comedian Dick Dotty) and Whimsy Galore. Smith also appears in the drama Mozart: Man of Music (1957), remaking it as Beethoven: Man of Music in 1958 and as Andrew Lloyd Webber: Man of Music in 1984. Smith is knighted for his contributions to the British stage and screen. As Sir Norbert, he appears in It's Grim Up North (1962), in which he plays the father of a poor working class household, unable to exert any authority over his family, and over his rebellious adult son in particular: [...] "If I find out who's taken my belt, I'll take my bloody belt to them". In a change of pace, he also appears in the rock musical <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hair</b> On, Daddio (1962), starring the popular singer Davey Throb. Sir Norbert plays Throb’s father, unable to appreciate the new beat music performed by Throb and his friends, but he finally grows to love the music scene, and joins in. Sir Norbert also features in Rover Returns Home (1964), a film notable for one of the first cinematic appearances of Michael Caine.|$|R
