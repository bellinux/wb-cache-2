500|$|Time magazine, {{music critic}} Robert Christgau and AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine all {{declared}} the track {{as one of}} CrazySexyCool best. [...] "In many ways, TLC at least musically, were best when {{they were the most}} subtle," [...] commented Complex Michael Arceneaux. In addition, the writer also found the track's content to be [...] "refreshing" [...] for displaying women [...] "muddy up right and wrong in a relationship." [...] From the same publication, Benjamin Chesna and Edwin Ortiz gave credits to the song for making infidelity sound [...] "empowering" [...] while praising Austin's [...] "silky smooth production," [...] concluding their article with a claim: [...] " [...] forced you into the arms of another lady, now you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> on the down low." [...] Slant Magazines editor Sal Cinquemani was reviewing the greatest hits album 20 when he observed that both of the girls' [...] "finest" [...] singles, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", had them [...] "proudly flipping accepted modes of female sexual behavior and consent on their heads." [...] To boot the idea, Idolator journalist Robbie Daw explained the song's [...] "staying power" [...] was perhaps owed {{to the fact that it}} was a [...] "provocative" [...] track dared to expose the [...] "taboo, down-low" [...] aspects of a relationship. In the 2014 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, [...] "Creep" [...] was served as the backdrop to a dramatic scene where Lopes' character set her then-boyfriend Rison's bathtub filled with tennis shoes on fire and destroyed their joint mansion due to his infidelity. Vibe Clover Hope watched the whole scene and realized how [...] "perfectly sexy and unapologetic" [...] the song was at the time of its first releasing. In contrary, one of Pitchfork contributors, Jess Harvell, felt its lyrics were [...] "unconscionable," [...] instead, he praised the song's groove that was [...] "so seductive you barely register what you're singing along to." [...] Harvell continued to say that Austin even managed to make scratching, [...] "that emblem of noisy hip-hop ruckus", sound [...] "smooth." [...] "No mean feat.," [...] he gave out an endnote. With Charles Aaron's review for Spin, he fictionalized a short story:After that, Aaron also went on to call the track as a whole a [...] "commercial/artistic apex" [...] for the producer. Including it on her list of best tracks that make people dance, Bernadette McNulty from The Telegraph claimed: [...] "The Dallas Austin groove on this is so deep, it might give you vertigo." [...] Ebony writer Michael A. Gonzales agreed, he said the girls' song [...] "put the sonic scientist that much closer to [...] dreams of making tracks as enticing and sexy as the ones his hero Prince created for Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6." [...] Music critic Smokey Fontaine even named the track Austin's best work: [...] "Here, the harmonies worked, the bass line was hard enough to compete in a hip-hop world, and for a moment, R didn't need a guest rapper." ...|$|E

6000|$|Wayworth was {{approached}} {{at the same}} moment by a gentleman he knew as one of Mrs. Alsager's friends--he had perceived him in that lady's box. Mrs. Alsager was waiting there for the successful author; she desired very earnestly that he would come round and speak to her. Wayworth assured himself first that Violet had left the theatre--one of the actresses could tell him that she had seen her throw on a cloak, without changing her dress, and had learnt afterwards that she had, the next moment, flung herself, after flinging her aunt, into a cab. He had wished to invite half a dozen persons, of whom Miss Grey and her elderly relative were two, to come home to supper with him; but she had refused to make any engagement beforehand (it would be so dreadful to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> if she shouldn't have made a hit), and this attitude had blighted the pleasant plan, which fell to the ground. He had called her morbid, but she was immovable. Mrs. Alsager's messenger let him know that he was expected to supper in Grosvenor Place, and half an hour afterwards he was seated there among complimentary people and flowers and popping corks, eating the first orderly meal he had partaken of for a week. Mrs. Alsager had carried him off in her brougham--the other people who were coming got into things of their own. He stopped her short as soon as she began to tell him how tremendously every one had been struck by the piece; he nailed her down to the question of Violet Grey. Had she spoilt the play, had she jeopardised or compromised it--had she been utterly bad, had she been good in any degree? ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{must say}} to my dearest Sarianna how delighted {{we are at the}} thought of seeing her in Florence. I wish it had been before the autumn, but since autumn is decided for we must be content to reap our golden harvest at the time for such things. Certainly the summer heat of Florence is terrible enough--only we should have carried you with us into the shade somewhere to the sea or to the mountains--and Robert has, of course, told you of our Spezzia plan. The 'fatling of the flock' has been sheared closely of his long petticoats. Did he tell you that? And you can't think how funny the little {{creature}} looks without his train, his wise baby face appearing to approve of the whole arrangement. He talks to himself now and smiles at everybody, and admired my roses so much the other day that he wanted to eat them; having a sublime transcendental notion about the mouth being the receptacle of all beauty and glory in this world. Tell your dear father that certainly he is a 'sweet baby,' there's no denying it. We lay him down on the floor to let him kick at ease, and he makes violent efforts to get up by himself, and Wilson declares that the least encouragement would set him walking. Robert's nursing does not mend his spirits much. I shall be very glad to get him away from Florence; he has suffered too much here to rally as I long to see him do, because, dearest Sarianna, we have to live after all; and to live rightly we must turn our faces forward and press forward and not look backward morbidly for the footsteps in the dust of those beloved ones who travelled with us but yesterday. They themselves are not behind but before, and we carry with us our tenderness living and undiminished towards them, to be completed when the round of this life is complete for us also. Dearest Sarianna, why do I say such things, but because I have known what grief is? Oh, and how I could have compounded with you, grief for grief, mine for yours, for I had no last words nor gestures, Sarianna. God keep you from such a helpless bitter agony as mine then was. Dear Sarianna, you will think of us and of Florence, my dear sister, and remember how you have made us a promise and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it.</b> May God bless you and comfort you. We think of you and love you continually, and I am always your most affectionate ...|$|E
