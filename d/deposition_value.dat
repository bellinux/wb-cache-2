This article presents a new method for quantification of in vivo deposit formation on multiple materials.

The deposits were graded by three independent observers under a stereomicroscope at X 20 magnification. Plots of average <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> averaged for all participants and sites are given. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) had the lowest <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> in this trial.

To characterize the ambient falling dust pollution 15 typical sampling sites were chosen for falling dust collection at time interval of one month.

Rains over the coastal zone had different concentrations of total mercury, they ranged from 8. 6 to 118. 0 ng L − 1, out of which about 32 % were labile, inorganic forms, easily reducible in a SnCl 2 solution. Over the southern Baltic two maxima of concentrations were observed: first, in the heating season and second, in the non-heating season. Elevated concentrations of mercury in precipitations during heating seasons {{were the result of}} the activity of local emission sources (intensive combustion of fossil fuels in domestic furnaces and individual power and heat generating plants). During the warm season, precipitation over the southern Baltic could clean the air from Hg reemitted from sea and land surfaces. Precipitations, which purified marine and continental air masses were responsible for the comparable input of mercury to the coastal zone.

30|$|An {{analysis}} of the frequency distribution of maize pollen deposition onto A. syriaca leaves was previously attempted by Pleasants et al. [22]. Their analysis {{was based on an}} extensive study at four sites in the US over several years. Because the authors frequently made three 1 -cm 2 sub-measurements per leaf, variability on the leaf surface could be assessed to some extent. In addition to the fact that three sub-measurements per leaf and a resolution of 1  cm 2 are insufficient to represent leaf surface variability [15], they selectively excluded midrib zones with high <b>deposition</b> <b>values</b> at most of their study sites (see above). The resulting frequency distribution was consequently not representative of the deposition of pollen onto leaves. On the basis of carefully performed sample measurements, they estimated that the actual deposition was higher by a factor of 1.5 – 1.9 when midribs were included. The mean leaf <b>deposition</b> <b>values</b> calculated by taking this factor into account lie within the range of our results, although our range of single leaf-deposition values far exceeds that of their data.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} interest in trace metals in the atmosphere and the environmental effects of their deposition. This is to large extent because heavy metals can accumulate in the biosphere and may be toxic to living systems. On the basis of IIASA's TRACE model, the total (wet plus dry) deposition of As, Cd, Pb and Zn has been estimated for Eastern Europe. These are annual averages for rural areas, and relate to the situation in Europe in the mid- 1980 s. The maximum <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> is 3. 5 mg m^- 2 yr^- 1 for As, 1. 5 mg m^- 2 yr^- 1 for Cd and 50 mg m^- 2 yr^- 1 for Zn. All these maxima occur in Southern Poland. The highest total deposition of Pb (15. 0 - 20. 0 mg m^- 2 yr^- 1) has been computed for western Czechoslovakia and also for southern Poland. Deposition levels throughout most of Eastern Europe are at least one or two orders of magnitude greater than observed in remote parts of the world. The annual average concentration of metals in some rural areas are lower, but within a factor of two of drinking water guidelines. This is cause for concern because some short-term concentrations are almost assuredly much higher than the annual average. Because of long-range transport, there is a very significant transboundary exchange of heavy metals within Eastern Europe. As with acid-causing pollutants, the problem of heavy metals contamination in the region depends on the reduction of this transboundary pollution...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of topography on the grain size characteristics of aeolian dust deposits. Experiments were performed on three isolated hills having various size and aspect ratios. The longitudinal profile of the median grain diameter was investigated for each hill. The longitudinal dust deposition profile was also studied for nine grain size classes of between 10 and 104 Rm, as were wind and dust concentration profiles in the atmosphere upwind of, over and downwind of a hill. The wind tunnel experiments show that the grain size characteristics of aeolian dust deposits are affected by topography. Most apparent is the occurrence of a zone of reduced grain size on the leeside of hills, which extends from just upwind of the summit to a distance of several times {{the height of the}} hill. Slightly coarser than normal dust is deposited on the concave windward hill slope and in a zone downwind of the area of reduced grain size, but the increase in grain size in these zones remains very small. Although the normalized dust deposition profile for a hill does not vary substantially as a function of grain size, systematic trends are observed. The most important tendencies are: (1) a progressive extension, in the downwind direction, of a zone of decreased dust deposition on the leeside of a hill (the coarser the grains, the further downwind the zone of reduced deposition extends); (2) a progressive increase in dust deposition immediately upwind of a hill (the finer the grains, the higher the <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> upwind of a hill becomes). Both tendencies are explained by the difference in inertia of the grains, which is controlled by grain size. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new phenomenological {{model of the}} {{evaporation}} of ground water containing a polluting material in the dissolved form. It is assumed that there exists a sharp evaporation front separating between the dry and the water saturated soil. The water saturated soil is assumed to occupy a semi-infinite domain x>X(t), where x is a vertical coordinate directed downward and X(T) is a position of the evaporation front. The mathematical description {{is based on the}} mass and energy conservation laws, the Darcy law, and the equations of state for both phases. In the motionless case, the governing equations reduce to a system of four linear diffusion equations coupled through four boundary conditions, one of which is non-linear, on the free moving evaporation front. Only the one-dimensional case is treated. We obtain a similarity solution of the governing equations and analyse it qualitatively showing that the concentration of the dissolved pollutant increases in the upward vertical direction and reaches its maximum on the evaporation front. The problem is reduced to a transcendental equation which is treated numerically. The dependence of the pollutant concentration on the evaporation front and of the velocity of the front on the initial pollutant concentration and the temperature of the ground surface are computed. It is shown that for realistic values of the initial pollutant concentration that are below the concentration value c_d at which a deposition of the pollutant sets in and for realistic values of the ground surface temperature, the pollutant concentration on the evaporation front can reach values that are above the <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> c_d. These results point to a possible mechanism of the deposition of pollutants dissolved in ground water caused by the evaporation. Within the proposed model, an assessment {{of the impact of the}} evaporation of polluted ground water on the lasting soil contamination can be madeSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RR 6943 (98 - 06) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Dutch Priority Program on acidification, the DAS model (Dutch Acidification System model) has been developed. This model describes the entire causal chain from emissions of acidifying components to their effects on ecosystems on a regional scale. In the atmospheric module of DAS the transport and deposition of acidifying species is described by means of so-called source-receptor relations. Assuming that the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere may be approximated as first order, linear processes, the relation between an emission quantity in a source area and the resulting deposition flux in a receptor area can be described with a single transfer coefficient. In the Netherlands 20 receptor areas are defined. The number of source areas in the Netherlands and foreign countries is 39. The source-receptor relations are {{based on the results of}} the atmospheric transport model TREND. For the components NOx and SO 2 different sets of transfer matrices are calculated for three emission height classes. This improves the calculation of the contribution to the deposition of sources at relatively short distances. As ammonia emissions take place at the surface or at low heights, no discrimination in emission heights is made for this component. By using the transfer matrices the calculation of atmospheric deposition is reduced to a simple matrix multiplication. In this way the computer time consuming applications of the TREND model can be avoided. However, during the procedure of calculating the transfer matrices, a number of assumptions and choices had to be made which limit the application of the matrices. In principle the assumption of a linear relation between emission and deposition is violated for all three acidifying components. Interactions between the compounds play a (sometimes important) role in atmospheric processes. As model parameters are validated for the present situation, deviations from a linear behaviour will become larger with increasing deviations from the present emission conditions. Next to limitations inherent to the method, there are some practical limitations. Only an average <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> for a receptor area can be obtained. There is no information on the spatial variations in deposition within a receptor area. Detailed calculations with TREND show that the variation may be large. The meteorological conditions and the removal parameters are pre defined for the TREND calculations. Changes in these parameters require a re-calculation of the matrices. Nevertheless, it may be assumed that the error introduced by the assumptions of a linear emissiondeposition relation is acceptable in view of the uncertainties in the other modules of the DAS-model. ...|$|E
40|$|A passively cooled {{graphite}} {{target was}} proposed for a 1. 5 MW neutrino production research facility {{because of its}} simplicity and favorable performance as a target material for neutrino production (Ref. 1). The conceptual design for the target in the Reference 1 study was a graphite rod 15 mm in diameter by 800 mm long. Figure 1 shows the graphite target rod supported by graphite spokes, which are mounted to a water-cooled stainless steel support tube. The target is radiatively cooled to the water-cooled surface of the support tube. Based on nuclear analysis results (Ref. 2), the time-averaged power deposition in the target is 35 kW. If this power is deposited uniformly along the axial length of the target, the volumetric power deposition in the target is about 250 MW/m{sup 3 }. The target surface temperature required to radiate the deposited power to a water-cooled tube {{is estimated to be}} about 1850 C, and the temperature {{at the center of the}} target is about 75 C hotter. The sublimation erosion rate (e), estimated assuming that the graphite is submersed in a perfect vacuum environment, can be derived from kinetic theory and is given by: e = p{sub sat} (m/ 2 {pi} kT) {sup 1 / 2 } where p{sub sat} is the saturation pressure, m is the molecular weight, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature. The saturation pressure given in Ref. 3 can be approximated by: p{sub sat} = exp(-A/T + B) where A = 9. 47 x 10 {sup 3 }, B = 24. 2, and the units of p{sub sat} and T are atmospheres and K, respectively. Using these equations, the saturation pressure and sublimation erosion rate are plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. The surface recession rate shown with units of mm/s in Fig. 2 assumes one-sided erosion. At the average power <b>deposition</b> <b>value</b> of 250 MW/m{sup 3 }, the surface temperature is 1850 C resulting in a sublimation erosion rate of only 2. 2 mm/day. However, if the actual power deposition were peaked by a factor of two in the axial direction, then the surface temperature would be 2260 C and the surface recession rate would be 2. 8 mm/day, which is clearly unacceptable. To establish the viability of a graphite target at the reference power levels and perhaps extend the power handling performance of radiatively cooled graphite targets, a helium cover gas at nominally one atmosphere pressure was proposed as a means to greatly reduce the net erosion rate. The mean free path for a graphite atom in a helium environment at a pressure of one atmosphere is less than 0. 1 mm, which means that graphite that is sublimated from the target surface will travel on average less than 0. 1 mm before it interacts with the helium. Given this small mean-free-path, it can be expected that a large fraction of the graphite that is sublimated will find its way back to the graphite surface and re-condense on the target, thereby greatly reducing the net erosion rate. The primary purposes for performing the tests described in this report are to (1) verify that we can reproduce the sublimation erosion rate expected for high vacuum conditions and (2) establish the reduction in net sublimation of graphite as a function of the gas (He) pressure in a chamber that roughly simulates the stainless steel support tube discussed above. Thus far, the first objective has been accomplished, but more work is required to accomplish the second. The experimental apparatus is described in Section 2 of this report and results obtained thus far are presented in Section 3 of this report...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} of nitrogen and sulfur causes many deleterious effects on ecosystems including acidification and excess eutrophication. Assessments to support development of strategies to mitigate these effects require spatially and temporally continuous values of nitrogen and sulfur deposition. In the U. S., national monitoring networks exist that provide values of {{wet and dry}} deposition at discrete locations. While wet deposition can be interpolated between the monitoring locations, dry deposition cannot. Additionally, monitoring networks do not measure the complete suite of chemicals that contribute to total sulfur and nitrogen deposition. Regional air quality models provide spatially continuous <b>values</b> of <b>deposition</b> of monitored species as well as important unmeasured species. However, air quality modeling values are not generally available for an extended continuous time period. Air quality modeling results may also be biased for some chemical species.

The expression of deposition on a surface unit at constant surface element rotation frequency is determined {{on the basis of}} approximated scheme with negative curvature. The <b>deposition</b> <b>values</b> are resulted for different types of curvature. The value of the particle flux divergence in the capacity of compensative factor for the curvature deposition inhomogeneity is considered. The fact that the strong dependence of the deposition probability on the bombarding angle leads to the reduction of the general level of deposition for different schemes is revealed...|$|R
40|$|Goal of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of three land use scenarios on agricultural ammonia emissions and resulting nature values. The study area is {{the northern part of the}} Netherlands, comprised of the three northern provinces. It is concluded that the three scenarios studied have comparable effects on ammonia emissions and the resulting <b>depositions.</b> <b>Values</b> are low compared to other parts of the Netherlands. In general nature values are high and differences between the scenarios are mainly a result from the localisation of different land use types. A more detailed analysis shows that the scenario called 'Raamwerk' generally produces slightly higher nature values than the other two scenarios...|$|R
