50|$|In the mid-1980s, Sega {{released}} Hang-On and After Burner, arcade {{titles that}} {{make use of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cabinet</b> functionality and force feedback control. Sega also released the 360-degree rotating machine R-360. For arcade system boards, Sega released the System series and the Super Scaler series. UFO Catcher was introduced in 1985 and is Japan's most commonly installed claw crane game. Sega {{was also one of}} the first to introduce medal games with World Bingo and World Derby in the 1980s, a sub-industry within Japanese arcades up to its current day.|$|E
5000|$|M2, in {{collaboration}} with Sega CS3, ported Space Harrier to the handheld Nintendo 3DS console in 2013, complete with stereoscopic 3D and widescreen graphicsâ€”a process that took eighteen months. Sega CS3 producer Yosuke Okunari described the game's 3D-conversion process as [...] "almost impossible. When you take a character sprite that was originally in 2D and bring it into a 3D viewpoint, {{you have to build}} the graphic from scratch." [...] During development, M2 president Naoki Horii sought opinions from staff members regarding the gameplay of the arcade original. [...] "They'd say {{it was hard to tell}} whether objects were right in front of their character or not. Once we had the game in 3D, the same people came back and said, 'OK, now I get it! I can play it now!'" [...] The port included a feature that allowed players to use the 3DS's gyroscope to simulate the experience of the original <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cabinet</b> by way of a tilting screen, compounded by the optional activation of the sounds of button clicks and the cabinet's movement. Horii recalled in a 2015 interview that he was intrigued by the possibility of crafting Space Harrier and past Sega arcade games for the 3DS using stereoscopic technology. [...] "Both SEGA and M2 wanted to see what would happen if we added a little bit of spice to these titles, in the form of modern gaming technology. Would it enhance the entertainment factor? I think the reception that the releases have had from critics highlights that these games are as relevant today as ever, and that means we've succeeded." ...|$|E
50|$|By January 1998, {{an updated}} version of the game had been {{released}} in Japan, under the title of The Lost World Special. The new <b>hydraulic</b> game <b>cabinet</b> features seats that rotate and rock from side to side. A burst of air blows out at the player(s) whenever the Tyrannosaurus roars. The game was rewritten to more closely follow the film's plot. Some ideas that were scrapped from the original game were implemented into the Special game. Some of the game's levels were moved around from the original. The Carnotaurus was cut from the game and replaced with a final level of a Tyrannosaurus rampaging through San Diego.|$|R
5000|$|Sega AM2's Hang-On, {{designed}} by Yu Suzuki and {{running on the}} Sega Space Harrier hardware, {{was the first of}} Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. The pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Designed by Sega AM2's Yu Suzuki, he stated that his [...] "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." [...] It was controlled using a video game arcade cabinet resembling a motorbike, which the player moves with their body. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> arcade <b>cabinets</b> in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles.|$|R

This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> arcade <b>cabinets</b> in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. The Sega Activator, based on the Light Harp invented by Assaf Gurner, An Israeli musician and Kung Fu martial artist who researched inter disciplinarian concepts to create the experience of playing an instrument using the whole body's motion. was released for the Mega Drive (Genesis) in 1993. It could read the player's physical movements {{and was the first}} controller to allow full-body motion sensing, The original invention related to a 3 octaves musical instrument that could interpret the user's gestures into musical notes via MIDI protocol. The invention was registered as patent initially in Israel on May 11, 1988 after 4 years of R&D. In 1992 the first complete Light Harp was created by Assaf Gurner and Oded Zur and was presented to Sega of America, However, it was a commercial failure due to its [...] "unwieldiness and inaccuracy". Another early motion-sensing device was the Sega VR headset, first announced in 1991. It featured built-in sensors that tracked the player's movement and head position, but was never officially released. Another early example is the 2000 light gun shooter arcade game Police 911, which used motion sensing technology to detect the player's movements, which are reflected by the player character within the game. The Atari Mindlink was an early proposed motion controller for the Atari 2600, which measured the movement of the user's eyebrows with a fitted headband.|$|R
2500|$|Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In {{his first}} year, {{he created a}} 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the {{executive}} staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still {{in his first year}} at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove to be the big stepping-off point of his career. [...] "To develop this game," [...] Suzuki told G4TV, [...] "I rode on motorcycles a lot. [...] When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype bike for hours and hours every day." [...] His efforts culminated into the game Hang-On, released in 1985. Hang-On was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled <b>hydraulic</b> arcade <b>cabinets</b> in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, it was also the first of Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed three-dimensional sprite/texture-scaling at high frame rates.
