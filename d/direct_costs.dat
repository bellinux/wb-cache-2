40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 70) The {{objective of}} this research has been to examine the nature and usefulness of <b>direct</b> <b>costing.</b> After a chapter that presented the historical background {{and the development of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> concept and which was included in the research to lend perspective and understanding, the study considered cost classifications and analyzed the usefulness of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> for management decision purposes and for external financial reporting. The study also presented a profit sensitivity model so that attention could be focused on the variance in results obtained under <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> as compared to the results obtained using absorption costing. This model was included in the study for completeness {{on the assumption that the}} evaluation of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> should not be limited to a consideration of its differences in theory and application, but also its impact on profits as compared to other costing methods. The central conclusions of this study are listed below. 1. The nature of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> is found in the association of fixed or time costs of production with time periods rather than with units of product. 2. <b>Direct</b> <b>cost</b> statements help make management aware of patterns of cost behavior and relevant cost classifications and thus aid in solving decision problems. 3. <b>Direct</b> <b>costing</b> presents income statements where the fluctuation in income is related to the fluctuations in sales, rather than to the fluctuation in both sales and production, and can aid in evaluating efficiency. 4. <b>Direct</b> <b>costing</b> has not had general acceptance for published financial reports even though it may be used for planning and controlling purposes. Because the criteria applied in the case of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> differ from the criteria applied for absorption costing, the controversy over the use of <b>direct</b> or absorption <b>costing</b> for external reports will persist. 5. The impact of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> for profit determination as demonstrated by the sensitivity model developed for the study is significant even for reasonably low proportions of fixed overhead cost and relatively balanced production and sales volumes...|$|R

However, there are no consensus between researchers in classifying <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> component. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> model of occupational accident cost by using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) method. There are three cost components proposed for <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> estimation which are medical cost, rehabilitation cost and compensation cost. Local specific approach (by reviewing previous accident record in the company) is adopted in data collection process and only accidents occurred between 2008 and 2013 were considered in this study. There are 344 cases in total which came from six different sectors in manufacturing industry. For each occupational accident, the site safety officer in charge, human resource and account department officer were interviewed in order to estimate the <b>direct</b> <b>cost.</b> Then, the relationship between three observed variables for <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> is evaluated by using CFA. The CFA result shows that the occupational accident <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> model has acceptable goodness of fit that proved relationship between three observed variables (medical, rehabilitation and compensation cost) and its latent construct.

25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. <b>Direct</b> <b>costs</b> relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E

Freight rates were the same for broad and narrow-gauge railways, despite higher <b>direct</b> <b>costs.</b> Most of the loadings were goods such as timber, potatoes and lime, which were charged at a low rate.

The amount credited to the lines did not cover the cost of running trains, and the more traffic the larger the loss. However, particularly in the 1920s, the traffic generated by the narrow-gauge lines was appreciated by the railways and the lines survived for up to 60 years before closure.|$|E

However, most of the economic costs would come in indirect forms, such as delays in trade routes. One estimate predicts the effect due to reduced trade to be a drop of 0.8% in overall economic output, a loss of €110 billion by 2025, representing a 10-20% decrease in trade between Schengen countries. For example, in France the GDP would be lowered by 0.5% compared to 2015, a cumulative loss of about €10 billion. Other estimated costs include up to €5.2 billion per year for commuters and other travelers, €7.5 billion per year for waiting time for trucks at borders, and €20 billion per year in losses for the European tourism industry.|$|E

The <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> to the Confederacy in human capital, government expenditures, and physical destruction from the war totaled $3.3 billion. By 1865, the Confederate dollar was worthless due to high inflation, {{and people in the}} South had to resort to bartering services for goods, or else use scarce Union dollars. With the emancipation of the southern slaves, the entire economy of the South had to be rebuilt. Having lost their enormous investment in slaves, white planters had minimal capital to pay freedmen workers to bring in crops. As a result, a system of sharecropping was developed where landowners broke up large plantations and rented small lots to the freedmen and their families. The South was transformed from an elite minority of landed gentry slaveholders into a tenant farming agriculture system.|$|E
25|$|Constantine settled Franks on {{the lower}} left bank of the Rhine; their {{settlements}} required a line of fortifications {{to keep them in}} check, indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control. Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire. The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening. In Gaul, which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s, perhaps worst in Armorica. By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted, and local use of money ceased about 360. Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians. Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians. Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay; as they farmed for themselves, their <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy. However, except for the provinces along the lower Rhine, the agricultural economy was generally doing well. The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century; the population of North-Western Europe did not recover, though the Mediterranean regions did.|$|E
