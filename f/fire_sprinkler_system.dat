5|$|Towson United Methodist Church is in {{the midst}} of a $3million phased {{renovation}} and expansion project started in 2006. In the first phase, completed in 2007, an elevator and additional facilities were installed for improved disabled accessibility, along with a new <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> and replacement of the building's climate control system (HVAC). Additional classrooms in an expanded education wing are planned in future phases of a multiyear master plan adopted by the church in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> in high rise buildings.|$|E

25|$|Preliminary {{underwater}} {{inspections of}} the Norman Atlantic {{revealed that the}} water intake pipes of the <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> were clogged with mussels; additional inspections are necessary to determine if this blockage contributed to the fire's spreading. Although the voyage data recorder (black box) has been recovered, still by mid-March no data have been extracted, apparently because {{the heat of the}} fire caused the plastic to melt onto the hard disk. Recordings of the Voyage data recorder published on 7 October 2015, say that the <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> wasn't working correctly and instead of spraying water there was smoke coming from the system. The investigations also state that there was a truck that had the engine working. Smoke was coming from the truck prior to the fire.|$|E
25|$|A fire {{sprinkler}} {{is the part}} of a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> that discharges water when the effects of a fire have been detected, such as when a pre-determined temperature has been reached. Henry S. Parmelee of New Haven, Connecticut invented and installed the first closed-head or automated {{fire sprinkler}} in 1874.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{occurred}} at the Sofa Super Store, composed of a 42,000ft² (3,902 m²) single-story steel trussed showroom building with a 17,000ft² (1,579 m²) warehouse building located behind the retail space, located at 1807 Savannah Highway in Charleston. The building had no <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system.</b> The fire started at approximately 7:00p.m. in a covered loading dock area built between the showroom and warehouse buildings which was attached to both buildings. At the time, the business was open and employees were present.

25|$|A National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigation}} of the fire, using computer simulations with FDS and a mock-up of the stage area and dance floor, concluded that a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> would have contained the fire long enough to give everyone time to exit safely. However, because of the building's age (built in 1946) and size (4,484 square feet (404 m²)), many believed the Station to be exempt from sprinkler system requirements. In fact, the building had undergone an occupancy change when it was converted from a restaurant to a nightclub. This change dissolved its exemption from the law, a fact that West Warwick fire inspectors never noticed. On the night in question, the Station was legally required to have a sprinkler system but did not; outcry over the event has sparked calls for a national Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act but those efforts have so far stalled.|$|E
25|$|About 6 a.m. on 17 November 2010 a fire {{broke out}} on the vehicle deck of the MS Pearl of Scandinavia on its way from Oslo to Copenhagen. The ferry's <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> {{put out the fire}} before any of the crew or the 490 {{sleeping}} passengers were injured and the ship could dock in Copenhagen under its own power. It was determined that the cause of the fire was a short circuit in the plug of an extension cord used to charge a rebuilt Nissan Qashqai, converted into a battery electric vehicle by the Sakskøbing based company A Future EV. The company owner was returning from Norway where the vehicle had started the approval process for general sale there, and had used an extension cord to charge the vehicle from a general purpose power outlet on the ferry. The ferry operator DFDS Seaways consequently prohibited vehicle charging on board its ferries while the investors withdrew their support for the vehicle company forcing it into bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|The Dupont Plaza {{opened in}} 1963 as the Puerto Rico-Sheraton and was {{operated}} by the Sheraton hotel company until 1980, just before Sheraton imposed significant fire-safety measures in its hotels throughout the world. Before national fire safety requirements were enacted in 1990, most hotels had implemented fire safety measures based on local regulations and ordinances, which in some localities were lax, despite frequent fires and fire-related deaths at hotels. In June 1985, the Dupont Plaza was inspected by the local fire department and {{was found to have}} deficiencies in its safety systems, including malfunctioning equipment and lack of evacuation and emergency plans. The <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system,</b> which was not criticized in the fire department's report, was not automated, as it was in 95% of hotels across the U.S. at that time. In 1985, there were 7,500 reported fires in hotels and motels across the U.S., with 85 deaths and $56 million in damages ($ in present-day terms).|$|E

500|$|When Little Ferry, New Jersey {{contractor}} William Fehrs {{was hired}} to construct a film storage facility in 1934, he designed the structure to be fireproof. The building had [...] outer walls and a reinforced concrete roof. Internally, it was divided into forty-two individual vaults, each enclosed behind a steel door and separated with [...] brick interior walls. The local fire department confirmed Fehrs's fireproofing. Despite the potential for fire, the facility was located in a residential neighborhood, and was equipped with neither a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> nor mechanical ventilation.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} General Management Plan {{adopted by}} the NPS in 1998 for the estate's {{long-term}} planning and operation, the NPS began studying the mansion's security, safety, electrical systems, and environmental issues in 2000. Critical needs were identified, such as {{the lack of a}} fire suppression system and climate control. Conservators of the property's furnishings and paintings said that the need to stabilize temperature and humidity levels inside the mansion was [...] "urgent due to unacceptable environmental stress". The NPS finalized plans in 2004, including an environmental impact assessment, for installation of a modern HVAC system and a concealed <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> to protect the historic mansion and its irreplaceable contents from loss by fire.|$|E
500|$|Rising Sun Pictures {{created a}} {{sequence}} {{considered by many}} reviewers {{the centerpiece of the}} film's effects, where Quicksilver uses his super speed in the Pentagon kitchen. Depicting how, to a speedster, actions in real time come down to a virtual standstill, objects float around in slow motion. After doing LIDAR scan of the kitchen set, the digital recreation added many computer generated props [...] - cooking gear, cutlery, vegetables and water released by a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> - rendered in near microscopic detail regarding placement and lighting, particularly because the footage had to work in 3D. To simulate Quicksilver running on the walls, Evan Peters and a stunt double were filmed in both the set being suspended by a harness and on a treadmill that stood in front of a chroma key green screen. Only Peters' legs were digitally replaced. Despite the sequence only having 29 effects shots, it required nearly seven months of work from RSP's team of 70 artists.|$|E
5000|$|May 11, 1969 saw a {{major fire}} in a {{glovebox}} in Building 776/777. [...] This was the costliest industrial accident ever {{to occur in the}} United States up to that time. Cleanup from the accident took two years and led to safety upgrades on the site, including <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> and firewalls.|$|R
25|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{systems have}} a proven record for controlling and extinguishing unwanted fires. Many fire officials recommend that every building, including residences, have <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems.</b> Correctly working <b>sprinklers</b> in a residence greatly {{reduce the risk}} of death from a fire. With the small rooms typical of a residence, one or two sprinklers can cover most rooms.|$|R

500|$|The {{ship was}} hit five more times in this attack, {{one of which}} {{penetrated}} the unarmoured aft lift and detonated beneath it, destroying it and the surrounding structure. One bomb struck and destroyed the starboard forward [...] "pom-pom" [...] mount closest to the island, while another passed through the forwardmost port [...] "pom-pom" [...] mount and failed to detonate, although it did start a fire. One bomb penetrated {{the outer edge of}} the forward port flight deck and detonated about [...] above the water, riddling the adjacent hull structure with holes which caused flooding in some compartments and starting a fire. The most damaging hit was a large bomb that penetrated through the deck armour forward of the aft lift and detonated 10 feet above the hangar deck. The explosion started a severe fire, destroyed the rear <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system,</b> bent the forward lift like a hoop and shredded the fire curtains into lethal splinters. It also blew a hole in the hangar deck, damaging areas three decks below. The Stukas also near-missed Illustrious with two bombs, which caused minor damage and flooding. The multiple hits at the aft end of the carrier knocked out her steering gear, although it was soon repaired.|$|E
500|$|Seabourn Legend was rented for {{six weeks}} at a {{reported}} cost of $38,000 per day; the ship served as the film's primary setting and provided accommodation for the cast and crew. [...] The evacuation sequence {{was among the first}} scenes filmed on the ship, and was shot in Key West, Florida over a two-week period. Approximately 30 hoses and the ship's <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> were used to simulate heavy rainfall in the scene. Severe weather conditions from Hurricane Lili delayed production activity on the ship for several days, and caused seasickness among the cast and crew {{for the remainder of the}} production at sea. To make the ship appear faster, all exterior shots were filmed from a moving vehicle. Scenes on the bridge were filmed in a mockup dubbed the [...] "bridge ship", a large-scale reconstruction of the bow and bridge built atop the hull of a cargo ship. Additional ship interiors were filmed at Sony Pictures Studios and Warren Entertainment in Los Angeles County, California. Full-scale replicas of the ship's atrium, cabins, and engine rooms were constructed on sound stages where production took place for over a month. The scene where Alex rescues Drew while the ship is being flooded was filmed by camera operators wearing wet suits inside a sound stage tank, which was constructed with plywood and a hydraulic lift to give the effect that the water level was rising.|$|E
2500|$|The Customs House {{was bought}} by Statsbygg in 1999 as office space for their Statsbygg Sør division. [...] With the help of Amlie's {{architectural}} firm in Stathelle they immediately conducted extensive restoration of the building's interior. [...] The windows {{and all of the}} interior and exterior doors were taken out and replaced with new replicas. [...] Some of the original features, such as the elaborately detailed ceilings, wall panels, and main staircase, were repaired and restored. [...] Some parts of the interior were torn out, such as many non-load-bearing walls, ceilings, and floors that were mainly from the 1950s to 1980s. [...] The building was also fitted with modern amenities such as HVAC, an elevator, and a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wood's metal {{is useful}} as a low-melting solder, {{low-temperature}} casting metal, high-temperature coupling fluid in heat baths, and as a fire-melted valve element in <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> in buildings.

2500|$|Cooling towers {{constructed}} {{in whole or}} in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation. Such fires can become very intense, due to the high surface-volume ratio of the towers, and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft. [...] The resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure. For this reason, some codes and standards recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system.</b> Fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation (such as for maintenance or construction), and even while the tower is in operation, especially those of the induced-draft type, because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1913, Imperator {{returned}} to the Vulkan shipyard to facilitate drastic work to improve her handling and stability, {{as it had been}} discovered that her centre of gravity was too high (see metacentric height). To correct the problem, the marble bathroom suites in first class were removed and heavy furniture was replaced with lightweight wicker cane. The ship's funnels were reduced in height by [...] Finally, 2,000 tons of cement was poured into the ship's double bottom as ballast. This work cost £200,000, which had to be borne by the shipyard as part of their five-year warranty to the shipowners. At the same time, an advanced <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> was fitted throughout the ship, as several fires had occurred on board since the vessel had entered service.|$|E
2500|$|After the fire, {{some state}} {{residents}} {{tried to have}} the university moved further west to Sedalia; but Columbia rallied support to keep it. [...] The columns were retained {{as a symbol of}} the historic campus. [...] Today they are surrounded by the Francis Quadrangle, the oldest part of campus. At the southern end of the quad is Academic Hall's replacement, Jesse Hall, named for Richard Jesse (the president of the university at the time of the fire). Built in 1895, Jesse Hall holds many administrative offices and Jesse Auditorium. The buildings surrounding the quad were constructed of red brick, leading to this area becoming known as Red Campus. The area was tied together in planned landscaping and walks in 1910 by George Kessler in a City Beautiful design of the grounds. Jesse Hall is scheduled for a $9.8 mil. makeover to include a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system,</b> work on its elevators, and a new heating and cooling system as part of a $92 mil. total renovation package approved by the Board of Curators in June 2013.
