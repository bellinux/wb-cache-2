25|$|The District Court remanded the {{decision}} to issue the permits to the FWS. It directed the FWS to gather the necessary data and conduct the required scientific analysis {{in order to determine}} whether the permits issued meet requirements under the ESA and the NEPA. The court stressed that the FWS must do more than merely <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> in performing its duties to protect the Alabama beach mouse from extinction.|$|E
500|$|The {{bottom line}} is that {{withdrawing}} the Krayoxx Case would cause Finley & Figg to be sued for both defense costs and malpractice, which would completely ruin the small firm. There is no choice for Finley & Figg but to give up their motion to withdraw the tort case and prepare to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of a [...] jury trial which they have absolutely no chance of winning. Moreover, going through the motions is quite expensive: in order to present any kind of case they must bring experts to testify against Krayoxx and even disreputable experts, the only ones who can be found charge fees {{in the tens of thousands}} of dollars.|$|E
500|$|At age 30 (the {{minimum age}} {{required}} {{to hold the}} office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: [...] "I liked to [...] at night when I {{thought there was a}} better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1Â½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E

60|$|Jenny had {{no better}} means of {{justification}} {{than the last}} apology to which her sex trust, and usually not in vain; she pressed her handkerchief to her face, sobbed with great vehemence, and either wept, or managed, as Halliday might have said, to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> wonderfully well.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} Saturday came, and the WEEKLY SAGAMORE arrived. Mrs. Eversly Bennett was present. She was the Presbyterian parson's wife, {{and was working}} the Fosters for a charity.

The moment {{she was out of}} the house, Aleck eagerly tore the wrapper from the paper, and her eyes and Sally's swept the columns for the death-notices. Disappointment! Tilbury was not anywhere mentioned. Aleck was a Christian from the cradle, and duty and the force of habit required her to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions.</b> She pulled herself together and said, with a pious two-per-cent. trade joyousness: ...|$|E

60|$|This mood will pass, some day--there {{is history}} for it. But it cannot pass until my wife comes {{up out of}} the submergence. She was always so quick to recover herself before, but now there is no rebound, and we are dead people who <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of life. Indeed I am a mud image, and it will puzzle me to know what it is in me that writes, and has comedy-fancies and finds {{pleasure}} in phrasing them. It is a law of our nature, of course, or it wouldn't happen; the thing in me forgets the presence of the mud image and goes its own way, wholly unconscious of it and apparently of no kinship with it.

60|$|When the Emperor had seated {{himself and}} given the signal, the sports began. Sometimes a rope-dancing {{elephant}} would begin the entertainment, by mounting even to {{the summit of the}} building and descending by a cord. Then a bear, dressed up as a Roman matron, would be carried along in a chair between porters, as ladies were wont to go abroad, and another bear, in a lawyer's robe, would stand on his hind legs and <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of pleading a case. Or a lion came forth with a jeweled crown on his head, a diamond necklace round his neck, his mane plaited with gold, and his claws gilded, and played a hundred pretty gentle antics with a little hare that danced fearlessly within his grasp. Then in would come twelve elephants, six males in togas, six females with the veil and pallium; they took their places on couches around an ivory table, dined with great decorum, playfully sprinkled a little rosewater over the nearest spectators, and then received more guests of their unwieldy kind, who arrived in ball dresses, scattered flowers, and performed a dance.|$|E
6000|$|That {{seems to}} confirm and justify the {{prevalent}} Austrian faith {{that in this}} confusion of unrelated and irreconcilable elements, this condition of incurable disunion, there is strength--for the Government. Nearly every day some one explains {{to me that a}} revolution would not succeed here. 'It couldn't, you know. Broadly speaking, all the nations in the empire hate the Government--but they all hate each other too, and with devoted and enthusiastic bitterness; no two of them can combine; the nation that rises must rise alone; then the others would joyfully join the Government against her, and she would have just a fly's chance against a combination of spiders. This Government is entirely independent. It can go its own road, and do as it pleases; it has nothing to fear. In countries like England and America, where there is one tongue and the public interests are common, the Government must take account of public opinion; but in Austria-Hungary there are nineteen public opinions--one for each state. No--two or three for each state, since there are two or three nationalities in each. A Government cannot satisfy all these public opinions; it can only <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of trying. This Government does that. It goes through the motions, and they do not succeed; but that does not worry the Government much.' ...|$|E

60|$|They piled {{over one}} another {{to get to the}} bar, with coarse jests and oaths and laughter. None of them noted that the {{stranger}} did not appear so thirsty as he had claimed to be. In fact, though he <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions,</b> he did not drink at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he said cheerfully. [...] "Today I take my seat, as I've {{arranged}} it, you see, {{over there}} with them, and watch 'em <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions.</b> One rehearsal's enough for ME. At the same time, I can chip in if necessary." [...] And before she could reply {{he was out of}} the schoolhouse again, hailing the new-comers. This was done with apparently such delight to the children and with some evidently imported expression into his smooth mask-like face, that Mrs. Martin had to content herself with watching him with equal curiosity. She was turning away with a sudden sense of forgotten dignity, when a shout of joyous, childish laughter attracted her attention to the window. The new assistant, with half a dozen small children on his square shoulders, walking with bent back and every simulation of advanced senility, was evidently personating, with the assistance of astonishingly distorted features, the ogre of a Christmas pantomime. As his eye caught hers the expression vanished, the mask-like face returned; he set the children down, and moved away. And when school began, although he marshaled them triumphantly to the very door,--with what contortion of face or simulation of character she was unable to guess,--after he had entered the schoolroom and taken his seat every vestige of his previous facial aberration was gone, and only his usual stolidity remained. In vain, as Mrs. Martin expected, the hundred delighted little eyes before her dwelt at first eagerly and hopefully upon his face, but, as she HAD NOT expected, recognizing from the blankness of his demeanor that the previous performance was intended for them exclusively, the same eager eyes were presently dropped again upon their books in simple imitation, as if he were one of themselves. Mrs. Martin breathed freely, and lessons began.|$|E
6000|$|The {{country is}} weary of being cheated with plays upon words. The United States are a nation, {{and not a}} mass-meeting; theirs is a {{government}}, and not a caucus,--a government {{that was meant to}} be capable, and is capable, of something more than the helpless please don't of a village constable; they have executive and administrative officers that are not mere puppet-figures to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of an objectless activity, but arms and hands that become supple to do {{the will of the people}} so soon as that will becomes conscious and defines its purpose. It is time that we turned up our definitions in some more trustworthy dictionary than that of avowed disunionists and their more dangerous because more timid and cunning accomplices. Rebellion smells no sweeter because it is called Secession, nor does Order lose its divine precedence in human affairs because a knave may nickname it Coercion. Secession means chaos, and Coercion the exercise of legitimate authority. You cannot dignify the one nor degrade the other by any verbal charlatanism. The best testimony to the virtue of coercion is the fact that no wrongdoer ever thought well of it. The thief in jail, the mob-leader in the hands of the police, and the murderer on the drop will be unanimous in favor of this new heresy of the unconstitutionality of constitutions, with its Newgate Calendar of confessors, martyrs, and saints. Falstaff's famous regiment would have volunteered to a man for its propagation or its defence. Henceforth let every unsuccessful litigant have the right to pronounce the verdict of a jury sectional, and to quash all proceedings and retain the property in controversy by seceding from the court-room. Let the planting of hemp be made penal, because it squints toward coercion. Why, the first great secessionist would doubtless have preferred to divide heaven peaceably, would have been willing to send commissioners, must have thought Michael's proceedings injudicious, and could probably even now demonstrate the illegality of hell-fire to any five-year-old imp of average education and intelligence. What a fine world we should have, if we could only come quietly together in convention, and declare by unanimous resolution, or even by a two-thirds vote, that edge-tools should hereafter cut everybody's fingers but his that played with them; that, when two men ride on one horse, the hindmost shall always sit in front; and that, when a man tries to thrust his partner out of bed and gets kicked out himself, he shall be deemed to have established his title to an equitable division, and the bed shall be thenceforth his as of right, without detriment to the other's privilege in the floor! ...|$|E
