50|$|Although the {{newcomers}} arrived in America after an already established small community of their compatriots, they experienced many culture shocks in what {{to them was}} a strange country. The Chinese immigrants neither spoke nor understood English and were not familiar with western culture and life; they often came from rural China and therefore had difficulty in adjusting to and finding their way around large towns such as San Francisco. The racism they experienced from the European Americans from the outset increased continuously until {{the turn of the}} 20th century, and with lasting effect prevented their assimilation into mainstream American society. This in turn led to the creation, cohesion, and cooperation of many Chinese benevolent associations and societies whose existence in the United States continued far into the 20th century as a necessity both for support and survival. There were also many other factors that hindered their assimilation, most notably their appearance. Under Qing dynasty law, Han Chinese men were forced under the threat of beheading to follow Manchu customs including shaving the front of their heads and combing the remaining hair into a queue. Historically, to the Manchus, the policy was both an act of submission and, in practical terms, an <b>identification</b> <b>aid</b> to tell friend from foe. Because Chinese immigrants returned as often as they could to China to see their family, they could not cut off their often hated braids in America and then legally re-enter China.|$|E

We examined ways in which mental health nurses could correctly identify patients during medication administration that promote medication safety and that are acceptable to both consumers and nurses. Central to the safe practice of medication administration are the “five rights”- giving the right drug, in the right dose, to the right patient, via the right route, at the right time. In non-psychiatric settings, such as medical and surgical inpatient units, the use of <b>identification</b> <b>aids,</b> such as wristbands, are common.

Given a small amount of speech from a new speaker, is it better to apply speaker adaptation, or to use accent <b>identification</b> (<b>AID)</b> to identify the speaker’s accent followed by accent-dependent ASR? Three approaches to accent-dependent modelling are investigated: using the ‘correct’ accent model, choosing a model using supervised (ACCDIST-based) accent identifi- cation (AID), and building a model using data from neighbouring speakers in ‘AID space’. All of the methods outperform the accentindependent model, with relative reductions in ASR error rate of up to 44 %.

Given {{a small amount of}} speech from a new speaker, is it better to apply speaker adaptation to the baseline, or to use accent <b>identification</b> (<b>AID)</b> to identify the speaker’s accent and select an accent-dependent acoustic model? Three accent-based model selection methods are inves- tigated: using the ‘true’ accent model, and unsupervised model selection using i-Vector and phonotactic-based AID. All three methods outperform the unadapted baseline. Most significantly, AID-based model selection using 43 s of speech performs bet- ter than unsupervised speaker adaptation, even if the latter uses five times more adaptation data. Combining unsupervised AID- based model selection and speaker adaptation gives an average relative reduction in ASR error rate of up to 47 %...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{differences}} are so subtle in a native accent <b>identification</b> (<b>AID)</b> task that a brute force frame-based Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fails {{to discover the}} tiny distinctions [1]. Apart from the frame-based framework, {{in this paper we}} propose a vector-based speaker modeling method, to which common support vector machine (SVM) kernels can be applied. The vector-based speaker model is composed of the concatenation of the average acoustic representations of all phonemes. SVM and GMM classifiers are compared on the speaker models. Moreover, based on the observation that accents only differ in a limited number of phonemes, a variable selection framework is indispensable to select accent relevant features. We investigate a forward selection method, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and a backward selection method, SVM- Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE). We find that the multiclass SVM-RFE achieves comparable performance with the ANOVA on optimally selected variable sets, while it obtains excellent performance with very few features in low dimensions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed speaker models together with the SVM classifier both in low dimensions and in high dimensions as well as the necessity of variable selection.

Other references must be used in most cases to determine the species at hand. Today, BugGuide. Net {{will be the next}} step for the average reader. Most of the book is devoted to one-page presentations of a small selection of families, usually those that contain species most likely to be found by the casual observer. Common name, group name, pronunciation guide, and characteristics are presented with a brief account of a selection of included insects, for which a generic or occasionally a specific name and two or more good illustrations are usually given. An introduction to insects, arachnids, and other arthropods, although essential, leaves only 154 pages for family presentations, and this is again reduced by a number of tables giving preferred habitat and feeding characteristics for common families of large orders like flies. No estimate is given for the number of insect species thought to occur in Texas, but the world figure given, 2 to 30 million, is suitably large and reflects the number yet to be discovered and described. Altogether but a tiny, tiny fraction of Texas insects is presented in this book.

Documents and updates produced after the workshop to incorporate issues raised and suggested improvements, • 3. 2006 update. A provisional update to taxonomy, with an <b>identification</b> <b>aid</b> in tabular form produced for a workshop in 2006. The identity of European cirratulids remains uncertain in many cases and all parts of this document remain provisional. The different parts show changes through the years and more are expected.

40|$|Abstract Background Commercial {{diagnostics}} {{are commonly}} used to identify gram-positive bacteria. Errors have been reported mostly at the species level. We have found certain phenotypic criteria used in API systems which significantly misidentify Leuconostoc, an emerging human pathogen, at the genus level. We also attempt to find practical, conventional phenotypic assays for accurate identification of this group of bacteria. Methods Clinical isolates of catalase-negative, gram-positive coccoid or coccobacillary bacteria with non-β hemolysis in our institute during 1997 – 2004 were subject to an <b>identification</b> <b>aid</b> by API 20 STREP, following the instruction manual, {{as an aid to}} conventional phenotypic tests. Those identified as Leuconostoc by API 20 STREP were re-examined by the same kit and also by API 50 CHL according to the instruction manuals, by our Leuconostoc conventional phenotypic assays, by Leuconostoc - and Lactobacillus -specific PCR's, and, where possible, by 16 S rDNA sequence analysis. In addition, catalase-negative gram-positive isolates during 2005 – 2006 which were resistant to vancomycin at high levels were also evaluated by the same phenotypic and genotypic assays. Results Out of several thousands of clinical gram-positive isolates, 26 catalase negative gram-positive isolates initially identified as Leuconostoc by API 20 STREP and 7 vancomycin-resistant gram-positive catalase-negative bacteria entered the study. 11 out of the 26 isolates and all the 7 isolates were identified as Leuconostoc by API 20 STREP. Only 5 isolates, however, were confirmed by both genotypic and all defined conventional phenotypic criteria. API 50 CHL also failed to reliably provide accurate identification of Leuconostoc. We have identified key problem tests in API 20 STREP leading to misidentification of the bacteria. A simple, conventional set of phenotypic tests for Leuconostoc identification is proposed. Conclusion The current API systems cannot accurately identify Leuconostoc. Identification of vancomycin-resistant, catalase-negative gram-positive bacteria should be performed by a few practical phenotypic assays, with assistance of genotypic assays where available. </p...|$|E
