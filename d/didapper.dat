6000|$|He {{would be}} a Reformer, a didactic writer. If we are to have nothing but [...] "Art for Art's sake," [...] that burly body of Harry Fielding's must even go to the wall. The first Beau <b>Didapper</b> of a critic that passes can shove him aside. He preaches like Thackeray; he writes [...] "with a purpose" [...] like Dickens--obsolete old authors. His cause is judged, and into Bridewell he goes, if l'Art pour l'Art is all the {{literary}} law and the prophets.|$|E
60|$|No man can conceive, till {{he comes}} to try it, how great a pain {{it is to be}} a public-spirited person. I am sure I am unable to express to the world, how much anxiety I have suffered, to see of how little benefit my Lucubrations have been to my fellow-subjects. Men will go on in their own way in spite of all my labour. I gave Mr. <b>Didapper</b> a private {{reprimand}} for wearing red-heeled shoes, and at the same time was so indulgent as to connive at him for fourteen days, because I would give him the wearing of them out; but after all this I am informed, he appeared yesterday with a new pair of the same sort. I have no better success with Mr. Whatdee'call[1] as to his buttons: Stentor[2] still roars; and box and dice rattle as loud as they did before I writ against them. Partridge[3] walks about at noon-day, and Aesculapius[4] thinks of adding a new lace to his livery. However, I must still go on in laying these enormities before men's eyes, and let them answer for going on in their practice.[5] My province is much larger than at first sight men would imagine, and I shall lose no part of my jurisdiction, which extends not only to futurity, but also is retrospect to things past; and the behaviour of persons who have long ago acted their parts, is as much liable to my examination, as that of my own contemporaries.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{literary}} critics, such as Martin C. Battestin, {{suggest that}} Pope's friend and fellow-satirist Henry Fielding intended {{the character of}} Beau <b>Didapper</b> in Joseph Andrews to be read as Hervey. Beau <b>Didapper</b> is described as obedient to the commands of a [...] "Great Man" [...] (presumably Walpole) [...] "which he implicitly submitted to, at the Expence of his Conscience, his Honour, and of his Country." [...] <b>Didapper</b> is also compared to Hylas, and is mistaken for {{a woman in the}} dark on account of his soft skin.|$|E
50|$|Lady Booby, in {{a last-ditch}} attempt to {{sabotage}} the marriage, brings a young beau named <b>Didapper</b> to Adamsâ€™ house to seduce Fanny. Fanny is unattracted to his bold attempts of courtship. <b>Didapper</b> {{is a little}} too bold in his approach and provokes Joseph into a fight. The Lady and the beau depart in disgust, but the pedlar, having seen the Lady, is compelled to relate a tale. The pedlar had met his wife while in the army, and she died young. While on her death bed, she confessed that she once stole an exquisitely beautiful baby girl from a family named Andrews, and sold her on to Sir Thomas Booby, thus raising the possibility that Fanny may in fact be Joseph's sister. The company is shocked, but there is general relief that the crime of incest may have been narrowly averted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{records of}} Bruno's {{imprisonment}} by the Venetian inquisition in May 1592 {{describe him as}} a man [...] "of average height, with a hazel-coloured beard and the appearance of being about forty years of age".Alternately, a passage in a work by George Abbot indicates that Bruno was of diminutive stature: [...] "When that Italian <b>Didapper,</b> who intituled himselfe Philotheus Iordanus Brunus Nolanus, magis elaboratae Theologiae Doctor, &c. with a name longer than his body...". The word [...] "didapper" [...] used by Abbot is the derisive term which at the time meant [...] "a small diving waterfowl".|$|E
