5|$|After {{travelling}} to Istanbul, Bond <b>heads</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city to {{meet with}} station head Ali Kerim Bey, tailed by Bulgarian secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate in order to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a limpet mine - but Kerim is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress. He and Bond then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilenku {{is responsible for the}} bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural gypsy settlement. However, Krilenku learns of this and promptly attacks a Gypsy feast (where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests) with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilenku down to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.|$|E
