Also we give the definitions of real and complex inner product spaces and study Hilbert spaces which are special type of normed space and complete inner product spaces in the sense of *-calculus. Furthermore, as an example of Hilbert spaces, first we introduce the non-Cartesian plane which is a nonlinear model for plane Euclidean geometry. Secondly, we give Euclidean, unitary, and sequence spaces via corresponding norms which are induced by an inner product. Finally, by using the *-norm properties of complex structures, we examine Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} in a decay of the form B_d or B_s-> P_ 1 P_ 2 gamma (where P_ 1 and P_ 2 are pseudoscalar mesons), through a flavor {{changing}} dipole transition, time dependent oscillations can reveal the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model. If P_ 1 and P_ 2 are CP eigenstates (e. g. as in B_d -> K_S pi 0 gamma), the oscillation is independent of the resonance structure. Thus data from resonances {{as well as from}} nonresonant decays can be included. This may significantly enhance the sensitivity to new physics of the method. If P_ 1 is a charged particle, and P_ 2 its anti-particle (e. g. as in B_d -> pi+ pi- gamma), one has the additional advantage that both the magnitude and the weak phase of any new physics contribution can be determined from a study of the angular distribution. These signals offer <b>excellent</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> detect new physics because they are suppressed in the Standard Model. We also show that the potential contamination of these signals originating from the Standard Model annihilation diagram gives rise to photons with, to a very good approximation, the same helicity as the dominant penguin graph and thus causes no serious difficulty.
