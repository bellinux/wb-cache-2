25|$|The {{per capita}} water use in Latin America varies greatly among countries, among {{cities in the}} same country, and between urban and rural areas, and {{obviously}} among those with a <b>house</b> <b>connection,</b> a public tap or no improved water source at all. The average net urban water use (i.e. excluding distribution losses) was estimated at about 240 liter/capita/day, a level that is about as high as in the United States and almost {{twice as high as}} in Central Europe. The highest water use can be found in some utilities in Chile and Argentina, where water resources are abundant and water use is almost 500 liter/capita/day. The lowest water use is in Aguas de Illimani serving La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, with less than 50 liter/capita/day. In rural areas water use is sometimes even lower than this level.|$|E
40|$|It {{remains unknown}} how lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> affect the {{performance}} of the sewer system, since the assessment of serviceability is mainly based {{on the state of the}} main sewer system. Further insight into the contribution of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> to the overall level of service provided can aid to target investments to parts of the system where it is most effective. To this end, techniques from the reliability theory were applied to a commercial sewer maintenance database to quantify the impact of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> on the serviceability of sewer systems. Analysis of the data showed that the failures follow a Poisson distribution. A comparison of the derived failure rate with values obtained from a different study revealed that the blockage rate of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> is an order of magnitude greater than the failure rate of the dominant mechanism of main sewer systems, thereby making the impact of lateral <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> on the serviceability of sewer systems substantial.

Tablas Island Electric Cooperatives (TIELCO) serves the power needs of Tablas Island including San Jose. It operates a 5.070 MW diesel power plant in Odiongan and 1.740 MW power barge in San Agustin. The electric cooperative serves a total of 21,097 <b>house</b> <b>connections.</b> Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel power plant and a 1.30 MW power barge.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of artificial neural networks application to the availability indicator prediction. The forecasted results indicate that artificial networks may be used to model the reliability level of the water supply systems. The network was trained using 147 and 173 operational data from one Polish medium-sized city (distribution pipes and <b>house</b> <b>connections,</b> respectively). 50 % of all data was chosen for learning, 25 % for testing and 25 % for validation. In prognosis phase, the best created network used 100 % of 114 and 133 values for testing. Following functions were used to activate neurons in hidden and output layers: linear, logistic, hyperbolic tangent, exponential. The learning of the artificial network was performed using following input parameters: material, total length, diameter. In the optimal models hyperbolic tangent was chosen to activate the hidden and output neurons in modeling the availability indicator of <b>house</b> <b>connections</b> during 68 epochs of training. Hidden and output neurons were activated (20 epochs of learning) respectively by hyperbolic tangent and linear function during the prediction of availability indicator of distribution pipes. The maximum relative errors in learning and prognosis step were equal to 0. 10 % and 1. 20 % as well as 0. 27 % and 1. 15 % for distribution pipes and <b>house</b> <b>connections,</b> respectively...|$|R
