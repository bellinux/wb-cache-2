25|$|Property {{inherited}} by an insolvent {{during his}} insolvency falls into his <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate,</b> notwithstanding a contrary {{provision in the}} testator’s will. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an insurance benefit of {{which he has been}} nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not vest in his estate. The reason is that the insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit until he has accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or insurance benefit, ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E
25|$|On sequestration, civil {{proceedings}} by or against an insolvent relating to property that {{falls into the}} <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate</b> are stayed until {{the appointment of a}} trustee. A further consequence of a sequestration order is that the execution on any judgment against the insolvent is stayed unless the court otherwise directs.|$|E
25|$|The debtor is {{divested}} of his estate, {{and may not}} burden it {{with any}} further debts. A creditor’s right to recover his claim in full by judicial proceedings is replaced by his right, on proving a claim against the <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate,</b> to share with all other proved creditors in the proceeds of the estate assets.|$|E

25|$|Whenever an {{insolvent}} {{has acquired}} possession of property which is {{claimed by the}} trustee, it is deemed {{to belong to the}} <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate,</b> unless the contrary is proved. If, however, a person who became a creditor of the insolvent after sequestration alleges that a particular asset does not belong to the estate, and claims a right to the asset, it is deemed not to belong to the estate unless the contrary is proved.|$|E
25|$|Sequestration of a {{joint estate}} makes both spouses “insolvent debtors” for the {{purposes}} of the Act, with the consequence that the property of both of them (comprising their shares in the joint estate, as well as separately-owned property) vests in the trustee and is available to meet the claims of creditors. Thus, property inherited by a spouse to a marriage in community of property forms part of the <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate,</b> even if the will contains a provision specifically excluding the property from any community of property.|$|E

25|$|A {{contract}} {{made by the}} insolvent {{without the}} trustee's consent, where such consent is necessary, is not void, but it is voidable at the instance of the trustee. This {{is subject to the}} qualification that, if an insolvent purports to alienate, for valuable consideration, and without the consent of the trustee of the <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate,</b> any property acquired after sequestration, or right to such property to a person who proves that he was not aware and had no reason to suspect that the estate of the insolvent was under sequestration, the alienation shall nevertheless be valid.|$|E
25|$|The debtor may {{not make}} a {{contract}} which purports to dispose of any property of his <b>insolvent</b> <b>estate.</b> Furthermore, he may not, without the written consent of the trustee, {{enter into a contract}} which adversely affects his estate or any contribution which he is obliged to make towards his estate. That contribution is what is claimable by the trustee in terms of section 23(5) from moneys earned by the insolvent {{in the course of his}} profession, occupation or employment. The contribution becomes due to the trustee only once the Master has expressed the opinion that the moneys in question are not necessary for the support of the insolvent and his dependents. It follows that, prior to the Master’s assessment of a contribution, the insolvent need not obtain the trustee’s consent to enter into the contract.|$|E
