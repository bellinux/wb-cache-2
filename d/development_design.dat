25|$|Basic <b>Development</b> <b>design.</b> The NA-123 {{design was}} {{presented}} by North American Aircraft to the USAAF in February 1944. The {{design for the}} new aircraft was for a long-range fighter to penetrate deep into enemy territory. Its immediate role would be to escort the B-29 Superfortress bombers used in the Pacific Theater of Operations against Japan. The USAAF endorsed it at once. A letter contract to construct and test four experimental XP-82 aircraft (P-82 designation) gave way in the same month to an order for 500 production models.|$|E

2500|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of the new custom streamliners, EMC {{invested}} in a new locomotive factory and started development work on the locomotives that it would produce. The new headquarters on 55th Street in McCook, Illinois, west of Chicago, remains the corporate headquarters. The 1935 EMC 1800 hp B-B boxcab <b>development</b> <b>design</b> locomotives featured the multiple-unit control systems that became the basis of cab/booster locomotive sets, and the twin 900hp Winton Diesel engine power unit format that would be adopted for the Budd-built Zephyr power units in 1936 and EMC's E series streamlined passenger locomotives that the new factory began producing in 1937. [...] Prior to their introduction of the E units EMC was in production of switch engines, which remained the mainstay of their production until Dieselization of freight and passenger service hit full stride in the mid-1940s.|$|E
2500|$|Systems {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary field {{of engineering and}} engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles. At its core systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. [...] Issues such as requirements engineering, , logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system <b>development,</b> <b>design,</b> implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, organizational studies and project management. [...] Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950s left EMD {{with only}} one serious competitor, the General Electric Company. Lima-Hamilton failed first, in 1951 merging with Baldwin to form Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. [...] Baldwin's own {{position}} was precarious, with their market share continuing to dwindle as they continued to offer what were essentially <b>development</b> <b>design</b> locomotives in the road Diesel market. [...] By the mid-1950s Baldwin was effectively {{shut out of the}} market but made one more attempt at steam turbine-electric power, resulting in one customer delivery, then left the locomotive business in 1956. Fairbanks-Morse, after partnering with General Electric, Westinghouse, then Canadian Locomotive Company to produce a series of locomotives that never established a solid reputation and sold poorly, left the locomotive field in 1963. [...] ALCO remained competitive while backed by the industrial might of General Electric, however, GE dissolved the partnership in the wake of ALCO's lackluster development of higher powered engines for mainline road locomotives. General Electric's new subsidiary GE Rail took over the ALCO-GE gas-turbine-electric venture in 1953. By 1956 GE was marketing its own Universal series Cooper-Bessemer powered Diesel-electrics as export locomotives. In 1959 the U25B was the first of GE's road locomotives powered by GE's [...] FDL-16 Diesel engine, which would seriously challenge EMD's position in the mainline locomotive market. [...] From the mid-1950s onward, ALCO's position slipped steadily until the company went out of business in 1969.|$|E
