The Court upheld a lower court decision denying them the license, finding that the District's marriage statute did not contemplate same-sex marriages despite being gender-neutral, that denying the license did not violate District law against <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>sex</b> or sexual orientation and that denying the license did not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.|$|E

2500|$|A {{three-judge panel}} of the Texas Fourteenth Court of Appeals heard the case on November 3, 1999. Their 2–1 {{decision}} issued on June 8, 2000, ruled the Texas law was unconstitutional. Justice John S. Anderson and Chief Justice Paul Murphy found that the law violated the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment to the Texas Constitution, which bars <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>sex,</b> race, color, creed, or national origin. J. Harvey Hudson dissented. The Court of Appeals decided to review the case en banc. On March 15, 2001, without hearing oral arguments, it reversed the three-judge panel's decision and upheld the law's constitutionality 7–2, denying both the substantive due process and equal protection arguments. Attorneys for Lawrence and Garner asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest appellate court in Texas for criminal matters, to review the case. After a year's delay, on April 17, 2002, that request was denied. Lambda Legal's Harlow called that decision [...] "a major abdication of judicial responsibility".

2500|$|On October 4, 2017, Sessions {{released}} a Department of Justice (DoJ) memo interpreting Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>sex,</b> stating that Title VII [...] "is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female," [...] but it [...] "does not prohibit {{discrimination based on}} gender identity per se." [...] The memo was written to withdraw an earlier DoJ memorandum issued by Eric Holder on December 15, 2014, which aligned the DoJ with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on interpreting Title VII to include gender identity or transgender status as a protected class. At that time, DoJ had already stopped opposing claims of discrimination brought by federal transgender employees. Devin O'Malley, representing the DoJ, stated [...] "the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle , which necessitated today's action." [...] Sharon McGowan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who previously served in the Civil Rights division of DoJ, rejected that argument, saying [...] "this memo [...] is not actually {{a reflection of the}} law as it is — it's a reflection of what the DOJ wishes the law were" [...] and [...] "he Justice Department is actually getting back in the business of making anti-transgender law in court." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{asserted}} {{that he was}} not joking; he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. Martha Griffiths, he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment. For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. He for decades had been close to the National Woman's Party and its leader Alice Paul, who was also the leader in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, the author of the first Equal Rights Amendment, and a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 {{trying to find a way}} to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment. Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws [...] "protecting" [...] women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs. The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Thus, as Justice William Rehnquist explained in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, [...] "The prohibition against <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>sex</b> was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives... the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Act's prohibition against discrimination based on 'sex.|$|E
2500|$|Barnes v. Train (1974) is {{commonly}} {{viewed as the}} first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term [...] "sexual harassment" [...] was not used. The term [...] "sexual harassment" [...] was coined and popularized by Lin Farley in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 Cornell University class she taught on women and work. In 1976, Williams v. Saxbe established sexual harassment {{as a form of}} sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Supreme Court first recognized [...] "sexual harassment" [...] as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer liability, and that speech or conduct in itself can create a [...] "hostile environment". The Civil Rights Act of 1991 added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive damages for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of Ellison v. Brady resulted in rejecting the reasonable person standard in favor of the [...] "reasonable woman standard" [...] which allowed for cases to be analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} complainant and not the defendant. Also in 1991, Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. became the first sexual harassment case to be given class action status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the [...] "discovery" [...] process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the litigation process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida, and Burlington v. Ellerth, that employers are liable for harassment by their employees. Moreover, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of [...] "sexual desire", stating that any <b>discrimination</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>sex</b> is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.|$|E
