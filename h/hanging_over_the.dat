5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech Hokies football team was {{whether or not}} star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|King Henry and King Stephen {{recognised}} Pain as {{the legitimate}} holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 88s arrived {{over the}} target at Kenley {{to find a}} smoke pall <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> target. It was {{impossible}} to begin dive-bombing attacks under those conditions. Given the amount of damage to Kenley, it also seemed unnecessary to the bomber crews. As they were deciding what action to take, they were attacked. The Bf 109s led by Hannes Trautloft had a difficult job of defending the Ju 88s. After passing Biggin Hill {{on their way to}} RAF West Malling British AAA fire began targeting the formation. One Ju 88 was hit, and Trautloft gave it special protection. As he manoeuvred himself into position, the formation was jumped by Spitfires and Hurricanes. One Ju 88 was lost to 32 Squadron's Pilot Officer Bolesław Własnowolski. As they attack began, the Ju 88s turned to West Malling, and began dive-bombing attacks as an alternate target.|$|E

5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> edge of the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers {{would not be able to}} support the vault's weight.|$|E

25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from davits supplied by the Welin Davit & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were slung from the davits, ready to be launched. The davits were of a highly efficient double-acting quadrant design, capable of being slung inboard (<b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> deck) as well as outboard (<b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The davits aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the davits. Each davit was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each davit to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken across the deck so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and davit. They had to be lowered by hand, ideally by a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|E

25|$|In fact, {{from the}} beginning, {{a sense of}} urgency gave the first Zionists the {{profound}} conviction that the task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was merely a matter of politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews {{at the beginning of the}} century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.|$|E
25|$|A statue {{was created}} for Logan Circle, Philadelphia in 1926, {{designed}} by Alexander Stirling Calder. It does not depict Shakespeare himself, but rather the figures of Touchstone the jester from As You Like It, representing comedy, and Hamlet, representing tragedy. Touchstone is lounging with his head tilted laughing, his feet <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of the tall stone pedestal and his left arm resting on Hamlet's legs. Hamlet is seated, brooding, his knife dangling over Touchstone's body. The opening lines of the famous All the world's a stage speech from As You Like It are inscribed on the pedestal beneath the figures.|$|E

25|$|The {{walls of}} the main lobby are cream-colored plaster, {{surrounded}} by eight pillars and cornices adorned with golden lotus blossoms and palm leaves. High up the walls, between each of the pillars, are six large golden plaster urns. The urns are decorated with lotus blossom buds and palm leaves as well. They are crowned by a gilded design incorporating outstretched falcon wings and the disc of the sun entwined with golden serpents. The lotus motif is repeated on the frosted wall sconces below the urns and on the chandelier <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> center of the double staircase; the staircase, {{at the end of}} the main lobby, leads to the mezzanine and balcony.|$|E

The devout Roman Catholic Johnny questions God and has lost any ability to feel true emotions, which has affected his relationship with his family. Christy believes she has been granted three wishes by her dead brother, which she only uses at times of near-dire consequences for the family as they try to survive in New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} usually {{deposited}} on {{the leaves of}} trees or shrubs <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> running water of mountain streams, creeks, and small rivers. One species leaves its eggs over stones close to waterfalls. The method of egg-laying on the leaf varies between species. The males usually call from leaves close to their egg clutches. These eggs are less vulnerable to predators than those laid within water, but {{are affected by the}} parasitic maggots of some fly species. As a result, some glass frogs show parental care. In many species, glass frog females brood their eggs during the night the eggs are fertilized, which improves the survival of the eggs, while in almost a third of species, glass frog males stay on guard for much longer periods.After they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the waters below. The tadpoles are elongated, with powerful tails and low fins, suited for fast-flowing water. Outside of the breeding season, some species live in the canopy.|$|E

25|$|Although Kent {{intended}} the First Lord {{to use this}} space as his study, it has rarely served that purpose; it has almost always been the Cabinet room. There {{have been a few}} exceptions. Stanley Baldwin used the Cabinet Room as his office. A few Prime Ministers, such as Tony Blair, occasionally worked at the Cabinet Room table. Painted off-white with large floor to ceiling windows along one of the long walls, the room is light and airy. Three brass chandeliers hang from the high ceiling. The Cabinet table, purchased during the Gladstone era, dominates the room. The modern boat-shaped top, introduced by Harold Macmillan in the late 1950s, is supported by huge original oak legs. The table is surrounded by carved, solid mahogany chairs that also date from the Gladstone era. The Prime Minister's chair, the only one with arms, is situated midway along one side in front of the marble fireplace, facing the windows; when not in use, it is positioned at an angle for easy access. The only picture in the room is a copy of a portrait of Sir Robert Walpole by Jean-Baptiste van Loo <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fireplace. Each Cabinet member is allocated a chair based on order of seniority. Blotters inscribed with their titles mark their places.|$|E
500|$|The writer Simon Winder {{believes}} that because Fleming {{was writing about}} Jamaica, the result was [...] "perhaps the most attractive of all the Bond books—the most relaxed, the most fiendish, the most confident". According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, Fleming knew his outdated view of Jamaica would soon be overtaken by events—as evidenced by the novel's description of how the Queen's Club would be lost during independence struggles. According to the cultural historian Michael Denning, this acknowledgement of the end-of-empire leads to a [...] "sense of doom" [...] that {{is the result of}} [...] "a shadow of real history <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stories".|$|E
500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45.

The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{trend of}} wearing whale tail-revealing jeans started to {{dissipate}} somewhat {{in the mid}} 2000s when American clothing designers started shifting focus from low-slung jeans and exposed midriffs to high-waisted trousers and cardigans. Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion writer of The Guardian, claimed that the whale tail and the muffin top (the bulge of flesh <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of low-rider jeans), [...] "twin crimes of modern fashion", had led to {{the decline in the}} popularity of hipster jeans. She quoted Louise Hunn, editor of the British edition of InStyle, as saying — [...] "When a look goes too mainstream, people start wearing it badly. And then the really fashionable people run a mile". While the thong still represented 24% of the US$2.5 billion annual market in women's underwear, it stopped growing by end of 2004. By 2007, thongs were overtaken by boyshorts and accounted for only 12% of the panties market. Some vendors, including Victoria's Secret and DKNY, started selling thongs that do not result in whale tails. Adam Lippes, founder of the lingerie line ADAM, said, [...] "Women got tired of it. And they got sick and tired of seeing string hanging out of the top of every celebrity's jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{boulders}} {{were transported}} over [...] {{from the source}} of the stone. The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown, especially since the Olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels, and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible. Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the waterborne transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical. Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes. A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block, with their legs <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side. These sculptures may well depict Olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments. When transport over land was necessary, the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways, ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads. The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country. The construction of temporary causeways using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau. Earth structures such as mounds, platforms and causeways upon the plateau demonstrate that the Olmec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large-scale earthworks.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees, meaning {{it does not}} have a true {{vertical}} drop. [...] The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension, then levels out, slowly travelling around a curve on a unique chain system, seen only on Oblivion, as the cars approach the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds, giving the rider {{a clear view of the}} long drop, before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel. This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through. Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes, slowing down, and then pulls around back to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. A pre-recorded and disembodied voice saying 'don't look down' was played just before release. In 2004, this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and instead the words [...] "Don't look down" [...] have been painted on the floor of the guest observation area where the ride enters the ground. The words are clearly visible to riders when the train is <b>hanging</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> edge of the drop.|$|E
