40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the <b>following</b> people: <b>My</b> Supervisor, Steve Blackburn, for {{providing}} me with a great project, <b>following</b> <b>my</b> progress with <b>interest</b> and enthusiasm, and being such a tremendous source of knowledge and ideas. Daniel Frampton and Luke Quinane, who inspired me to do this project in the first place, and who this year have gone through the same ordeal of having to constantly clarify to people that “garbage collection ” has nothing to do with pushing bins around. Lunchtime regulars and fellow garbage collectors Robin Garner, Fahad Gilani, Andrew Gray, and John Zigman. You provided not only food, but food for thought. I hope all of your own projects I’ve heard so much about over the year are great successes. Richard Walker, for his guidance, support, and high expectations of me. Peter Strazdins, for reading a late draft of my thesis on short notice. The inventor of coffee...|$|R

I am thankful to Prof. Philips for his many suggestions and positive criticism during my research. Prof. Acheroy gave me a great encouragement and the opportunity to take part in many international conferences. I am grateful to Prof. Ignace Lemahieu for expressing <b>interest</b> in <b>my</b> work and for giving me support through all these years of my research. I also thank to all my TELIN colleagues and ex-colleagues for a friendly atmosphere which makes work pleasant. Annette Nevejans and Alice Verheylesonne gave me often precious administrative help. Here I also want to mention the MEDISIP group and especially the TELIN-MEDISIP meetings which inspire research through constructive discussions. I am grateful to my parents for their trust, support and love. Finally, I thank my husband Veselin and my daughter Marija for their patience and support that I could always count on...|$|R
6000|$|After all, {{those other}} fellows who took high {{places in the}} College {{examinations}} and were the professor's model boys haven't done so amazingly. Some are professors themselves, some technical experts; not one can show things done such as I, <b>following</b> <b>my</b> own <b>interest,</b> have achieved. For I have built boats that smack across the water like whiplashes; no one ever dreamt of such boats until I built them; and I have surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries, in the unexpected hiding-places of Nature. I have come nearer flying than any man has done. Could I have done as much if I had had a turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who proposed to train my mind? If I had been trained in research--that ridiculous contradiction in terms--should I have done more than produce additions to the existing store of little papers with blunted conclusions, {{of which there are}} already too many? I see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter. Even by the standards of worldly success I am, by the side of my fellow-students, no failure. I had my F.R.S. by the time I was thirty-seven, and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as far from me as the Spanish Inquisition. Suppose I had stamped down on the head of my wandering curiosity, locked my imagination in a box just when it wanted to grow out to things, worked by so-and-so's excellent method and so-and-so's indications, where should I be now? ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the course}} of my {{undergraduate}} studies in Molecular and Cellular Biology and the experiences <b>following</b> <b>my</b> graduation, I became increasingly interested in research that can directly improve patient care. My research experiences in the U. S. include studying cytochrome P 450 enzymes in Nanodiscs at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and examining immune evasion by acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Beyond work in the laboratory, I also participated in a year-long project to implement a water delivery system in Honduras, leading to <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> in infectious disease research. <b>My</b> <b>interest</b> in this field grew after learning about phage therapy, a way of treating antibiotic-resistant infections, during an honors virology seminar. Only a few research groups are dedicated to studying phage therapy, which includes the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy (IIET) in Poland. I was fortunate enough to receive a U. S. Fulbright research grant to study the immune response to phage therapy under the mentorship of Prof. hab. n. med. Andrzej Górski at the IIET. In this article, I will discuss my involvement at U. S. and European institutions, the insights I have gained, and how other students can similarly get involved in research...|$|R

40|$|Heavy quarkonia {{production}} {{is expected to}} be sensitive to the formation of a quark gluon plasma (QGP). It was (and still is with ongoing data analyses) extensively studied at the CERN SPS, at collision energy √ sNN of the order of 20 GeV. An anomalous suppression was clearly observed. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has presented preliminary results that exhibit a similar amount of J/ψ suppression, at ten times higher collision energy. I review the results obtained at both facilities. While interpreting and comparing them, the importance of understanding normal nuclear effects is emphasized. A new method to derive a reference for Au+Au collisions from the centrality dependence of d+Au measurements at RHIC is exposed. Key words: PACS: 1 Nuclear effects from p+A or d+A collisions When trying to interpret all the quarkonia yields observed in p+A collisions at various energies and kinematical domains, we find ourselves facing a real puzzle [1]. Various effects are invoked, including normal nuclear absorption of quarkonia or pre-resonant cc pairs, parton shadowing and corresponding antishadowing, contribution from the intrinsic charm existing in the nucleon wave function, or energy loss and related transverse momentum broadening, all of them being further complicated by the feed-downs from higher mass states. Explaining all the available p+A data is beyond the scope of this article. In the <b>following,</b> I restrict <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> for p+A data and nuclear effects to the energies and kinematical domains where A+A collisions are also measured, in order to set up references for QGP studies...|$|R

40|$|As a young boy, I became {{mesmerized by}} medieval European castles, fabulous armor suites, ancient arms, noble knights, {{powerful}} lords, glamorous ladies and wealthy kings that I {{read about in}} numerous literary works.
