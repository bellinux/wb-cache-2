The loads were fixed as 20 per cent, 40 per cent, 60 per cent, 80 per cent, and 100 per cent. In dual-fuel operation with <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> induction, the thermal efficiency of JO was increased mainly at high power outputs. Maximum thermal efficiency with JO was found as 29 per cent at 31 per cent of <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> induction at 100 per cent load. Smoke was reduced significantly with all <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> induction rates at all power outputs in dual-fuel operation with JO. It was reduced from 4. 4 to 3. 3 BSU (Bosch Smoke Units) with JO at the maximum efficiency point at 100 per cent load.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} three common gutta-percha solvents’ effectiveness in dissolving three different types of root canal sealers. Materials and Methods: The solubility of three different root canal sealers (AH Plus, Apexit Plus and Endoflas FS) was assessed in xylene, refined <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> tetrachloroethylene and <b>distilled</b> water (control). One-hundred twenty samples of root canal sealers were prepared and then divided into three equal groups (n= 40). Each group was further divided into four equal subgroups (n= 10) for immersion in the respective solvents for a 10 minute immersion period. The mean amount of weight loss was determined for each material in each solvent during the specified immersion period, and the values were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Xylene exhibited the greatest dissolving efficacy for AH Plus, followed by refined <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> and tetrachloroethylene. Xylene was also able to dissolve {{the greatest amount of}} Apexit Plus, followed by refined <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> and tetrachloroethylene which were equally effective in dissolving Apexit Plus. For Endoflas FS, maximum dissolving efficacy was seen with tetrachloroethylene followed by refined <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> and xylene. Conclusion: The results showed that xylene, refined <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> and tetrachloroethylene can be used for the removal of AH Plus, Apexit plus and Endoflas FS sealers during endodontic retreatment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of five different solvents: xylol, eucalyptol, halothane, chloroform and <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> on softening gutta-percha in simulated root canals.

40|$|Female Mediterranean {{fruit flies}} (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) {{perceive}} both {{qualitative and quantitative}} aspects of citrus fruit chemistry. However, the behavioural and biological adjustments of this response remain largely unknown. In the present study, the ovipositional responses of gravid female medflies to essential oils (i. e. the most critical resistance factor to medfly infestation) of various citrus fruits are investigated. In dual-choice (treatment versus distilled water control) experiments, females lay significantly more eggs into pre-punctured hollow oviposition hemispheres (domes) provided with 1 mu L of citrus peel <b>oil</b> from sweet <b>orange,</b> satsuma mandarin, bitter orange, grapefruit and lemon compared with odourless domes. No-choice tests show a weak effect of lemon essential oils in stimulating oviposition. The female ovipositional response to sweet <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> (the most active in eliciting oviposition) is dose-dependent. Additionally, limonene, the most abundant chemical in all citrus oils, stimulates oviposition, whereas linalool, a representative compound of immature citrus fruit associated with high toxicity against immature stages of fruit flies, has a significant deterrent effect. In further no-choice tests, females lay approximately 23 % fewer eggs in limonene (93 %) (amount found in <b>orange</b> <b>oil)</b> and 60 % fewer eggs in limonene 93 % plus linalool 3 % (approximately 10 -fold the amount found in <b>orange</b> <b>oil)</b> mixtures, relative to sweet <b>orange</b> <b>oil.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} limonene content accounts largely (but not completely) for the ovipositional responses observed in sweet <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas high linalool proportions are capable of significantly masking and/or disrupting its stimulatory effects in citrus oils. The importance and practical implications of these findings with respect to understanding how citrus fruit chemistry influences the ovipositional responses of medfly is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{comparative}} evaluation of the effectiveness of <b>orange</b> <b>oil,</b> turpentine oil, and chloroform in dissolving gutta-percha and GuttaFlow discs. Materials and Method: Forty-five discs (10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness) made from GuttaFlow and gutta-percha were prepared. After weighing the initial mass by using an analytical balance, specimens were randomly divided into 3 groups (n= 15) according to solvent type. GuttaFlow and gutta-percha specimens were immersed in solvents for 10 min and then reweighed. The difference between the final and initial weights of specimens was considered the mass dissolved by solvents. Two-way ANOVA test with Bonferronni correction and Tukey test were used for the statistical analyses. Results: Chloroform dissolved significantly more gutta-percha (p= 0. 000) and GuttaFlow (p= 0. 000) than <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> or turpentine. There was no statistically significant difference between the effectiveness of <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> and turpentine oil in dissolving both gutta-percha (p= 0. 985) and GuttaFlow (p= 0. 713). Conventional gutta-percha discs dissolved in the solvents more than GuttaFlow discs did (p= 0. 000). Conclusion: Chloroform was more effective in dissolving conventional gutta-percha and GuttaFlow discs compared to <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> and turpentine. Conventional gutta-percha dissolved more than GuttaFlow did in the tested solvents.

40|$|Background: Limonene, a major {{component}} in citrus oil, has demonstrated anti-cancer effects in preclinical mammary cancer models. However, the effective oral dose translates to a human dose {{that may not be}} feasible for chronic dosing. We proposed to evaluate topical application of limonene to the breast as an alternative dosing strategy. Materials and Methods: We conducted a mouse disposition study to determine whether limonene would be bioavailable in the mammary tissue after topical application. SKH- 1 mice received topical or oral administration of limonene in the form of <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> every day for 4 weeks. Plasma and mammary pads were collected 4 hrs after the final dosing. We also conducted an exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of topically applied limonene in the form of <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> to the breast. Healthy women were recruited to apply <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> containing massage oil to their breasts daily for four weeks. Safety and feasibility were assessed by reported adverse events, clinical labs, and usage compliance. Pre and post-intervention nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and plasma were collected for limonene concentration determination. Results: The mouse disposition study showed that topical and oral <b>orange</b> <b>oil</b> administration resulted in similar mammary tissue disposition of limonene with no clinical signs of toxicity. In the clinical study, the topical application of limonene containing massage oil to the breast was found to be safe with high levels of usage compliance for daily application, although NAF and plasma limonene concentrations were not significantly changed after the massage oil application.
