Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the <b>grass</b> <b>grub</b> Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} insects, <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> {{fall prey to}} almost all bird species present in the same areas, some {{examples}} of avian predators are; Larus marinus, Great black backed gull, especially when the areas inhabited by <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub,</b> undergo cultivation, Starlings Sturnus vulgaris and Black Birds Turdus merula seem to favour <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> larvae in their third instar phase, {{as well as the}} adult beetle, and are often seen actively digging through the soil in areas with a high <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> population. Another common predator of the <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> is the Hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus whose intake of <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> can be up to 40% of the total diet of an adult hedgehog.

In November 2012 researchers in New Zealand discovered an unknown maggot preying on <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> larvae, 35-50% of the grubs in the near bye area were parasitized, DNA samples from these maggots were not matched to any known species so a sample was collected and allowed to pupate and eventually hatch where they were finally identified as Ostenia robusta.|$|E

25|$|The pupae {{start off}} the same creamy white colour as the larvae, but slowly {{turn to a}} dark brown during pupation. They have a soft body and are {{generally}} shorter and thicker than the <b>grass</b> <b>grub</b> larvae, they grow to between 10–30mm in length. The pupae have a thin translucent skin called the epidermal layer, through which the developing wings and legs can be seen.|$|E
25|$|On {{hatching}} larvae have a whitish/grey C-shaped segmented body, with {{a darker}} coloured head and dark brown jaws (mandibles). The larvae have {{three pairs of}} legs (true legs) attached to {{the underside of the}} segment behind the head, called the thorax. The length of the larvae ranges from 5mm, when newly hatched, to 25mm at larval maturity. Newly hatched larvae weigh 2–3mg and grow up to 200mg. The most obvious characteristic of larva is that the abdomen is very swollen and looks a lot bigger than any other part of body. There are many thin fine hairs along both sides of the body, especially around the abdomen. Occasionally <b>grass</b> <b>grub</b> larvae can be found that are purple/yellow or green in colour, these are diseased.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand <b>grass</b> <b>grub</b> has {{an annual}} life cycle, taking {{typically}} one year under normal climatic conditions but {{can take up}} to two years in adverse weather such as drought or significant cold periods (this also includes periods where the soil moisture is very high), or due to a food shortage. Over that one-year period the adult beetles live for 4–6 weeks emerging in spring (October – December) when the air temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius, and undertake two main flights, the first flight is to mate and the second and consecutive are to feed and lay clutches of eggs. Females are the last to emerge from the soil, this leads to localized infestations due to them being unable to reach a significant distance before being mated. Egg cluster size can range from 5-80 eggs and range from 80–250mm {{below the surface of the}} soil. Females can lay two to three clusters over a two to three week period. Costelytra zealandica larvae hatch between November and March (depending on the time they were laid). They start to feed on roots of clover and pasture plants from the time they hatch until September. They undergo three stages called instars before pupation.|$|E

2500|$|Because <b>grass</b> <b>grub</b> {{build up}} large colonies in the soil, disease can spread quickly and be devastating to the population, {{the most common}} disease of the New Zealand <b>Grass</b> <b>Grub</b> is Amber Disease.

The conjugation of 1 -naphthol, one of the primary metabolites of carbaryl, was examined in greater detail in flies and <b>grass</b> <b>grubs.</b> Isotope dilution and paper chromatographic analyses of extracts of insects dosed with [14 C] 1 -naphthol revealed the presence of the phosphomonoester, sulphate, and glucoside conjugate of 1 -naphthol, but phosphodiester and glucosiduronic acid conjugates could not be detected. A new metabolite of 1 -naphthol was present in extracts of dosed flies. This new metabolite, and also the corresponding p-nitrophenol metabolite, was isolated form extracts of flies fed with the parent phenols and characterised as a new conjugate, the Beta-D-glucoside 6 -(dihydrogen phosphate).

40|$|Appendix B - missing pages 328 - 333 (yet to be scanned and inserted). During the 1860 s and 1870 s {{the early}} {{settlers}} in New Zealand experienced insect plagues, especially armies of caterpillars, which created havoc amongst their crops (Drummond, 1907). Although some native birds {{were regarded as}} insectivorous, the clearance of native bush and settlement of land had restricted the distribution of these birds and the numbers remaining in crop areas were considered insufficient to control the insect numbers. Attention therefore turned to know insectivorous birds from other countries. Acclimatisation societies were formed and various birds were imported. Australian magpies (Gymnorhina spp.) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced during this period {{in the hope that}} they would help control the insect pests. Now, approximately 100 years later, both these birds are strongly associated with pastoral farming and are still commonly regarded as beneficial in keeping down insect numbers. However, with the restricted use of DDT insecticides for pasture pest control in recent years, the development of DDT resistant populations of <b>grass</b> <b>grubs</b> (Costelytra zealandica) and the resulting resurgence of <b>grass</b> <b>grubs</b> and porina (Wiseana spp.) as pests in certain areas, {{there is a need to}} evaluate the actual roles birds play in agriculture and especially as biologically controlling agents of insects. Very few detailed studies covering most aspects of the ecology of introduced birds have been carried out in New Zealand. Marples (1942) is the only worker so far to have made a systematic study on the food of an introduced bird. The objective of this thesis was to study the biology of magpies in New Zealand. The most important aspect of this was an investigation of the food to ascertain what magpies actually eat and to discover if any of these items were of any agricultural interest. Other aspects studied included possible interbreeding between the two, Gymnorhina hypoleuca Gould and G. Tibicen Latham, present in New Zealand and consequently their taxonomic classification: distribution of both species; taxonomic measurements and identification of sex and age classes; breeding biology; territorial behaviour and mortality factors. A subsidiary objective was to review and if possible obtain fresh evidence on the aggressive behaviour shown by magpies towards other birds and mammals (including man) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now clear}} that day length is the mast {{important}} of the environmental factors that regulate the voltinism of arthropods. <b>Grass</b> <b>grubs,</b> the larval stages of Costelytra zealandica (White), are one of a large group of insects that cannot receive the direct effect of this stimulus because they live below the soil surface. Some soil insects have no defined rhythm. The length of their life cycle is de~endent on the soil temDerature. However. the C. zealandica beetles. in a given population, characteristically emerge for their short-lived mating and dispersal flight over a period of a week or so. This indicates a degree of co-ordination within a population. Wightman (1974) has shown that 3 rd instar larvae can be induced to pupate by chilling them at 5 OC for about 6 weeks and then warming them at 15 OC. It was also apparent that larvae lvould not pupate unless they reached a state of development that has not yet been defined, even though they had been chilled. This is sufficient information to explain why larvae that have been retarded by starvation, drought, or low soil temperatures enter a 2 nd year of growth.
