500|$|I {{wrote it}} two years ago, which is funny because {{everybody}} is like [...] "God, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> current," [...] {{and some people}} that I work with were like [...] "You should just say you wrote {{it a couple of}} weeks ago." [...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." [...] I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and recording Teenage Dream, [...] it didn't feel right on the record. I would've had to take out one of my other songs that [...] a nice, complete package.|$|E
500|$|Originally, [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] {{was planned}} to be {{released}} as the third single from The Fame Monster, as a preference of Gaga's record label. The singer's own choice, [...] "Alejandro", initially saw poor reception in terms of radio play, thereby was not seen as a viable choice for a single. A quarrel then arose between Gaga and her label where [...] "Alejandro" [...] was ultimately chosen to be released. Through her account on Twitter, the singer remarked on the decision, [...] "Alejandro is on the radio. Fuck <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> good, we did it little monsters." [...] The single was officially sent to radio on April 20, 2010 in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} laughed {{in spite of}} herself. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> like an echo of Miss Cornelia.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> like Ann that {{it quite}} {{put him at}} his ease. He {{followed}} the small servant up the stairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> odd {{and mean}} {{for such a}} being! But it was his {{decision}}, and we said nothing; his decision was sufficient.|$|R
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS. Don't {{you wish}} she wouldn't {{advertise}} it as human hair? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> pokerish--like human flesh, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my lord, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> likely," [...] {{answered}} Wentworth, [...] "that... that... I marvel we did {{not provide}} against such a contingency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Howard Spence, President of the Orange Trust Company!" [...] he recited. [...] "I suppose no {{man is a}} hero to his wife. Does <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>so</b> incredible?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> like {{a menace}} that, {{with a full}} divination at last, the poor girl fell weakly into a chair. [...] "What on earth have you done?" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the rider}} was thus borne away, another sepulchral laugh broke the silence, {{but this time}} <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> close to the horseman's ear that he involuntarily looked round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed {{he would}} not; {{he would like}} it. He has told me so. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> cold to him to be called Mr. Belton by his relations." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ida. Yes, but I do {{not like}} the name; methinks [...] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> cold, as if you thought upon [...] Our pedigree, and only weighed our blood.|$|E
60|$|I put in {{a little}} Greek now and then, partly because <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> much like the ocean,--though I doubt if Homer's Mediterranean Sea ever sounded so loud as this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} be {{one of a dozen}} or two." [...] And as she {{answered}} him, she dropped her tone of raillery, and spoke in a low, soft, sweet voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> sweet on Bertram's ear.|$|R
6000|$|Grace shivered as she answered: [...] "I {{have never}} heard it before, and <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> unearthly--almost like a warning of some evil. But it is growing late, and you have far to go. I shall expect you at the crossing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Heyst went on. [...] "He {{seemed to}} try to warn me. That must have been it Did he imagine I had {{forgotten}} your existence? The only word he said was 'two'. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so,</b> at least. Yes, 'two'--and that he didn't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only if {{you would}} have waited till summer we would have had such a nice party on the lawn. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> ugly, being married from lodgings; doesn't it, mamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am his darling. Only <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> {{conceited}} in any girl to say so. Why {{should he}} {{care so much}} about me?--or why should you, for the matter of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'll write, but for pity's sake, Ned, don't call me Kitty. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> childish. Well, bye-bye, dear boy. I'll {{be back in}} {{two months}} and then we'll have a lovely time." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were [...] "Jack" [...] and [...] "Elsie" [...] to me, {{to their}} faces, before three days were out; and I was plain [...] "Una" [...] to them: <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> sweet and sisterly. Elsie slipped {{it out the}} second morning as {{naturally}} as could be.|$|R
6000|$|At {{these words}} Alonzo {{burst into a}} shout of laughter; but <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> harsh and loud that Julia shrank away shuddering. It seemed {{as if he could}} not stop himself, and the more he laughed the paler the poor girl became, murmuring to herself as she watched him: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{took them}} aback at first. There {{were people who}} did this sort of thing. People of no class, who called {{themselves}} names and took up things. But for people of social standing to talk about serious subjects--except, perhaps, in bed to one's wife! <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> un-English.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is,' said Sir Red, 'the most {{beautiful}} coverlet that any mortal ever heard tell of. It {{also has the}} property that, when anyone touches it, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> {{that it can be}} heard over eight kingdoms.' ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they told}} me the tale I was filled with sympathy. Now I wish that I had soft-soap and tried the {{experiment}} on some lonely little beast far away in the woods. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> probable and so human.|$|E
6000|$|Saying this Hockins put {{the tiny}} {{instrument}} to his lips, and drew from <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> sweet, so soft, so melodious and tuneful, that his companions seemed {{to listen in}} a trance of delight, with eyes {{as well as with}} ears! ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the end the}} {{brothers}} {{told him about the}} coverlet which, when one touched <b>it,</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> that <b>it</b> could be heard over eight kingdoms. Esben thought that this was the worst errand that he had had yet, but he could not do worse than fail, and so he would make the attempt.|$|R
60|$|LIZA. Oh, I don't mind; only <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> genteel. I {{should just}} {{like to take a}} taxi to the corner of Tottenham Court Road and get out there and tell it to wait for me, just to put the girls in their place a bit. I wouldn't speak to them, you know.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusics Brian Mansfield {{compared}} the album to [...] "an aural {{trip to the}} candy shop. The arrangements, especially on [...] "Turn the World" [...] and [...] "Quiver," [...] sound {{like some sort of}} electro-pop Christmas album. These pop confectioners have always used sweetness and innocence in their recipe, but never has <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> sugary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane, I ever {{like your}} tone of voice: it still renews hope, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget {{that you have}} formed a new tie. But I am not a fool--go--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. That {{was what}} I {{wanted to tell}} you when I 'phoned to you to come down today. By the way, I can't realize that we really have {{telephones}} in Avonlea now. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> preposterously up-to-date and modernish for this darling, leisurely old place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to call the {{southernwood}} 'appleringie' after this. Beverley says that is what they call it in Scotland, and I think <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>so</b> much more poetical than southernwood. Felicity says the right name is 'Boy's Love,' but I think that sounds silly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} would, my dear. And I told Mr. Goodall I {{wished he could}} make it ten, as it would make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>so</b> much more regular like; but he said he couldn't do it because the gas has gone up so much. He could have done it if I had sixty pounds, but of course I hadn't." ...|$|R
60|$|Cattiwow {{came down}} the steep lane with his five-horse timber-tug. He stopped by the wood-lump at the back gate {{to take off the}} brakes. His real name was Brabon, but the first time the {{children}} met him, years and years ago, he told them he was 'carting wood,' and <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> exactly like 'cattiwow' that they never called him anything else.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>so</b> simple: give {{state-owned}} {{assets to}} the people. After all, what better {{foundation for a}} property-owning democracy than a campaign of privatisation encompassing housing? An economic theory says that markets can't function without mortgages, because it's only by borrowing against their assets that entrepreneurs can get their businesses off the ground. But what if mortgages are bundled together and sold off to the highest bidder? ...|$|R
