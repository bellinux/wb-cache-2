50|$|<b>Gantacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> (formerly {{recognized}} as GW280430A and as AV430A) {{is a new}} experimental neuromuscular blocking drug or skeletal muscle relaxant {{in the category of}} non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs, used adjunctively in surgical anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.Gantacurium is not yet available for widespread clinical use: it is currently undergoing Phase III clinical development.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gantacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> is not {{associated}} with histamine release when administered as a rapid bolus (<5 seconds administration time) at doses {{up to and including}} 0.45 mg/kg (â‰¤2.5xED95) according to one small study in healthy human volunteers. At 0.54 mg/kg (just under 3xED95 dose), one of four volunteers experienced histamine release with associated hypotension (30% maximum decrease in blood pressure and 13% maximum increase in heart rate) but no cutaneous flushing. At the highest administered dose of 0.72 mg/kg, three of four volunteers experienced histamine release with associated hypotension (17% to 34% maximum decrease in blood pressure and 16% to 25% increase in heart rate) and cutaneous flushing. These effects were transient and lasted no more than two minutes and did not require any adjunctive treatment to address the changes in blood pressure or heart rate.|$|E
50|$|In early 1998, {{shortly after}} {{conducting}} the first clinical study, GlaxoWellcome Inc. undertook a strategic decision to outlicense its US anesthesia research portfolio and franchise. Further clinical development of GW280430A therefore ceased until the portfolio was licensed in May 2002 to a now-defunct start-up company called Avera Pharmaceuticals (San Diego). Meanwhile, {{in the intervening}} period, scientists at the former GlaxoWellcome Inc. had conducted further research and developed a proprietary buffer excipient formulation intended to mitigate the mast cell degranulation seen upon rapid intravenous administration of high concentration doses of agents such as GW280430A that are intrinsically cationic. In 2003, a newly reformulated version of GW280430A (now renamed AV430A, and subsequently renamed again to the generic <b>gantacurium</b> <b>chloride</b> in 2004), using the licensed buffer excipient from GlaxoSmithKline, was re-investigated in a second clinical study in healthy US volunteers to compare the improvement in safety margin versus that with the original formulation. Success with the reformulated gantancurium in healthy volunteers led to initiation and conduct of a randomized, controlled, phase II multicenter European study investigating its utility for endotracheal intubation in 230 patients undergoing surgical anesthesia. The phase II study was completed successfully by Spring 2006: >90% of patients administered with gantacurium were assessed to have acceptable tracheal intubation within 60 seconds of its injection. However, a peer-reviewed full publication of these data from this European study {{has yet to be}} published, despite early presentation of these data as abstracts.|$|E
