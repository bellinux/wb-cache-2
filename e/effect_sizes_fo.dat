If this information was not present, we estimated <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> from the exact p values, or the test statistics, given likelihood ratios or correlations. For the computation, we used the online <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> calculator provided by Wilson (2013).

Because the standardized mean difference <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> suffers from a slight upward bias when based on small samples (N <  20), we calculated unbiased <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> on the basis of Lipsey and Wilson’s (2001) work. After adjusting the <b>effect</b> <b>sizes,</b> we analyzed the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> mean and its distribution. The integration of the standardized mean differences uses inverse variance weights to account for varying sample sizes in studies. We provide all data and values in the Web Appendix.|$|R

This study investigated the agreement between evaluation methods (i. e., visual analysis, no assumptions <b>effect</b> <b>size,</b> percentage of nonoverlapping data, nonoverlap of all pairs) used in BEA. Overall, the measures of <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> resulted in {{a higher percentage of}} positive agreement with other measures of <b>effect</b> <b>size,</b> in comparison to visual analysis paired with <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> measures. Use of <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> measures also resulted in less equivalency between intervention outcomes within a BEA. These data suggest that using a measure of <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> can be a beneficial component to visual analysis; however, each measure of <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> has its own strengths and limitations and should be used cautiously when interpreting results of a BEA...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> {{related to}} the common {{language}} <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> is the rank-biserial correlation. This measure was introduced by Cureton as an <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> for the Mann-Whitney U test. That is, there are two groups, and scores for the groups have been converted to ranks. The Kerby simple difference formula [...] computes the rank-biserial correlation from the common language <b>effect</b> <b>size.</b> Letting f be the proportion of pairs favorable to the hypothesis (the common language <b>effect</b> <b>size),</b> and letting u be the proportion of pairs not favorable, the rank-biserial r is the simple {{difference between the two}} proportions: r = f − u. In other words, the correlation is the difference between the common language <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> and its complement. For example, if the common language <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> is 60%, then the rank-biserial r equals 60% minus 40%, or r = 0.20. The Kerby formula is directional, with positive values indicating that the results support the hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Although {{researchers}} {{are becoming more}} aware of the benefits of reporting <b>effect</b> <b>sizes,</b> the usefulness of <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> can be enhanced if researchers have a firm under-standing of how to interpret the various <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> that are available. This article ar-ticulates and illustrates the interpretation of 3 pairs of <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> developed for use in contrast analysis (Rosenthal, Rosnow, & Rubin, 2000). Three ways of conceptualiz-ing the <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> are discussed: (a) as correlations between predicted and observed data, (b) as proportion of variance accounted for, and (c) as parallel to a multiple re-gression approach. It is hoped that this interpretive aid helps increase the frequency with which <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> are reported and the effectiveness with which they are used. contrast analysis, <b>effect</b> <b>size,</b> significance testing, correlation Social scientists are increasingly promoting the importance and utility of <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> (e. g., Cohen, 1994). One outcome of the vociferous debate over the role of sig-nificance testing has been a deeper appreciation of the role of <b>effect</b> <b>sizes.</b> In fact, the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association [APA], 2001) tells authors that “For readers to fully un-derstand your findings, it is almost always necessary to include some index of ef-fect size or strength of relation in your Results section ” (p. 25). Along with this en-dorsement by APA, a growing number of journals have instituted explicit requirements or recommendations encouraging the reporting of <b>effect</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was performed}} on 19 studies comparing antidepressant medication to placebos, and on 19 studies comparing psychotherapy to no-treatment or wait list control groups, to find {{the magnitude of the}} placebo effect. Mean weighted <b>effect</b> <b>sizes,</b> based on improvement from baseline, were computed {{for each of the four}} conditions. The magnitude of the placebo effect was determined by subtracting the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> of the no-treatment control group from the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> of the placebo group. The drug effect was determined by subtracting the placebo <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> from the drug <b>effect</b> <b>size.</b> Results indicated that the magnitude of the placebo effect is 0. 77 standard deviations and is significantly greater than the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> of spontaneous recovery or the passage of time (0. 35 standard deviations).

50|$|As in any {{statistical}} setting, <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> {{are estimated}} with sampling error, {{and may be}} biased unless the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> estimator that is used is appropriate for {{the manner in which}} the data were sampled and {{the manner in which the}} measurements were made. An example of this is publication bias, which occurs when scientists only report results when the estimated <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> are large or are statistically significant. As a result, if many researchers carry out studies with low statistical power, the reported <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> will tend to be larger than the true (population) effects, if any. Another example where <b>effect</b> <b>sizes</b> may be distorted is in a multiple trial experiment, where the <b>effect</b> <b>size</b> calculation is based on the averaged or aggregated response across the trials.|$|R
