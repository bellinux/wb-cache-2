Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound. The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{unless a}} new bishop <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> coat of arms, he {{typically}} adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion {{to a particular}} saint is represented by symbols established in iconography and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a coat that looks entirely non-clerical, not least because their descendants may seek reassignment of the arms, and few of them {{are likely to be}} clerics.|$|E
5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

25|$|Never Better {{is about}} Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life {{never seems to}} get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied with his own flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts {{to be a good}} husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right thing}} tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.|$|E

25|$|Each {{individual}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> deity, called Kula dewa, who {{resides in}} the temple called the family temple that the individual and his family patronize. Balinese Hindu follow a 210-day calendar (based on rice crop and lunar cycles), and each temple celebrates its anniversary once every 210 days. Unique rituals and festivals of Balinese Hindus, that are not found in India, include those related to death {{of a loved one}} followed by cremations, cockfights, tooth filings, Nyepi and Galungan. Each temple anniversary, as well as festivals and family events such as wedding include flowers, offerings, towering bamboos with decoration at the end and a procession. These are celebrated by the community with prayers and feast. Most festivals have a temple as venue, and they are often occasions for prayers, celebration of arts and community. Some traditions, in contrast, involve animist rituals such as caru (animal blood sacrifice) such as Tabuh Rah (lethal cockfighting) or killing of an animal to appease buta kala (spirits of the earth) - however, the animal sacrifices are conducted outside the premises of a temple.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of extra structure relates {{these types of}} groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for abstract harmonic analysis, whereas Lie groups (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of differential geometry and unitary representation theory. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, compact connected Lie groups have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group Γ can be realized as a lattice in a topological group G, the geometry and analysis pertaining to G yield important results about Γ. A comparatively recent trend {{in the theory of}} finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups (profinite groups): for example, a single p-adic analytic group G <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of quotients which are finite p-groups of various orders, and properties of G translate into the properties of its finite quotients.|$|E
25|$|Thorfinn, {{having no}} other choice, follows Eskil and Vrage to meet Vagn. Surprisingly, when Vagn sees Thors’s son Thorfinn, he started crying publicly. Thorfinn finally learns {{that the person}} who ordered for Thors’s death was Floki, as Thors was the mostly likely {{candidate}} to be the third chieftain. Rage crossed Thorfinn’s mind but leaves to sort himself out. Alone, he questions if he can still change for the better and become a kinder person. Thorfinn also meets one of his old crewmates, Atli who is arrested for thievery. Atli says he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> back home and “will find an honest line of work”. Vagn warns Thorfinn that people like Atli will return to stealing and killing people instead of field labor, so killing him is better than releasing him. Hild leaves after questioning Vagn on the same thing since he is also enjoying an extravagant meal when there are no animals or fields around. Thorfinn wishes to not go to Jomsborg nor fight anyone, not even to meet Floki again. Thorfinn states that King Canute will oversee the affairs of Thors’s murder while Thorfinn will complete his own mission without needless bloodshed. Later, Vagn is puzzled when Thorfinn and Hild are trying to stop Vagn’s men from sexually assaulting the slave girls.|$|E

25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) {{also called}} {{paroxysmal}} kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. Involuntary movements {{can take many}} forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect {{one side of the}} body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.|$|E
