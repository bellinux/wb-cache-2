5|$|Ever {{since the}} Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589), {{painting}} {{had become an}} art of high sophistication that {{was associated with the}} gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.|$|E
25|$|His {{attitude}} toward the Kabbalah is determined by his conservative standpoint. Its elements, {{as far as they}} {{can be traced back to}} the Talmud, he considered to be true. When the inhabitants of Fez made inquiries regarding the proportions of God, he answered, as one of the signers of the responsum, that God is above any corporeal qualification and that the Talmud forbids the public discussion of these things. His answer to the question regarding the interpretation of the Talmudic tradition that four men entered paradise is interesting, and has caused much discussion. He refers to the opinion of various scholars that specially favored persons could attain, by means of castigation and the reciting of psalms, to an ecstatic state in which they might behold the heavenly halls ("hekalot") as vividly as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> had entered them. Contrary to his father-in-law, Samuel ben Hofni, gaon of Sura, he followed former scholars in deeming it not impossible that God should reveal the marvels of heaven to the pious while in this state of ecstasy. But all the elements of the later Kabbalah not found in Talmudic tradition, as the belief that miracles could be performed with the names of God, he designated as foolishness not credited by any sensible man.|$|E
500|$|... "Earth Song" [...] is a ballad that {{incorporates}} elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself. [...] The song reveals {{itself to be}} highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham. [...] "What about death again" [...] reminds all to think about eternal death, asking people to check their heart for repentance, or to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> cared at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith {{to focus on the}} Biblical Jesus Christ until his death.|$|E

[...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted {{he was trying to get}} into that person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset." ...|$|E
500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody {{was out of the}} closet and because that's what we heard from doctors [...] that's what Socarides told us, {{it was a matter of}} shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> wanted to.|$|E
500|$|The {{theatrical}} poster {{for the film}} was released in early August 2013. Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider criticized the poster for its lack of originality, noting its similarities {{to one of the}} posters of Iron Man 3, both of which included the female lead clinging to the male lead, with both looking in opposite directions, antagonists prominently displayed in the background and supporting characters featured [...] "on the side". Additionally, Marvel released a second trailer for the film as part of YouTube's Geek Week. Forbes said, [...] "this 150-second trailer is basically just an extended version of last April's 106-second teaser" [...] and that [...] "this trailer fails to showcase what's new this time around... making audiences question <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> don't have much else to offer." [...] The Los Angeles Times said, that the trailer suggests [...] "an ominous, epic scale for the sequel" [...] and that [...] "the collaboration between Thor and Loki promises to be especially interesting."

500|$|In 405 BC, the Athenian navy was {{defeated}} and {{destroyed by the}} Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander at the Battle of Aegospotami in the Hellespont. Without sufficient funds to build another fleet, the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city. Blockaded by land and sea, with their food supplies running low, the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king Agis, whose army was camped outside their walls, offering to join the Spartan alliance if {{they were allowed to}} keep their walls and port; Agis, claiming that he had no power to negotiate, sent the ambassadors on to Sparta, but there they were told that, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> wanted peace, they should bring the Spartans better proposals. The Athenians were initially intransigent, {{going so far as to}} imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the long walls be torn down as the Spartans had insisted, but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises. In this situation, Theramenes, in a speech to the assembly, requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander (who was at this time besieging Samos) to determine the Spartans' intentions towards Athens; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians' situation, although he declined to share it with the citizenry. His request was granted, and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander; from there, he was sent to Sparta, perhaps stopping at Athens on the way. At Sparta, with representatives of all of Sparta's allies present, Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were pulled down, the size of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited, and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use [...] "the constitution of their ancestors". Theramenes returned to Athens and presented the results of the negotiations to the assembly; although some still favored holding out, the majority voted to accept the terms; the Peloponnesian War, after 28 years, was at an end.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans.

(Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships."

[...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking.

2500|$|The {{other form}} of {{feminism}} in the Islamic world is independent or state feminism.

These Muslim feminists argue that there is only so much that reinterpreting the texts can do and believe that the best – and perhaps only – way to increasing women's rights is outside of the parameters of Islam. Therefore, changing polygynist practices would involve reforming the political and legal systems instead of just trying to reinterpret the Qur’an and the hadiths to determine <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> support the practice and to what extent.|$|E
