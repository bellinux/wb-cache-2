2500|$|Historical records {{relating}} to frustration, revolts and high mortality rates among farmers in India, particularly cash crop farmers, {{date back to}} the 19th century. However, suicides due to the same were rare. The high land taxes of 1870s, payable in cash regardless of the effects of frequent famines on farm output or productivity, combined with colonial protection of usury, money lenders and landowner rights, contributed to widespread penury and frustration among cotton and other farmers, ultimately leading to the Deccan Riots of 1875-1877. The British government enacted the Deccan Agriculturists’ Relief Act in 1879, to limit the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>charged</b> by money lenders to Deccan cotton farmers, but applied it selectively to areas that served British cotton trading interests. Rural mortality rates, in predominantly agrarian British India, were very high between 1850 and the 1940s. However, starvation related deaths far exceeded those by suicide, the latter being officially classified under [...] "injuries". The death rate classified under [...] "injuries", in 1897, was 79 per 100,000 people in Central Provinces of India and 37 per 100,000 people in Bombay Presidency.|$|E

The real average portfolio yield cited by the sample of 704 microfinance institutions that voluntarily submitted reports to the MicroBanking Bulletin in 2006 was 22.3% annually. However, annual <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> to clients are higher, as they also include local inflation and the bad debt expenses of the microfinance institution. <b>Interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by the Mexican Banco Compartamos on their micro-loans reached 86% per year while it sold stocks {{in the stock market}} in 2007.|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} remarked that <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by banks in Sub-Saharan Africa create disincentives for most borrowers to acquire funds {{to invest in}} their {{businesses}} on one hand. On the other hand, the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>charged</b> by banks discourage most small businesses from applying for bank financing (Diagne and Zeller, 2002; Foltz, 2004). Fatoki and Smit (2011) in South Africa grouped the major factors that influence the low access to finance by SMEs in two ways; internal and external. The internal factors include the business information, collateral, networking, and managerial competences. External factors constitute the legal environment, crime and corruption, ethical perceptions, and macro-economy.|$|R
