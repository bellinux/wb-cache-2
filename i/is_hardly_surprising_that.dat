Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E

He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations [...] "silly", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an [...] "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black."

[...] The Catholic movement lost its vigour in both patriarchates and although the conversion of the Nestorian bishop Joseph in Amid in 1672 revived Catholic hopes, this unexpected development came after several decades in which the Mosul patriarchs had recovered their old authority in the western districts, consecrating Nestorian bishops for the Catholic dioceses founded by Sulaqa a century earlier. [...] Scribal activity, previously concentrated in the Gazarta district, shifted to Mosul, to the nearby villages of Telkepe and Tel Isqof, and above all to Alqosh, whose Shikwana and Nasro families emerged {{in the second half of}} the century to establish a dominance which was not seriously challenged until the second half of the 19th century.|$|E

And because Judah was the birthplace of ancient Israel's central scripture, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the biblical text repeatedly stresses Judah's special status from the very beginnings of Israel's history.... it was Judah, among all of Jacob's sons, whose destiny was to rule over all the other tribes in Israel." ...|$|E

The Bulgarian Communist government saw the accident primarily as a political negative in the d√©tente in East/West relations that had been achieved in talks in Geneva earlier the same year, so after the incident both pilots were considered for demotion and threatened with prison terms by the minister of the interior Georgi Tzankov. Prison terms were not imposed, as the pilots were determined to have followed the orders given. Although the Bulgarian government at first refused to accept responsibility, blaming the Israeli airliner for penetrating its airspace without authorization, it eventually issued a formal apology, stating that the fighter pilots had been [...] "too hasty" [...] in shooting down the airliner, and agreed to pay compensation to the victims' families.|$|E
5000|$|The {{township}}'s name {{is derived}} from William Augustus Pitt, {{one of the founders}} of the central town of the township, Tipton. Through about 1901, the township name was spelled [...] "Pittsburgh," [...] and it surrounded a town that had the same name. From 1902 on, the township name dropped the final H. The first white settlers came to this Pittsburg in 1871. We know from official records that Mr. W. A. Pitt lived here in 1872, one-half mile east of the present town site, on a farm he owned. Mr. Pitt's house served as the local post office. Hence it <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the scattered settlers in and around this territory began to call it Pitt's-burg.|$|R

2500|$|One {{reason for}} McLoughlin's partial {{withdrawal}} from the rotogravure series late in 1948 was undoubtedly the introduction of Christmas annuals to the Boardman line under their Popular Press imprint. The first of these, Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual number one, appeared {{in time for the}} 1949 Christmas market. The book's production was rushed because T.V. Boardman, Sr., did not decide to proceed with the project until the last minute. Success of the experiment assured that the title would continue and another Buffalo Bill Wild West Annual appeared in time for Christmas every year through the 1961 issue. Given the success of Buffalo Bill, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "Adventure" [...] annual series was soon added to the Popular Press offerings.

2500|$|As the old native {{aristocracy}} suffered {{military and}} political defeat and, in many cases, exile, the world order that had supported the bardic poets disappeared. In these circumstances, it <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> much Irish language poetry and song of this period laments these changes and the poet's plight. However, being practical professionals, the poets were not above writing poems in praise of the new English lords {{in the hope of}} finding a continuity of court patronage. This was not generally a successful tactic, and Gaelic poets tended to be folk poets until the Gaelic revival that began {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. However, many of the poems and songs written during this period of apparent decline live on and are still recited and sung today. The end of old ways, a feature of the bardic laments of the 18th century, is also to be found in the early 19th century poem Caoine Cill Chais (The Lament for Kilcash). In this verse the anonymous poet laments that the castle of Cill Chais stands empty, its woods are cut down and its old splendours departed. (Flood and Flood 1999:85-93): ...|$|E
2500|$|Elaborately painted vases were good, {{but not the}} best, table wares {{available}} to a Greek. Metal vessels, especially from precious metals, were held in higher regard. Nonetheless, painted vases were not cheap products; the larger specimens, especially, were expensive. Around 500 BC, a large painted vase cost about one drachma, equivalent to the daily wage of a stonemason. It {{has been suggested that}} the painted vases represent an attempt to imitate metal vessels. It is normally assumed that the lower social classes tended to use simple undecorated coarse wares, massive quantities of which are found in excavations. Tablewares made of perishable materials, like wood, may have been even more widespread. Nonetheless, multiple finds of red-figure vases, usually not of the highest quality, found in settlements, prove that such vessels were used in daily life. A large proportion of production was taken up by cult and grave vessels. In any case, it can be assumed that the production of high-quality pottery was a profitable business. For example, an expensive votive gift by the painter Euphronios was found on the Athenian Acropolis. [...] There {{can be little doubt that}} the export of such pottery made an important contribution to the affluence of Athens. It <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> many workshops appear to have aimed their production at export markets, for example by producing vessel shapes that were more popular in the target region than in Athens. The 4th century BC demise of Attic vase painting tellingly coincides with the very period when the Etruscans, probably the main western export market, came under increasing pressure from South Italian Greeks and the Romans. A further reason for the end of the production of figurally decorated vases is a change in tastes at the start of the Hellenistic period. The main reason, however, should be seen in the increasingly unsuccessful progress of the Peloponnesian War, culminating in the devastating defeat of Athens in 404 BC. After this, Sparta controlled the western trade, albeit without having the economic strength to fully exploit it. The Attic potters had to find new markets; they did so in the Black Sea area. But Athens and its industries never fully recovered from the defeat. Some potters and painters had already relocated to Italy during the war, seeking better economic conditions. A key indicator for the export-oriented nature of Attic vase production is the nearly total absence of theatre scenes. Buyers from other cultural backgrounds, such as Etruscans or later customers in the Iberian Peninsula, would have found such depiction incomprehensible or uninteresting. In Southern Italian vase painting, which was mostly not aimed at export, such scenes are quite common.|$|E

6000|$|This {{was decidedly}} a well-got-up affair for a colonial place. The Maori oracles are {{precisely}} {{like those of}} Delphi. In one case a chief was absent, was inquired for, and the Voice came, 'He will return, yet not return'. Six months later the chiefs friends went to implore him to come home. They brought him back a corpse; they had found him dying, and carried away the body. In another case, when the Maori oracle was consulted as {{to the issue of}} a proposed war, it said: 'A desolate country, a desolate country, a desolate country!' The chiefs, of course, thought the other country was meant, but they were deceived, as Croesus was by Delphi, when he was told that he 'would ruin a great empire'. In yet another case, the Maoris were anxious for the spirits to bring back a European ship, on which a girl had fled with the captain. The Pakeha Maori was present at this seance, and heard the 'hollow, mysterious whistling Voice, [...] "The ship's nose I will batter out on the great sea"'. Even the priest was puzzled, this, he said, was clearly a deceitful spirit, or atua, like those of which Porphyry complains, like most of them in fact. But, ten days later, the ship came back to port; she had met a gale, and sprung a leak in the bow, called, in Maori, 'the nose' (ihu). It <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> some Europeans used to consult the oracle.|$|E

Thus, timed automata {{have already been}} applied in many different areas, including model-based testing. Unfortunately, there is one drawback in using timed automata for test-case generation: if they contain non-determinism or silent transitions, the problem of language inclusion between timed automata becomes undecidable.

The resulting timed automata are unfolded to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) up to depth k. It <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>surprising,</b> <b>that</b> the unfolding caused an exponential state-space explosion. Consequently, the language inclusion algorithm we had developed for test-case generation from deterministic timed automata did not scale anymore.
