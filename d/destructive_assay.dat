Consequently, biological signaling and genetic networks not only translate stimuli with functional response but also random fluctuations.

Our method for causation prediction, "Inference of Network Directionality Using Covariance Elements (INDUCE)," exploits the theoretical relationship between a change in the strength of a causal interaction and the associated changes in the single cell measured entries of the covariance matrix of protein concentrations. We validated our method for causation prediction in two experimental systems where causation is well established: in an E. coli synthetic gene network, and in MEK to ERK signaling in mammalian cells.

The cartilage constructs were treated with three chemical agents (collagenase, chondroitinase-ABC, and ribose) to induce changes in biochemical content (collagen and glycosaminoglycan [GAG]) of matured constructs (4 weeks); and to subsequently alter the mechanical properties of the construct. The biochemical changes were evaluated using TRFS. The microstructure and the thickness of the engineered cartilage samples were charac-terized by UBM. The optical and ultrasound results were validated against those acquired via conventional techniques including collagen and GAG quantification and measurement of construct stiffness. Current results demonstrated that a set of optical parameters (e. g., average fluorescence lifetime and decay constants) showed significant correlation (p < 0. 05) with biochemical and mechanical data. The high-resolution ultrasound images provided complementary cross-section information of the cartilage samples morphology.

Both bioluminescent E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S.

A bioluminescent strain of S.

Carbon utilization patterns based on increased luminescence varied with different extracts analyzed with commercial produce extracts and lab extracts both in overall luminescence and kinetics for both plasmid based constructs.

Porcine femoral osteochondral plugs were cultured for 20 days, with the addition on day 6, of Triton X- 100 (to induce necrosis), camptothecin (to induce apoptosis) or no toxic additives. Tissue viability was assessed by the tissue destructive XTT (sodium 3 '-[1 -[(phenylamino) -carbonyl]- 3, 4 -tetrazolium]-bis(4 -methoxy- 6 -nitro) benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate) assay method and LIVE/DEAD® staining of the cartilage at days 0, 6 and 20.

Initial plans called for LANL to process a total of 30 kg of oxide powder for pressing into monolithic ceramic pellets. The original 30 kg commitment was processed within the time frame allotted; an additional 8 kg were required to replace fuel lost due to failure to meet Quality Assurance specifications for impurities and dimensions. During the time frame allotted for pellet production, operations were impacted by equipment failure, unacceptable fuel impurities levels, and periods of extended down time, > 30 working days during which little or no processing occurred. Throughout and production process, the reality of operations requirements varied from the theory upon which production schedules were based...|$|E
40|$|Current {{safeguards}} approaches {{used by the}} IAEA at {{gas centrifuge}} enrichment plants (GCEPs) need enhancement in order to verify declared LEU production, detect undeclared LEU production and detect HEU production with adequate detection probability using non <b>destructive</b> <b>assay</b> (NDA) techniques. At present inspectors use attended systems, systems needing {{the presence of an}} inspector for operation, during inspections to verify the mass and U- 235 enrichment of declared UF 6 containers used in the process of enrichment at GCEPs. This paper contains an analysis of how possible improvements in unattended and attended NDA systems including process monitoring and possible on-site analysis of DA samples could reduce the uncertainty of the inspector measurements providing more effective and efficient IAEA GCEPs safeguards. We have also studied a few advanced safeguards systems that could be assembled for unattended operation and what performance would be needed to provide more effective safeguards. The analysis will also focus on how short notice random inspections, unannounced inspections, and the concept of information-driven inspections can affect probability of detection of the diversion of nuclear materials when coupled to new GCEPs safeguards regimes augmented with unattended systems. We also will look at the issue of inspection costs for such systems and attempt to quantify the savings associated with implementing an advanced safeguards system. While investigating costs, we will also explore the effects of system failures and operator tampering on meeting safeguards goals for quantity and timeliness and what measures would be needed to recover from such failures and anomalies...|$|E
50|$|The most elaborately accurate, but totally <b>destructive,</b> {{precious}} metal <b>assay</b> is fire-assay. (It {{may also be}} called by the critical cupellation step that separates {{precious metal}} from lead.) If performed on bullion (high purity precious metal alloy) to international standards, the method can be accurate on gold metal to 1 part in 10,000. If performed on ore materials using fusion followed by cupellation separation, detection may be in parts per billion. However, accuracy on ore material is typically limited to 3 to 5% of reported value. Although time consuming, the method is the accepted standard applied for valuing gold ore as well as gold and silver bullion at major refineries and gold mining companies.In the case of fire assaying of gold and platinum ores, the lengthy time required to carry out an assay generally is offset by carrying out large numbers of assays simultaneously, and a typical laboratory will be equipped with several fusion and cupellation furnaces, each capable of taking multiple samples, so that several hundred analyses per day can be carried out. The principal advantage of fire assay is that large samples can be used, and these increase the accuracy in analysing low yield ores in the <1g/T range of concentration.|$|R
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) {{is one of}} {{the major}} plant hormones. It is {{especially}} important for seed development and germination and adaptation to environmental stresses. Many of the plant physiological responses to ABA are the consequences of ABA-inducible or ABA-repressible gene expression. Our knowledge of the ABA signal transduction pathways leading to altered gene expression is far from complete. Two of the known transgenes affecting ABA-regulated gene expression are VIVIPAROUS 1 (VPl) and ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI 1). VP 1 encodes a transcriptional activator which activates ABA-inducible genes by binding to a DNA-binding basic leucine zipper protein specific for ABA responsive elements (ABREs). The ABIl gene encodes a serine/threonine protein phosphatase with a negative regulatory role in ABA signalling. Rice protoplasts are a good model system to study the cell biology of ABA transduction. They express introduced DNA constructs, are sensitive to exogenous ABA and pharmacological agents, and they make single cell analyses possible. Most reporter gene activities are quantified analyzed by <b>destructive</b> enzyme <b>assays.</b> Quantifying plant gene expression by flow cytometry (FCM) would allow multidimensional cell parameter analysis on a per-cell basis, thereby providing insight into the cellular mechanisms of plant gene regulation. Therefore we established quantitation by FCM of ABA-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and statistically compared the method with traditional reporter enzyme assays. Dual-color FCM of GFP-expressing cells immunodecorated with mAbs recognizing rice cell surface epitopes was successfully performed. We conclude that quantitation by FCM of inducible gene expression in rice protoplasts is a valid method with the advantages over biochemical assays of live cell analysis, sorting of populations, and multiparameter correlative analysis. Interactions between ABA, ABI 1, VPl, and lanthanum ions were observed by flow cytometry and traditional reporter gene assays in transiently transformed rice protoplasts. Lanthanum and other trivalent ions, were established as specific agonists of ABA-inducible gene expression. The mechanism of trivalent ion action on ABA signalling is unknown. The findings support a sequential model of effector action in ABA signalling cascades, from ABA, La 3 + to ABIl to VP 1 to gene expression in a single or partially overlapping pathways. The transient rice protoplast system was further used to show that mAbs recognizing specific carbohydrate epitopes of cell surface molecules had modulating effects on ABA-inducible gene expression. JIM 19 inhibited ABA-inducible Em promoter activity about 40 % and JIM 7 activated it about 35 %, suggesting that they might directly or indirectly interact with an ABA receptor complex, changing the receptor's sensitivity to ABA. These mAbs, lanthanum and other trivalent ions might be useful tools to study cellular mechanisms of ABA signal transduction...|$|R
40|$|Chaperones are {{ubiquitous}} conserved proteins {{critical in}} stabilization of new proteins, repair/removal of defective proteins and immunodominant antigens in innate and adaptive immunity. Periodontal {{disease is a}} chronic inflammatory infection associated with infection by Porphyromonas gingivalis that culminates {{in the destruction of}} the supporting structures of the teeth. We previously reported studies of serum antibodies reactive with the human chaperone Hsp 90 in gingivitis, a reversible form of gingival disease confined to the oral soft tissues. In those studies, antibodies were at their highest levels in subjects with the best oral health. We hypothesized that antibodies to the HSP 90 homologue of P. gingivalis (HtpG) might be associated with protection/resistance against <b>destructive</b> periodontitis. ELISA <b>assays</b> using cloned HtpG and peptide antigens confirmed gingivitis subjects colonized with P. gingivalis had higher serum levels of anti-HtpG and, concomitantly, lower levels of attachment loss. Additionally, serum antibody levels to P. gingivalis HtpG protein were higher in healthy subjects compared to patients with either chronic or aggressive periodontitis. We found a negative association between tooth attachment loss and anti-P. gingivalis HtpG (p = 0. 043) but not anti-Fusobacterium nucleatum (an oral opportunistic commensal) HtpG levels. Furthermore, response to periodontal therapy was more successful in subjects having higher levels of anti-P. gingivalis HtpG before treatment (p = 0. 018). There was no similar relationship to anti-F. nucleatum HtpG levels. Similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with a synthetic peptide of a region of P. gingivalis HtpG. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST: 1) anti-P. gingivalis HtpG antibodies are protective and therefore predict health periodontitis-susceptable patients; 2) may augment the host defence to periodontitis and 3) a unique peptide of P. gingivalis HtpG offers significant potential as an effective diagnostic target and vaccine candidate. These results are compatible with a novel immune control mechanism unrelated to direct binding of bacteria...|$|R
