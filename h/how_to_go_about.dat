5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure as to <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E

The Delors Report endorsed by the Madrid Summit of June 1989 envisaged a three-stage process to monetary union, and this was given legal authority by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 (enacted into Irish law as the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland by 70% of those voting in a referendum on 18 June 1992).

But <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> carrying out this division? The answer was by resorting to the already partly existing structures, i.e., the Bishops' Conferences. These would normally coincide with national boundaries, as had long been the case with the German Episcopal Conferences which had existed for over 100 years. A hurried establishment of such entities, willed by the Holy See to be ad hoc, was effected {{for the sole purpose of}} facilitating the working out of common stands on the Council documents.

Union ground forces led by General John Pope, in New Madrid, and Union naval forces led by Admrial Andrew Hull Foote, {{upstream}} of the bend, were kept apart by Island No. 10. From the first, they did not agree <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> conducting the operation. Pope wanted immediate action; Foote hoped to subdue the island by the slow process of bombardment. As early as March 17, Pope was asking that two or three gunboats run past the Confederate batteries, to enable him to cross the river and trap the entire garrison. Foote demurred, arguing that his boats were not invincible. For the next two weeks, fighting consisted of bombardment of the island at rather long range, mostly conducted by the mortars, and occasionally replied to by the Confederate batteries.|$|E

25|$|The gunboats and mortars {{arrived on}} March 15, and the siege is dated from that time. Pope, in New Madrid, and Foote, {{upstream}} of the bend, were kept apart by Island No. 10. From the first, {{they did not}} agree <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> conducting the operation. Pope wanted immediate action; Foote hoped to subdue the island by the slow process of bombardment. Foote was hampered by ambiguous or even contradictory orders from Halleck, who was distracted at the time by preparations for the advance along the Tennessee River that soon culminated in the Battle of Shiloh (or Pittsburg Landing). As early as March 17, Pope was asking that two or three gunboats run past the Confederate batteries, to enable him to cross the river and trap the entire garrison. Foote demurred, arguing that his boats were not invincible, that a chance disabling shot would deliver a boat into Confederate hands, and that gunboat could then threaten all the Northern cities along the Mississippi and its tributaries. Foote's thinking {{may also have been}} affected by the wound he had received at Fort Donelson, which was not healing properly and kept him in pain and on crutches.|$|E
25|$|Governor General the Viscount Monck had {{originally}} {{pushed for a}} distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, {{to be called the}} Order of St. Lawrence. The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a Royal Order of Canada. The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead to steer clear of the controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; {{this was the first time}} an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the Nickle Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project to consider all the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.|$|E

Harrison recalled vamping chords on guitar and alternating between sung phrases of [...] "hallelujah" [...] and [...] "Hare Krishna". He later took the idea to the others, and the chorus vocals were developed further. Band leader Delaney Bramlett's more recent version of events is that the idea originated from Harrison asking him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> writing a genuine gospel song, and that Bramlett demonstrated by scat singing the words [...] "Oh my Lord" [...] while wife Bonnie and singer Rita Coolidge added gospel [...] "hallelujah"s in reply.

However, {{it has been said}} that the unhappily married Duke enjoyed his relationship with Mrs Arbuthnot because he found in her company [...] "the comfort and happiness his wife could not give him." [...] Arbuthnot was certainly the Duke's confidante in all matters, especially that of his marriage. He confided to her that he only married his wife because [...] "they asked me to do it" [...] and that he was [...] "not the least in love with her." [...] In fact, Wellington had not seen his wife for ten years before their wedding day. Following the marriage, the bride and groom found they had little if anything in common. Despite producing two sons, they led mostly separate lives until the death of the Duchess of Wellington in 1831. Harriet had a rather poor opinion of the Duchess ("she is such a fool"), although she disagreed with Wellington when he said that his wife cared nothing for his comfort: in Harriet's view the Duchess longed to make her husband happy, but had no idea <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the task.|$|E

In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories.

This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a givenexample. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories...|$|R
