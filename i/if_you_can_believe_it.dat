All her own gaieties have been under Lady Kirkaldy's wing, or that of Mrs. William Egremont's relations, and only in a quiet {{moderate}} way. Her father gets his own old set about him, and they have not been very choice, but they are mostly elderly men, and gentlemen, and know how to behave themselves to her. Indeed, her cousin Blanche, who was here in the winter, gave us to understand that Ursula knows {{how to take care of}} herself, and gets laughed at as rather an old maidish model of propriety, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> of your little Nuttie.' ...|$|E

He always did his courting before the public. He told Marshall that he hadn't thought about Ellen for years, but {{the first time he}} went to church last fall he saw her {{and fell in love with}} her all over again.

Unfortunately, I 've got no errand, and nobody will trust me with one. I want to care for something, or for some one. And I want to care with a certain ardor; even, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> with a certain passion. I can't just now feel ardent and passionate about a hospital or a dormitory. Do you know I sometimes think that I 'm a man of genius, half finished? The genius has been left out, the faculty of expression is wanting; but the need for expression remains, and I spend my days groping for the latch of a closed door." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Bread {{dropped her}} eyes and hesitated. [...] "If I were a foreigner, sir, I should make less of telling you; it comes harder to a decent Englishwoman. But I {{sometimes}} think I have picked up too many foreign ways. What I was telling you belongs {{to a time when}} I was much younger and very different looking to what I am now. I had a very high color, sir, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> indeed I was a very smart lass. My lady was younger, too, and the late marquis was youngest of all--I mean in the way he went on, sir; he had a very high spirit; he was a magnificent man. He was fond of his pleasure, like most foreigners, and it must be owned that he sometimes went rather below him to take it. My lady was often jealous, and, if you'll believe it, sir, she did me the honor to be jealous of me. One day I had a red ribbon in my cap, and my lady flew out at me and ordered me to take it off. She accused me of putting it on to make the marquis look at me. I don't know that I was impertinent, but I spoke up like an honest girl and didn't count my words. A red ribbon indeed! As if it was my ribbons the marquis looked at! My lady knew afterwards that I was perfectly respectable, but she never said a word to show that she believed it. But the marquis did!" [...] Mrs. Bread presently added, [...] "I took off my red ribbon and put it away in a drawer, where I have kept it to this day. It's faded now, it's a very pale pink; but there it lies. My grudge has faded, too; the red has all gone out of it; but it lies here yet." [...] And Mrs. Bread stroked her black satin bodice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing would induce me to {{go there}} again," [...] she declared, [...] "and I {{consider}} myself very fortunate to have escaped from it with my life. It 's filled {{with all sorts of}} horrible things, that fizzle up and go off, or that make you turn some dreadful color if you look at them. I expect to hear a great clap some day, and half an hour afterward to see Gordon brought home in several hundred small pieces, put up in a dozen little bottles. I got a horrid little stain {{in the middle of my}} dress that one of the young men--the young savants--was so good as to drop there. Did you see the young savants who work under Gordon's orders? I thought they were too forlorn; there is n't one of them you would look at. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> there was n't one of them that looked at me; they took no more notice of me than if I had been the charwoman. They might have shown me some attention, at least, as the wife of the proprietor. What is it that Gordon 's called--is n't there some other name? If you say 'proprietor,' it sounds as if he kept an hotel. I certainly don't want to pass for the wife of an hotel-keeper. What does he call himself? He must have some name. I hate telling people he 's a chemist; it sounds just as if he kept a shop. That 's what they call the druggists in England, and I formed the habit while I was there. It makes me feel as if he were some dreadful little man, with big green bottles in the window and 'night-bell' painted outside. He does n't call himself anything? Well, that 's exactly like Gordon! I wonder he consents to have a name at all. When I was telling some one about the young men who work under his orders--the young savants--he said I must not say that--I must not speak of their working 'under his orders.' I don't know what he would like me to say! Under his inspiration!" ...|$|E

English fine weather is worth waiting for--it is so sovereign in quality when it comes, and the capacity of this little place of a few marked odd elements to become charming, to shine and flush and endear itself, is then so admirable. I went out for my afternoon walk under stress of having promised my good little gardener (a real pearl of price--these eleven years--in the way of a serving-man) to come and witness his possible triumphs at our annual little horticultural show, given this year in some charming private grounds on a high hill overlooking our little huddled (and lower-hilled) purple town. There I found myself in the extraordinary position--save that other summers might--but haven't--softened the edge of the monstrosity--of seeing [...] "Henry James Esq." [...] figure on thirteen large cards commemorative of first, second and third prizes--and of more first, even, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> than the others. It always [seems] to point, more than anything else, the moral, for me, of my long expatriation and to put its [...] "advantages" [...] into a nutshell. In what corner of our native immensity could I have fallen--and practically without effort, helpless ignoramus though I be--into the uncanny flourish of a swell at local flower shows? Here it has come of itself--and it crowns my career. How I wish you weren't too far away for me to send you a box of my victorious carnations and my triumphant sweet peas! However, I remember your telling me with emphasis long years ago that you hated [...] "cut flowers," [...] and I have treasured your brave heresy (the memory of it) so ineffaceably so as to find support in it always, and fine precedent, for a very lukewarm adhesion to them myself, except for a slight inconsistency in the matter of roses and sweet peas (both supremely lovable, I think, in their kind,) which increase and multiply and bless one in proportion as one tears them from the stem. However, it's 1.30 a.m. o'clock--and I am putting this to bed; till to-morrow night again, when I shall pull it forth and add to its yearning volume. I have to write at night, and even late at night--to write letter-things at all; for the simple reason of being so vilely constituted for work that when my regularly recurring morning stint is done (from after breakfast to luncheon-time,) I am [...] "done" [...] utterly, and so cerebrally spent (with the effort to distil [...] "quality" [...] for three or four hours,) that I can't touch a pen till as much as possible of the day has elapsed, to build out and disconnect my morning's association with it. That is one reason--and always has been--of my baseness as a correspondent. The question is whether the effect I produce as a [...] "story writer" [...] is of a nature to make up for it. You will say [...] "most certainly not!"--and who shall blame you? But goodnight and à demain.|$|E

5000|$|About this time, John Phillips' new band, [...] "The New Journeymen", {{needed a}} {{replacement}} for tenor Marshall Brickman. Brickman had left the folk trio {{to pursue a career}} in television writing, and the group needed a quick replacement for their remaining tour dates. Doherty, then unemployed, filled the opening. After the New Journeymen called it quits as a band in early 1965, Elliot was invited into the formation of a new band, which became [...] "The Magic Cyrcle". Six months later in September 1965, the group signed a recording contract with Dunhill Records. Changing their name to The Mamas & the Papas, the band soon began to record their debut album, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Believe</b> Your Eyes and Ears. The Mamas & the Papas song [...] "Creeque Alley" [...] briefly outlines this history.|$|R
50|$|The Mamas and the Papas' {{recordings}} {{were released}} on Dunhill Records until 1967, {{when the company}} was sold and the label became ABC-Dunhill. Around 1973, ABC-Dunhill discarded all multi-track session recordings and mono masters because they were deemed obsolete and too expensive to store. The original recordings of The Mamas and the Papas, and of labelmates such as Three Dog Night, are therefore lost, {{and it has been}} necessary to create digital versions from the stereo album masters, often second- or third-generation tapes. This is why the sound quality of Mamas and Papas' reissues does not match the best from the 1960s. In 2012, Sundazed Records located a mono master of <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Believe</b> Your Eyes and Ears in the UK and released it on 180-gram vinyl and a limited edition of 500 compact discs.|$|R

These included The Mamas & the Papas (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Believe</b> Your Eyes and Ears), Big Brother and the Holding Company (Cheap Thrills), Jimi Hendrix (Are You Experienced), Jefferson Airplane (Surrealistic Pillow), The Doors (The Doors) and Sly and the Family Stone (Stand!).
