To overcome this issue of abutting properties long-established on the old Highway16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Ten was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September2007. The system {{developed as a}} subtropical depression on September21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave, {{the tail end of}} a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on August 14, moved westward as a disorganized system, and passed through the Cape Verde islands on August 15. On August 17, a weak {{area of low pressure}} developed in the system about 750miles (1,200km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western portion of the wave axis, and the system began to become better organized on August 18 while located about 1,250miles (2,000km) east of the Lesser Antilles. However, convection around the system diminished on August 19, and later that day it began to move through the Lesser Antilles. Despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures, there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface. Convection again increased early on August 20, and it gradually became better organized. Based on a ship's wind report of the system, it is estimated the wave developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August 21 while located about 260miles (415km) south of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{developed on}} May2, 2002 near Sri Lanka, {{associated with a}} weak and broad circulation center. The system tracked west-northwestward through the Arabian Sea along a trough near the equator. Its thunderstorm activity was enhanced by a ridge to its north, though was also removed from the center. By May5, the circulation had become better defined, and concurrently the convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> center. After further organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as Depression ARB01A on May6. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 01A, while located about 1300km (800mi) southeast of Salalah, Oman.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Jokwe {{remained}} {{over land}} for about 18hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel, weakening quickly to tropical storm status. Upon reaching open waters, convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> center, and late on March 9 Jokwe re-intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery. The cyclone {{turned to the}} south-southeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its east. An upper-level low to its south produced good outflow which, in combination with warm waters, allowed Jokwe to re-intensify. Late on March 10, the storm passed about 35km (21mi) east of Europa Island, and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe to intense tropical cyclone status with winds of 170km/h (105mph). Subsequently, an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening trend, and by March 12 Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially exposed from the deep convection; at the same time, the storm turned to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of September, a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean. By September 8, a weak frontal wave began {{developing}} along the cold front. Late on September 9, convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> broad low pressure area, and the overall system intensified beneath an upper-level low. Subsequently, the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection near and {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars <b>increased.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Humberto {{are from the}} {{remnants}} of a frontal trough—the same that spawned Tropical Storm Gabrielle—that moved offshore south Florida on September 5. The combination of a weak surface trough and an upper-level low pressure system produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms from western Cuba into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tracking slowly west-northwestward, unfavorable wind shear initially inhibited tropical cyclone development. By late on September 11, environmental conditions became more favorable, and the following morning convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> disturbance. Tracking around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge, the system turned on a slow northwest drift and quickly organized. Radar imagery reported loose banding features, and buoy data indicated the presence of a surface circulation; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Nine, while located roughly 60miles (100km) southeast of Matagorda, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Sudal {{were from a}} {{persistent}} area of convection, or thunderstorms, southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia {{toward the end of}} March 2004. Initially, it was in an area of high wind shear, which is the change in wind direction with height and is unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. The unfavorable conditions gradually abated, which allowed convection to increase over a broad, developing circulation center. On April2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression near Chuuk in the FSM. It was later classified with the international designation of 0401, meaning it was the first tropical cyclone of 2004. Slow development continued as the system moved slowly westward, and two days later it was classified as Tropical Depression 03W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC); this was the third tropical cyclone tracked by the agency. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, after convection <b>increased</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> circulation.|$|E
