40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the amount and ecological condition of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> throughout Estonia after significant changes in agriculture {{in the second part of}} 20 th century. We also present the first attempt to estimate the success of recent conservation efforts for <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> Our analysis is based on recent exhaustive inventories. We found that Estonia, despite a decrease of the area in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> by two orders of magnitude during the 20 th century, still has about 8400 ha remaining of which approximately 5800 ha are meadows with, at the least, an intermediate conservation value. The latter is directly dependent on mowing regime. Efforts to preserve <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> include establishment of protected areas and financial support for mowing. The national conservation subsidy has been useful and supportive for <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows,</b> however the total amount of this subsidy has been small compared to the area that could be supported.

Due {{to changes in}} land use, <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> have severely declined during the last century. The dominant trees in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> acquire mineral nutrients via ectomycor-rhizal fungi. Using anatomotyping and sequencing of root tips, interpolation and extrapola-tion methods, we studied the diversity and community structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi in two soil horizons of both managed and forested parts of a <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow</b> in Estonia. Species of Thelephoraceae, Sebacinaceae and the genus Inocybe dominated the whole ectomy-corrhizal fungal community of 172 observed species. Forested and managed parts of the <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow</b> harboured different communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas soil horizon had a negligible effect on the fungal community composition.

Therefore, a chronosequence was studied which included a traditionally managed <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow,</b> an overgrown meadow which has been abandoned for more that) 100 yr and a meadow which was restored 36 yr ago by cutting and is now grazed. We analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep, After abandonment 87 % of the typical grassland species vanished from the established vegetation and were replaced by species characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m(2)) to 18 species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed bank type while only 1 / 3 could be classified as having a short-term persistent seed bank. Thus. restoration of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> cannot rely on the soil seed bank.

40|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the 20 th Century the area of {{semi-natural}} grasslands in Estonia decreased substantially, partly due to the collectivization process during the soviet era leading to agricultural abandonment in some areas and intensification in more productive soil types (Henle et al. 2008). Both of these processes led to declines in species diversity as well as homogenisation and loss of character. Within calcareous grasslands loss of grazing leads to colonization by scrub including juniper (Juniperus communis) with very few species and a very different structure, and similar processes occur in other semi-natural grassland types. The unique biodiversity value of semi-natural grasslands in Estonia is well recognised (Dengler et al. 2014), however, an estimation of their value is required to demonstrate to policy makers the urgent requirement for conservation measures. The ecosystem services framework provides a new approach to assess the value and multi-functionality of these habitats. A methodology for assessing ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands is provided in this paper. Management type and intensity have a major influence on semi-natural grassland species composition (Burnside et al. 2007). Therefore the first stage of this project was to assess the relationships between the management regime and the presence of key species in different semi-natural grassland types. The Annex 1 habitat classification was used as the starting point for the study because they are thoroughly mapped in Estonia and form the basis for agri-environmental payments. The five dominant semi-natural grassland habitats in Estonia were selected for this study and include: Northern boreal alluvial meadows (6450), Boreal Baltic coastal meadows (1630), Alvars (6280) and <b>Fennoscandian</b> <b>wooded</b> pastures and <b>meadows</b> (6530 and 9070 respectively). These account for 25 %, 21 %, 15 % and 10 % of the 109592 ha of semi-natural grasslands in Estonia. Four ecosystem services were selected for this study: plant biodiversity, soil carbon storage, biomass production and use for grazing animals. As part of the study, bundles and trade-offs between ecosystem services are identified, as well as hot and cold spots for the provision of ecosystem services. Fig. 1 provides a summary of the share of semi-natural grasslands in Estonia and uses the Environmental Stratification of Estonia (ESE) (Villoslada et al. 2016) to show regional distribution. The results of the project will be translated into policy and decision-making through an online ecosystem services valuation tool in the frame of the LIFE Viva Grass project.

40|$|The Swedish {{countryside}} at {{the beginning}} of the nineteenth century was still so varied and rich that there was room for both human beings and animals almost everywhere. It is true that for thousands of years man had struggled with the advancing forests. First the primaeval deciduous forest was cleared during the warm period following the last glaciation, and after the great climatic change at the close of the Swedish Bronze Age (ca 700 B. C.) the struggle was against the encroaching spruce on practically all fronts. The struggle resulted in culture steppes, pine heaths, birch groves and <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> All these types of landscape were gradually filled with the fauna adapted to them. Different types of cultivation have alternated, and as the nature has changed, the fauna has adapted itself. But up to the nineteenth century these changes were not so great that they altered the general picture of the animal world. Imagine Sweden a century and a half ago! Spruce forests dominated then as now, but they were less uniform; they had kept their individuality and character. <b>Wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> were numerous, for the regular leaf harvest that created them was of great importance in the former agrarian economy. In that way the spruce was kept at bay and the <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> could develop freely, and there the farmers could collect leaves for winter fodder. The young Swedish soil was then still virgin. Thousands of lakes, marshes and fens, the inheritage of the great ice-cap, filled the countryside. Through the country ran the glittering silver bands of streams and brooks. In spring they widened and at times the water flooded the meadows. As summer approached, the low-lying alluvial fields of sedge, horsetail and rush were transformed by the sun into natural meadows, which were mown yearly to make use of everything that could serve as fodder for the livestock during the coming winter...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the species richness and species composition {{in relation to}} light and management regime in remnants of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> within the riparian forests along the middle Drava River in Slovenia. 41 plots of still managed and, at different time periods (15 yrs), abandoned riparian <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> (RWM) were sampled. In addition to vegetation relevés, light intensity (PAR) was also measured in plots. Within the still-managed RWM, two floristically distinct types were recognized using TWINSPAN analysis: meadow-like and forest-like. Light intensity differed significantly between types. The CCA of active RWM showed a significant relation between species composition and light conditions. The number of species per relevé on active RWM was negatively correlated with light intensity - in contrast to North European wooded grasslands. This {{could be explained by}} the influence of species-rich riparian hornbeam forests that contribute many understorey species, in contrast to naturally mesotrophic meadows. CCA of both active and abandoned RWM demonstrated that light was a good predictor of RWM species composition and that abandonment caused profound changes in floristic composition. The species turnover during succession was more pronounced in less shaded meadow-like RWM where more light-requiring (grassland) species occurred. Species richness was the highest in active forest-like RWM. There {{were no significant differences in}} species richness between active meadow-like RWM and groups of abandoned RWM. The remains of riparian forests stretching along the flood plains of Central and Eastern Europe are considered one of the most natural ecosystems in the prevailing agricultural landscape. But naturalness could be in many cases only the consequence of abandonment of ancient land-use practices, like grazing of livestock, cutting between the trees, litter collecting, etc. Examination of the middle Drava River in Slovenia suggests the need to recognize the remains of ancient cultural landscape...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{traditional}} usage of hazel in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> {{in the island}} of Gotland, and the relations between this usage and the biodiversity of these lands. Research on relations between historical land-use and biodiversity {{is a relatively new}} field and there is presently no such undertaken research on traditional usage of hazel. The aim of the study is to explore how the usage of hazel in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> in Gotland where undertaken under the period between 1647 to 1925 and its connections to biodiversity. As indicators for biodiversity, the essay focuses on two endangered species of long-horned beetles that are dependent of dead hazel wood for their reproduction cycle. As relating theories, the essay looks upon the subject through the two concepts of biocultural heritage and intangible cultural heritage. The methods used are literature and archive studies, complemented by interviews with craftsmen with particular knowledge of traditional handicrafts of common hazel usages in Gotland. The study shows that the most common method of harvesting hazel in the meadows has been a type of selective cutting, in favor of coppicing a whole bush at a time. Selective cutting has been used {{for a wide range of}} purposes which created sparse hazel bushes of an approximate height of 3 meters, containing dead wood of hazel of various sizes and height. As such, the traditional usage has been mostly beneficial for the two long-horned beetles. The essay concludes that modern methods of environmental management should copy the traditional method of selective cutting, with the exception that more dead wood should be created in order to create enough living space for the two long-horned beetles. Furthermore, this type of integrated management will also probably benefit other types of beetles, some types of stingers as well as valuable vascular plants in the field level.

This study examines how, and why such change affected xylophagous insects. I have studied microhabitat preferences, i. e. distribution of xylophagous insects in canopy and understorey of closed forests, forest edges and <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> I used method of rearing insect from timber baits exposed to ovipositing females of xylophagous insects in different situations in the forest at the beginning if vegetation season. After one season of exposition,the baits were collected enclosed in fly-wire cages, where emerging insects were collected for two seasons. This thesis consists of two parts: The first part is an unpublished manuscript dealing with effect of habitat insolation, vertical stratification, forest structure and amount of dead wood on community of long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) and jewell beetles (Buprestidae) feeding on wood of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Baits were exposed in the canopy and the understorey of forest interior, the canopy and the understorey of forest edge and on solitary trees on <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> Most insect species do prefer insoled wood for their development, and were {{more common in the}} understorey than in the canopy. Insolation of bait was thus the prime factor affecting composition of reared insects. No relation was found between dead wood volume and species composition or abundance of reared insects This shows that insolation of the dead wood is crucial to conservation of most xylophagous insects. The second part of the thesis studies effect of vertical stratification and insolation on distribution of xylophages feeding reared from wood of 8 tree species (Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, P. x canadensis, Salix alba, Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Ulmus laevis) and host specificity of xylophages. Results show that: (i) community composition of xylophages reflects evolutionary history of their host plants; (ii) communities reared from different trees exhibit different preferences for forest strata and insolation of the habitat, probably in connection to preferred growth conditions of the host plant, (iii) many xylophagous insect species exhibit strong preferences to insoled habitats, and are thus confined to forest edges in extensively managed forests as well as in unmanaged forest reserves...|$|R

Lake Vättern has a clear influence on the local climate, with cold springs, but long, mild autumns. Because of this, several post-glacial warming relicts have been able to survive in the region and in the slopes down to Lake Vättern, which have an oceanic climate. For example, the only incidence in all Scandinavia of the symbolic species Ena montana, the Bulin snail, occurs in the ravine environments near the lake. Gisebo and Gränna are home to one of the country’s largest fruit growing districts, which is not common at this latitude and altitude. Due to the central location of the East Vättern Scarp Landscape in the southern one-third of Sweden, both eastern and western species are found here, as well as typically northern coniferous forest environments and typically southern Swedish <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> From a macro perspective, the East Vättern Scarp Landscape {{can be seen as a}} large border zone that gradually transitions from more open, broadleaf-dominated landscapes near the lake to more dense wooded landscapes on the South Swedish Highlands.
