40|$|An {{efficient}} reverse {{analysis of}} three 6 -degree-of-freedom (dof) subchains of the 7 -dof SSRMS is presented. The first subchain is <b>formed</b> by <b>locking</b> the seventh joint. The second subchain is <b>formed</b> by <b>locking</b> the second joint, while the third subchain is <b>formed</b> by <b>locking</b> the first joint (the grounded joint is counted {{as the first}} joint in the chain). There are a maximum of eight different arm configurations {{in each of the}} three subchains, and these were determined by employing a computer-efficient algorithm, which required the rooting of only at most quadratic polynomials. The algorithms were implemented, and the SSRMS was employed in an animated environment to perform and practice a number of useful tasks for Space Station servicing. The locking of the second joint has the advantage in that an operator can choose the orientation of the plane that contains the two longest links so as to avoid collisions with obstacles. However, it has the disadvantage that when the second joint angle equals 0 deg or 180 deg, the manipulator is in a singularity configuration. This plane can also be oriented by specifying the first joint angle, so that the plane can be oriented arbitrarily and, in this, the singularity is avoided...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "agujeta" [...] lock or [...] "la llave de transici√≥n", a {{contemporary}} of the patilla, {{was produced in}} Ripoll, a gun-making center in Catalonia. The lock was primarily fitted to a long-barreled pistol called a [...] "pedrenyal" [...] and also on long guns {{for a short period}} until the patilla became the predominant lock of manufacture in Spain. In Italy, the romanlock seems to have been the mechanical counterpart, and possibly the predecessor of the agujeta. The agujeta used a back catch on the cock in lieu of a half cock sear and the mainspring bore down on the toe of the cock as with the romanlock. A detached combination lock, wheellock and what is certainly an agujeta/romanlock <b>form</b> <b>lock,</b> in the Royal Artillery Museum, Turin, strongly suggests the agujeta/romanlock came to Spain from Italy, probably during a period of Spanish involvement there.|$|R

25|$|A turf-sided lock is {{an early}} <b>form</b> of canal <b>lock</b> design that uses earth banks to <b>form</b> the <b>lock</b> chamber, {{subsequently}} attracting grasses and other vegetation, instead of the now more familiar and widespread brick, stone, or concrete lock wall constructions. This early lock design was most often used on river navigations in the early 18th century {{before the advent of}} canals in Britain. The sides of the turf-lock are sloping so, when full, the lock is quite wide. Consequently, this type of lock needs more water to operate than vertical-sided brick- or stone-walled locks. On British canals and waterways most turf-sided locks have been subsequently rebuilt in brick or stone, and so only a few good examples survive, such as at Garston Lock, and Monkey Marsh Lock, on the Kennet and Avon Canal.|$|R

50|$|Ground {{clearance}} {{began in}} February and March 2001, {{with the intention}} of constructing {{the lower end of the}} navigation first, but the outbreak of Foot-and-mouth disease in May 2001 resulted in all of the surrounding agricultural land being closed for access, and there was no option but to start at the top. Work began on lock 5 first, followed by lock 4. Both were built on dry ground between the sides of a meander. The design involved driving four rows of interlocking steel piles into the ground, using a vibrating pile driver to minimise the noise nuisance which is normally associated with hammer action pile driving. The inner two rows would <b>form</b> the <b>lock</b> walls, while the outer two were tied to them by steel tie rods to provide anchorage. Earth was then excavated from between the inner pair to <b>form</b> the <b>lock</b> chamber. Construction of the staircase began soon afterwards, which was the first staircase ever built by machine, and getting the profile of the piles correct required new skills which were developed on the project. The Foot-and-mouth restrictions were lifted in July 2001, and work on the lower section could start.|$|R
