5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orphanage {{with the other}} playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered {{when he and his}} older sister were separated.|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study compared selected HIV/STD-related risk variables (sexual behavior, condom use, STD diagnosis, and beliefs) between adults who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area {{and those who}} <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area. Participants were recruited through an electronic mailing list of a large, internet-based sexual enhancement product company and completed a web-based questionnaire. A sample comprising 123 rural {{men and women and}} 1131 non–rural men and women, ages 18 to 39 years, were analyzed. No significant differences were found for any of the variables between those who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area compared to those who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area, although both groups reported HIV/STD risk behaviors. Hence, prevention education efforts appear justified in rural, as well urban area...|$|R

25|$|I <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{atmosphere}} of Sanskrit literature and I have {{been dealing with}} the Sanskrit classics in and outside the classroom either as a student, or a teacher for the last sixty years. Naturally some of that cultural heritage cannot but appear even in a work on Christ. Moreover, I believe our task today is to underscore the similarities and the points in common between different cultures and religions rather than emphasise the differences.|$|E
