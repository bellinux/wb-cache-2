Both species inhabit small sun-lit pools [4, 5], and often occur in the same geographical areas [6, 7].

40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles <b>gambiae</b> {{has become a}} serious concern to the future success of malaria control. In Benin, the National Malaria Control Programme has recently planned to scaling up long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria prevention. It is, therefore, crucial to monitor the level and type of insecticide resistance in An. <b>gambiae,</b> particularly in southern Benin where reduced efficacy of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and IRS has previously been reported. Methods: The protocol was based on mosquito collection during both dry and rainy seasons across forty districts selected in southern Benin. Bioassay were performed on adults collected from the field to assess the susceptibility of malaria vectors to insecticide-impregnated papers (permethrin 0. 75 %, delthamethrin 0. 05 %, DDT 4 %, and bendiocarb 0. 1 %) following WHOPES guidelines. The species within An. <b>gambiae</b> complex, molecular form and presence of kdr and ace- 1 mutations were determined by PCR. Results: Strong resistance to permethrin and DDT was found in An. <b>gambiae</b> populations from southern Benin, except in Aglangandan where mosquitoes were fully susceptible (mortality 100 %) to all insecticides tested. PCR showed the presence of two sub-species of An. <b>gambiae,</b> namely An. <b>gambiae</b> s. s, and Anopheles melas, with a predominance for An. <b>gambiae</b> s. s (98 %).
