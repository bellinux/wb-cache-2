40|$|CRIEPI has {{developed}} techniques for geohydrological investigation and radionuclide migration analyses {{that will be}} required for the performance assessment of geological disposal of HLW. Unfortunately, there are no underground testing facilities to demonstrate the investigating and evaluating techniques developed for the HLW disposal using the in-situ data. CRIEPI has been joined in international cooperation research (table- 1) conducted at the Äspö HRL (Hard Rock Laboratory). There is a tunnel of total 3500 m in length and max. 460 m depth which was excavated in granite rock by SKB (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company), from 1991. Objectives To demonstrate technical methods on geological and <b>geohydrological</b> <b>investigations</b> for the site-characterization and ongroundwater flow and radionuclide migration analyses to precisely predict the radionuclide underground transportation by using insitu data collected at Äspö HRL. Principal Results 1. Demonstration on the geological and geohydological investigating methods for the site-characterization (1) Dating method of fault activity: The date that some faults in Äspö HRL moved was determined by counting numbers of un-pair electrons, which were produced in tiny quart particles into clay minerals in fault by natural radiation, using the electron spin resonance method. The fault activity dating method was verified to evaluate length of duration that has passed sinc...|$|E
