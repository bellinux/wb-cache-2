500|$|In January 2011, {{the head}} of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, Valery Lukin, {{announced}} that his team had only [...] of ice left to drill in order to reach the water. The researchers then switched to a new thermal drill head with a [...] "clean" [...] silicone oil fluid to drill the rest of the way. Instead of drilling all the way into the water, they said they would stop just above it when a sensor on the thermal drill detected free water. At that point, the drill was to be stopped and extracted from the bore hole. [...] Removal of the drill would lower the pressure beneath it, drawing water into the hole to be left to freeze, creating a plug of ice {{in the bottom of the}} <b>hole.</b> <b>Drilling</b> stopped on 5 February 2011 at a depth of [...] so that the research team could make it off the ice before the beginning of the Antarctic winter season. The drilling team left by aircraft on 6 February 2011.|$|E

50|$|Deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> (DHD) is a {{residual}} stress measurement technique {{used to measure}} locked-in and applied stresses in engineering materials and components. DHD is a semi-destructive mechanical strain relaxation (MSR) technique, which seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of a drilled reference hole. The process is unique {{in its ability to}} measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over 750 mm, without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered deep in comparison to other <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> techniques such as centre <b>hole</b> <b>drilling.</b>|$|E
50|$|For example, a beam {{component}} was plastically bent {{to introduce}} a known residual stress profile. These residual stresses were then measured using multiple residual stress measurement techniques including Neutron Diffraction, Slitting, Ring Core, Incremental Centre <b>Hole</b> <b>Drilling,</b> Deep <b>Hole</b> <b>Drilling</b> and Incremental Deep <b>Hole</b> <b>Drilling,</b> as well as modelled with finite element software to provide further numerical validation. The correlation between the results from techniques is strong, with DHD and iDHD displaying the same trend and magnitudes as both the numerical simulation and the other experimental techniques. The results from this comparison are shown in the Figure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} stress measurements at Stripa, compares the results obtained by different techniques, and recommends a stress measurement program for a hard rock repository site. The state of stress at the Stripa Mine has been measured both in a 381 -m-deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilled</b> from the surface and in <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> from the drifts underground. Hydraulic fracturing and several overcoring methods have been used (Lulea triaxial gauge, CSIRO gauge, USBM gauge, Swedish State Power Board deep-hole Leeman triaxial gauge). The results of overcoring and hydraulic fracturing agree well, particularly for the magnitude and orientation of the greatest stress. A recommended program for stress measurement at a repository site would include hydraulic fracturing and deep-hole overcoring in a deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilled</b> from surface, and overcoring (Lulea gauge and USBM gauge) and hydraulic fracturing from <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> from underground openings when access is available.

A validation test specimen was fabricated and plastically loaded to impose a permanent residual stress field within the specimen. The validation test specimen was designed to provide a variety of stress profiles as a function of location within the specimen. A finite element analysis of the validation test specimen was performed in order to provide a reference solution for comparison to the deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> experimental results. Results from experimental testing of the validation test specimen agree well with the finite element analysis reference solution, thereby providing further validation of the deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> method to measure residual stresses...|$|R
