5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not <b>have</b> <b>adequate</b> skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
5|$|By noon of 7 August, {{the early}} morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied {{aircraft}} appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would <b>have</b> <b>adequate</b> air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft {{from the moment they}} took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield. In the open ground east of Mortain, the German Panzers became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF.|$|E

5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not <b>have</b> <b>adequate</b> space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|Mutiny of the Matoika is {{the common}} name for the events in July 1920 {{involving}} {{a large portion of}} the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not <b>have</b> <b>adequate</b> accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in the traditional sense, but has been called that since the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee (Danny McBride) is {{the pilot}} of the Covenant and Maggie Faris' husband. During a space walk to repair the solar {{recharge}} sails of the Covenant, Tennessee inadvertently intercepts a signal from Shaw, which prompts the colonization mission to divert towards the signal's source. While {{the brunt of the}} crew embarks on an excursion {{to the surface of the}} Engineer home world, Tennessee pilots Covenant in high orbit. Due to an ionic storm, he is unable to <b>have</b> <b>adequate</b> communication with the expedition. To regain communications, Tennessee brings Covenant dangerously close to the storm, which allows Daniels to privately reveal to him that Maggie is dead. Tennessee pilots a cargo lander down to the surface of the planet and extracts Daniels, Lope and David impersonating Walter, assisting with killing an Alien in the process. Aboard Covenant, the crew is alerted to an Alien stowaway, prompting Tennessee to work with Daniels to dispose of it. They lure it to the terraforming bay, where it is ejected into space. Tennessee subsequently returns to cryosleep before Daniels does.|$|E

40|$|The {{health and}} {{happiness}} of families {{depend on the}} family size. The aim of family welfare is to bring down population growth. The study was proposed to assess and compare the knowledge of Muslim women regarding temporary contraceptive methods in rural and urban area. The study was a descriptive comparative design. The study was carried out at rural area Pathamadai Village, Tirnelveli District. Urban area was Melapalyam Town, Tirnelveli District, with the sample of 100 Muslim women by using non probability convenient sampling technique. The inclusion criteria were Muslim women who were eligible couple and {{willing to participate in}} this study. Most women were in the age group between 21 to 30 years in rural and urban areas. Majority of them were self employed in both areas. Out of 50 rural Muslim women 82 % <b>had</b> <b>adequate</b> knowledge, 18 % <b>had</b> moderately <b>adequate</b> knowledge and no one <b>had</b> <b>adequate</b> knowledge. In urban Muslim women 10 % <b>had</b> <b>adequate</b> knowledge, 54 % <b>had</b> moderately <b>adequate</b> knowledge and 36 % <b>had</b> <b>adequate</b> knowledge. The statistical analysis showed significant difference in the knowledge among rural & urban Muslim women. Hence the hypothesis is accepted...|$|R
