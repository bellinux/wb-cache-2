However, if the offender is 17 years old or younger, has a clean record, and such sexual activity was consensual, Youthful Offender status (a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges) may be granted.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relation}} between different types of child abuse victimization and criminal recidivism among <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> Method: Secondary analyses were conducted on data collected with the Washington State Juvenile Court Assessment and general recidivism. The sample consisted of female (n = 3502) and male (n = 10, 111) <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> Results: For male <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> neglect and physical abuse victimization were significantly but rather weakly associated with both general and violent recidivism. For female <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> neglect and physical abuse were weakly associated with general recidivism, but not with violent recidivism. Sexual abuse {{was not related to}} either general or violent recidivism in both male and female <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> Most associations between dynamic (treatable) risk domains and recidivism were stronger in male <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> than in female <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> In addition, most risk domains were more strongly related to general recidivism than to violent felony recidivism. For male <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> neglect victimization was uniquely related to general recidivism whereas physical abuse victimization was uniquely related to violent recidivism, over and above dynamic risk factors for recidivism. For female <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> none of the maltreatment variables were uniquely related to general or violent felony recidivism. Conclusions: Childhood experiences of neglect and physical abuse predict reoffending in male <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders,</b> pointing at a possible need to address these in risk management interventions...|$|R

Academic skill remediation has contributed to reduced recidivism and prosocial behavior for <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> (Brunner, 1993 b; Katisiyannis & Archwamety, 1999).

40|$|Background: Juveniles with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) {{are more}} often victims of maltreatment and more often perpetrators of abuse than juveniles without ID. Because previous research {{on the relationship between}} maltreatment victimisation and subsequent offending behaviour was primarily performed in non-disabled samples, the present study aimed to examine differences between <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> with and without ID in the relationship between maltreatment victimisation and sexual and violent offending. Method: The sample consisted of <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> with ID (n[*]=[*] 102) and without ID (n[*]=[*] 526) who appeared before the courts for a criminal act and for whom the Washington State Juvenile Court Assessment (WSJCA) was completed. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the strength of the relationship between maltreatment and offending, Fisher's z tests were calculated to assess the significance {{of the differences between the}} two groups in the strength of the correlations, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the unique contribution of maltreatment victimisation to the prediction of violent and sexual offending. Results: Seventy per cent of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> with ID and 42 % of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> without ID had experienced abuse and/or neglect. Both sexual and violent offending were more common in <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> with ID than in <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> without ID. Moreover, the relationship between different forms of maltreatment and sexual offending was stronger in <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> with ID than in <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> without ID. Conclusions: Given the high rates of abuse and neglect victimisation and the strength of the association between victimisation and sexual offending, especially in <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> with ID, treatment should focus on potential trauma and other problems associated with the abuse...|$|R

Additionally, a secondary aim is to compare the effects of individual-based interventions to family-based interventions. Methods A systematic search of literature and electronic databases through 2010 generated five experimental or quasi-experimental studies that assessed alcohol outcomes for <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders</b> and five experimental or quasi-experimental studies that assessed marijuana outcomes for <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> Results Overall, substance abuse treatment appears to have a small to moderate effect on alcohol and marijuana reduction for <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> Interventions that showed the most promise were Multisystemic Therapy, Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care, Teaching Family, and Life Skills Training. Individual-based interventions and family-based interventions had similar small to moderate effects on alcohol and marijuana use. Conclusion This review highlights several promising interventions for this high-risk population; however, further rigorous study is desperately needed to provide a better understanding of what works best in reducing substance use among <b>juvenile</b> <b>offenders.</b> ...|$|R
