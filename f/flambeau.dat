5|$|The entire action {{lasted about}} forty minutes. The French were much {{worse off than}} the Americans in terms of casualties, with 7 Frenchmen killed and 33wounded {{compared}} to 3 Americans killed and 7wounded. A prize crew from Enterprise was sent aboard <b>Flambeau</b> and sailed her to Saint Kitts where she was condemned.

5|$|During the Quasi-War American {{merchant}} ships often {{became the}} target of French privateers who seized them in large quantities. In an effort to stem these depredations against American shipping several United States Navy warships were dispatched to hunt down French privateers. One such vessel was , an American naval schooner {{under the command of}} Lieutenant John Shaw. Enterprise had been sent out to the Caribbean Sea in March 1800 with orders to cruise against French shipping in the region. Enterprise had already previously engaged and defeated several French privateers when on the night of 24 October she sighted the privateer <b>Flambeau</b> off the leeward side of Dominica.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flambeau</b> C (b. 1971) {{became a}} pillar of the French show jumping team in the 1980s. He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he took 7th individually, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal with the French team. The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991), a small black horse with a {{conformation}} and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a {{gold medal at the}} 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.|$|E
5|$|The campus newspaper, the FSView & Florida <b>Flambeau,</b> is 100 {{years old}} now and publishes weekly {{during the summer and}} semiweekly on Mondays and Thursdays during the school year {{following}} the academic calendar. After changing hands three times in 13 years, the FSView was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the Gannett chain. This exchange was allowed because the FSView had been for a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with Florida State University. Since most collegiate newspapers are supported by their colleges, this was also among the first times that a major corporation had acquired a college newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} <b>Flambeau</b> brought further acclaim to Shaw, {{who had already}} {{defeated}} several other French privateers and taken them as prizes. Enterprise continued her cruise, next chasing down and capturing Pauline and later Guadaloupeenne. Shortly afterward, chronic illness forced Shaw to transfer command of the vessel to Lieutenant Andrew Sterett. Sterret continued to cruise the Caribbean, taking several more prizes before returning home. Upon Shaw's return home the president and other public officials personally thanked him for his service. Shaw later continued his naval career, serving with distinction during the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La Pointe. He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du <b>Flambeau</b> or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du <b>Flambeau</b> Indian Reservation. The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional wild ricing grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for fishing grounds at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the Lac Vieux Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established. The St. Croix and Sokaogon bands left the negotiations in protest and {{were excluded from the}} agreement.|$|E
25|$|The party's central {{committee}} included its president, La Rocque, vice-presidents Jean Mermoz and Noël Ottavi, Edmond Barrachin, Charles Vallin, Jean Ybarnegaray, Jean Borotra, and Georges Riché. The party had two newspapers: Le <b>Flambeau</b> and Le Petit Journal.|$|E

25|$|After her {{season in}} Paris, Bernhardt {{performed}} L'Aiglon in London, {{and then made}} her sixth tour to the United States. On this tour, she traveled with Constant Coquelin, then the most popular leading man in France.

Eventually he was {{appointed}} primary agent at the Ojibwe settlement of Lac du <b>Flambeau.</b> In about 1834, while still employed by the American Fur Company, he established a trading post on the Wisconsin River near present day Knowlton, Wisconsin. The homestead was located in the modern town of Dewey, at the far north edge of Portage County. He claimed it was the place where his father spent a winter in temporary trading quarters.|$|E

25|$|Another work, {{tracing the}} {{historical}} background of Bolshevism and the Esers, appeared in 1921 as Da Pietro il Grande a Lenin: Storia del movimento rivoluzionario in Russia ("From Peter the Great to Lenin: History of the Revolutionary Movement in Russia"); a French edition {{came out in}} 1933, at Éditions Gallimard. Slonim followed up with an essay on Bolshevik Proletkult and Futurism, taken up by Henri Grégoire's monthly, Le <b>Flambeau</b> (October 1921). At this early stage, Slonim derided Soviet literary productions, and described the better poets (Alexander Blok and Andrei Bely) as incompatible with communist dogmas.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary program}} was {{wilderness}} canoe trips, through the {{lakes and rivers}} of northern Wisconsin and {{the southern edge of}} the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The base provided training, outfitting, and guiding for these trips as well as sleeping and meal facilities for groups of 6-12 crew members, including an adult leader, as they prepared to start or end canoe trips. They also provided transportation to and from starting and ending points. Training included an intensive Voyageur course for the youth leader of a group during the week prior to the group's trip. Additional programs for Scouts included whitewater trips on the lower <b>Flambeau</b> Flowage, swimming at the White Sand Lake beach, informal sandlot football and softball games between staff members and Scouts at the base, and winter camping in the cabins left by the CCC.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{was ordained}} on December 8, 1913. In {{his second year}} as a priest, he became Assistant Director of Catholic Indian Welfare for the Bureau of Catholic Missions in Washington, DC. However, in 1917 he was asked by Cardinal James Gibbons, President of the Bureau of Catholic Missions, to leave the Bureau due to his outspoken activism. Thereafter, he appealed for and {{received}} an assignment with the Chippewas, taking on pastorship for St. Francis Solano at Reserve, Wisconsin, and six Indian missions; the main mission at Reserve near the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, two on the Lac du <b>Flambeau</b> Indian Reservation, one at Mud Lake and Russ Kelly, one {{at the mouth of}} Yellow River, and one at Old Post on the west branch of the Chippewa River. When the Reserve church burned in 1921, Gordon helped raise money to replace it with a church that would honor its Native American attendees by incorporating many native symbols.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Allis-Chalmers {{acquired}} the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding {{a line of}} crawler tractors. In 1929, it {{acquired the}} La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him {{to think about the}} use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to <b>Flambeau</b> Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor's {{first race}} {{occurred}} on 20 April in Newmarket at the First Spring meeting where she beat the filly Miss Fuery and won 250 guineas. The Epsom Derby, held on 21 May, was her second career start, which she won against 9 colts {{and one other}} filly while carrying 110 pounds. A colt by Fidget (owned by Lord Egremont) was second and the Duke of Grafton's filly Remnant sired by Trumpetor was third. On {{the day after the}} Derby, Eleanor won the 550-guinea Epsom Oaks from Lord Grosvenor's filly Rosamond and four other horses. At Ascot, she finished second in a 215-guinea sweepstakes to a colt sired by Asparagus (later named Teddy the Grinder) while carrying 7 pounds more weight than the other racers as a handicap for her wins in the Derby and the Oaks. At the First October meeting in Newmarket, Eleanor won 700 guineas in a match race with Miss Fuery. In her last engagement of the season, Eleanor beat the Duke of Grafton's colt <b>Flambeau</b> in a 200-guinea match race.|$|E
