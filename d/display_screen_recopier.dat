40|$|DE 102009041784 A 1 UPAB: 20110405 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{observing a}} set of stereoscopic half-images and producing a stereo image that is reproduced on a <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> The half-images are reproduced on the screen, so {{that one of the}} half-images is viewed on two lateral and cohesive regions (16) when the other half-image is viewed from a stereo zone (17) that lies between the lateral and cohesive regions. The lateral region is smaller than the cohesive region, and image information of the half-images are enrolled in a lateral direction forced in a sub-pixel of a matrix <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> (10) i. e. liquid crystal <b>display</b> <b>screen.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> for <b>displaying</b> a point of views visible from lateral offset viewing zones comprising a beam splitter grid. USE - Method for displaying image information on an auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> that is utilized for displaying a point of views visible from lateral offset viewing zones (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method enables displaying the image information of three dimensional images on the auto-stereoscopic <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> with better quality by the user in a convenient manner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{expand the}} visual {{field of the}} 3 D <b>display</b> <b>screen,</b> we propose a 3 D visual image {{location}} controller based on the visual evoked potential (VEP). The controller evokes potential information by visual simulator. It constructs high quality data collection system by an EEG amplifier, then abstracts {{the characteristics of the}} EEG signal by signal processing algorithm and controls the movement of image on the 3 D <b>display</b> <b>screen</b> by transforming them into controlling signal. This research can expand the visual field of the 3 D <b>display</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|R
