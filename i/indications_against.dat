40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} at {{pairs of}} acceptors {{in close proximity}} are one frequent cause of transcriptome complexity. In particular, acceptors with the pattern NAGNAG are widespread in several genomes [1 – 3]. When affecting the coding regions, alternative splicing at NAGNAGs mainly results in the insertion/deletion of one amino acid. While such subtle events are undoubtedly frequent, an important question arises: do they have functional consequences or are they simply noise tolerated by cells? Zavolan and colleagues [3, 4] suggest that these variations {{are the result of}} stochastic binding of the spliceosome at neighboring splice sites and do not discuss known functional implications.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} processes taking place around strong shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs) depend on the shock obliquity. The measured synchrotron flux {{is a function of}} the aspect angle between interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) and the line of sight. Thus a model of non-thermal emission from SNRs should account for the orientation of the ambient magnetic field. We develop a new method for the estimation of the aspect angle, based on the comparison between observed and synthesized radio maps of SNRs, making different assumptions about the dependence of electron injection efficiency on the shock obliquity. The method uses the azimuthal profile of radio surface brightness as a probe for orientation of ambient magnetic field because it is almost insensitive to the downstream distribution of magnetic field and emitting electrons. We apply our method to a new radio image of SN 1006 produced on the basis of archival VLA and Parkes data. The image recovers emission from all spatial structures with angular scales from few arcseconds to 15 arcmin. We explore different models of injection efficiency and find the following best-fitting values for the aspect angle of SN 1006 : phi= 70 +/- 4. 2 deg if the injection is isotropic, phi= 64 +/- 2. 8 deg for quasi-perpendicular injection (SNR has an equatorial belt in both cases) and phi= 11 +/- 0. 8 deg for quasi-parallel injection (polar-cap model of SNR).

Questions The present status of wrist arthroscopy was investigated by answering the following questions: -What is its current position in the treatment wrist pathologies according to the literature? -What is its current position according to hand surgeons? Methods Analysis of the number of publications on wrist arthroscopy was performed and compared with the number of publications on other arthroscopy topics to assess the current position of wrist arthroscopy. The members of the EWAS (European Wrist Arthroscopy Society) and the members of eight national hand surgery societies were questioned on wrist arthroscopy in daily practice.

This study investigated the biomechanical properties of autogenous and allogenic, free, fresh-frozen tendon grafts with non-anatomical anchoring (femoral: Endobutton, tibial: cortical bridge) in sheep. 54 mature female merino sheep aged between 2 - 3 years were implanted with free long flexor tendon, replacing their anterior cruciate ligament. After 6, 12 and 52 weeks two loading conditions were simulated: an anterior–posterior (AP) drawer test and a load-to-failure test. The autografts demonstrated less anterior translation during anterior–posterior (AP) drawer test than the allografts at all testing points. At 52 weeks, AP laxity of the allografts was significantly larger than in the knee joint with autologous ACL reconstruction. Likewise, the autografts showed superior results in load-to-failure testing. The one-year autograft group recorded nearly twice as much failure load compared to the one-year allograft group. The contrast was statistically significant. A significant increase was observed in the stiffness of failure load and stress between 12 and 52 weeks in autografts. In comparison, the allograft group showed a reduction in stiffness between 12 and 52 weeks. : Although animal research cannot be directly applied to humans, the results should be taken into consideration. The use of allogenic grafts in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, particularly in young, active patients, should be viewed critically.

It is argued that the components affecting CEO pay studied up to today including e. g. company size, performance, industry, and ownership structure are not enough to explain the differences observed in international executive pay. Thus, the analysis is expanded to take into consideration also geographical and cultural influences. In this study geographical distance is measured at the continent level whereas Hofstede's cultural country scores are used to proxy cultural aspects. The study is realized as archival research with a sample of 120 observations from 10 countries and 6 industries. The countries included are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, The United Kingdom and The United States. The industries included are energy, telecom & information technology, machinery, commercial, transport, and chemicals & pharmaceuticals. The compensation data was gathered from the webpages of the companies and the company specific control data from the Orbis database. The data was analysed with statistical methods using SPSS. The results are surprising by nature and challenge the sole reliance on agency theory and agency costs of debt theory in the field of executive compensation: the study indicates that the rational explanations such as company size, profitability, industry, and capital structure often offered to explain the determination of executive pay actually explain only {{a very small percentage of}} the international differences observed in executive compensation practices and in the use of share-based pay systems. On the contrary, the results suggest executive compensation relies very much on geographical and cultural considerations and as a consequence it seems there is no universal fit-for-all compensation practice that can be developed.

These studies have reported small and opposing differences between both modalities. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the outcome of hemodialysis as initial chronic dialysis treatment with that of peritoneal dialysis in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: All new dialysis patients from 38 dialysis centers in The Netherlands without <b>indications</b> <b>against</b> either modality were invited to participate. Patients were assigned to start with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The primary outcome was mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) score. Secondary outcome was survival. RESULTS: Due to the low inclusion rate, the trial was prematurely stopped after which 38 patients had been randomized: 18 patients to hemodialysis and 20 to peritoneal dialysis. The mean QALY score in the first 2 years was 59. 1 (SD 12) for hemodialysis patients versus 54. 0 (SD 19) for peritoneal dialysis patients, which constitutes a small difference in favor of hemodialysis of 5. 1 (95 %CI - 7. 3 to 17. 6) After 5 years of follow-up, nine hemodialysis and five peritoneal dialysis patients had died, a significant difference in survival; hazard ration of hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis of 3. 8 (95 %CI 1. 1 to 12. 6). After adjustment for age, comorbidity, and primary kidney disease the hazard ratio was 3. 6 (0. 8 to 15. 4).

40|$|AbstractThe aquatic {{environment}} is polluted {{with thousands of}} chemicals. It is currently unclear which of these pose a significant threat to aquatic biota. The typical exposure scenario is now represented by a widespread blanket of contamination composed of myriads of individual pollutants—each typically present at a low concentration. The synthetic steroids, 17 α-ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, have been widely reported {{to be present in}} the {{aquatic environment}} in the low ng to sub-ng/l range. They are widely used in contraceptive formulations, both individually and in combination. Our research employed the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) 21 day ‘pair-breeding’ assay to assess reproductive output when pairs of fish were exposed to the single chemicals at low environmentally relevant concentrations, and then to a binary mixture of them. A variety of endpoints were assessed, including egg production, which was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by both the individual chemicals and the mixture. Significant, sex specific effects were also seen with both chemicals, at differing levels of biological organisation. Plasma concentrations of EE 2 and levonorgestrel were predicted {{and in the case of}} levonorgestrel measured, and compared with the human therapeutic plasma concentrations (Read-Across approach) to support the interpretation of the results. A novel quantitative method was developed for the data analysis, which ensured a suitable endpoint for the comparative mixture assessment. This approach compares the reproductive performance from individual pairs of fish during chemical exposure to its pre-treatment performance. The responses from the empirical mixture study were compared to predictions derived from the single substance data. We hypothesised combined responses which were best described by the concept of concentration addition, and found no clear <b>indications</b> <b>against</b> this additivity expectation. However, the effect profiles support the current knowledge that both compounds act in different ways to reduce egg production in fish, and suggest that probably response addition (also called Independent action) is the more appropriate mixture model in this case...|$|E

After adjustment for age, comorbidity, and primary kidney disease the hazard ratio was 3. 6 (0. 8 to 15. 4). ConclusionOnly a small difference in QALY score was observed between patients who started with hemodialysis compared to patients who started with peritoneal dialysis, lending support for the equivalence hypothesis. The significant difference in longer-term survival, which favored peritoneal dialysis in this small group of patients, could be used to posit that incident dialysis patients might benefit from starting on peritoneal dialysis...|$|E
40|$|In the eld of {{particle}} systems and growths models simulation {{is an important}} tool. When explicit calculations are too complex or impossible to perform we may use simulations instead. We adapt a new technique here denoted omniparametric simulation, to the two-type Richardson, Ising and Potts models. Omniparametric means simulating for all parameter values {{at the same time}} giving us something else than ordinary samples, but by xingthe parameter value we can always retrieve an ordinary sample. We use only one dimensional parameters, so for the random cluster and Potts models we x q at some value and consider it known. For the two-type Richardson model we use symmetry and rescale time to eliminate one of the two parameters. We study We study asymmetric simultaneous survival for the twotype Richardson model using omniparametric simulations. The belief is that if both types are equally strong the can survive for all times but if one type is stronger than the other this can not happen. We do not nd any indication of the existence of so called exceptional values < 1 where simultaneous survival may be possible [...] We develop a simple test procedure to see how strong the <b>indications</b> <b>against</b> exceptional values are and also which exceptional values tests may rule out, and also consider how large subsets of Z 2 we must use. For the Ising and Potts models we use omniparametric simulations to nd smooth estimates of functions for model characteristics such as connection probabilities and susceptbility. The characteristics are then used for parameter estimation, we construct both point estimate and condence intervals. Based on partial observations we develop three methods, two using asymptotic theory, and on non-asymptotic. The method for constructing point estimate are the same for all three approaches, the difference lies in ho we capture the variance of the statistic. We perform extensive testing of the methods and elaborate some on the difference between the model used in simulations and the experienced from data...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} whether the {{implementation}} of new technologies has increased the relative demand for highly skilled workers. We use data on Finnish manufacturing plants over the years 1986 - 2002. Our rich plant-level data set covers basically all manufacturing plants which employ at least 25 persons. To empirically tests the hypothesis of skill-biased technical change (SBTC), we apply the general index approach proposed by Baltagi and Rich (2005). This approach {{has the advantage of}} allowing for an unconstrained time path of SBTC. It also avoids the problem of omitted technology variables in the prevalent proxy variable approach. Our paper contributes to the empirical literature on SBTC in several ways. First, we take into account the problems caused by a fractional response variable, a cost share bounded between 0 and 1. In our analysis, we use logit transformation to solve this problem. As logit transformation excludes boundary observations, we check the robustness of our regression estimates by the Bernoulli quasi-maximum likelihood method. Second, because the effect of technology on the factor intensities is presumably different across industries, we allow for different time paths of SBTC across industries. Third, we calculate the bootstrap estimates of the standard errors and confidence intervals for the labour demand elasticity estimates. Our main findings are the following. There is evidence on SBTC in six out of twelve two-character NACE industries. We find <b>indications</b> <b>against</b> the skill-bias hypothesis for one industry. Thereby, our results support the view that there have been some technology-induced changes in labour demand that favour more skilled workers. However, the pattern of SBTC is different across industries. Strong evidence supporting the capital-skill complementarity is also found. Finally, our results show that research and development (R&D) intensity and our index of SBTC correlate negatively,indicating that R&D intensity is one of the sources of skill-biased technical change.

50|$|Industrial {{property}} takes a {{range of}} forms, these include patents for inventions, industrial designs (aesthetic creations related to the appearance of industrial products), trademarks, service marks, layout-designs of integrated circuits, commercial names and designations, geographical <b>indications</b> and protection <b>against</b> unfair competition. In some cases, aspects of an intellectual creation, although present, are less clearly defined. What counts then is that the object of industrial property consists of signs conveying information, in particular to consumers, regarding products and services offered on the market. Protection is directed against unauthorized use of such signs that could mislead consumers, and against misleading practices in general.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 March 2009, Janet Fraser, {{a leading}} {{advocate}} of UC and national convener {{of the highly}} popular Joyous Birth website, lost her child during a birth assisted only by her partner and a female friend. In an interview five days earlier with The Sunday Age, Fraser, {{in the early stages}} of labor at the time, stated that she had at no point during her pregnancy consulted with a health professional, and that she intended to deliver the baby at her home without an attending midwife. The cause of death was reported to be cardiac arrest. A coronial inquest concluded in 2012 that Roisin Fraser's death was the result of a complication resulting from cord entanglement, was almost certainly preventable if the birth had proceeded in a maternity unit, and was probably preventable if the birth at home had been attended by a registered midwife. It also found that Fraser's claim of [...] "birthrape" [...] during her first birth followed a planned homebirth attended by a midwife, where Fraser herself requested transfer to a hospital for epidural anaesthesia, and then subsequently requested a caesarean birth without medical <b>indications</b> and <b>against</b> medical advice.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} processes taking place around strong shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs) depend on the shock obliquity. The measured synchrotron flux {{is a function of}} the aspect angle between interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) and the line of sight. Thus, a model of non-thermal emission from SNRs should account for the orientation of the ambient magnetic field. We develop a new method for the estimation of the aspect angle, based on the comparison between observed and synthesized radio maps of SNRs, making different assumptions about the dependence of electron injection efficiency on the shock obliquity. The method uses the azimuthal profile of radio surface brightness as a probe for orientation of ambient magnetic field because it is almost insensitive to the downstream distribution of magnetic field and emitting electrons. We apply our method to a new radio image of SN 1006 produced on the basis of archival Very Large Array and Parkes data. The image recovers emission from all spatial structures with angular scales from a few arcsec to 15 arcmin. We explore different models of injection efficiency and find the following best-fitting values for the aspect angle of SN 1006 : φo = 70 o ± 4. 2 o if the injection is isotropic, φo = 64 o ± 2. 8 o for quasi-perpendicular injection (SNR has an equatorial belt in both cases) and φo = 11 o ± 0. 8 o for quasi-parallel injection (polar-cap model of SNR). In the last case, SN 1006 is expected to have a centrally peaked morphology contrary to what is observed. Therefore, our analysis provides some <b>indication</b> <b>against</b> the quasi-parallel injection model.
