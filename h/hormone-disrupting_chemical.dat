25|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a <b>hormone-disrupting</b> <b>chemical</b> {{that has}} been implicated in having {{negative}} effects on human health, including, but not limited to, fetal development. As shown in animal studies which mimic human enamel, the mother’s consumption of products with BPA during pregnancy {{can lead to the}} child’s tooth development being obstructed. Those children are shown to be prone to incisor and first molar hypomineralization, a weakened state of the enamel. Additionally, it is most important for mother’s to avoid BPA during pregnancy, but also avoid BPA-use in the child’s products up to five months of age.|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScTuberculosis {{still remains}} one of the world’s killer diseases. Pyrazinamide (PZA) {{is one of the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs due to its ability to significantly shorten the TB treatment period. However, excess PZA in the body caused hepatotoxicity and liver damage. This, together with the resistance of the bacteria to treatment drugs, poor medication and inappropriate dosing, contribute significantly to the high incidents of TB deaths and diseases (such as liver damage). This, therefore, calls for new methods for ensuring reliable dosing of the drug, which will differ from person to person due to inter-individual differences in drug metabolism. A novel biosensor system for monitoring the metabolism of PZA was prepared with a nanocomposite of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), polyaniline (PANI) and cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) electrochemically deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The nanocomposite biosensor system exhibited enhanced electro-activity that is attributed to the catalytic effect of the incorporated MWCNTs. The biosensor had a sensitivity of 7. 80 μA/ μg mL- 1 PZA and a dynamic linear range (DLR) of 4. 92 – 160 ng/mL PZA. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a <b>hormone-disrupting</b> <b>chemical</b> used in production of epoxy resins and polycarbonates, which produce various products used on a daily basis. However, BPA can leach out of plastic during normal use and cause health effects such as cancer or disrupt the endocrine system. Moreover, BPA has also been proven to degrade from the containers in landfills and accumulate in groundwater and streams, thereby, polluting the environment while destroying aquatic organisms. Therefore, this also calls for new selective and sensitive methods for the monitoring of BPA. A novel biosensor system for monitoring the oxidation of BPA was prepared from a nanocomposite of polyaniline, polymethyl methacrylate and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, also electrochemically deposited on the GCE. Biosensor fabrication was conducted by immobilization of the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) iii onto the nanocomposite film. The nanobiosensor also revealed enhanced electro activity, attributed to the incorporation of TiO 2 nanoparticles. The biosensor system had a sensitivity of 0. 3 μA/nM and a detection limit of 0. 12 nM. This detection limit falls within the range of the allowed daily intake of BPA as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, USA) and other regulatory bodies...|$|E

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple {{capillary}} zone electrophoretic (CZE) method {{has been developed}} for analysis of cathepsin D activity in MCF- 7 cells. Enzyme active suspension was separated and incubated with hemoglobin as a substrate. Specific peptides were then separated and analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis with on-column sample stacking. The CZE conditions, including the organic solvents used, their concentrations, and pH and separation voltage, were optimized. The results showed that dilution of the sample with acetonitrile was compensated by using large-volume injection in the stacking procedure. The limit of determination of the method was dramatically improved. This relatively rapid and simple means of determination of cathepsin D activity was successfully used to assay the expression of cathepsin D in cultured MCF- 7 cells, to evaluate the estrogenic activity of <b>hormone-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> present in the environment...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic <b>hormone-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{may play}} a role in the {{increased}} frequency of cryptorchidism observed in some studies. We used a spatial ecological design to search for variations in orchidopexy rates in the province of Granada in Spain and to search for relationships between these differences and geographical variations in exposure to pesticides. Orchidopexy rates were estimated for the period from 1980 to 1991 in all municipalities and health care districts served by the University of Granada Hospital. A random sample of males of the same age (1 - 16 years) admitted for any reason during the same period was used to estimate inpatient control rates. Each municipality was assigned to one of four levels of pesticide use. We used Poisson homogeneity tests to detect significant differences in rates of orchidopexy between districts and between levels of pesticide use. Poisson and logistic regression models were also used to estimate the strength of association between orchidopexy and level of pesticide use. Orchidopexy rates tended to be higher in districts near the Mediterranean coast where intensive farming is widespread. The city of Granada, where the reference hospital is located, also had higher figures both for orchidopexy and inpatient control rates. Regression models showed that the strength of association between orchidopexy and level of pesticide use tended to increase with higher levels of use, with the exception of level 0 (mainly in the city of Granada). Our results are compatible with a hypothetical association between exposure to hormone-disruptive chemicals and the induction of cryptorchidism. Several methodological limitations in the design make it necessary to evaluate the results with caution...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{evidence}} suggests that humans and wildlife species may experience adverse health consequences from exposure to environmental chemicals that interact with the endocrine system. Reliable short-term assays are needed to identify <b>hormone-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals.</b> In this study we demonstrate that the estrogenic activity of a chemical can be evaluated by assaying induction or repression of endogenous estrogen-regulated "marker genes" in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells. We included four marker genes in the assay [...] pS 2, transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFbeta 3), monoamine oxidase A, and [alpha] 1 -antichymotrypsin [...] and we evaluated estrogenic activity for 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)), diethylstilbestrol, [alpha]-zearalanol, nonylphenol, genistein, methoxychlor, endosulphan, o,p-DDE, bisphenol A, dibutylphthalate, 4 -hydroxy tamoxifen, and ICI 182. 780. All four marker genes responded strongly to the three high-potency estrogens (E(2), diethylstilbestrol, and [alpha]-zearalanol), whereas the potency of the other chemicals was 10 (3) - to 10 (6) -fold {{lower than that of}} E(2). There were some marker gene-dependent differences in the relative potencies of the tested chemicals. TGFbeta 3 was equally sensitive to the three high-potency estrogens, whereas the sensitivity to [alpha]-zearalanol was approximately 10 -fold lower than the sensitivity to E(2) and diethylstilbestrol when assayed with the other three marker genes. The potency of nonylphenol was equal to that of genistein when assayed with pS 2 and TGFbeta 3, but 10 - to 100 -fold higher/lower with monoamine oxidase A and [alpha] 1 -antichymotrypsin, respectively. The results are in agreement with results obtained by other methods and suggest that an assay based on endogenous gene expression may offer an attractive alternative to other E-SCREEN methods...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} indicates that certain chemicals in the environment [...] known as hormone or endocrine disruptors [...] cause developmental and reproductive abnormalities in humans and animals. Studies of wildlife show associations between <b>hormone-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the environment and declining populations, thinning eggshells, morphologic abnormalities, and impaired viability of offspring. Scientists also have postulated a relationship between these chemicals and abnormalities and diseases in humans, including declining sperm counts; breast, testicular, and prostate cancers; and neurological disorders, including cognitive and neurobehavioral effects. While continuing {{to learn about the}} effects and interactions these chemicals have on humans and wildlife, scientists recently began working with policy makers to develop a testing program and identify chemicals that require further regulation. One individual in particular has helped to amass and interpret the scientific evidence on endocrine disruptors, thereby stimulating the interest in and funding for endocrine disruptor research that continues today. Her name is Theo Colborn. Last year, Colborn, a senior scientist at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Washington, DC, received one of the most honored environmental awards [...] the Blue Planet Prize [...] an award established by Japan's Asahi Glass Foundation at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The foundation recognized Colborn for her "systematic research that certain types of chemical compounds pose a danger as disruptors of endocrine systems to the development, function, survival, and reproduction of wild organisms and people. " [1] Colborn is credited for her synthesis of scientific evidence and her facilitation of multidisciplinary symposia that have focused the attention of many scientists and policy makers worldwide on the potential effects of scores of agricultural and industrial chemicals on the body's endocrine system (see the box below) ...|$|R
