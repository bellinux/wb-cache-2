6000|$|... "I {{found her}} on deck--crying. She had been tearing up some photographs, and she {{talked a little}} wildly. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> then for a little time." ...|$|E
60|$|W.A. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of {{the laws}} of marriage, the reason of such compacts, whereby order and justice is maintained; without which men would run from their wives and children, to the {{dissolution}} of families or inheritances.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never did}} give me any--not the {{least in the}} world, when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> myself," [...] said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. [...] "But when I asked Mr. Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sometimes. She {{is totally}} {{different}} from Angela Vivian--not nearly so cultivated; but she seems very charming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your charming ward," [...] Cecil answered, [...] "has as many whims and fancies as an elf. She yawns when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{and looks}} longingly {{after one of}} my villagers. Hang the fellow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} it would," [...] Richard admitted. [...] "I think when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> she'll {{understand}} that I care {{more than any of}} the others. If {{you want to know the}} reason, that's why I'm so hopeful." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{almost every}} day of working hard; and, in short, I did nothing but work and cry all day, which grieved the good, kind woman so much, that at last she began to be {{concerned}} for me, for she loved me very well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, she knowed {{no more of}} a chowder, than if the sea wern't in the neighbourhood, {{and there}} wern't {{such a thing as}} a fish in all England. When <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of a chowder, she gave in, like a Spaniard at the fourth or fifth broadside." ...|$|E
60|$|To efface {{from her}} mind the memory {{of such a thing}} on such a day, <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as we cantered out into the country, of the life to come, of the mother that waited to welcome us, and of the glad tidings with which we were to rejoice her on that Christmas day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} feel that I'm making none. She {{looks at me}} half amused and half astonished when I express my opinions; I have to keep a curb on myself when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> In fact, I've once or twice got mad. I can take a joke, but her condescending smile is riling." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{complement}} {{of many other}} verbs used intransitively, including need and dare (when not used as modal-like verbs), want, expect, try, hope, agree, refuse, etc. These are raising-to-subject verbs, where the logical subject is promoted {{to the position of}} subject of the governing verb. With some verbs the infinitive may carry a significantly different meaning from a gerund: compare <b>I</b> stopped <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with <b>I</b> stopped <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> or <b>I</b> forgot to buy the bread with I forgot buying the bread.|$|R
6000|$|She {{explained}} if Lagune dismissed <b>her</b> she was <b>to</b> go {{into the}} country to an aunt, a sister of Chaffery's who needed a companion. Chaffery insisted upon that. [...] "Companion they call it. I shall be just a servant--she has no servant. My mother cries when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She tells me she doesn't {{want me to go}} away from her. But she's afraid of him. 'Why don't you do what he wants?' she says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Curiosity was {{the poor}} child's foible. I could see, as <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> that her {{thoughts}} were elsewhere (as yours, my friend, have been absent {{once or twice}} to-night). To know the secret of Masonry was the wretched child's mad desire. With a thousand wiles, smiles, caresses, she strove to coax it from me--from ME--ha! ha! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he persists, [...] "I saw {{her only}} a week ago. It was in Lucerne, while I was {{waiting for you to}} come on from England. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> three or four times altogether. And her face--the change in her! I can't get it out of my head--night or day. The miserable waste of her...." ...|$|E
6000|$|I wandered {{far that}} night, very far. Some girl accosted me, a thin-faced ruined child younger by {{a year or}} so than myself. I remembered how <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> foolish {{rambling}} talk. [...] "If you loved a man, and he was poor, you'd wait," [...] I said, [...] "you'd stick to him. You'd not leave him just to get married to a richer man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> came over from Colmar when I {{heard of this}} {{marriage}} on purpose that <b>I</b> might <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> had at any rate {{a right to do}} that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{my mother}} cried out with grief {{that the child}} should be ill, the poor Queen replied with that good-humoured laugh with which she met all the inconveniences that {{concerned}} herself alone: 'Oh, no, Madame, not ill, only cold! We cannot get any firewood, and so bed is the safest place for my little maid, who cares not if she can have <b>her</b> mother <b>to</b> play with <b>her!</b> Here is a new playfellow for thee, ma mie. Sweet Nan will sit by thee, and make thee sport, while <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bella? Oh, your brother's wife! <b>I</b> wasn't <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> I've been sulking in corners {{ever since}} I {{concluded}} {{you were not}} coming. How beautiful you are, Beatrice! You'll let an old friend say that much, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mademoiselle, {{you have}} read me strangely {{if you think}} that. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with my lips, yes--but it was of you I was {{thinking}}. I was thinking that you were born to {{play a part in}} many dramas, that you have the fatal beauty which is rare in all ages." [...] The Vicomte bent towards her, and his voice became caressing. [...] "You cannot realize how beautiful you are," [...] he sighed.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{remember}} who was there, except Dora. I have {{not the least}} idea what we had for dinner, besides Dora. My impression is, that I dined off Dora, entirely, and sent away half-a-dozen plates untouched. I sat next to her. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She had the most delightful little voice, the gayest little laugh, the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways, that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery. She was rather diminutive altogether. So much the more precious, I thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when she}} saw the young lady look out of the window the old lady knocked again; and when nobody came she took up the furze-hook and looked at it, and put it down again, and then she looked at the faggot-bonds; and then she went away, and walked across to me, and blowed her breath very hard, like this. We walked on together, she and I, and <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and she talked to me a bit, but not much, because she couldn't blow her breath." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would depend}} upon how the thing went. When <b>I</b> do <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> it always seems that nothing I say can be right. Now, {{if you will}} give it her {{you can put in}} all manner of pretty things." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2015, South Korean tabloid newspaper, Dispatch, {{revealed}} that IU and South Korean singer-songwriter Chang Kiha have been dating. The two met in late 2013 when IU participated {{as a guest}} on a radio show Chang was hosting and started their relationship shortly after. On their 11-year age gap, Chang remarked, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> we're on the same wavelength more often than we feel an age gap. Rather than focus on trying to overcome the age gap, {{it serves as a}} means to learn from each other." [...] On January 23, 2017 both singers' labels confirmed that the two had broken up after 3 years of dating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Somehow <b>I</b> can't <b>talk</b> {{about this}} <b>to</b> Edith. It is ridiculous, I know. But {{in some way}} I can't.... It isn't fair <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> If I could, I would.... Quite soon after we were married <b>I</b> ceased <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> mean <b>talking</b> really and simply--as I do to you. And it's never come back. I don't know why.... And {{particularly}} <b>I</b> can't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of Hugh.... Little things, little shadows of criticism, but {{enough to make it}} impossible.... And I go about thinking about Hugh, and what has happened to him sometimes... as though I was stifling." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{wife was}} curiously silent {{throughout}} the drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> reassuringly, {{pointing out that}} the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.|$|E
6000|$|While I {{waited for}} Nettie and Verrall in this {{agreeable}} trysting place, I {{talked to the}} landlady--a broad-shouldered, smiling, freckled woman--about {{the morning of the}} Change. That motherly, abundant, red-haired figure of health was buoyantly sure that everything in the world was now to be changed for the better. That confidence, and something in her voice, made me love her as <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Now we're awake," [...] she said, [...] "all sorts of things will be put right that hadn't any sense in them. Why? Oh! I'm sure of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not know}} about meaning. I like reality, and I will have it too. I {{consulted}} herself, and was more forbearing than most fathers would be. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about it, and she promised me that she would do her best to entertain the man. Now she receives him and me with an old frock and a sulky face. Who pays for her clothes? She has everything she wants,--just as a daughter, {{and she would not}} take the trouble to change her dress to grace my friend,--as you did, as any daughter would! I am angry with her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{her husband}} is laid off again. <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> quite a while this afternoon.... Oh, dear, I do get so lonely for you, sweetheart, with nothing to do. But I did read some Kim this afternoon. I liked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, to be sure. <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Looking {{very well}} indeed." [...] Then {{there was a}} {{considerable}} pause; for Charlotte could not at once make Madeline understand why {{she was to be}} sent home in a hurry without her brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather {{think you}} are mistaken, for when <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{yesterday}} of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed {{that there was no}} immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time." ...|$|R
60|$|After we had dinner, {{which was}} as English as the British lion, and much more to our taste than {{anything}} we had had in London, Jone went out to smoke a pipe, and I had a talk with Miss Pondar about fish, meat, and groceries, and about housekeeping matters in general. Miss Pondar, whose general aspect of minister's wife began to wear off when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> mingles respectfulness and respectability in a manner I haven't been {{in the habit of}} seeing. Generally those two things run against each other, but they don't in her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] he answered. [...] "She {{offered it}} {{of her own}} accord. I {{do not know why}} <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of my own affairs, but she led me on to speak of them. Your sister is a {{wonderful}} person," [...] he continued, dropping his voice. [...] "I don't know why, but she made me talk as no one else has ever made me talk before. I simply had to tell her things. Then, when I had finished, she showed me her bankbooks and suggested that she should invest some of her money in the Rise." ...|$|E
60|$|The squint-eyed {{woman was}} not so hard to manage. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{as if she were}} some male friend of mine, only {{appealing}} to her womanliness with all the soft sadness I could press into the tones of my voice. In the end she was mollified, and even tender and motherly in her feelings toward the unfortunate family. I left on her dresser the half-crown I shrank from offering her, and, having reduced the comb-wearer also, I marched off, carrying the stewpot and the fragments of the ill-fated doe to the cottage of the widow, where George and the girls awaited me.|$|E
60|$|I {{would be}} her friend, I {{repeated}} to myself, I would be <b>her</b> friend. <b>I</b> would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> often, plan with her, work with her. I could put my meanings into her life and she should throw her beauty over mine. I began already to dream of the talk of to-morrow's meeting....|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. Then do tell <b>her</b> <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> particularly. <b>I</b> {{have been}} waiting here all the morning <b>to</b> see either <b>her</b> or Robert.|$|R
60|$|Of course, <b>I</b> began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{about her}} former husband. I {{asked her how}} he was getting on. She replied that {{she thought he was}} very comfortable.|$|R
