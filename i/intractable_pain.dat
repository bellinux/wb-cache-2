Methods Three cases of <b>intractable</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> with poor medicine efficacy or serious adverse drug reactions had been followed-up for 6 - 14 months after being implanted programmable intrathecal infusion pump. Pain relief, sleep quality improvement, dosage of oral analgesics and drug side effect were observed. Results After treatment the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 3 patients decreased significantly, with pain releasing from preoperative moderate or severe pain to postoperative mild pain and decrease of fulminating pain frequency. Dosage of oral analgesics declined to 10 % of its preoperative dose and sleep quality was improved obviously. Neither postoperative complications nor side effect of morphine was observed during the follow-up. Conclusion The treatment of implanting a totally programmable continuous intrathecal infusion pump is eutherapeutic to the patients with <b>intractable</b> neuropathic <b>pain</b> who have achieved satisfactory analgesic effect in experimental therapy...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Intractable</b> <b>pain,</b> {{also known}} as <b>Intractable</b> <b>Pain</b> Disease or IP, is a severe, {{constant}} pain that is not curable by any known means and which causes a bed or house-bound state and early death if not adequately treated, usually with opioids and/or interventional procedures. It is not relieved by ordinary medical, surgical, nursing, or pharmaceutical measures. Unlike the more common chronic pain, it causes adverse biologic effects on the body's cardiovascular, hormone, and neurologic systems. Patients experience changes in testosterone, estrogen, cortisol, thyroid hormones, and/or pituitary hormones. Both men and women require testosterone, however many doctors neglect to test women for low testosterone.

40|$|Background: Pancreatic calculi is {{distinctly}} {{uncommon in}} children and usually present wit recurrent abdominal pain. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of longitudinal pancreatico-jejunostomy in relieving <b>intractable</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> in children with pancreatic calculi. Methods: this prospective study was conducted from 2003 - 2009 at Paediatric Surgery Department of BSMMU. Ductal decompression by longitudinal pancreatic jejunostomy (LPJ) was done in 14 children (10 male, 4 female) suffering from <b>intractable</b> abdominal <b>pain</b> due to pancreatic calculi. The operative outcomes were divided in to satisfactory and unsatisfactory according to whether the patients were completely or almost completely relieved of pain or continued to be troubled by pain. The main outcome measures were pain relief, postoperative morbidity and mortality. Results: There was no mortality and no significant postoperative morbidity. 14 patients were followed up till 2009. The mean follow-up period were 22 (range 8 - 72) months. Operative results was satisfactory (no pain) in 12 patients and unsatisfactory (moderate pain) in 2 patients. Complete pain relief was seen 12 patients.

Results: Upon experiencing excellent pain relief over the next two days during the trial, the patients were implanted with permanent leads and rechargeable or non-rechargeable generators two to four weeks later and reported sustained pain relief during following 12 months after implantation. Conclusion: We conclude that SCS offers an alternative treatment option for <b>intractable</b> post-herniorrhaphy <b>pain.</b> This type of treatment should be considered for use in a select group of patients when all conventional treatments failed...|$|R
