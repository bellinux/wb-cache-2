This project was supported by Savatech d. o. o. Kranj. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology of <b>floating</b> containment <b>boom</b> made of PVC has focused on a comprehensive analysis {{of this type of}} booms, which are used around the world. Based on this knowledge and over 25 years of experiences with rubber booms, a new type of PVC boom was developed.

Boom has small volume when packed for transport and is simple and quick to deploy. It is made of UV and oil resistant material. Practical implications: The new type of oil boom was tested in clean water and is available for application in oil spill accidents. Also calculations for salt water were made.

40|$|A {{multi-phase}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{method is}} developed {{to model the}} failure process of a flexible oil boom. An algorithm is proposed based on the dynamic boundary particles (DBPs) for preventing the particle disorders during the multi-fluid particle movement around the solid boundary. The improved multi-phase SPH model is firstly validated by the experimental data of a wedge falling into a two-layer oil-water fluid. Then a numerical wave-current flume is established with an active absorbing piston-type wave generator and a circulating current system. The model reliability is validated against the measured vertical profiles of velocity. Simulation of the flexible <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> movement is implemented by introducing a Rigid Module and Flexible Connector (RMFC) multi-body system. The model is finally applied to the simulation of movement of a flexible <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> in containing industrial gear oil under the combined waves and currents. Good agreements are obtained between the SPH modeling results and the experimental data {{in terms of the}} ambient wave-current field, hydrodynamic responses of the floating body and evolution process of the oil slick for the flexible boom. The hydrodynamic responses and containment performances of the flexible <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> are also compared with those of the rigid one. It is found from both the experimental and numerical results that two vortices of the water phase exist in the front and rear of the boom skirt {{and the size of the}} front vortex decreases with an increase of the current velocity while the wake vortex is reversed. It is also found that the skirt of the flexible boom has a larger magnitude of the swaying and rolling than the rigid one and the maximum quantity of the escaped oil of a flexible boom within one wave cycle is about 5 % more than a rigid one under the present test conditions...|$|E

They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of the oil and they used sorbents to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove the oil completely, chemicals called dispersants are used to hasten the oil’s degradation to prevent the oil from doing further damage to the marine habitats below the surface water.

Severe physical- and radiological-access restrictions made the task of characterizing the World War II-era underground radioactive storage tanks at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) particularly challenging. The innovative and inexpensive tank characterization system (TCS) developed to meet this challenge at ORNL is worthy of consideration for use in similar remediation projects. The TCS is a floating system that uses the existing water in the tank as a platform that supports instruments and samplers mounted on a <b>floating</b> <b>boom.</b> TCS operators feed the unit into an existing port of the tank to be characterized. Once inserted, the system`s position is controlled by rotation and by insertion and withdrawal of the boom. The major components of the TCS system include the following: (1) boom support system that consists of a boom support structure and a <b>floating</b> <b>boom,</b> (2) video camera and lights, (3) sludge grab sampler, (4) wall chip sampler, and (5) sonar depth finder. This simple design allows access to all parts of a tank. Moreover, the use of off-the-shelf components keeps the system inexpensive and minimizes maintenance costs. The TCS proved invaluable in negotiating the hazards of ORNL`s Gunite and Associated Tanks, which typically contain a layer of radioactive sludge, have only one to three access ports that are usually only 12 - or 24 -in. in diameter, and range from 12 to 50 ft in diameter.

40|$|The Ocean Cleanup {{proposes to}} place a huge barrier in the ocean in order to clean it from plastic waste. Plastic will be caught as it flows towards the barrier on the ocean’s currents. As such a {{structure}} has no precedent, the concept has to be engineered {{from the bottom up}} and tested extensively. The barrier has a relatively shallow draft and moves in the splash zone, making it difficult to model the barrier’s behaviour. First, this study focusses on the development of a numerical two dimensional (2 D) hydro-elastic model. This model {{has to be able to}} simulate the motions of such a barrier as observed in two dimensional tests and allows for a better understanding of the barrier’s hydrodynamic behaviour. The wave forces on the barrier are calculated with the Morison equation, which is often used in offshore hydrodynamics to calculate the wave forces on slender members. Including all details necessary for a correct simulation, the model is simplified wherever possible. This reduces runtime so that the model can be used for simulations for a fatigue assessment in the second part of this thesis. These assumptions are validated using the results from 2 D tests carried out by Deltares. In addition, another student will develop a CFD model to validate these simplifications by an alternative way. The results of the validation using the 2 D tests suggest that the motions can be simulated very well using this approach. The validation also shows that the horizontal position of the barrier seems to be mostly affected by the forces on the screen, while the vertical position is dominated by the buoyancy force of the <b>floating</b> <b>boom.</b> The second part of this study consists of a first qualitative assessment of the fatigue life of the barrier. Earlier tests have shown that the loads on the barrier are relatively low. This is why fatigue is expected to play an important role, given the fact that the barrier will be deployed for about 5 to 10 years. Fatigue life of the rubber component at the point where the <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> is connected to the plastic capturing screen is investigated. To carry out this assessment, the prototype currently deployed in the North Sea is used as a starting point. The hydro-elastic model from the first part of this thesis is used to simulate the barrier’s motions. Using a structural model which simulates the rubber’s behaviour, these motions are superimposed from the global to the local structure. For this structural model a hyperelastic material that resembles the rubber component is assumed. After superimposing the barrier’s motions, fatigue life of the barrier is calculated using a damage model suitable for rubber. The results show that fatigue life seems to be dominated by seastates with steep waves or with large velocity and acceleration amplitudes. Also, the fatigue life in the Pacific Ocean will be about two and a half to three times longer than for one deployed in the North Sea.

40|$|Abstract]: An {{effective}} {{mechanical method}} of confining the oil spills {{in an open}} ocean is to use barriers such as <b>floating</b> <b>booms.</b> However, the confined oil may leak beneath a boom if either the towing speed of the boom or the amount of oil is too large. In this paper a simple mathematical model based on the potential theory is presented for the two-layer (oil and water) flow near a vertical barrier. A set of non-linear integral equations is formulated and solved numerically. For the indirect approach we adopted to solve the non-linear integral equations, the water velocity at the water-oil upstream contact point becomes a determining parameter of the final results. It is shown that the oil leakage under the barrier is impossible if the contact point is a stagnation one. For other non-stagnation cases, {{we were able to}} compute flows up to critical Froude numbers beyond which the oil will leak underneath the barrier...|$|R

Currently, the most common type of installment is a steel panel guide wall attached to a <b>floating</b> <b>boom.</b> While less utilized than other guidance structure options (e. g. louvers and bar racks), guide walls have been gaining popularity, particularly within the Northwest United States.

40|$|Previous oil {{containment}} booms have an {{open top}} that allows natural gas to escape, and have significant oil leakage due to wave action. Also, a subsea pyramid oil trap exists, but cannot move relative to moving oil plumes from deepsea oil leaks. The solution is to have large, moveable oil traps. One version floats on the sea surface and has a flexible tarp cover and a lower weighted skirt to completely entrap the floating oil and natural gas. The device must have at least three sides with boats pulling at each apex, and sonar or other system to track the slowly moving oil plume, so that the boats can properly locate the booms. The oil trap device must also have a means for removal of the oil and the natural gas. A second design version has a flexible pyramid cover that is attached by lines to ballast on the ocean floor. This is similar to fixed, metal pyramid oil capture devices in the Santa Barbara Channel {{off the coast of}} California. The ballast lines for the improved design, however, would have winches that can move the pyramid to always be located above the oil and gas plume. A third design is a combination of the first two. It uses a submerged pyramid to trap oil, but has no anchor and uses boats to locate the trap. It has ballast weights located along the bottom of the tarp and/or at the corners of the trap. The improved floating oil-spill containment device has a large <b>floating</b> <b>boom</b> and weighted skirt surrounding the oil and gas entrapment area. The device is triangular (or more than three sides) and has a flexible tarp cover with a raised gas vent area. Boats pull on the apex of the triangles to maintain tension and to allow the device to move to optimum locations to trap oil and gas. The gas is retrieved from a higher buoyant part of the tarp, and oil is retrieved from the floating oil layer contained in the device. These devices can be operated in relatively severe weather, since waves will break over the devices without causing oil leaking. Also, natural gas is entrapped and can be retrieved. All designs can use sonar to locate the moving oil plume, and then be relocated by using boats or winches to move the oil trapping devices. These devices can be constructed of treated, non-permeable DuPont Kevlar cloth (or similar material) ...|$|E

Oilblotter, trade name of the Anderson Cob Mills' new anti-pollution product, is an absorbent of vegetable origin for removing oil from water and other surfaces quickly and efficiently. According to David I. B. Vander Hooven, Executive Vice-President of the mills, Oilblotter has been undergoing research and develop­ment since early 1969 and has been successfully demon­strated for federal, state and marine industry officials in both fresh and salt water and under both hot and cold temperature conditions in Canada, Texas and Florida. Mr. Vander Hooven flew to Kentucky to personally oversee the demonstration of the product which is used after a slick is contained by means of a <b>floating</b> <b>boom.</b> O ilblotter, which is non-toxic and subject to normal organic decomposition, absorbs oil immediately upon contact and is then skimmed off for burning or other means of disposal. Affiliated with The Andersons of Maumee, the Ander­son Cob Mills, Inc., are primary producers of a versatile, tough-textured natural cellulose grit derived from corn cobs, which is used in a number of manu­facturing processes including de-burring, burnishing and finishing metal parts, blast cleaning, and as carriers of agricultural chemicals. Grit-O-Cobs and Lite-R-Cobs, registered trade names, are also used by foundries, fur cleaners and cosmetic manufacturers.

Annual Sugar Beet Field Tour Held Recently In Oh io Areas The Farmers' and Manufacturers' Beet Sugar Associ· ation of Saginaw, Michigan, held its annual sugar beet field tour i. n the Fremont and Findlay, Ohio areas recently, reports Glenn E. Maddy, county extension agent. They visited the sugar beet fields of Melvin Schulte, Woodville; Carl and Theodore Kaiser of Graytown; Wilson Damschroder, Lindsey; Rollin Turnow, Curtice; Harold Draeger, Lindsey; Emil Webert, Elmore, and toured the new additions to the Fremont factory of the Northern Ohio Sugar Company. The main items observed were the planting of beets to a stand-that is, the farmer planted beets at the rate of four seeds per foot with no blocking done. The weed control material was Pyramin+ TCA. Then in many of the cases, they had labor removing the weeds with long· handled hoes. This is a very common practice in Michigan, the planting of beets to stand without using labor. The Kaiser Brothers used a John Deere electronic thinner to remove their excess beets. The beets were planted at two inches apart, and then were reduced to approximately one foot apart. This thinning mach­ine can do two acres per hour. The machine covers six rows at a time.

In this research, there are two types of connection, hinged or drilled hole that will be used to connect the piers and the booms. Three types of material were used which are Styrofoam, bamboo, and PVC. Total six booms were created and tested with five different flow rates. An amount of 200 g of debris was put into the open channel to test the <b>floating</b> debris <b>boom.</b> The results indicated that hinged connection is stronger than drilled-hole connection to connect the piers and the booms as it provided a free movement for the boom to move. For the type of material, Styrofoam proved that it has the best effectiveness for capturing the debris due to its lighter weight among the three materials. Based on the data obtained, <b>floating</b> debris <b>boom</b> which is made from Styrofoam and connected by hinged connection has the best performance and effectiveness for capturing the debris in this experiment. Eventually, this finding may contribute toward the minimization of river pollution happening in Malaysia...|$|R
50|$|This is an {{electrified}} freight-only branch {{used primarily}} for loading logs from <b>booms</b> <b>floated</b> down the river. Originally called the Supung Hoan Line, it was opened by the P'yŏngbuk Railway on 30 September 1940.|$|R
50|$|The two {{communities}} of Minneapolis and St. Anthony shared {{the resources of}} the Falls. Both towns grew quickly and developed a number of industries at the falls. The earliest waterpowered facilities were sawmills; flour mills soon followed. For many years river crossing between the communities was via a rope-drawn ferry, by foot when the river surface was frozen, or on <b>floating</b> log <b>booms</b> that often filled the channel.|$|R
500|$|Scapa Flow made a near-ideal anchorage. Situated at {{the centre}} of the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland, the natural harbour, large enough to contain the entire Grand Fleet, was {{surrounded}} by a ring of islands separated by shallow channels subject to fast-racing tides. The threat from U-boats had however long been realised, and a series of countermeasures were installed {{during the early years of}} the First World War. Blockships were sunk at critical points, and <b>floating</b> <b>booms</b> deployed to block the three widest channels, and operated by tugboats to allow the passage of friendly shipping. [...] It was considered possible—but highly unlikely—that a daring U-boat commander could attempt to race through undetected before the boom was closed. Two submarines that had attempted infiltration during the First World War were ill-fated: on 23 November 1914 [...] was rammed twice before running aground with the capture of her crew, and [...] was detected by hydrophone and destroyed with the loss of all hands on 28 October 1918.|$|R

500|$|Two {{reinforced}} concrete retaining walls extend [...] upstream {{from the northeast}} and northwest corners of the generator building, forming a triangle and serve as an anchor for a <b>floating</b> trash <b>boom</b> which keeps refuse out of the turbine pits. A similar triangle is formed by two {{reinforced concrete}} retaining walls extending [...] downriver from {{the south side of}} the generator building. A concrete retaining wall extends an additional [...] south from the tip of this triangle.|$|R
5000|$|A massive {{response}} ensued {{to protect}} beaches, wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships, <b>floating</b> <b>booms,</b> controlled burns and [...] of Corexit oil dispersant. Due to the months-long spill, along with adverse {{effects from the}} response and cleanup activities, extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries was reported. [...] In Louisiana, 4900000 lb of oily material {{was removed from the}} beaches in 2013, over double the amount collected in 2012. Oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on 55 mi of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013. Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the waters off the Florida Panhandle and Tampa Bay, where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand. [...] In 2013 it was reported that dolphins and other marine life continued to die in record numbers with infant dolphins dying at six times the normal rate. [...] One study released in 2014 reported that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening and another study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill.|$|R
