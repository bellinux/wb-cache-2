50|$|The {{control or}} {{inspection}} of precious metals was an ancient concept of examination and marking, {{by means of}} <b>inspection</b> <b>stamps</b> (punch marks). The use of hallmarks, at first on silver, {{has a long history}} dating back to the 4th century AD — there is evidence of silver bars marked under authority of the Emperor Augustinian around AD 350 — and represents the oldest known form of consumer protection. A series or system of five marks has been found on Byzantine silver dating from this period, though their interpretation is still not completely resolved.|$|R

5000|$|Originally, {{the album}} was {{released}} in March 1995 on independent Seattle label, PopLlama Records. This version of {{the album was}} noticeably different than other subsequent releases.

The CD looked like a food <b>inspection</b> <b>stamp.</b> [...] "Feather Pluckn" [...] included a verse which was somewhat of a parody of The Beatles' [...] "I've Got a Feeling". The PopLlama release was also pressed on yellow vinyl with two bonus tracks. After the band signed to Columbia Records, the album was re-released on July 25, 1995. This version's inside cover featured a picture of the band members painted in red, white and blue in multiple pictures. The CD looks like a vinyl record label. All of the songs were re-mixed, and [...] "Feather Pluckn" [...] lost the [...] "I've Got A Feeling" [...] verse. In 2004, the band independently re-released the album as a Ten Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition. It featured 13 bonus tracks, including b-sides and demos, and a bonus DVD of music videos and performance footage. In 2008, the album was re-released for a final time by the band's current label, Fugitive Recordings. This version features the food inspection stamp-like design that originally appeared on the 1995 edition. The insert picture features a collage of band performances. In addition, the liner notes were slightly updated.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the associations between the products' market price and attributes related to fish purchase and consumption within a university community in Brazil. A structured questionnaire consisting of a five-point Likert scale was used. It was previously tested and made available to the university community via the Internet. The sample comprised 1966 voluntaries including university students and faculty and staff members. A descriptive analysis of data was performed using Spearman's correlation analysis. The results showed that the majority of the respondents (56 %) consume fish at home; some consume fish at restaurants (39 %), and 5 % at family or friends' houses, reinforcing the idea that variables such as culture and reference groups are fundamental determinants of purchase and consumption behavior. It was identified a significant (p < 0. 001) and very strong correlation between the attributes price and nutritional value (r = 0. 92); price and availability at the usual places of purchase (r = 0. 92); price and packaging (r = 0. 92); price and brand name (r = 0. 91); and price and of the Federal <b>Inspection</b> <b>stamp</b> (r = 0. 91) and a low positive correlation (p < 0. 001) between the price variable and the initiative for fish traceability (r = 0. 16). This study demonstrated that the price of fish is associated with the quality of the product and the attributes related to it such as packaging, nutritional value, and availability of the product in the market...|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} 1896 and 1897 Steyr-manufactured Krag rifles {{resembling}} the M1894 Norwegian and chambered in 6.5×55, but lacking some Norwegian inspection markings and having serial numbers outside the sequences of those produced for Norway, were in Boer hands {{during the second}} Boer War of 1899-1902—most have serial numbers below 900. Markings show these rifles were manufactured by Steyr concurrently with a large order of M1894 rifles made for Norway. Some parts of rejected Norwegian rifles {{may have been used}} in these weapons—many small parts have serial numbers that do not match receiver numbers, these mismatched small parts sometimes have numbers in ranges of rifles made for Norway, yet appear original to the rifle. Photographs of high-ranking Boer officers holding M1894-like rifles exist. Cartridge casings in 6.5×55 have been found on the Magersfontein battlefield and may have been fired by such M1894-like rifles. Some sources state that about 100 1896-date and at least about 200 1897-date rifles reached the Boers. Some rifles meeting this description exist in South African museums with Boer-war documentation, and in England documented as captured bring-backs. A few rifles having Norwegian inspector stamps and serial numbers in the civilian marksmanship organization serial number range are also known to be in South African museums and may have been used by Boer forces—it is suspected that these may have arrived in South Africa with a small Scandinavian volunteer force that fought for the Boers. A small number of Steyr 1897 M1894-like 6.5×55 rifles with 3-digit serial numbers outside the Norwegian contract ranges and in the same range as these Boer Krags, and lacking Norwegian <b>inspection</b> <b>stamps</b> like the low-numbered 1897 rifles in South African museums, are known to exist in the USA—it is not known if these have Boer connections or were initially delivered elsewhere.|$|R

5000|$|The book Tobacco in Colonial Virginia ("The Sovereign Remedy") by Melvin Herndon {{describes}} {{operation of}} the public warehouses as follows:In 1730 the most comprehensive inspection bill ever introduced, passed the General Assembly. The common knowledge that {{the past and present}} inspection laws had failed to prevent the importation of unmarketable tobacco, plus a long depression, had changed the attitude of many of the influential planters and merchants. Nevertheless, the act did meet with opposition from some of the English customs officials {{and a few of the}} large planters. Soon after the passage of this new inspection law a prominent planter wrote complainingly to a London merchant, [...] "This Tobo hath passed the Inspection of our new law, every hogshead was cased and viewed by which means the tobacco was very much tumbled and made something less sightly than it was before and it causes a great deal of extraordinary trouble". There were complaints that the new law destroyed tobacco that used to bring good money. Still another planter complained that the planter's name and evidence on the hogshead had much more effect on the price of the tobacco than the inspector's brand. While some of the planters expressed their disapproval of the new inspection law verbally, others resorted to violence. During the first year some villains burned two inspection houses, one in Lancaster County and another in Northumberland.The inspection law passed in 1730 was frequently amended during the colonial period, but there were no changes in its essential features. The act provided that no tobacco was to be shipped except in hogsheads, cases, or casks, without having first passed an inspection at one of the legally established inspection warehouses; thus the shipment of bulk tobacco was prohibited. Two inspectors were employed at each warehouse, and a third was summoned in case of a dispute between the two regular inspectors. These officials were bonded and were forbidden under heavy penalties to pass bad tobacco, engage in the tobacco trade, or to take rewards. Tobacco offered in payment of debts, public or private, had to be inspected under the same conditions as that to be exported. The inspectors were required to open the hogshead, extract and carefully examine two samplings; all trash and unsound tobacco was to be burned in the warehouse kiln in the presence and with the consent of the owner. If the owner refused consent the entire hogshead was to be destroyed. After the tobacco was sorted, the good tobacco was repacked in the hogshead and the planter's distinguishing mark, net weight, tare (weight of the hogshead), and name of <b>inspection</b> warehouse were <b>stamped</b> on the hogshead.|$|R
