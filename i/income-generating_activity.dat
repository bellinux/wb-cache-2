In his time, state taxes and expenditures were comparatively small (5%-10% of gross product), but since that time they have risen to 30%-40% or more of gross product in many countries. They enable the state to intervene directly {{in the process of}} social and economic reproduction, and to alter its course within certain limits. Because of the size of state funds and the fact that taxes must be paid irrespective of productive performance, the state can borrow large sums and use them, together with legislation, to influence economic growth and social relations.

By Milford Bateman For more than 30 years microfinance has been portrayed as a key policy and programme intervention for poverty reduction and ‘bottom-up’ local economic and social development. Microfinance (more accurately microcredit, but in practice the terms are interchangeable) is the provision of tiny loans to the poor to help them establish or expand an <b>income-generating</b> <b>activity,</b> and thereby escape from poverty.

40|$|Summary This paper {{examines}} {{the links between}} the assets and the economic activities of rural households in developing countries to provide insight into how the promotion of certain key assets [...] particularly education, land, and infrastructure [...] influences the economic choices of these households. Nationally representative data from 15 countries which form part of the rural <b>income-generating</b> <b>activities</b> (RIGA) database {{are used in the}} analysis. The results indicate that improved land access is linked to agricultural production and thus will lead households to take, on average, this path for improving household welfare. Higher levels of education and greater access to infrastructure appear to be most closely linked to non-agricultural wage employment. rural <b>income-generating</b> <b>activities</b> livelihood strategies meta-regression analysis...|$|R

Specifically, we aimed to identify the primary <b>income-generating</b> <b>activities,</b> the variation in access to land, the potential for the development of community projects, and the implementation of alternative <b>income-generating</b> <b>activities.</b> In the summer of 2013, we assessed a REDD+ pilot project in and around the Luki Biosphere Reserve, Bas-Congo Province.

30|$|Honey {{production}} {{has a long}} tradition in Ethiopia. The practice of beekeeping in Ethiopia is often integrated with crop farming and animal husbandry. In many regions of the country, beekeeping is an important additional <b>income-generating</b> <b>activity</b> for farmers, next to cropping and livestock rearing. Currently, the honey sector is part of the integrated household extension program runn by the government to imprve productivity and increase household income (Egziabher et al. 2013). It is also believed {{to be one of the}} subsectors which tend to be inclusive of smallholders in Ethiopia (Paulos, 2012). Apiculture can importantly contribute to the livelihood of rural households, either by providing additional income through honey sale or by providing a high-nutritious food product for household consumption. Honey production is regarded as a poverty reduction strategy and as a tool for combating malnutrition in rural areas of developing countries (Legesse, 2014).|$|E

40|$|The act of user-dealing {{has largely}} been {{explored}} within criminology {{in conjunction with the}} ‘drug–crime’ link or with a focus on ethnography and subculture. Whereas it is known that many users of drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine engage in small-scale supply as a way of generating revenue, less is known about the particular interplay of social context and choice that leads them to pick this <b>income-generating</b> <b>activity</b> over other potential options. Contributing to a burgeoning literature, this article explores the constrained choices of user-dealers with reference to Bourdieu’s ‘theory of practice’ (1977). Through locating stories of failure in user-dealer narratives, we utilize this novel approach in criminology, illuminating the importance of working with all of the interrelated concepts of habitus, field and capital in appreciating user-dealing as ‘practice’. It is argued that application of this framework affords the previously unharnessed opportunity to use Bourdieusian theory to understand notions of culpability when sentencing this group.

The main objective of this apiculture intervention was to identify the current beekeeping practices, assess potentials and problems, and provide solutions through {{the introduction of a}} participatory market-oriented modern beekeeping practice as an <b>income-generating</b> <b>activity</b> to farmers and others who are interested to complement their income. The activities reported in this paper are based on studies and interventions undertaken to enhance market-oriented apiculture development in Ada';a-Liben woreda between 2005 and 2007. This working paper is divided into a number of sections. The first two sections describe the major strengths and constraints of the bee industry in Ethiopia. Section 3 describes the beekeeping institutes and associations. Sections 4 and 5 analyse the most important opportunities and threats for apiculture development and marketing intervention in Ada';a-Liben woreda. Section 6 presents IPMS intervention strategies and lessons learned in knowledge sharing, capacity building, and commodity development including technology transfer, platforms, input supply, credit facilitation and market linkage. This section also discusses the methods used and the achievements obtained so far. Finally, Section 7 discusses both general and industry specific recommendations, which form the basis for further development of the industry. This working paper is intended to provide preliminary information on lessons drawn in beekeeping interventions in Ada';a-Liben woreda and to share the experiences to those who have already launched or are planning to launch apiary development program as an alternative income generating activity. It also highlights the methodologies applied and the lessons learned from the apiculture interventions of the IPMS project for scaling up to other woredas.
