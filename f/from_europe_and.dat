40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the labour market <b>and</b> immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> OECD countries living in Sweden. We investigated two main questions; the first was; what accounts for higher unemployment rates among immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> OECD countries in Sweden? And the second, what accounts for lower wages and earnings of immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> OECD countries in Sweden. We collected data by reviewing secondary sources of research on labour market statistics, recruitment process of some companies, earnings of heterogeneous immigrants and natives living in Sweden. We analyzed our data with human capital theory, disparate treatment theory and unconscious bias theory. Our findings were that, stereotypical discrimination by employers was the cause for higher unemployment rate among immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> OECD countries and perceived low skills by employers was the cause for lower earnings among immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> the OECD countries...|$|R
