The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling—at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one {{with a sense of}} distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> piss on.|$|E

And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it <b>is</b> <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together <b>is</b> <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> know.

500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> have to put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people {{had the luxury of}} doing one job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

While dying of cancer in 1994 he told Lyle, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> should know, but I cannot tell you." [...] Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain. After Christiansen's death family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.|$|E

She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{have to do to}} get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|Criss {{discussed}} his personal connection with Blaine {{in an interview}} with Vanity Fair. He explained that he grew up among the [...] "gay community", being with theater performers, so was raised without a concept of sexuality being an issue. Criss stated that, although he identifies as straight, [...] "it really doesn't come into play with me in this role. As an actor, your objective is always to play the scene. And this in case, he happens to be a gay teen." [...] Talk show host and media personality Ellen DeGeneres deemed Blaine [...] "a very confident gay teen, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> don't see much on television." [...] However, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times assessed that [...] "despite the image he projects, he, too, is just a kid trying to figure things out as he goes along." [...] Criss feels that Blaine's confidence is an important aspect of his character, as it is rare for gay teenagers on television to be so [...] "sure of themselves." [...] He hopes that [...] "all the kids struggling with this issue can look to a guy like Blaine and feel [...] by his confidence." ...|$|E

500|$|Ricardo Arjona {{released}} on 9 February 2012 the music video for [...] "Fuiste Tú".

[...] Some of those locations belong to the Sololá, and the singer revealed that he chose to film the video there {{because he wanted to}} [...] "show the real situation of that department", {{which is one of the}} poorest in the country, although being visited yearly by thousands of tourists. [...] About the concept of the video, Arjona commented that [...] "it recreates the battle on a couple when someone starts to say 'is the beginning of the end'. When there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> don't like from your beloved one, there's two options: The first, hold on to the relationship. The second, go away. Sadly, there's a third one that is created by those who are unsure and that is when, on the conflictive moments, they use a recurrent phrase: It was you." ...|$|E
500|$|Hannah Montana {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who appreciated its overall production. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares enjoyed Cyrus' deliveries of [...] "cute, well-written songs", {{and added that}} the overall project was [...] "sweet, starry-eyed, [...] utterly charming". Jennifer Axman from Common Sense Media shared a similar sentiment, appreciating its [...] "upbeat girl-power messages" [...] and distinguishing [...] "I Learned from You" [...] as a stand-out track for its inspirational lyrics ("I learned from you that I do not crumble / I learned from you that strength <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> choose /.../ There is no question that's a lesson I learned from you"). MSN Music gave the record a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and listed it as an [...] "essential album". However, Chris Willman provided a more mixed review, commenting that Cyrus appeared to [...] "mimic Avril, Ashlee, and Britney simultaneously", and felt {{that the concept of}} leading a double life was [...] "a nice fantasy for Brangelina, but a weird one to push on little girls." [...] David Hiltbrand was also critical of the record, stating that its [...] "generic pop" [...] would irritate adult listeners, but acknowledged that it was [...] "slickly executed" [...] for appealing to its younger audience.|$|E
500|$|In late 2000, Brooks was {{declared}} bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth {{after failing to}} repay a 14,941.64 debt to BankWest. In May 2001, the police raided Brooks' Perth home and found a metre-high cannabis plant. Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend, and then {{announced that he would}} be leaving the state. Having moved to South Australia in 2003, Brooks started Local, which he billed as the state's leading lifestyle magazine. The venture was run solely by him and his wife, and was dominated by advertising. Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting, citing a quote from Kieren Perkins, which was rendered thus in the publication: [...] "I was over the moon. Winning <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [...]" [...] Brooks stood 200cm and weighed 95kg during his career, but {{in the early part of}} the 21st century fought a battle with obesity, after ballooning to 150kg. As of 2007, he had lost substantial weight and fought off his alcohol problems.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Susan {{was seen}} {{offering}} {{to become a}} surrogate for her daughter Libby. Following a fight with the hospital board, Susan became pregnant. However, this causes friction with her son-in-law. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Woodburne called the scenes [...] "difficult" [...] to film. Alan Fletcher said the storyline [...] "could have been dreadful in the wrong hands", but he was pleased {{at the way the}} scenes were handled. He added [...] "The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family". Neighbours timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline. The writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. Woodburne said [...] "Because of the time of day that our show is on—it's on at 6.30 here and day time in the UK—obviously doing something as controversial as surrogacy at that time slot we would be so restricted by censorship". The storyline received mixed reactions from viewers. Woodburne said that people believe Susan is [...] "such a good mother and it's awesome she's prepared to do this for Libby and Dan". Other viewers have said that Susan should not have got involved and that the storyline was ridiculous as Susan is too old. Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower also spoke out about the storyline and said [...] "I've had quite a few letters from people in England who'd heard about it before it was even in the papers in Australia saying they disagree and think it's shocking".|$|E
