50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex trunk circuit, {{outgoing}} trunks are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more <b>idle</b> <b>trunks</b> in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an <b>idle</b> <b>trunk</b> and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those <b>idle</b> <b>trunks.</b> This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, in-band {{signaling}} was used, so {{the same line}} for both voice conversations and telephone connection management signals. Since a pause in a voice conversation would produce silence, another method was required for switches to determine available circuits. The solution AT&T created was to produce a 2600 Hz tone on <b>idling</b> <b>trunks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Calls from manual {{offices to}} panel offices {{required}} the A board, or outgoing operator, to request the number from the caller, connect to an <b>idle</b> <b>trunk</b> {{to the distant}} exchange and relay the desired number to the B Board Manual Incoming Call operator, who keyed it to the Panel machine for setting up the incoming and final frames to the called telephone number.|$|R
25|$|A second {{common form}} of {{signaling}} for supervision was called single-frequency or SF signaling. The most {{common form of}} this used a steady 2,600Hz tone to identify a <b>trunk</b> as <b>idle.</b> <b>Trunk</b> circuitry hearing a 2,600Hz tone for a certain duration would go idle. (The duration requirement reduced falsing.) Some systems used tone frequencies over 3,000Hz, particularly on SSB frequency division multiplex microwave radio relays.|$|R
5000|$|It gained brief fame as {{the last}} place in the {{continental}} United States to use a trunking system (inter-office circuits) that was called [...] "N2 Carrier", an analog system that utilized Multi-Frequency (MF) tones and the infamous 2600 Hz control tone for answer supervision and <b>idle</b> <b>trunk</b> condition. This system was much loved by phone phreaks {{as it was the}} same system which the now infamous John Draper made famous. The era ended in June 2006, when the privately owned exchange switched to a digital trunk. Phone hacking attempts from across the nation had placed a large burden on the extremely small telephone company serving the township.|$|R
50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument {{with a short}} holding time, had the additional task of decoding the first three digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A cross connect field had a terminal for each office code, which was cross connected to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another cross connect or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for <b>idle</b> <b>trunks</b> to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the distant terminating office. When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the cross connect fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network. Translation cross connect fields such as these {{were among the first to}} be converted from soldered terminals to wire wrap.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Idle</b> {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> {{were picked}} {{by the traditional}} [...] "sleeve test" [...] method, as lines were, except that hunting was the usual practice for trunks rather than a special service feature. The selector moved upward to the proper trunk group, and then through twenty terminals, checking for one with an un-grounded sleeve lead, then selecting and grounding it. If all the trunks were busy, the selector sent back an All Circuits Busy tone (reorder tone). [...] There was no provision for alternate routing as in earlier manual systems and later more sophisticated mechanical ones.|$|R
50|$|For example, if police {{communications}} are configured {{in such a}} {{way that}} twelve conventional channels are required to permit citywide dispatch based upon geographical patrol areas, during periods of slow dispatch activity, much of that channel capacity is <b>idle.</b> In a <b>trunked</b> system, the police units in a given geographical area are not assigned a dedicated channel, but instead are members of a talk-group entitled to draw upon the common resources of a smaller pool of channels.|$|R
60|$|So the Elephant's Child {{went home}} across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit {{down from a}} tree, {{instead of waiting for}} it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool, slushy-squshy mud-cap {{whenever}} the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his <b>trunk,</b> and the <b>noise</b> was louder than several brass bands.|$|R
40|$|This {{reporting}} {{shall be}} {{in the form of}} an out-of-service message. Upon receipt of a release message from the calling ISC, the releasing end DCME shall initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s forward connection, and the opposite end DCME shall automatically initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s return connection. Upon completion of this process, a positive release acknowledgement message shall be returned to the releasing ISC. Failure to complete the release shall be reported to the releasing ISC using the out-of-service message and the DCME shall put the trunk in a blocked condition. After manual or automatic removal of any failure condition, the DCME shall put the <b>trunk</b> in an <b>idle</b> condition and send a back-in-service message to the ISC. A calling end DCME shall detect a release initiated by the opposite end (non-controlling) ISC by the reception of a disconnect message in the control channel. This abnormal release shall be recognized as a dual seizure situation being resolved between the ISCs. The detecting DCME shall first complete the release normally and immediately attempt to re-establish the released 64 kbit/s unrestricted duplex connection between the DCMEs. 4. 10 <b>Trunk</b> channel <b>idle</b> <b>noise</b> level detection and injection The DCME transmit unit shall measure the <b>trunk</b> channel <b>idle</b> <b>noise</b> level and forward this information to the corresponding DCME receive unit, which shall insert the appropriate idle level noise within the receive output speech channel during silent intervals following disconection of the bearer channel.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, due to {{the scope}} of consideration relating exclusively to the impacts of the given <b>trunk</b> line/route, the <b>noise</b> impact has not been considered. This is because of not including the inland collection and distribution of containers to/from the seaports from/to their ultimate suppliers and customers. In addition, the congestion and delays have not been considered after assuming that a rather low utilization of berths in both ports has neutralized any irregularity in handling the incoming and outgoing ships. As far as the safety is concerned, the estimated rate of losing container ship is given in Table 1. Applied to the given trunk line/route, it has given: 4.492 · 10 −[*] 12 Losses/TEU-mile · 9748 mile · 2, 443, 543 TEU/year[*]=[*] 0.1074 Losses/year (just as an estimate). Does this imply that the safety in the given chain is satisfactory high? The answer is “yes” under given conditions.|$|R
50|$|Catori {{tells him}} that she and Andar will go with Sepinta instead. When Turok tries to give the charm (which Catori had when she was young) to Catori, she lets him keep it, as it is {{something}} of hers that will keep him safe. Sepinta then tells Turok to follow the setting sun past the mountain with two peaks if he changes his mind. It begins to rain as Turok leaves, and the villagers head forward. On his way, Turok discovers tracks of the cave dwellers. He then climbs on the edge where the waterfall is. He finds claw or teeth marks on a tree <b>trunk.</b> He hears <b>noises</b> and discovers the Carnotaurus (which is discovered to be a female), seen feeding her two young. The dinosaur has caught a wild boar. She drops the injured pig as her two offspring begin to feast on it. The Carnotaurus leaves to find food for herself.|$|R
50|$|The {{next day}} Adam, with Finn, travels to town with the damaged window {{to have it}} {{repaired}} and is again warned about the hallow. Clare at the house is frightened by Colm when he comes into her home uninvited, Colm warns Clare to leave the village and leaves behind an old book. On {{his way home from}} the village Adam has issues with his car forcing him off the road and nearly causing him to wreck. He opens the hood to see a vine-like fungus clogging the engine, opening the trunk he is hit and pushed in. After awaking in the <b>trunk</b> Adam hears <b>noises</b> outside scratching at the car, with Finn, still in the car, beginning to cry as the car shakes and shadows move menacingly across the windows. Adam kicks a hole in the backseat cushion and pushes his way out just as the car stops shaking. He gets Finn out of the car, which has a number of deep scratches across it. Then, scared and worried, he starts towards home.|$|R
