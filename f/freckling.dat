25|$|On lighter {{to medium}} skin tones, solar lentigenes emerge as small- to {{medium-sized}} brown patches of <b>freckling</b> that can grow and accumulate over time on {{areas of the}} body that receive the most unprotected sun exposure, such as the back of the hands, forearms, chest, and face. For those with darker skin colors, these discolorations can appear as patches or areas of ashen-gray skin.|$|E
25|$|Uneven {{pigmentation}} of {{some sort}} affects most people, regardless of bioethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or <b>freckling.</b> Apart from blood-related conditions such as jaundice, carotenosis, or argyria, skin pigmentation disorders generally occur because the body produces either {{too much or too}} little melanin.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} of fair skin, red hair, and <b>freckling</b> {{is associated with}} high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype {{is caused by a}} loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely fair skin is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern {{characteristic of}} light skin.|$|E

40|$|<b>Freckle</b> {{occurrence}} {{is known}} to be dependent on the casting size and the superalloy components with large cross section are more prone to <b>freckle</b> formation. In our directional solidification experiment of superalloys <b>freckles</b> are observed in some thin samples, while some significantly thicker samples in the same shell mould cluster remain <b>freckle</b> free. The EBSD analysis shows that the samples with <b>freckles</b> have a good axial orientation, while in <b>freckle</b> free samples the primary dendrite stems diverge from the sample axis. In an analogue system the flow behaviour through a mushy zone was simulated, in which the dendrite network was placed in different orientation. The dendrite array shows the lowest resistance to the vertical melt flow. As the dendrite alignment diverges from orientation, the flow speed slows down and reaches the minimum at the orientation. This orientation effect of the interdendritic permeability explains well why the crystal orientation plays such {{an important role in the}} occurrence of <b>freckles</b> in superalloy castings. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum mostly {{affects the}} eye and skin. Individuals with XP have extreme {{sensitivity}} to light in the ultraviolet range starting from {{one to two years}} of age, and causes sunburn, <b>freckling</b> of skin, dry skin and pigmentation after exposure. When the eye is exposed to sunlight, it becomes irritated and bloodshot, and the cornea becomes cloudy. Around 30% of affected individuals also develop neurological abnormalities, including deafness, poor coordination, decreased intellectual abilities, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures; these effects tend to become progressively worse over time. All affected individuals have a 1000-fold higher risk of developing skin cancer: half of the affected population develop skin cancer by age 10, usually at areas most exposed to sunlight (e.g. face, head, or neck). The risk for other cancers such as brain tumors, lung cancer and eye cancers also increase.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, <b>freckling,</b> blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Freckle</b> defects usually {{appear on}} the surface of {{castings}} and industrial ingots during the directional solidification process {{and most of them are}} located near the interface between the shell mold and superalloys. Ceramic cores create more interfaces in the directionally solidified (DS) and single crystal (SX) hollow turbine blades. In order to investigate the location of <b>freckle</b> occurrence in superalloys, superalloy CM 247 LC was directionally solidified in an industrial-sized Bridgman furnace. Instead of ceramic cores, Alumina tubes were used inside of the casting specimens. It was found that <b>freckles</b> occur not only on the casting external surfaces, but also appear near the internal interfaces between the ceramic core and superalloys. Meanwhile, the size, initial position, and area of <b>freckle</b> were investigated in various diameters of the specimens. The initial position of the <b>freckle</b> chain reduces when the diameter of the rods increase. <b>Freckle</b> area follows a linear relationship in various diameters and the average <b>freckle</b> fraction is 1. 1 % of cross sectional area of casting specimens. The flow of liquid metal near the interfaces was stronger than that in the interdendritic region in the mushy zone, and explained why <b>freckle</b> tends to occur on the outer or inner surfaces of castings. This new phenomenon suggests that <b>freckles</b> are more likely to occur on the outer or inner surfaces of the hollow turbine blades...|$|R

The community of isolation drew them closer. In place of a companion he had assumed the part of friend, to whom she could confide all her home-sick aspirations. So that, even when she was sitting silent, a slim, long foot stretched out in front, bending with an air of cool absorption over some pencil sketches which she would not show him--even then, by her very attitude, by the sweet freshness that clung about her, by her quick, offended glances at the strange persons round, she seemed to acknowledge in some secret way that he was necessary. He was far from realising this; his intellectual and observant parts were hypnotised and fascinated even by her failings. The faint <b>freckling</b> across her nose, the slim and virginal severeness of her figure, with its narrow hips and arms, the curve of her long neck-all were added charms.

40|$|AbstractA 3 -D {{model of}} <b>freckle</b> (solute channel) {{formation}} at a microstructural level was coupled with in situ X-ray radiography {{to investigate the}} mechanisms of <b>freckle</b> initiation and growth. The model predictions for solute partitioning, diffusion and convection were validated via in situ X-ray radiographic measurements in Ga– 25 wt. % In alloy, showing good agreement. Other key features, such as <b>freckle</b> channel width and critical Rayleigh number, also correlated well. The validated model was used to investigate <b>freckle</b> formation under a range of solidification conditions. Two distinct stages of <b>freckle</b> onset were observed, identified via the dendrite tip growth and solute profiles. The first stage corresponds to lower flow velocities with large fluctuations; in the second stage the velocities stabilize, with established recirculating flows forming solute channels. The influence of imperfections in dendritic morphology, such as grain boundaries and primary spacing variations, on the critical Rayleigh number was studied. It was found that that these features initiate <b>freckles.</b> Non-intuitively, converging grain boundaries were observed to have the greatest propensity for <b>freckle</b> formation. The resulting new insights on solute plume formation impact a range of phenomena from single-crystal superalloys to magma flows...|$|R
