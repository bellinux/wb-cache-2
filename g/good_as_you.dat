5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

Allingham was invested as a Scout on 18 November 2008, 100 years after he first joined as a youth. He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Allingham celebrated his 113th birthday on , at an event hosted by the Royal Navy. He received a signed birthday card from First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band and saw a Mark 8 Royal Navy Lynx flying overhead while he was sitting outside in his wheelchair. When asked the secret of his long life, Allingham said, [...] "I don't know, but I would say, be as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> possibly can." ...|$|E

500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested to see what happens next, whereas last week I wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E
500|$|Louis Virtel from HitFix called [...] "Living for Love" [...] as Madonna's [...] "best video since 'Hung Up'". He found {{references}} to older Madonna videos, like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] in the [...] "unusual choreography {{with all of}} its masculine posturing and grappling", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] with its bullfighting theme and playing on a familiar imagery from her career, and [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] during the sequences where Madonna fends off the Minotaur dancers. Virtel also commended the choreography, costumes, Madonna's looks and the cinematography of the video. Along with the [...] "Take a Bow" [...] reference, Billboards Joe Lynch called the video as incredible and [...] "lush, arresting" [...] but criticized for the misspelling of Nietzsche at the end." [...] Rita Kokshanian from InStyle said that the video was [...] "just as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could have expected... And while we were completely transfixed by her killer moves and insane physique, we were equally in awe of her outfits." ...|$|E
500|$|An 1837 essay of his, {{centered}} on a debate regarding the translation of Homer's works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: [...] "This {{is not the time}} for criticism, children, it is the time for writing, so write as much and as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience". Paraphrased as [...] "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" [...] (Scrieţi, băieţi, orice, numai scrieţi!), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity. The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian Şerban Cioculescu and others, who argued that Ion Heliade Rădulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level. Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular rhyme, Paul Zarifopol accused him and Gheorghe Asachi of [...] "tastelessness" [...] and [...] "literary insecurity". He elaborated: [...] "Rădulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".|$|E

Choon Klet pointed to a high initial difficulty but said: [...] "Once the skills are acquired, be ready for many hours of enjoyment and sleepless nights." [...] Chip and Jonathan Carter of St. Petersburg Times deemed the game {{one of the best}} of the year and felt the SNES version [...] "loses nothing in the translation". The duo said the Game Boy and Game Gear versions were [...] "less impressive" [...] due to their technical restrictions but [...] "about as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can get on the small screen". [...] "Sir Garnabus" [...] of GamePro was impressed with the Game Boy version's clear and detailed graphics, lack of slowdown, good controls, and faithfulness to the original version, but judged the Game Gear version to be [...] "merely average", saying issues such as poor collision detection hamper the game despite its outstanding graphics. Amiga CD32 Gamer called Jungle Strike [...] "a 500lb gorilla among games" [...] and praised its ease of control and [...] "masses of gameplay and realistic detail".|$|E
500|$|Davey {{performed}} a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from her follow-up album which she initially {{referred to as}} Silversleeve. All {{but two of the}} songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's just say I didn't wipe it with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> remember the first time". The Irish Independent's reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as [...] "a record that she can be proud of". Jim Carroll, The Irish Times rock critic, called it [...] "The most charming pop album you'll hear in Zero Seven".|$|E
500|$|Chrissie {{entered the}} show as the estranged wife of [...] "one of the most iconic {{characters}} in soap history", Den Watts, and was deliberately presented as [...] "very different to the first Mrs. Watts." [...] When EastEnders began in 1985 viewers had watched Den's affairs and manipulation gradually take their toll on his wife, Angie, who was unable {{to compete in the}} games he played. Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's [...] "equal" [...] and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how [...] "Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer – just like Den." [...] Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can hold it together much better." [...] Indeed, according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: [...] "What's great is that they've written Den an equal", Oberman noted, [...] "It'll be interesting to see their little sparring matches." [...] The attraction was intended to be mutual, unlike Den's one-sided marriage to Angie. Trying to win Chrissie around into giving their marriage another try, Den declared: [...] "I know we've got a great relationship even when we're tearing lumps out of each other, you give as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> get and that's the sort of marriage I've always wanted". Commenting on the complicated nature of their relationship, Oberman observed, ...|$|E

[...] But soon afterward, the judges began predicting Lewis' [...] "front runner" [...] status. In {{an exclusive interview with}} [...] on March 4, 2007, Simon Cowell foresaw Lewis' chance to take the crown. After Lewis' performance of [...] "Lovesong" [...] by The Cure/311 on March 27, Paula Abdul said that she would love to see him in the finale. Cowell further confirmed that Lewis was the front runner of male contestants on American Idol. Lewis, upon entering the top 2 on May 16, 2007, he thus became the first ever contestant from the Northwestern United States (specifically, Washington) to compete in the finale.|$|E

This bettered Kayoko Fukushi's previous world best by almost half a minute. (Dibaba's record was broken by Florence Kiplagat on 15 February 2015.) This was her first competitive road race since 2005, but she downplayed the idea of moving on to road running, stating that the track remained her priority. Her 5 kilometre splits were 15:58 – 15:25 – 15:05. She said, [...] "Although I trained a lot together with my husband for this race, a roadrace is something different. I {{did not know what}} I could expect. Therefore, I was not that fast in the beginning. ... After 10 kilometres, I pressed the pace and in the final three kilometres it felt like flying.

The Baltimore Sun states that Angelou [...] "uses remembered meals and dishes as a prism through which to view her own life, its turning points and its intersections with the lives of others". The essays focus on events, paired with food, that occurred throughout Angelou's life, from Angelou's childhood in Stamps, Arkansas, to her adolescence and young adulthood spent with her mother Vivian Baxter, to her career, which brought her fame. She impresses a prospective employer with Southern food; he tells her, [...] "If you can write half as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can cook, you are going to be famous". As her fame grows, [...] "the food world widens (tamales, pâté, minestrone, chachouka)" [...] and her dining companions are also among the famous (Oprah Winfrey, Jessica Mitford, Rosa Guy).
