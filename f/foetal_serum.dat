40|$|The protein binding of the enantiomers of {{propranolol}} and verapamil {{was measured}} in 19 pairs of maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> obtained at delivery. The binding of the enantiomers of both drugs was lower in foetal than in maternal serum. In maternal serum the mean (+/- s. d.) unbound percentages were 22. 4 +/- 6. 2 and 20. 7 +/- 6. 6 for R- and S-propranolol, and 16. 8 +/- 5. 5 and 22. 5 +/- 6. 2 for R- and S-verapamil; in <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> the values were 38. 8 +/- 8. 6 and 40. 4 +/- 10. 6 for R- and S-propranolol, and 34. 7 +/- 10. 5 and 44. 8 +/- 10. 7 for R- and S-verapamil. For propranolol, in maternal, but not in <b>foetal</b> <b>serum,</b> {{the difference between the}} binding of the R- and S-enantiomers was significant; the R/S ratio was significantly (P < 0. 01) larger in the mother (1. 099 +/- 0. 072) than in the foetus (0. 973 +/- 0. 068). For verapamil, the difference in binding between the R- and S-enantiomers was significant in both maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>serum,</b> but the R/S ratio was similar in mother (0. 735 +/- 0. 098) and foetus (0. 763 +/- 0. 070). Serum alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations were markedly higher and albumin concentrations slightly lower in maternal than in foetal samples. The binding of the four enantiomers in maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> was correlated (P < 0. 001) with the AAG concentration (r propranolol: R 0. 749, S 0. 746; r verapamil: R 0. 753, S 0. 782).

40|$|The {{basis of}} the {{maternal}} to <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> concentration gradient of dexamethasone was investigated in the rat on day 20 of gestation. The pregnant rat was assumed to behave as a two-compartment open model with one maternal and one foetal pool exchanging {{with each other and}} each to outside. Bolus injections of unlabelled dexamethasone were made into the mother and of [3 H]-dexamethasone into its foetuses and serial maternal and foetal blood samples were collected a number of times. The monitoring of both forms of the drug in each sample permitted the estimation by a non-linear least square approach of two placental and two non-placental clearances. After both maternal and foetal injections of dexamethasone, its concentrations were higher in the maternal than in the <b>foetal</b> <b>serum.</b> Placental clearance of dexamethasone from the foetus to the mother was 824 +/- 40 ml kg- 1 h- 1 and 8. 5 +/- 1 times greater than the placental clearance from the mother to foetus (103 +/- 2 ml kg- 1 h- 1). Foetal non-placental clearance was zero.

40|$|The {{influence}} of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) on the pharmacokinetics, transplacental passage and tissue localization of dexamethasone was determined in Sprague-Dawley rats. PCM increased the plasma half-life and volume of distribution of dexamethasone in pregnant {{but not in}} nonpregnant rats. Ratios of foetal to maternal serum dexamethasone concentrations were 0. 2 - 0. 4 at different dose levels (0. 8 - 20 mumol kg- 1), time intervals (0. 25 - 12 h) and gestational ages (day 14 - 21). PCM increased the <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> and tissue concentrations of dexamethasone but exerted no significant effect on its binding to maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> proteins or on its metabolism by the placenta.

40|$|The {{influence}} of streptozotocin-diabetes on the pharmacokinetics, placental transfer and tissue localization of dexamethasone was determined in Sprague-Dawley rats. Diabetes significantly increased {{the volume of}} distribution of dexamethasone in pregnant but not in nonpregnant rats; plasma half-life was not significantly increased. Concentrations of maternally administered dexamethasone in all tissues studied (maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> and livers, foetal lungs and placentas) except the amniotic fluid were lower in diabetic than in control animals. Diabetes did not alter the binding of dexamethasone to maternal or <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> proteins. Insulin treatment partially reversed the effects of diabetes on the maternal-foetal exchange of dexamethasone. Diabetes-induced decrease in the foetal localization of dexamethasone appears {{to be caused by}} a decrease in the maternal serum levels as well as by an increase in the foetal excretion of the steroid into the amniotic fluid. In so far as the rat model reflects the human situation, the present data suggest that a standard dose of dexamethasone might not be adequate in promoting foetal lung maturation in diabetic pregnancies...|$|E

40|$|Dedicated to Professor Dr. Dr. Ernst Schütte on the {{occasion}} of his 75 th birthday Summary: Pregnant rats were fed diets with an Mg 2 + content of 40, 12, 6 and 3 mmol/kg from day 10 - 19 of pregnancy. There was a linear correlation of non-protein bound Mg 2 + between foetal and maternal serum, between amniotic fluid and maternal serum, and between <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> and amniotic fluid, the ratios being 2. 7, 2. 0 and 1. 3 respectively, indicating active transport of Mg 2 + üp to a constant concentration gradient by the placenta. In hearts, increases of Na" 1 " and Ca 2 +, and decreases of Mg 24 " and K+ were observed only in the group receiving the lowest Mg 2 " 1 " supply. After i. v. injection of MgQh to pregnant rats, Mg 2 + was slowly transported from maternal to <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> and more slowly into the amniotic fluid. The effect of isoproterenol on cardiac electrolyte content in pregnant rats was less than in non-pregnant rats, and the effect of isoproterenol in foetal rats was smaller than in maternal rats. These results are explained by inactivation of isoproterenol in the plaeenta, by the small diaplacental transport of isoproterenol and by a smaller isoproterenol-stimulation of foetal cardiac adenylate cyclase.

Analysis of the protein-protein interaction network in the UO 2 2 + complex identified 32 proteins responsible for protein-protein complex formation and 34 with demonstrated ion-binding function, suggesting that UO 2 2 + stimulates the formation of protein functional networks rather than using a particular molecule as its target. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>foetal</b> calf <b>serum</b> to explant cultures of adult bovine articular cartilage {{is known to}} stimulate proteoglycan synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. We have now shown the activity in serum responsible for this effect to be heat- and acid-stable, {{to be associated with}} a high-Mr complex in normal serum but converted to a low-Mr form under acid conditions. The activity has an apparent Mr approximately 10, 000 and isoelectric points similar to those reported for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Addition of a monoclonal antibody against insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) prevented <b>foetal</b> calf <b>serum</b> from stimulating proteoglycan synthesis. Physiological concentrations of recombinant IGF-I or pharmacological levels of insulin when added to cartilage cultures mimicked the proteoglycan-stimulatory activity of serum. IGF-I appeared to act by increasing the rate of proteoglycan synthesis and did not change the nature of the proteoglycan synthesized nor the rate of proteoglycan catabolism by the tissue, suggesting that IGF-I may be important in the regulation of proteoglycan metabolism in adult articular cartilage. Furthermore, IGF-I can replace <b>foetal</b> calf <b>serum</b> in the culture medium, thereby allowing the use of a fully-defined medium which will maintain the synthesis and tissue levels of proteoglycan in adult articular cartilage explants for up to 5 days...|$|R

The low level of protease inhibitor activity in normal human serum may contribute to the inability of this serum to support the attachment of cells with detectable protease activity because the addition of protease inhibitors such as soybean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor and bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor to normal human serum dramatically enhanced cell attachment. In contrast to this, the addition of E-amino-n-caproic acid to normal human serum and the removal of plasminogen from normal human serum did not enhance its capacity to support cell attachment...|$|R

40|$|The {{administration}} {{of a single}} bolus of anti-IgM antibody to foetal lambs early in pregnancy produces prolonged B-cell depletion. The present study investigated this depletion by examining the effect, on B-cell development in the ileal Peyer’s patches, of varying the timing and dosage of antibody administration and by supplementing anti-IgM with surgical splenectomy. The capacity of a 1 mg bolus of anti-IgM to deplete Peyer’s patches of B cells was lost if its administration was deferred until {{two thirds of the}} way through pregnancy, but persisted beyond this time if weight-adjusted doses were used. Splenectomy of the foetus performed at an earlier age failed to extend the age at which a 1 mg dose of antibody remained effective. As the concentration of murine immunoglobulin in <b>foetal</b> <b>serum</b> was greatly reduced after 21 days, it is inferred that ongoing suppression of B-cell development is not dependent on the continued presence of murine immunoglobulin.

The binding of warfarin, phenylbutazone, azapropazone, diazepam, digitoxin and cholic acid by rat alpha 1 -FP and serum albumin was studied by equilibrium dialysis at 4 degrees C. Rat alpha 1 -FP was shown to have neither albumin's high-affinity site II (diazepam as marker) nor its site III (digitoxin and cholic acid as markers). High-affinity binding by alpha 1 -FP was found for the specific markers (warfarin, phenylbutazone, azapropazone) of albumin's drug-binding site I. However, instead of albumin's one high-affinity site/molecule, a mean value of 0. 5 site/molecule was obtained with rat alpha 1 -FP. Charcoal treatment at neutral pH of rat serum albumin did not affect its measured binding properties, but treatment of the alpha 1 -FP led to an increased affinity for warfarin, phenylbutazone and azapropazone without a change in the measured number of sites, indicating competition for binding at this site by (an) endogenous ligand(s).

Among the tissues taken, fin, liver and caudal peduncle showed good attachment with emergence of cells.

40|$|Thirty {{asthmatic}} {{children were}} compared with {{an equal number of}} age-matched healthy children. The mean peripheral blood T-lymphocyte level without <b>foetal</b> calf <b>serum</b> was lower in the asthmatic group (mean 970 /mm 3, as against 1740 /mm 3; P less than 0. 0001), but this difference was abolished by adding <b>foetal</b> calf <b>serum</b> or thymosin, thus explaining how quite severe T-cell deficiency can be missed by widely used methods. The degree of eosinophilia and the degree of elevation of the plasma IgE level in the asthmatic patients were positively correlated. Positive correlations were also shown between the degree of severity of the asthma, the degree of eosinophilia and the degree of elevation of the plasma IgE level, but not the degree of depression of the T-cell numbers. If this T-cell deficiency reflects an inadequate suppression of IgE responses, a clinical trial of thymosin appears to be warranted...|$|R
