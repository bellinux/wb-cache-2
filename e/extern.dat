40|$|Introduction: Morning {{report is}} an {{important}} teaching method for interns and <b>externs.</b> Achieving the objectives of morning report affects future performance. This descriptive cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} analyze the effectiveness of morning reports. Methods:Viewpoints of 85 interns and <b>externs</b> at the cardiology wards of teaching hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in the academic year of 2012 - 2013 were investigated. The instrument for data collection was a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed by chisquare and independent t-test. Effectiveness was defined as the rate of the achievement of the goals of morning reports based on dividing the total score of the questionnaire (54 scores) into three parts of 0 - 17 (poor effectiveness), 18 - 36 (moderate effectiveness) and 37 - 54 (good effectiveness). Results: The effectiveness of morning report sessions without the presence of residents was reported as moderate in hospital A, and the effectiveness of morning report sessions with the presence of residents in hospital B was reported as moderate in the opinion of interns and poor in the view of <b>externs.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the viewpoints of interns in hospitals A and B with regard to the effectiveness of morning report sessions (p= 0. 169). Conclusion: Results indicate that the higher academic level of subjects discussed in morning reports with presence of residents caused a reduction in the participation rate of interns and <b>externs,</b> thereby decreasing their learning and satisfaction. However, without the presence of residents, the students’ feelings of fear and anxiety were reduced and their satisfaction was heightened...|$|R
60|$|When Lord Steyne was benevolently disposed, he {{did nothing}} by halves, and his {{kindness}} towards the Crawley family did the greatest honour to his benevolent discrimination. His lordship extended his good-will to little Rawdon: he pointed out to the boy's parents the necessity of sending him to a public school, that he was of an age now when emulation, the first principles of the Latin language, pugilistic exercises, and the society of his fellow-boys would be of the greatest benefit to the boy. His father objected {{that he was not}} rich enough to send the child to a good public school; his mother that Briggs was a capital mistress for him, and had brought him on (as indeed was the fact) famously in English, the Latin rudiments, and in general learning: but all these objections disappeared before the generous perseverance of the Marquis of Steyne. His lordship was one of the governors of that famous old collegiate institution called the Whitefriars. It had been a Cistercian Convent in old days, when the Smithfield, which is contiguous to it, was a tournament ground. Obstinate heretics used to be brought thither convenient for burning hard by. Henry VIII, the Defender of the Faith, seized upon the monastery and its possessions and hanged and tortured some of the monks who could not accommodate themselves to the pace of his reform. Finally, a great merchant bought the house and land adjoining, in which, {{and with the help of}} other wealthy endowments of land and money, he established a famous foundation hospital for old men and children. An <b>extern</b> school grew round the old almost monastic foundation, which subsists still with its middle-age costume and usages--and all Cistercians pray that it may long flourish.|$|E
