5|$|To {{test this}} hypothesis, {{researchers}} examined how each species utilized the host ants. The M. schencki, M. sabuleti are parasitized by P. rebeli while the M. salina and M. vandeli are parasitized by the P. alcon. The M. scabrinodis is parasitized {{by both the}} P. rebeli and the P. alcon; however, the P. alcon is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> parasitize M. scabrinodis than the P. rebeli. Researchers found that in general, P. alcon was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> parasitize the host ant than P. rebeli; however, ant nests that supported the P. alcon were much smaller and supported lower populations than ant nests that supported P. rebeli.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women are <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference {{may be due to}} life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E

5|$|Comets {{are thought}} to have two {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, {{are thought to}} originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Multilingualism {{had been}} {{characteristic}} of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While {{the slave trade}} during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era. Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily. Christian inscriptions are <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be in Greek. In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough {{that it would have}} been acquired through everyday personal interaction.
