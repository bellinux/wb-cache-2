5|$|Richard Edward O'Connor {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Glebe on 4 August 1851. His mother was Mary Anne, née Harnett, while his father was Richard, an Irish-born Catholic who at that time served as {{librarian}} to the New South Wales Legislative Council, and would later become Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, chairing its first meeting. His family believed itself to be descended from the Irish republican rebel Arthur O'Connor, and also counted the prominent Tasmanian pioneer Roderic O'Connor among their relations. Richard Edward, sometimes known as Dick, attended St Mary's College, a Benedictine school in Lyndhurst, from 1861 to 1866 before matriculating at Sydney Grammar School in 1867 and studying at the University of Sydney. From a young age his closest friend was Edmund Barton, in whose Cabinet O'Connor would later serve. He won the Wentworth medal for the best <b>English</b> <b>essay</b> in 1870, and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1871 and a Master of Arts in 1873.|$|E
5|$|He {{gained a}} Second Class {{in the first}} History Tripos in 1909, and won the <b>English</b> <b>Essay</b> Prize with an essay on {{political}} satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts about his future as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as {{to the possibility of}} a career as a barrister. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of The Guardian and The Observer in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took {{the first part of the}} Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.|$|E

For example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan, however, fly fishing {{was likely to}} have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest <b>English</b> <b>essay</b> on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery.

[...] In 1828, Arnold's father was appointed Headmaster of Rugby School and his young family took up residence, that year, in the Headmaster's house. In 1831, Arnold was tutored by his uncle, [...] John Buckland in the small village of Laleham. In 1834, the Arnolds occupied a holiday home, Fox How, in the Lake District. William Wordsworth was a neighbour and close friend. In 1836, Arnold was sent to Winchester College, but in 1837 he returned to Rugby School where he was enrolled in the fifth form. He moved to the sixth form in 1838 and thus came under the direct tutelage of his father. He wrote verse for the manuscript Fox How Magazine co-produced with his brother Tom for the family's enjoyment from 1838 to 1843. During his years there, he won school prizes for <b>English</b> <b>essay</b> writing, and Latin and English poetry. His prize poem, [...] "Alaric at Rome," [...] was printed at Rugby.|$|E
2500|$|English essayists {{were aware}} of Continental models, but they {{developed}} their form independently from that tradition, and periodical literature grew between 1692 and 1712. Periodicals were inexpensive to produce, quick to read, and a viable way of influencing public opinion, and consequently there were many broadsheet periodicals headed by a single author and staffed by hirelings (so-called [...] "Grub Street" [...] authors). [...] One periodical outsold and dominated all others, however, and that was The Spectator, written by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele (with occasional contributions from their friends). The Spectator developed a number of pseudonymous characters, including [...] "Mr. Spectator," [...] Roger de Coverley, and [...] "Isaac Bickerstaff", and both Addison and Steele created fictions to surround their narrators. The dispassionate {{view of the world}} (the pose of a spectator, rather than participant) was essential {{for the development of the}} <b>English</b> <b>essay,</b> as it set out a ground wherein Addison and Steele could comment and meditate upon manners and events. Samuel Johnson's command of words and his practical wisdom gained a following as he published more than 200 essays offering insights into the follies of human nature and moral perseverance. Rather than being philosophers like Montesquieu, the English essayist could be an honest observer and his reader's peer. [...] After the success of The Spectator, more political periodicals of comment appeared. However, the political factions and coalitions of politicians very quickly realized the power of this type of press, and they began funding newspapers to spread rumors. [...] The Tory ministry of Robert Harley (17101714) reportedly spent over 50,000 pounds sterling on creating and bribing the press (Butt); this figure is known because their successors publicized it, but they (the Walpole government) were suspected of spending even more. [...] Politicians wrote papers, wrote into papers, and supported papers, and it was well known that some of the periodicals, like Mist's Journal, were party mouthpieces.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} rhetorical strategies in the English and Indonesian persuasive essays of Indonesian university students. Comparisons of rhetorical strategies were carried out across university majors, across languages, and across university-year cohorts. The correlation between rhetorical strategies used in <b>English</b> persuasive <b>essays</b> and overall proficiency in English composition were also examined. Undergraduate students of the State University of Malang, Indonesia, were asked to write persuasive essays on whether violence on TV programs should be restricted. Third-year students majoring in Indonesian wrote essays in Indonesian, fourth-year students majoring in <b>English</b> wrote <b>essays</b> in Indonesian and in English, and first-year students majoring in <b>English</b> wrote <b>essays</b> in <b>English.</b> The rhetorical strategies were examined in terms of Connor and Lauer's (1988) model consisting of three measures: the superstructure of argument, the Toulmin model of informal reasoning, and the persuasive appeals. The overall proficiency in English composition was evaluated using Jacobs et al's (1981) "ESL composition profile". The fourth-year students' Indonesian and <b>English</b> <b>essays</b> were more like each other than like the Indonesian essays of colleagues who majored in Indonesian. It is suggested that this may be caused by their exposure to English rhetoric. The finding that the fourth-year students were more successful than the first-year students in using rhetorical strategies in <b>English</b> persuasive <b>essays</b> might be attributed to the role of instruction. Overall proficiency in English composition was a good predictor of success in using rhetorical strategies in <b>English</b> persuasive <b>essays...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} errors that Arab EFL learners commit in writing <b>English</b> <b>essays</b> at the macrolinguistic level. It also tries to determine the causes of these problems and propose remedial strategies. More specifically stated the study {{seeks answers to the}} following questions: (1) What errors do Arab learners of English commit in writing <b>English</b> <b>essays</b> at the pragmatic and discoursal levels? (2) What are the possible causes of these errors? (3) How can such problems be minimized? and (4) To what extent do English language textbooks contribute to such problems? Five hundred essays and the contents of eight EFL textbooks were analysed {{for the purpose of this}} study. The findings revealed that Arab learners of English encounter major macrolinguistic problems in writing <b>English</b> <b>essays,</b> including coherence problems, cohesion problems, unawareness of logical relations between sentences, run-on sentences, poor paragraph development, and violation of the maxims of the cooperative principle. It was also found that teaching materials and the writing activities used in teaching English do not adequately develop students’ pragmalinguistic competence. Finally, the study identified a few potential causes of these problems and proposed a number of strategies that may help learners and teachers overcome such difficulties...|$|R
40|$|While Spanish and English {{have been}} studied by {{researchers}} {{in a variety of}} second language situations, little research has been done comparing Spanish/English theme/rheme structures and none has compared how the two languages use theme structures in academic essays. This study analyzes the types of themes that appear in independent clauses in a sample of academic essays selected from two Spanish and English composition textbooks. Seven Spanish <b>essays</b> and seven <b>English</b> <b>essays,</b> all of which were written by professional writers, were matched for genre; the first 200 words of each essay (adjusted for clause completion) were examined to determine the number of independent clauses and the types of theme used. The results show the <b>English</b> <b>essays</b> had a higher number of independent clauses and thus a higher number of theme structures than did the Spanish essays. In addition, while both the Spanish and the <b>English</b> <b>essays</b> use topical themes in each independent clause, higher number of instances of implicit subjects, personal pronouns, and processes used to announce the theme of the clause. The differences indicated in this study suggest that Spanish/English and English/Spanish students would benefit from an explicit comparison of theme/rheme structures in order to better understand how information can be delivered in their target language...|$|R

6000|$|What I {{believed}} to be only the fragment of an essay on Historical Criticism {{was already in the}} press, when accidentally I came across the remaining portions, in Wilde's own handwriting; it is now complete though unhappily divided in this edition. {0a} Any doubt as to its authenticity, quite apart from the calligraphy, would vanish on reading such a characteristic passage as the following:--' [...] . For, it was in vain that the middle ages strove to guard the buried spirit of progress. When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose, the sepulchre was empty, the grave clothes laid aside. Humanity had risen from the dead.' It was only Wilde who could contrive a literary conceit of that description; but readers will observe with different feelings, according to their temperament, that he never followed up the particular trend of thought developed in the essay. It is indeed more the work of the Berkeley Gold Medallist at Dublin, or the brilliant young Magdalen Demy than of the dramatist who was to write Salome. The composition belongs to his Oxford days when he was the unsuccessful competitor for the Chancellor's <b>English</b> <b>Essay</b> Prize. Perhaps Magdalen, which has never forgiven herself for nurturing the author of Ravenna, may be felicitated on having escaped the further intolerable honour that she might have suffered by seeing crowned again with paltry academic parsley the most highly gifted of all her children in the last century. Compared with the crude criticism on The Grosvenor Gallery (one of the earliest of Wilde's published prose writings), Historical Criticism is singularly advanced and mature. Apart from his mere scholarship Wilde developed his literary and dramatic talent slowly. He {{told me that he was}} never regarded as a particularly precocious or clever youth. Indeed many old family friends and contemporary journalists maintain sturdily that the talent of his elder brother William was much more remarkable. In this opinion they are fortified, appropriately enough, by the late Clement Scott. I record this interesting view because it symbolises the familiar phenomenon that those nearest the mountain cannot appreciate its height.|$|E

Little did he think, as he set down his gratitude, how much, in later life and among cribs and dictionaries, he was to lament this circumstance; nor how much of that later life he was to spend acquiring, with infinite toil, a shadow of what he might then have got with ease and fully. But if his Genoese education was in this particular imperfect, he was fortunate in the branches that more immediately touched on his career. The physical laboratory was the best mounted in Italy.
