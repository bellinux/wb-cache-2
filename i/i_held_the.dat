25|$|Ishme-Dagan I (c. 1721 BC – c. 1681 BC), son and {{successor}} of Shamshi-Adad <b>I,</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> {{capital city}} of his realm of influence in Ekallatum and ruled over the southeastern region of Upper Mesopotamia, including the city-state Assur. Ishme-Dagan I’s main challenge was in keeping his enemies in check; to his east were {{the foothills of the}} Zagros Mountains, inhabited by warlike pastoral peoples, and to the south was the Mesopotamian kingdom of Eshnunna. Although his father counted Ishme-Dagan I as politically astute and a capable soldier, commending him as he berated Yasmah-Adad in their letters, Ishme-Dagan I was not able to hold his father’s empire for long after his father died. Ishme-Dagan I eventually lost most of his domain, and was reduced to holding Assur and Ekallatum, despite waging several counter offensives to try to regain the upper Khabur area.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Hollywood in the mid-1960s, Baker {{travelled}} with Bob Hope's Christmas USO troupe entertaining {{soldiers in}} Vietnam and Southeast Asia, an experience which she described as reformative: [...] "In the hospitals <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> hands of damaged young men, and I {{realized that my}} pain was not exclusive: that in this world there was suffering much more terrible than mine." ...|$|E
500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E
500|$|K. K. Senthil Kumar scouted for {{locations}} in Gujarat, looking for dry, open lands {{to shoot the}} chariot race sequence. They found salt lands with white sands in Dholavira. To shoot the sequence there, they wanted a light weight vehicle to follow the horses; they bought a Maruti van, removed the vehicle's top and mounted the camera along with a jimmy jib atop it. A part of the song Dheera Dheera was also shot there, requiring filmmakers to plant a dry tree {{and a couple of}} oxen for use in the song's backdrop. An item number featuring Kim Sharma and Ram Charan was shot in late June 2008 in a specially erected fisherman colony. It was set up {{on the first floor of}} Annapurna Studios and cost less than 3 million. Ravinder explained, [...] "The set should look like an outdoor location, but need to be constructed in an indoor floor. I constructed exteriors of around 28 houses in that floor with detailed interior plan for the house of Srihari. I also constructed a small boat and a big wheeled fish with thermocol. When director wanted smoke-effect for a shot <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> heavy smoke machine on my shoulders in a low angle for the required effect." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, an off-off-Broadway company named The Hourglass Group {{produced}} {{an adaptation of}} The Beebo Brinker Chronicles in a production that ran for a month. The writers used material from I Am a Woman, Women in the Shadows and Journey to a Woman to predominantly positive reviews. It was successful enough to be moved Off Broadway for another ten-week run in 2008. The play's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian-themed works finding financial success. They were tempted {{to make it more}} appealing by turning to camp for comedy. However, one of the writers said, [...] "I just felt like, how can you turn these people into a joke? I mean, these people are real people! Why would I direct a play where <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> characters in some sort of contempt or felt that they were ridiculous? We are allowed to do something else besides camp." [...] The stage adaptation of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles was produced by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner, and it won the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award for [...] "fair, accurate, and inclusive" [...] portrayals of gay and lesbian people in New York Theater. In April 2008, Bannon appeared with the Seattle Women's Chorus in a performance called [...] "Vixen Fiction". Bannon read excerpts of her work and discussed the effects of her writing on her own life and the lives of her readers. U.S. cable network HBO has optioned Bannon's novels for potential development as a series.|$|E
