Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style.

The social measures, of exclusion and insecurity, assess the extent to which people are being treated unequally, their social exclusion and the extent of insecurity they experience. Finally, the data and trends in these performance dimensions <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> are complemented with data on a legitimization dimension <b>of</b> <b>democratization,</b> namely how people respond to these threats to democracy and development through various forms of civic action...|$|R

40|$|This {{concluding}} article {{tries to}} integrate the different insights of the individual case studies of this special issue into some comparative observations. The findings are related to debates and findings of the broader literature on democratization, {{with the aim of}} generating new insights that might help develop new studies on the topic. Importantly, our suggestions are to be considered as hypotheses complementary to the two dominant theories <b>of</b> <b>democratization,</b> rather than opposite to them, accepting both their key assumptions and stipulations. More specifically, two aspects of key concern to the study <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> are discussed in more detail: the phasing of the process <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> and the ambiguity of the process(es) of diffusion. We argue and show that, while accepting that the different phases of the process <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> might overlap in practice, the analytical distinction of democratic transition and consolidation provide clearer insights into the factors affecting processes <b>of</b> <b>democratization.</b> We also emphasize the importance of processes of diffusion in explaining (the different phases <b>of)</b> <b>democratization,</b> {{but at the same time}} analyse the current conceptual, methodological and theoretical problems involved in diffusion theory. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between oil wealth and the probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> {{has been widely}} investigated through the last decades. The negative effect that oil seems {{to have on the}} probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> is named the oil curse. Even though the subject has been investigated by many researchers for several years, the effect of oil on the probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> in different authoritarian regime types has not yet been studied statistically. This thesis investigates how oil rents affect the probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization</b> in three different authoritarian regime types: limited multiparty regimes, military regimes and oneparty regimes. I use a cross-sectional time-series dataset covering observations between 1960 and 2010, investigating if the oil curse is valid for all three regime types and if there are differences in the effect of oil between the regime types. The results of the analysis find support for the oil curse being present in limited multiparty regimes and one-party regimes. In military regimes, oil rents do not seem to have any negative effect on the probability <b>of</b> <b>democratization...</b>|$|R
