5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using <b>deficit</b> <b>spending,</b> public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise.|$|E

To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how the {{implementation}} of the Budgetary Stability Law has affected Political Budget Cycles generated by Spanish local governments. Specifically, we study whether the evolution of debt, budget <b>deficit,</b> capital <b>spending</b> and current spending over the electoral cycle has changed after the introduction of this law. We use a sample of 132 Spanish municipalities with more than 50, 000 inhabitants (including the provincial capitals) during the period 1995 – 2009. Our results show that the Budgetary Stability Law has avoided electoral cycles in debt. On the contrary, the adoption of this law has not mitigated the incumbents’ incentives to manipulate <b>deficit,</b> capital <b>spending</b> and current spending with electoral aims. Nevertheless, it has caused a change in the way in which mayors manipulate fiscal policy over the electoral cycle. The opportunistic expansion covered both preelectoral year and the electoral year before the implementation of this fiscal rule, while after that, <b>deficit</b> and <b>spending</b> increases are confined in the election year...|$|R
5|$|Using <b>deficit</b> <b>spending,</b> a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately {{were put to}} work, which gave them an income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly {{approved}} $250 {{million in}} spending cuts and Daniels renegotiated 30 different state contracts for {{a savings of}} $190 million, resulting in a budget of $23 billion. Annual spending growth for future budgets was cut to 2.8% from the 5.9% that had been standard for many years. Increase in revenues, coupled with the spending reductions, led to a $300 million budget surplus. Indiana is not permitted to take loans, as borrowing was prohibited in its constitution following the 1837 state bankruptcy. The state, therefore, had financed its <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> by reallocating $760 million in revenue that belonged to local government and school districts {{over the course of}} many years. The funds were gradually and fully restored to the municipal governments using the surplus money, and the state reserve fund was grown to $1.3 billion.|$|E

5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to <b>deficit</b> <b>spending.</b> His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} {{confines}} of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{conservatism}} in the UK {{was arguably}} most popular during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who, {{after a number}} of years of <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget. In 2010, {{as a result of the}} deterioration in the UK's public finances—according to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> under the previous Labour government, the late-2000s recession and by the European sovereign debt crisis—the Liberal Democrat-Conservative Coalition embarked on an austerity programme, featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises, in an attempt to halve the deficit and completely eliminate the structural deficit over the five-year parliament.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal {{conservatism}} is {{the economic}} philosophy of prudence in {{government spending and}} debt. Fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of <b>deficit</b> <b>spending,</b> the reduction of overall government spending and national debt, and ensuring balanced budgets.

40|$|This thesis investigates fiscal {{policies}} of subnational governments in Spain, {{a country whose}} regions are currently mired in a crisis of solvency. Many previous {{studies have suggested that}} political factors {{play an important role in}} determining <b>deficits,</b> <b>spending,</b> and debt. This paper examines the effect of such political factors as the party in power, the electoral cycle, the competitiveness of regional politics, and the degree of autonomy a region has, on fiscal outcomes, especially discretionary spending. The results show that much of the variation in fiscal outcomes can be explained by economic factors. However, some of the political factors are also relevant. The competitiveness of regional politics, especially whether the regional government is a coalition, or has just come to power, does affect fiscal outcomes, though not always as previous literature has found. Certain aspects of the Spanish system, like transfers from the federal government to regional governments, are also significant, in most cases in accordance with the literature. However, while this paper examines specifically what affects discretionary spending, here the results are less conclusive, and more work may be needed to determine not only what affects discretionary parts of spending, but what makes certain programs discretionary or non-discretionary...|$|R
