EBI {{can be used to}} share I/O pins controlling memory devices that are connected to two different memory controllers. Use of EBI reduces the total number of system pins required causing the system cost to come down. EBI manufacturers include Barco,Freescale Semiconductor,,Microchip,Atmel,and Silicon Labs.|$|R

30|$|As {{explained}} above, the tool/end effector {{is driven}} {{by a pair of}} active and passive mechanisms. Hereafter, this active–passive pair is called the rotational meshing actuator. Furthermore, for simplicity, the active and passive actuator components are called the A-Gear and P-Gear, respectively. Positive clutch and friction clutch are two typical mechanisms of rotation transmission. The friction clutch <b>enables</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> high-speed rotation, but its friction surface should be finished with high accuracy. On the other hand, positive clutches such as the jaw clutch have a simple mechanical structure, but are unsuitable for high-speed operation.|$|R

30|$|If studies {{persist in}} using remote sensing-based methods to {{characterize}} the post-fire environment, several steps should be considered. First, the use of definable, repeatable, and transferable (across ecosystems) units in the post-fire metrics are essential (Keeley 2009). Units <b>enable</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> physics models of the energy field and will simplify scaling. Second, consistency should be sought in the comparison between the remote sensing and validation data. Specifically, as noted by Miller et al. (2009) and others, if differenced spectral indices are used (i.e., indices that subtract the value at one date from another), then similarly differenced field measurables should also be used.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} among emotional neglect, a felt sense of positive emotional connection, self-injury (tissue-damaging behaviors) and dissociation were explored {{in a clinical}} sample consisting of 90 adult outpatient psychotherapy clients. Participants responded to questions concerning 5 types of childhood maltreatment (emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect); a felt sense of positive emotional <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> and <b>with</b> beings and entities in childhood; the number of types and frequency of self-injurious behaviors; {{and the level of}} dissociative symptornatology. Correlations among all variables were significant and in the expected directions except for positive emotional <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> beings and entities which was only significantly correlated with emotional neglect and positive emotional <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people.</b> The results showed, as hypothesized, that more emotional neglect was related to a greater likelihood that a person would self-injure, more types of self-injurious behaviors and a higher frequency of engaging in those behaviors. More emotional neglect was also related to higher levels of dissociation. The results also showed that higher levels of positive emotional <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> were related to a greater likelihood that a person would not engage in self-injury, a lower total number of self-injurious behaviors, less frequency of engaging in those behaviors, as well as less dissociative symptomatology. Implications for treatment are discussed. ^ Post hoc analyses with stepwise regression indicated that when all variables were used to predict self-injury, only dissociation and positive emotional <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> added uniquely to the variance. Interestingly, we did not find a unique contribution from any type of childhood maltreatment. However, in predicting dissociation, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect, added uniquely to the variance. These results and the implications for future research are discussed. ^ Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of the data collected, the unknown psychometric properties of some of the instruments used, and a sample with high levels of childhood maltreatment. ^ It is clear that the {{relationships among}} childhood maltreatment, a felt sense of positive emotional connection, self-injury, and dissociation are complex. Hopefully future research will help us to understand more about the nature of those relationships. ...|$|R
