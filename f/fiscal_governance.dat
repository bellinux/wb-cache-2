40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{achievements}} of the acceding countries in the sphere of procedural fiscal rules (labeled as <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance).</b> The primary goal is to answer two questions: what is the current state of <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> in the “novice” EU comparing to the “old” EU- 15 ? Can we prescribe the acceding states any country-specific fiscal procedures? Three major sections of the study aim at three different issues. Section 2 reviews the rationale for <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance,</b> and the main focus draws upon the common-pool problem. The next section reviews methods to find the <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> suitable for countries with differing political environments. Next, observed <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> is reported by means of indices from survey data gathered in May-June 2004. Group by group, the author compares the observations with what has been measured for EU- 15 countries. The findings reveal the existence of groups of countries with similar characteristics and similar institutional potential. fiscal governance; fiscal rules; political fragmentation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review several ‘models’ of {{governing}} structure found in metropolitan {{areas around the}} world from a fiscal perspective. We evaluate how different models achieve coordination of service delivery over the entire metropolitan area, {{the extent to which}} they allow for the equitable sharing of costs of services throughout the metropolitan area, and their ability to reduce negative or positive spillovers of service delivery across local boundaries. We then consider the advantages and disadvantages of different revenue-raising tools for metropolitan areas. We conclude by making a few suggestions with respect to metropolitan <b>fiscal</b> and <b>governance</b> developments in Latin America. ...|$|R

A theoretical analysis demonstrates how recent <b>fiscal</b> and <b>governance</b> reforms give rise to land conversion decisions and long run urban spatial sizes that respond to economic incentives even though the allocation of land between urban and rural uses is determined administratively. An econometric investigation of China's coastal provinces finds that changes in urban area are increasing {{in the value of}} urban land and budgetary government revenues and decreasing in the value of agricultural land, results consistent with the theoretical analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Common wisdom {{dictates}} that <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> (i. e. procedural fiscal rules) improves fiscal discipline. We rather find that selected fiscal constraints protect the coalitional status quo from logrolling. In effect, <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> may deteriorate fiscal position. In political economy with heterogeneous agents, we examine four procedural fiscal rules: limits on amendments in legislative committees, timing of {{a vote on}} the budget size, deficit targets, and spending level targets. We find that <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> protects the budgetary contract of governing coalition from attractive compromises with the opposition. When parties are evenly distributed across single policy dimension, and minimum winning connected coalitions are equiprobable, this protection is shown to magnify volatility in taxes and spending. Moreover, the volatility may increase in more fragmented party systems. We conclude <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> not always and not necessarily reduces fiscal costs of fragmentation.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> in Central and East European countries 1998 - 2008. The first part makes predictions about which form of <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> fits which form of government. Under multi-party coalition governments, fiscal contracts where governments make political commitments to multi-annual fiscal plans work well. In countries where two political blocks face off against one another, delegation based around a strong finance ministry should be most effective. The second part examines electoral and party systems, which affect the form of government in place. The third part documents norms, rules, and institutions in place. The final section {{considers the}} joint effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> on fiscal outcomes. On balance, the underlying political climate is crucial for determining what types of fiscal norms, institutions, and rules function best.

40|$|The recent global {{financial}} and economic crises, followed by fiscal crisis, have led many governments in Europe to adopt austerity measures {{in order to}} cope with the concurrent problems of lower revenues and high public debt. It can be expected that the need to undertake large-scale cutbacks would lead to changes in budgeting practices, budgetary institutions and modes of <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance.</b> Based on the existing literature on <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> and budgeting, it can be conjectured that in response to fiscal stress, the following shifts have taken (or are taking) place in <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> and budgetary institutions: movement from decentralized and bottom-up modes of budget preparation to centralized and top-down modes, adoption of numerical fiscal rules, and the revival of the 'more rational' budgetary decision-making techniques (e. g., performance-based budgeting, results-based budgeting, etc.) ...|$|E

The upshot of the analysis is that, as some authors have suggested, <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> based on compulsory and automatic rules is unlikely either to lead to sound fiscal policy or to be enforceable in an intergovernmental setting. Therefore a more integrated framework based on permanent institutions rather than rules is proposed and briefly sketched...|$|E

40|$|Especially {{since the}} start of the second decade of the twenty-first century, once more we have seen more focused {{interest}} in the use of SWFs by home states—less as a means of projecting sovereign financial power outwards and more as a means of internal financial management, and development. What makes this interesting from the perspective of SWF development is the role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in SWF development. This article takes a first look at the way in which IFIs have also begun to use SWFs in their interactions, with a emphasis on developing states. A review of some recent efforts to establish SWFs with a stabilization or development focus suggests the way in which these funds now may better serve the project of <b>fiscal</b> and <b>governance</b> internationalization, and the development of global policy coherence around the fiscal ideologies of IFIs, rather than as an instrument of national policy. Part II briefly sketches the IFI’s interest in and approach to SWFs as a part of their investment, capacity building and rule of law toolkits. Part III then reviews the manifestation of this approach in the development of SWFs in a number of developing states. The article suggests ways in which stabilization and development SWFs may better serve financial globalization than the particular interest of states establishing them precisely by transposing global standards of <b>fiscal</b> and <b>governance</b> behavior into the internal workings of states. In this sense, development and stabilization SWFs serve as an instrument of globalization from the top down (through IFI policy operationalization) perhaps as effectively as SWFs that seek to project national financial power through private market investments abroad. But it also creates the possibility of divergence in SWF character as the consequences of the use of SWFs as governance devices may produce substantial deviation from the traditional organizational parameters of SWFs as instruments of macroeconomic policy...|$|R

40|$|With a rapid {{centralisation}} {{of fiscal}} sovereignty now being aired {{as a possibility}} following on from the financial and economic crisis, this thesis considers how legitimising discourses are shaping the efforts to reform EU <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance.</b> Norman Fairclough’s ‘moderately constructivist’ three-dimensional framework for CDA is drawn upon. This approach is also combined with insights drawn from the new institutionalist literature base (particularly from its historical and discursive strands of thought), with an additional emphasis being placed on broader understandings of structural forms of power as developed through the writings of Susan Strange. It is found that the emerging debate over EU <b>fiscal</b> <b>governance</b> reform is dominated by a limiting neoliberal legitimising discourse. This research also makes a contribution {{to our understanding of}} the ideational and institutional roots of the current impasse in European Integration.

Moreover, increased dependency on oil extraction puts a serious threat to Nigeria’s industrial competitive future.
