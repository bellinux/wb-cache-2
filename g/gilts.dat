5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (<b>gilts),</b> along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as <b>gilts.</b> On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E
5|$|The global {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s affected Ireland less because of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks were reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government <b>gilts.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of this borrowing to the Government's totals increases the National Debt from £537 billion, or 37.7% of GDP to around 45%, breaking the so-called Golden Rule which sets the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement threshold at below 40%.

In the 2008 Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the government would issue £14 billion of <b>gilts</b> in order to cover the Northern Rock debt.|$|E
25|$|Inflation-indexed bonds (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), {{in which}} the {{principal}} amount and the interest payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The United Kingdom was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked <b>gilts</b> in the 1980s. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{collection}} is more demanding and requires more training than semen collection because the female reproductive organs are located {{inside of the}} body cavity. Superovulation is a technique used {{in order to have}} a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads. Follicle stimulating hormone is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because <b>gilts</b> and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. Superovulation can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and success will vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization. In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less. Technicians are able to determine the sex of the embryo, which can be especially beneficial in the dairy industry because it is more desirable for the embryo to be a female. Vitrification is the preferred method of embryo freezing because it yields higher quality embryos. It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.|$|E

2500|$|The {{yield to}} {{maturity}} (YTM), book yield or redemption yield of a bond or other fixed-interest security, such as <b>gilts,</b> is the internal {{rate of return}} (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond will be held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments will be made on schedule. Yield to maturity is the discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (coupons and principal) is equal to the price of the bond. The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets (such as <b>gilts)</b> the convention is to quote annualised yields with semi-annual compounding (see compound interest); [...] thus, for example, an annual effective yield of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 × 1.05 = 1.1025.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} inflation-indexed bonds, {{fixed-income}} securities {{linked to a}} specific price index. The most common examples are US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and UK Index Linked <b>Gilts.</b> The interest and principal repayments under this type of bond are adjusted in line with a Consumer Price Index (in the US this is the CPI-U for urban consumers). This means that these bonds are guaranteed to outperform the inflation rate (unless (a) the market price has increased so that the [...] "real" [...] yield is negative, which {{is the case in}} 2012 for many such UK bonds, or (b) the government or other issuer defaults on the bond). This allows investors of all types to preserve the purchasing power of their money even at times of high inflation. For example, assuming 3.88% inflation over the course of 1 year (just about the 56 year average inflation rate, through most of 2006), and a real yield of 2.61% (the fixed US Treasury real yield on October 19, 2006, for a 5 yr TIPS), the adjusted principal of the fixed income would rise from 100 to 103.88 and then the real yield would be applied to the adjusted principal, meaning 103.88 x 1.0261, which equals 106.5913; giving a total return of 6.5913%. TIPS moderately outperform conventional US Treasuries, which yielded just 5.05% for a 1 yr bill on October 19, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able to save for retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, <b>gilts</b> or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that litter size, the amount of floor space during the growing period, {{and the number of}} pigs the gilt, or female pig, is placed with while growing affect the {{reproduction}} rates of the <b>gilts.</b> Data from a study in 1976 by Nelson and Robinson showed that <b>gilts</b> from a small litter size ovulated more than the <b>gilts</b> from the larger litters. The study suggests stress plays a role in impacting the reproduction. The amount of floor space has been shown to impact the time it takes <b>gilts</b> to reach puberty. An adequate amount of floor space allowed the higher percentage of <b>gilts</b> to reach puberty sooner than those <b>gilts</b> who had less floor space. The <b>gilts</b> placed in smaller groups bore one more pig per litter than <b>gilts</b> in larger groups.
