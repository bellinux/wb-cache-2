5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of diffusion damping is calculated as a damping factor or suppression factor, {{represented by the}} symbol , which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). What affect the diffusion length are primarily {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plasma may also affect the damping process.|$|E

5|$|This project, {{based on}} the village of Shapwick, was begun by Mick Aston of Bristol University to {{investigate}} the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical English village. A preliminary study of the village's history was carried out using maps and documents, then surveys of the buildings were made together with botanical surveys. Field walking was carried out and key sites excavated. A report on the project, which ran from 1989 to 1999, was published in eight volumes.|$|E
5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E

5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sail in Dimetrodon {{was related to the}} evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor, which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The {{strength of}} the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plasma may also affect the damping process. The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.|$|E

5|$|This traditional, {{historical}} {{portrayal of}} the North-West Mounted Police influenced that of the RCMP, who used their predecessor's history {{to build their own}} status as a Canadian national symbol. Although the RCMP as an organisation formally dates from 1920, the modern force chose to trace its own history back to the foundation of the mounted police in 1873, rather than, for example, drawing on the Dominion Police's foundation date of 1868. The RCMP's centennial in 1973 saw celebratory events across Canada, various historical publications and even proposals – turned down by the mounted police – for a reenactment of the March West. The RCMP used the celebrations to redefine the early history of the mounted police in line with contemporary policing objectives, focusing on the force's role in shaping the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liberal, tolerant, modern Canada.|$|E
