5|$|Eardwulf (fl. 790– c. 830) {{was king}} of Northumbria from 796 to 806, {{when he was}} deposed and went into exile. He may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria {{in the last years}} of the eighth century was the scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king Æthelred I {{attempted}} to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may have been viewed as a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by Osbald: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{acquired}} full {{ownership of}} the Jets on February 9, 1984, when Helen Dillion sold her 25%interest to him. Before the season, New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints. New York began its season with veteran Pat Ryan as starting quarterback; O'Brien was spending most weekdays waiting to testify about an altercation at the Studio 54 nightclub, at which Jets players had been present and, by some accounts, involved. The Jets <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> consecutive mediocre season, finishing 7–9 after starting the season 6–2.|$|E

His first Liverpool goal was 11 days later in a 3-2 derby comeback win after being two down to Everton. Liverpool <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> consecutive fifth place league finish. They exited the 1970-71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals to Leeds United. Brian Hall's goal clinched a 1970-71 FA Cup 2-1 comeback semi final over Everton. Heighway put Liverpool ahead in extra time in the final. Arsenal this time came back to win 2–1 for a Gunners League and cup double.|$|E

5|$|Radstock <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{railway station}} on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway {{extension}} to Bath, which closed to passengers in 1966. The stations were {{adjacent to each other}} in the centre of the town, and each had level crossings across the busy A367 road, causing long tailbacks at busy periods. The S line also carried substantial coal traffic. A spur from the Great Western line on to the S and continuing to Writhlington Colliery remained open for a few years after the railway's closure to passenger traffic, until the colliery closed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Remek was {{an active}} member both in the Pioneers and the Czechoslovak Union of Youth. He studied {{mathematics}} and physics at middle school in Čáslav where he earned awards in track running the 400-meter, 800-meter, and 1,500-meter events. Remek graduated in 1966 and proceeded to Vyšší Letecké Učiliště, an aviation school in Košice, where he trained in an Aero L-29 Delfín.

5|$|Terceira {{argued that}} she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> horse, Chaka III, {{who should have}} been used in the injured Navantus' place, was {{regularly}} faster than Nisbett's Antille 8 and should have earned the qualification position. She also accused the Bermuda Equestrian Federation of making the decision based on political or racial motivations, which the organization denied. BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which is the reason why the horse was not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position. Nisbett, however, withdrew from the Olympic position later that June. Terceira took his place.|$|E

The stage show <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> run on 13 and 14 December 1973 with a different cast including David Essex, Elkie Brooks, Marsha Hunt, Vivian Stanshall, Roy Wood, and Jon Pertwee.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1865 by the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, {{and had a}} single {{platform}}.

The station was expanded over the years, and at one point had four porters staffing it. However the Severn Beach Line declined over {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century and by the 1970s the station had no staff and only one platform. Services however have increased since 2000.|$|E

5|$|Unsigned by the Kings {{two years}} after his NHL draft, he became a free agent in the 2004 off-season. On June 7, 2004, he was signed by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He began his {{professional}} career with Anaheim's minor league affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2004–05. During that season, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> opportunity to play with his brother, Reagan Rome, as the latter was called up from Cincinnati's ECHL affiliate, the Reading Royals, for two games. Playing 74 games in his rookie AHL season, he scored 2 goals and 16 points. He helped Cincinnati to {{the second round of}} the 2005 playoffs, adding 3 goals and 6 points over 12 post-season games.|$|E
5|$|Urse died {{some time}} in 1108. Little is known of his wife, Alice, whose death is unrecorded. Urse was succeeded as sheriff by his son Roger d'Abetot, who was exiled in about 1110 and {{forfeited}} the office of sheriff. Roger's successor, Osbert d'Abetot, was probably Urse's brother. Urse also had a daughter, probably named Emmeline, who married Walter de Beauchamp. Walter succeeded to Urse's lands after Roger's exile. A charter for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey may indicate that Urse <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> son, named Robert. Urse may also have had another daughter, who married Robert Marmion, as some of Urse's estates went to Marmion's family and others to the Beauchamps.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{to avoid}} war, Tsar Peter sent his two sons, Boris and Roman, as hostages to Constantinople. This move failed to appease Nikephoros, {{but he was}} not able or willing to {{campaign}} against Bulgaria; his forces were engaged in the East, and furthermore, drawing on the Byzantines' past experience, Nikephoros was reluctant to mount an expedition into the mountainous and heavily forested terrain of Bulgaria. Consequently, he resorted to the old Byzantine expedient of calling in a tribe from eastern Europe to attack Bulgaria. In late 966 or early 967, he dispatched the patrikios Kalokyros, a citizen of Cherson, as his ambassador to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus'. The Byzantines had long maintained close relations with the Rus', with whom they were bound by treaty. With promises of rich rewards and, according to Leo the Deacon, a payment of 1,500pounds of gold, the Rus' ruler was induced to attack Bulgaria from the north. That Nikephoros should call upon Sviatoslav for aid was unusual, since the Pechenegs were traditionally used for such tasks. The historian A.D. Stokes, who examined the questions surrounding the background and chronology of Sviatoslav's Bulgarian campaign, suggested that this move <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> motive of turning the attention of Sviatoslav, who had recently destroyed the Khazar khanate, away from the Byzantine outpost of Cherson.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore factors that affect the decisions single-child parents make when considering whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> child applying the psychological theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Quantitative survey data from a sample of parents with a single child selected from a Slovak representative sample was used to perform regression analysis assessing effects of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived control on intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> child within the next three years. Results largely confirm the model captured in TPB. All three components of the TPB <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> child. <b>A</b> particular set of liberal and conservative attitudes facilitate plans to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> child. The strongest predictors, however, are the perceived pressure from the social environment (subjective norm) and subjective desire to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> child (perceived control). The study concludes that, along with demographic and sociological variables, psychological factors play a significant role in decision-making processes concerning reproductive planning...|$|R
