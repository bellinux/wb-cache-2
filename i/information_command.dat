50|$|The {{official}} Air Technical <b>Information</b> <b>Command</b> {{report on}} the crash stated that they were {{of the opinion that}} Captain Mantell lost consciousness due to oxygen starvation. The trimmed aircraft had continued to climb until increasing altitude caused a sufficient loss of power for it to level out. The aircraft then began to turn left due to torque and as the wing drooped, so did the nose, until it was in a tight turning spiral. The uncontrolled descent resulted in excessive speed causing the aircraft to disintegrate. It is believed that Captain Mantell never regained consciousness. This was borne out {{by the fact that the}} canopy lock was still in place after the crash, discounting any attempt to abandon the aircraft. They also stated that the UFO was in no way responsible for the crash.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{primary purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} requirements of naval command and control for future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and to propose solutions for current limitations. Currently, UAVs co-exist as a collection of independent systems that have poor interoperability and limited functionality beyond strategic reconnaissance. As UAVs mature, they will increasingly be deployed at the unit level and employed tactically, increasing the need for coordination and the dissemination of <b>information.</b> <b>Command</b> and control systems must evolve to keep pace with this development. A description of contemporary and proposed UAV systems is presented, and this Thesis uses a scenario to illustrate current limitations and develop the requirements for UAV command and control[URL] United States Navy Reserv...|$|E
40|$|While {{information}} {{has always been}} the substance of which command and control is made, it has become the thumbscrew of current military, business, and political strategy and operations. From the military perspective, {{information has}} become the centerpiece of net-centric warfare and as such has, in essence, become the most recent, fifth, military domain. (1) For the four older, previous military domains, we have developed methods and means to wage war and to command and control what we call the kinetic space. But so far we have developed little to no methods or means of providing the decision-maker a capability to command and control the new domain of warfare, the information space. This paper attempts to raise the level of awareness regarding the need for <b>information</b> <b>command</b> and control (IC 2) by addressing some critical challenges surrounding IC 2 and offering some insight to fledgling research that attempts to begin meeting these challenges. It is worthy to note from the start that {{the purpose of this paper}} is not to offer the solution, but rather to raise the level of awareness and to suggest some approaches to the need described...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effectiveness of continuous haptic peripheral displays in supporting multiple UAV supervisory control. Background: Previous research shows that continuous auditory peripheral displays can enhance operator performance in monitoring events that are continuous in nature, such as monitoring how well UAVs stay on their pre-planned courses. This research also shows that auditory alerts can be masked by other auditory <b>information.</b> <b>Command</b> and control operations are generally performed in noisy environments with multiple auditory alerts presented to the operators. In order to avoid this masking problem, another potentially useful sensory channel for providing redundant information to UAV operators is the haptic channel. Method: A pilot experiment was conducted with 13 participants, using a simulated multiple UAV supervisory control task. All participants completed two haptic feedback conditions (continuous and threshold), where they received alerts based on UAV course deviations and late arrivals to targets. Results: Threshold haptic feedback was found to be more effective for late target arrivals, whereas continuous haptic feedback resulted in faster reactions to course deviations. Conclusions: Continuous haptic feedback appears to be more appropriate for monitoring events that are continuous in nature (i. e., how well a UAV keeps its course). In contrast, threshold haptic feedback appears to better support response to discrete events (i. e., late target arrivals). Future research: Because this is a pilot study, {{more research is needed to}} validate these preliminary findings. A direct comparison between auditory and haptic feedback is also needed to provide better insights into the potential benefits of multi-modal peripheral displays in command and control of multiple UAVs.
