Optimized kinetic process (OKP) technology is implemented to realize HCCI combustion in a {{port fuel injection}} gasoline engine. The combustion and emission characteristics are investigated with variation of intake air temperature, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> The results show that intake air temperature has great influence on HCCI combustion characteristic.

The degree of in-cylinder mixture homogeneity is judged by the overall equivalence ratio and evaporation concentration. A 3 -D simulation was carried out for port injected diesel fuel for fixed valve lift and steady state condition. The degree of homogeneity of incylinder mixture for port injected fuel is judged by the percentage volume occupied by the required equivalence ratio for different regions of total cylinder volume. The parametric simulation approach for intake air temperature, pressure, port wall temperature, fuel injection duration and fuel injection pressure is used to optimize the homogeneity of in-cylinder mixture.

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} largely {{proposed}} as a possible fuel for internal combustion engines. The main advantage of burning hydrogen {{is the absence of}} carbon-based tailpipe emissions. Hydrogen’s wide flammability also offers the advantage of very lean combustion and higher engine efficiency than conventional carbon-based fuels. In order to avoid abnormal combustion modes like pre-ignition and backfiring, as well as air displacement from hydrogen’s large injected volume per cycle, direct injection of hydrogen after intake valve closure is the preferred mixture preparation method for hydrogen engines. The current work focused on computational studies of hydrogen injection and mixture formation for direct-injection spark-ignition engines. Hydrogen conditions at the injector’s nozzle exit are typically sonic. Initially the characteristics of under-expanded sonic hydrogen jets were investigated in a quiescent environment using both Reynolds-Averaged NavierStokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Various injection conditions were studied, including a reference case from the literature. Different nozzle geometries were investigated, including a straight nozzle with fixed cross section and a stepped nozzle design. LES captured details of the expansion shocks better than RANS and demonstrated several aspects of hydrogen’s injection and mixing. Incylinder simulations were also performed with a side 6 -hole injector using 70 and 100 bar injection pressure. Injection timing was set to just after inlet valve closure with duration of 6 μs and 8 μs, leading to global air-to-fuel equivalence ratios  typically in the region of 0. 2 – 0. 4.

40|$|The use of {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} (CNG) in light duty applications is still restricted to conventional spark ignition engines operating at low compression ratio, so overall efficiency is limited. A combustion concept that has been successfully applied on large stationary engines {{and to some extent}} on heavy-duty engines is dual-fuel combustion, where a compression-ignited diesel pilot injection is used to ignite a homogeneous charge of methane gas and air. CNG is injected in the intake ports during the intake stroke and later in the cycle the premixed air-CNG mixture is ignited via a pilot diesel injection close to top dead center. However, this concept has not been applied to a significant extent on light duty engines yet. The main reasons are linked to high temperature methane oxidation requirements and poor combustion efficiency at diluted conditions at low loads. Therefore, in this paper an experimental investigation of the effects of different intake manifold conditions on the dual-fuel combustion process is presented, based on performance and emissions of a light duty diesel engine rebuilt for dual-fuel operation operated at low loads and lean conditions. The main goal is to understand how intake temperature and pressure affects the combustion process and to identify possible control strategies for those parameters over the low load range of operation. Results show that intake air temperature {{plays an important role in}} the flame propagation process at highly diluted conditions and higher air temperature allows a sharp reduction in total unburned hydrocarbon emissions (TUHC).

40|$|Problem statement: The {{technology}} of turbocharger {{has been used}} with internal combustion engines since 1905 to increase <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> prior to putting it into the cylinders to increase thermal efficiency of the engine. Based on previous researches and uses of turbochargers, the pattern of turbocharger installation remains the same, either in series or in parallel.

The combined turbocharger set comprised two turbochargers {{of the same size}} having exhaust turbine connected in parallel to let both turbochargers work simultaneously and having intake air compressor connected in series for two stage compress. Approach: This research aimed to study the thermal efficiency of a combined turbocharger set with gasoline engine. The study was done by comparing the thermal efficiency between the combined turbocharger set and the parallel turbocharger set. The variation of both temperature and pressure of the intake air and exhaust gas were also investigated. The engine used in the study was TOYOTA engine model 1 JZ-GTE with six cylinders and a total displacement volume of 2, 491 cc. The engine was already installed with parallel turbocharger from the factory, therefore, the thermal efficiency test of the parallel turbocharger case was conducted first. Then, the engine was modified to be a combined turbocharger set and tested by the same procedure. The test was run under the speed of 2, 000 - 5, 000 rpm. Results: According to the test, the combined turbocharger set gave higher thermal efficiency than the parallel turbocharger set in all range of speed. At the speed of 2, 500, 3, 000, 3, 500, 4, 000, 4, 500 and 5, 000 rpm, the thermal efficiency of the combined turbocharger set was equal to 39. 37, 57. 73, 79. 30, 67. 66, 60. 63 and 55. 05 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the thermal efficiency of the parallel turbocharger set was equal to 15. 40, 22. 61, 44. 96, 55. 21, 56. 38 and 52. 24 %, respectively. Conclusion: It could be seen that the thermal efficiency of the combined turbocharger set was higher than that of the parallel set by 2. 55 times at the speed range of 2, 500 - 3, 000 rpm. The efficiency of the combined turbocharger would be equal or higher than that of the parallel set by 1. 05 times at the speed of 5, 000 rpm...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} is increasing. The problem of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions is approached by exploring various vehicle propulsion options, assessing their net eff�ectiveness on a energy conversion basis {{and on a}} usability (consumer appeal) basis. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of various options indicates that internal combustion engine powered vehicles compare favourably because of low production cost in spite of only achieving modest energy conversion efficiency in operation. Spark ignition (SI) homogeneous charge engines have dominated as passenger vehicle power plants, {{and are likely to}} maintain their prevalence for passenger vehicle propulsion into the future, but efficiency improvements are required and achievable. Throttling losses are a signifi�cant contributor to reduced efficiency at low load for SI engines which is the load range most employed in standard driving behaviour. An Induction Air Motor (IAM) was conceived, designed, simulated and prototyped to evaluate the potential to recover some of the work the engine does to reduce its <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> for low load operation. The prototyped IAM produced work which potentially could contribute to the engine output while reducing the intake pressure resulting in improved efficiency. However, further eff�ort is required to reduce the friction in the IAM and optimise the work produced by the IAM. An alternative strategy for efficiency improvement involves high Compression Ratio (CR) in conjunction with a reduced compression stroke volume achieved by Late Valve Closing (LVC). Such an arrangement of the Atkinson cycle is shown by simulation to produce improved brake efficiency in SI engines. In this cofin�guration, the maximum power produced by the engine is considerably lower than the maximum power that is achieved by the same displacement for a full compression stroke. To achieve both the improved efficiency at low load using the Atkinson confi�guration and the power achievable from a full induction stroke, the engine requires Variable Compression Ratio (VCR). Assessment of VCR concepts from literature and patents identifi�ed that the complexity of continuously variable compression ratio designs prevented their development to production-ready con�figurations. A simulation of fuel consumption over a standard driving cycle showed that a two-position VCR arrangement produces the same bene�t as a continuously variable CR for physically achievable piston-rod-crank cofin�gurations. Experiments with supporting simulations were performed for a previously patented two-position VCR device, an eccentric link in the big-end of the connecting rod. This work concludes that the eccentric link is not a viable VCR mechanism. An alternative VCR device involving a hydraulic connecting rod was prompted by further experiments and simulations which identifi�ed the behaviour of oil when compressed at high rates in a hydraulic cylinder impacted by a falling mass. The oil impact work suggested that oil chambers of cross-sectional area that could be arranged in a conventional connecting rod could readily support the loads experienced by the rod in a conventionally con�figured engine, so the design and prototyping of a hydraulic connecting rod proceeded. Experiments and simulation confi�rmed that a relatively easily manufactured hydraulic connection rod can be successfully operated in an engine, achieving controllable two-position VCR. Further development of the hydraulic connecting rod control device and improved production techniques are recommended for this new two-position hydraulic VCR device. ...|$|E
40|$|Compressed-air systems {{account for}} about 10 % of total industrial-energy use for few {{selected}} countries as found in literatures. Compressed air is typically {{one of the most}} expensive utilities in an industrial facility. This paper describes a comprehensive literature review about compressed air energy use, savings, and payback period of energy efficient strategies. This paper compiles latest literatures in terms of thesis (MS and PhD), journal articles, conference proceedings, web materials, reports, books, handbooks on compressed air energy use, efficiency, energy savings strategies. Computer tools for compressed air analysis have been reviewed and presented in this paper. Various energy-saving measures, such as use of highly efficient motors, VSD, leak prevention, use of outside <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> reducing <b>pressure</b> drop, recovering waste heat, use of efficient nozzle, and use of variable displacement compressor to save compressed-air energy have been reviewed. Based on review results, it has been found that for an electric motor used in a compressed-air system, a sizeable amount of electric energy and utility bill can be saved using high efficient motors and applying VSDs in matching speed requirements. Also, significant amounts of energy and emission are reducible through various energy-saving strategies. Payback periods for different energy savings measures have been identified and found to be economically viable in most cases.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engines are}} one of the most {{promising}} engine technologies for the future of energy conversion from clean, efficient combustion. HCCI engines allow high efficiency and lower CO 2 emission through the use of high compression ratios and the removal of intake throttle valves (like Diesel), and allow very low levels of urban pollutants like nitric oxide and soot (like Otto). These engines, however, are not without their challenges, such as low power density compared with other engine technologies, and a difficulty in controlling combustion timing. This dissertation first addresses the power output limits. The particular strategies for enabling high power output investigated in this dissertation focus on avoiding five critical limits that either damage an engine, drastically reduce efficiency, or drastically increase emissions: 1) ringing limits, 2) peak in-cylinder pressure limits, 3) misfire limits, 4) low intake temperature limits, and 5) excessive emissions limits. The research shows that the key factors that enable high power output, sufficient for passenger vehicles, while simultaneously avoiding the five limits defined above are the use of: 1) high <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>pressures</b> allowing improved power output, 2) highly delayed combustion timing to avoid ringing limits, and 3) using the highest possible equivalence ratio before encountering ringing limits. These results are revealed by conducting extensive experiments spanning a wide range of operating conditions on a multi-cylinder HCCI engine. Second, this dissertation discusses strategies for effectively sensing combustion characteristics on a HCCI engine. For effective feedback control of HCCI combustion timing, a sensor is required to quantify when combustion occurs. Many laboratory engines use in-cylinder pressure sensors but these sensors are currently prohibitively expensive for wide-scale commercialization. Instead, ion sensors made from inexpensive sparkplugs are proposed for sensing combustion timing. Ion sensing, however, is unreliable under certain HCCI conditions. The dissertation presents two strategies for improving the usefulness of ion sensors in HCCI engines: 1) the use of tiny fractions of metal-acetate fuel additives that expand the useful range of ion sensors, and 2) the use of ion sensors for detecting excessive ringing that must be avoided in HCCI engines. These two innovative research efforts make ion sensors viable for sensing combustion characteristics across the full range of HCCI operation, making them effective for use in engine control systems. In summary, this Ph. D dissertation addresses two important technical challenges facing HCCI engines: power output limits, and difficulty in sensing combustion characteristics for control applications. The strategies proposed in this dissertation research bring HCCI engines closer to widespread commercialization allowing vehicles to operate with significantly higher efficiency and with cleaner emissions...|$|R
