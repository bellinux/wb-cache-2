25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

Underneath it, there’s this subtext and feeling of this kind of darkness. It was a connection I felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Brain had {{declined}} {{the offer of}} a knighthood in the late 1960s, but accepted appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1979. When asked {{towards the end of}} his life why he had achieved so much but was not as well known as other aviation pioneers, he replied [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> very careful and didn't kill myself". Having suffered from cancer for several years, Brain died in Sydney on 30June 1980. He was survived by his wife and children, and cremated. In November 2008, Qantas announced that one of its new Airbus A380s would be named Lester Brain.|$|E

Owing {{to a lack of}} style, he was known during his primary school years as [...] "Basher Brooks", {{but by the time he}} entered Churchlands Senior High School, his stroke had become more technically refined. Nevertheless, he was always confident in his mental ability, stating [...] "before I just swam on guts, now I had the stroke as well as the guts. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the toughest kid in the race." ...|$|E

The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo."

[...] Gaga also said that her intent was to take [...] "the idea that America is full of young people that are inundated with information and technology and turn it into something that was more of a commentary on the kind of country that we are." ...|$|E
500|$|Trumble {{spent part}} of his early life in the western Victorian town of Ararat before {{returning}} to Melbourne, settling in suburban Camberwell. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble—a keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club—set out a cricket pitch at the family home. He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling. Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, [...] "Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> pretty close to it" ...|$|E

Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there. As a kid, I needed to be reminded of that sometimes." [...] His baseball role models growing up were Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{attended}} Columbia High School, {{where she}} was a member of the track team, a cheerleader and was a classmate of Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, [...] "I had a love for – I don't know if it was necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever it was, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Angel of Death" [...] caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well {{as their}} {{families}} and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Burn Black" [...] and [...] "Dicknail" [...] also feature {{aggressive}} {{language and}} themes alluding to child molestation and incest. [...] "Beautiful Son", written and recorded in 1992, features a more mellow guitar riff, and its lyrics make references to crossdressing. Love said the songwriting process {{on the track}} {{was an attempt to}} [...] "be a little dumber. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> trying to write a very complex song without ever having learned to write an easy Beatles song," [...] noted in a 1994 interview. [...] "It just had a riff. It wasn't super smart but it sounded good and that's when I started learning things don't have to have lots and lots of notes. That the best songs are carried by simple lines and simple melodies." [...] This illustrates the band's turning point from their noise rock beginnings to more mellow, accessible sounds.|$|E
500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{begins his}} verse {{approximately}} {{one minute and}} forty-five seconds in, singing the new lyrics [...] "It’s like every time you call me/ You know I can’t leave you lonely/ 'Cause <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> there when you need/ You said that you'd be there 'til the end/ What must I say/ I {{never thought it would}} happen this way oh/ But I can tell if you're gone again/ got my number… things til the end.” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I., the song ends with a fade. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It is the second time that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E

500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then and there... She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister, and <b>I</b> ... <b>was</b> <b>always</b> out of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Sevigny took on {{the lead}} female role in the art house film The Brown Bunny (2003), which details a lonely {{traveling}} motorcycle racer reminiscing about his former lover. The film achieved notoriety for its final scene, which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics. She went on to defend the movie, [...] "It's a shame people write so many things when they haven't seen it. When you see the film, it makes more sense. It's an art film. It should be playing in museums. It's like an Andy Warhol movie." [...] After the film's release at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the William Morris Agency terminated Sevigny as a client. The agency believed the scene was [...] "one step above pornography", and claimed that Sevigny's career [...] "may never recover". In an interview with The Telegraph in 2003, when asked if she regretted the film, she responded: [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> committed to the project {{on the strength of}} Vincent alone. I have faith in his aesthetic... I try to forgive and forget, otherwise I'd just become a bitter old lady." ...|$|E
