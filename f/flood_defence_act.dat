40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Flood</b> <b>defence</b> {{maintenance}} strategies {{require understanding}} of the time-dependent behaviour of <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> Quantitative risk and reliability methods provide a rational decision-making basis for <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> management. Failure mechanisms influencing the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> reliability are expressed by a limit state equation and organised in a fault tree. One or more random variables in the limit state equation may be time-dependent. Quantitative information about and understanding of time-dependency of <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> is often limited. A modelling methodology identifying the relevant variables and uncertainties involved with timedependent processes, {{the character of the}} process and appropriate statistical models is therefore introduced. The modelling methodology is demonstrated on anchored sheet pile walls in a <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system in the Thames Estuary. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets such as earth {{embankments}} {{comprise the}} {{vital part of}} linear <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> in many countries including the UK and protect inland from flooding. The risks of flooding are likely to increase in the future due to increasing pressure on land use, increasing rainfall events and rising sea level caused by climate change also affect aging <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets. Therefore, {{it is important that}} the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets are maintained at a high level of safety and serviceability. The high costs associated with preserving these deteriorating <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets and the limited funds available for their maintenance require the development of systematic approaches to ensure the sustainable flood-risk management system. The integration of realistic deterioration measurement and reliabilitybased performance assessment techniques has tremendous potential for structural safety and economic feasibility of <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets. Therefore, the need for reliability-based performance assessment is evident. However, investigations on time-dependent reliability analysis of <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets are limited. This paper presents a novel approach for time-dependent reliability analysis of <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assets. In the analysis, time-dependent fragility curve is developed by using the state-based stochastic deterioration model.

40|$|The {{coming decades}} the Netherlands will {{continue}} to urbanize, {{through the construction of}} houses and the reconstruction of old neighbourhoods and industrial areas. The need to maximise the possibilities of the scarce space at the urban waterfront connects flood security and spatial planning ever more closely. The current competition of space often makes it impossible to reinforce the <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> in urban areas in a traditional way; therefore it is necessary to find alternative solutions. The application of multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> can contribute to overcoming this challenge. The multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> concept aims to use the (limited) space that is still available along the popular waterfront by integrating several functions into a multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defence.</b> This way the concept can help to reduce the conflicts between spatial planning requirements and flood security. Especially in densely populated areas {{there is a need for}} further development of this concept. There is to be expected that opportunities will arise the coming years for the realisation of multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> due to the flood security assignment, especially at the riverfronts. However the opportunities to do more with the integration of <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> and spatial planning developments are barely used. In order to understand this, there needs to be more insight into the decision-making process of multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> This research opportunity leads to the following main research question: What are key factors that influence the decision-making process of multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> projects and how can those factors influence the decision-making process? In this research a multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> is in this research defined as: a primary <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> that is constructed or adapted to serve secondary non-common functions whereby retaining water remains the main function of the <b>flood</b> <b>defence.</b> Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural EngineeringConstruction Management and Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Polders in the Netherlands are {{protected}} from flooding by primary and regional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> systems. During the last decade, scientific research in flood risk {{focused on the}} development of a probabilistic approach to quantify the probability of flooding of the primary <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system. This paper proposed a methodology to quantify the probability of flooding of regional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> systems, which required several additions to the methodology used for the primary <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system. These additions focused on a method to account for regulation of regional water levels, the possibility of (reduced) intrusion resistance due to maintenance dredging in regional water, the probability of traffic loads and the influence of dependence between regional water levels and the phreatic surface of a regional <b>flood</b> <b>defence.</b> In addition, reliability updating is used to demonstrate the potential for updating the probability of failure of regional <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> with performance observations. The results demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be used to determine the probability of flooding of a regional <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system. In doing so, the methodology contributes to improving flood risk management in these systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Reliability {{analysis}} of the Caldicot Levels <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system by using Dutch reliability methods for <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> F. A. Buijs In {{the light of the}} shift to a risk-based safety assessment of <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> in the UK a project called RASP, Risk Assessment of Strategic Planning, is carried out at among others HRWallingford. Part of this project is to develop a detailed level methodology supporting decision-making at the scale of one <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system. In this Msc thesis the reliability-based tools as applied to <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> in the Netherlands are tested on a <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system in the UK, the Caldicot Levels <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system, in order to support an evaluation of the appropriateness of these tools as part of the detailed level methodology in RASP. The Caldicot Levels <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system is located at the south coast of Wales in the UK. The system borders the Severn Estuary in the south, the river Usk in the west and a distinct line of hills in the north and east. In the Severn estuary one of the largest tidal ranges in the world occurs, a range that varies between 9 and 15 meter. The River Usk is a small river, however the water levels can reach quite high values especially in case of high water levels at the Severn Estuary. The Dutch reliability methods for <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> mainly consist of two parts. Software called PC-Ring which calculates the probability of failure of a <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system. Second, a process that selects the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> sections which are most representative of the systems probability of failure. The first step in the reliability analysis is the definition of the system. This step points out the relevant defence length for the calculation of the probability of inundation and the area which suffers consequences in case the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system fails. The second step is to define the systems components, or the defence types that occur in the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system. Part of the second step is to determine the different failure modes which can cause failure of the components. The third step is to select for each failure mode the weak cross sections in the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> system which contribute most to the total probability of failure. The last step is gather the data connected to the selected cross sections and perform the calculations with PC-Ring. The results point out the weakest links in the system and which random variables contribute most to the variance of the total probability of failure. Apart from the probability of failure of the present system, the probability of failure of the system with improvements is regarded. The Dutch reliability-based methods for <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> prove to be suitable for relatively highly engineered systems with a high data availability - compared to UK standards. Adaptations of PC-Ring to the UK site point out that the set-up of the program is not very flexible. However, considering the diverse nature of the <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> in the UK and the often relatively low data availability, a flexible reliability-based computer program for <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> will be required in the UK.

Furthermore, computational efficiency is achieved by delaying cost calculations until they are actually needed by the graph algorithm. This significantly reduces the required number of computationally expensive flood risk calculations. In this paper, we conduct a number of case studies to compare the optimal paths found by the proposed approach with the results of competing methods that generate identical results. The proposed approach is set up in a generic way and implements the shortest-path approach for optimising cost–benefit analyses of interdependent <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> with computationally expensive flood risk calculations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{reliability}} analysis of sea <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> {{systems and the}} probabilistic approach of {{the design of the}} sea <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> are outlined.

40|$|Multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> are {{structures}} that primarily protect land from being covered by water and simultaneously serve other purposes. The present dissertation {{focuses on the}} combination of flood protection with functions that are fulfilled by means of buildings and objects, {{with a high degree}} of structural integration. This can typically be found in the urban context, where the combination of long-term flood protection and spatial quality is considered crucial for the viability of cities along rivers and seas. The design of multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> is more complicated than of plain <b>flood</b> <b>defences,</b> as two incompatible design cultures are involved: spatial design and hydraulic engineering. Moreover, the structural composition of multifunctional <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> is more complex and more diverse than of plain <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> Therefore, an overall, integrated, design method was developed that maintains the strengths of both existing approaches, but avoids their weaknesses. In addition, a method is proposed for the design phase of verifying the flood protection function. The methods were validated by design teams of students and by additional case studies.

40|$|The WTI 2017 {{project is}} {{responsible}} for the development of <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assessment tools for the 3600 km of Dutch primary <b>flood</b> <b>defences,</b> dikes/levees, dunes and hydraulic structures. These tools are necessary, as per January 1 st 2017, the new flood risk management policy for the Netherlands will be implemented. Then, the seven decades old design practice (maximum water level methodology of 1958) and two decades old safety standards (and maximum hydraulic load methodology of 1996) will formally be replaced by a more risked based approach for the national policy in flood risk management. The formal <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assessment {{is an important part of}} this new policy, especially for <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> managers, since national and regional funding for reinforcement is based on this assessment. This new <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> policy is based on a maximum allowable probability of flooding. For this, a maximum acceptable individual risk was determined at 1 / 100 000 per year, this is the probability of life loss of for every protected area in the Netherlands. Safety standards of <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> were then determined based on this acceptable individual risk. The results were adjusted based on information from cost -benefit analysis, societal risk and large scale societal disruption due to the failure of critical infrastructure e. g. power stations. The resulting riskbased <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> safety standards range from a 300 to a 100 000 year return period for failure. Two policy studies, WV 21 (Safety from floods in the 21 st century) and VNK- 2 (the National Flood Risk in 2010) provided the essential information to determine the new risk based safety standards for <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> The WTI 2017 project will provide the safety assessment tools based on these new standards and is thus an essential element for the implementation of this policy change. A major issue to be tackled was the development of user-friendly tools, as the new assessment is to be carried out by personnel of the institutions managing <b>flood</b> the <b>defences,</b> and not by just a small number of experts in probabilistic assessment. Therefore, data management and use of software are main issues that have been covered in courses and training in 2016 and 2017. All in all, this is the largest change in the assessment of Dutch <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> since 1996. In 1996 probabilistic techniques were first introduced to determine hydraulic boundary conditions (water levels and waves (wave height, wave period and direction for different return periods). To simplify the process, the assessment continues to consist of a three-step approach, moving from simple decision rules, to the methods for semi-probabilistic assessment, and finally to a fully probabilistic analysis to compare the strength of <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> with the hydraulic loads. The formal assessment results are thus mainly based on the fully probabilistic analysis and the ultimate limit state of the strength of a <b>flood</b> <b>defence.</b> For complex <b>flood</b> <b>defences,</b> additional models and software were developed. The current Hydra software suite (for policy analysis, formal <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> assessment and design) will be replaced by the model Ringtoets. New stand-alone software has been developed for revetments, geotechnical analysis and slope stability of the foreshore. Design software and policy analysis software, including the Delta model, will be updated in 2018. A fully probabilistic method results in more precise assessments and more transparency in the process of assessment and reconstruction of <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> This is of increasing importance, as large-scale infrastructural projects in a highly urbanized environment are increasingly subject to political and societal pressure to add additional features. For this reason, it is of increasing importance to be able to determine which new feature really adds to flood protection, to quantify how much its adds to the level of flood protection and to evaluate if it is really worthwhile.

40|$|During flood events {{emergency}} measures {{are used to}} prevent breaches in <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> However, there is still limited insight in their reliability and effectiveness. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a method to determine the reliability and effectiveness of {{emergency measures}} for <b>flood</b> <b>defences.</b> The investigation is focused on measures that prevent breaching of a <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> in a river system; measures to limit and/or close breaches are beyond the scope. To determine the failure probability of <b>flood</b> <b>defences</b> with emergency measures two assessments are made: 1) the reliability of implantation of emergency measures is determined and 2) the effect of the implemented emergency measures on the reliability of the <b>flood</b> <b>defence.</b> For an emergency measure to function correctly three phases need to be passed successfully: ‘Detection’, where weak spots in the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> are detected, ‘Placement’, where emergency measures are built on time, and 'Construction’, which is the successful functioning of the emergency measures. The reliability of ‘Detection’ and ‘Placement’ depends on human and organizational reliability and the feasibility of complete placement of the measures within the available time. The reliability of the ‘Construction’ concerns the structural performance of the emergency measure. For a case study along a part of a river in the Netherlands a failure probability of emergency measures for the piping failure mechanism is estimated to be 1 / 3 per event. The human / organizational reliability during ‘Detection’ and ‘Placement’ proved to be dominant. When translated to dike ring level the failure probability is reduced with about a factor 2. This is largely explained by the length effect: with increasing amounts of weak spots in a <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> the contribution of emergency measures will decrease.

40|$|The <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> in the {{historical}} town centre of Dordrecht is situated in the Voorstraat, which is a busy shopping street. The dike itself is too low at some places, but with a system of flood stop logs in the doors of buildings along the street some extra height can be reached. The reliability of the stop log system is doubted however, so plans for strengthening the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> are needed. One important issue for strengthening the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> is the climate change. Warming of the earth would lead to sea level rise and higher river discharges. The rate of climate change is unsure however and various scenarios have been made which range from minor to major changes. The water level at Dordrecht is determined by both the sea level and river discharges, so climate change could have severe consequences for the safety against flooding of Dordrecht. When {{the advice of the}} Delta Committee is followed, the safety standards of the dike rings should be heightened and much higher water levels have to be expected. Also the plans for the Rijnmond-Drechtsteden area are important for the strategy of strengthening the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> in the town centre of Dordrecht. A system of barriers in this area could protect Dordrecht against flooding, but {{it is also possible that}} strengthening the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> in the town centre of Dordrecht is still needed. Strengthening the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> in the Voorstraat is difficult. Therefore also a new <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> through the part of the town centre which now lies outside the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> is considered. Various alignments are possible, of which a <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> along the river, which protects the entire town centre against flooding has been elaborated. This new <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> will consist of an automatically floating barrier in the quays. Under normal circumstances this barrier is invisible and when the water level rises the barrier automatically floats up. At one part of the alignment buildings stand with the facades directly along the river. Here a boulevard through the river will be made, separated from the buildings. By integrating the floating barrier in the structure the boulevard can be kept low. Inside the <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> there is place for a marina and a swimming area. At five places in the alignment a harbour has to be crossed. For this purpose at four places a flood gate will be made, which under normal circumstances lies at the bottom, so it is not visible and ships can pass. When a flood is expected the gates are closed. At one place, at the largest harbour crossing, a multi-functional barrier will be made. This barrier consists of two gates which stand horizontally when retaining a flood. After the flood the gates are lifted and rotated to form a bridge and viewing platform over the harbour. Because of the floating barrier the largest part of the new <b>flood</b> <b>defence</b> will not be visible under normal circumstances, so it will have little impact on {{the historical}} town centre. Therefore it is a good and sustainable solution for protecting the entire town centre of Dordrecht against flooding for a long time. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
