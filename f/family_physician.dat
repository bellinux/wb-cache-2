40|$|PURPOSE Obstetric {{practice}} among <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> {{has declined}} in recent years. This study compared the practice patterns of <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> and obste-trician-gynecologists {{with and without}} obstetric practices to provide objective information on one potential reason for this decline—the impact of obstetrics on physician lifestyle. METHODS In 2004, we surveyed all obstetrician-gynecologists, all rural fam-ily physicians, and {{a random sample of}} urban <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> identifi ed from professional association lists (N = 2, 564) about demographics, practice character-istics, and obstetric practices. RESULTS A total of 1, 197 physicians (46. 7 %) overall responded to the survey (41. 5 % of urban <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> 54. 7 % of rural <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> and 55. 0 % of obstetrician-gynecologists). After exclusions, 991 were included in the fi nal data set. Twenty-seven percent of urban <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> 46 % of rural <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> and 79 % of obstetrician-gynecologists practiced obstetrics. The mean number of total professional hours worked per week was greater with obstetric practice than without for rural <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> (55. 4 vs 50. 2, P =. 005) and for obstetrician-gynecologists (58. 3 vs 43. 5, P =. 000), but not for urban <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> (47. 8 vs 49. 5, P =. 27). For all 3 groups, physicians practicing obstet-rics were more likely to provide inpatient care and take call than physicians not practicing obstetrics. Large proportions of <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> but not obstetrician-gynecologists, took their own call for obstetrics. Concerns about the litigation environment and personal issues were the most frequent reasons for stopping obstetric practice. CONCLUSIONS Practicing obstetrics is associated with an increased workload for <b>family</b> <b>physicians.</b> Organizing practices to decrease the impact on lifestyle may support <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> in practicing obstetrics.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{obstetric care}} {{provided}} by <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> {{and to determine}} why they transfer patients to obstetricians. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Obstetrics department of a regional non-academic community hospital PATIENTS: Of 683 women booked with <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> for obstetrical care, 601 were admitted by <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> and 82 were transferred to obstetricians before admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk score, induction, augmentation, consultation, forceps delivery, cesarean section, episiotomy, epidural anaesthesia, narcotic analgesia, neonatal birth weight and Apgar scores, and maternal complications. RESULTS: Family physicians' patients had good maternal and neonatal outcomes; spontaneous delivery rate was 82 %; cesarean section rate was 9 %. Women transferred from <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> to obstetricians before admission for delivery had a cesarean section rate of 63 %. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Family</b> <b>physicians</b> provided total obstetric care to most women in this community and transferred patients to obstetricians for expected reasons. Community hospitals with <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> highly involved in providing obstetric care are likely ideal institutions for training future <b>family</b> <b>physicians...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Since 2005, Kenyan medical {{universities}} have been training general practitioners, {{providing them with}} clinical, management, teaching and research skills, {{in order to enhance}} access to and quality of health care services for the Kenyan population. This study assesses what expectations <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> colleagues of <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> and policy makers have of family medicine, what expectations <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> live up to and which challenges they face. Methods <b>Family</b> <b>physicians</b> were observed and interviewed about their expectations and challenges concerning family medicine. Expectations among their colleagues were assessed through focus group discussions. Policy makers’ expectations were assessed by analysing the governmental policy on family medicine and a university’s curriculum. Results Roles perceived for and performed by <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> included providing comprehensive care, health care management, teaching, {{and to a lesser extent}} community outreach and performing research. Challenges faced by <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> were being posted in situations where they are regarded as just another type of specialist, lack of awareness of the roles of <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> among colleagues, lack of time, lack of funds and inadequate training. Conclusions The ministry’s posting policy has to be improved to ensure that <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> have a chance to perform their intended roles. Creating an environment in which <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> can function best requires more effort to enlighten other players in the health care system, like colleagues and policy makers, about the roles of <b>family</b> <b>physicians.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{comprehensively}} characterise the current use of electronic health records (EHRs) and personal digital assistants (PDAs) among <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> in Florida; and to compare <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> with other doctors with respect to the functions commonly used on their EHR and PDA systems. Methods A postal survey was sent to <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> (n= 2076) and other doctors with a clear and active licence in Florida (total n= 14 921). To examine factors among <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> related to EHR and PDA use, binary logistic regression modelling techniques were utilised. Chi-square analysis was used to compare EHR and PDA functions between <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> and other doctors. Results A total of 4203 responses, of which 756 were from <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> were available for the current study (28. 2 % overall response rate). EHR use among <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> was significantly related to large practice size, urban location and young physician age, after controlling for confounders. Likewise, PDA usage among <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> was independently associated with male gender and younger physician age. Additionally, even though no differences in overall EHR adoption were found, <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> when compared with other physicians, were significantly more likely to be using a more robust set of EHR functions. This included allergy and medication lists, diagnosis, problem lists, patient scheduling and educational materials, preventive services reminders and access to reference material. Conclusions Even though <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> utilise many EHR and PDA functions more commonly than other physician groups, the overall level of EHR adoption among <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> remains low. Until more barriers to the use of EHR are minimised, the goals of the Future of Family Medicine Report to broadly implement EHR and other health IT functions will not be fully realised...|$|R

The response rate was 70 %. Most general internists and <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> used online journals sometimes or often. Most general internists and <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> reported moderate to high interest in having links from original articles, reviews, or editorials to listed references (77 % to 89 % of internists and 65 % to 81 % of <b>family</b> <b>physicians)</b> and electronic medical reference texts (73 % to 78 % of internists and 65 % to 83 % of <b>family</b> <b>physicians).</b> Less than 25 % of both groups reported moderate to high interest in having links to initiate dialog with other readers or to communicate comments to the author or editor.

40|$|Background: Integrated team-based {{primary care}} is an {{international}} imperative. This is required more so in Africa, where fragmented verticalised care dominates. South Africa is trying to address this with health reforms, including Primary Health Care Re-engineering. <b>Family</b> <b>physicians</b> are already contributing to primary care despite family medicine being only fully registered as a full specialty in South Africa in 2008. However the views of leaders on family medicine {{and the role of}} <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> is not clear, especially with recent health reforms. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the views of key government and academic leaders in South Africa on family medicine, roles of <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> and human resource issues. Methods: This was a qualitative study with academic and government leaders across South Africa. In-depth interviews were conducted with sixteen purposively selected leaders using an interview guide. Thematic content analysis was based on the framework method. Results: Whilst <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> were seen as critical to the district health system there was ambivalence on their leadership role and ‘specialist’ status. National health reforms were creating both threats and opportunities for family medicine. Three key roles for <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> emerged: supporting referrals; clinical governance/quality improvement; and providing support to community-oriented care. Respondents’ urged <b>family</b> <b>physicians</b> to consolidate the development and training of <b>family</b> <b>physicians,</b> and shape human resource policy to include <b>family</b> <b>physicians.</b> Conclusions: <b>Family</b> <b>physicians</b> were seen as critical to the district health system in South Africa despite difficulties around their precise role. Whilst their role was dominated by filling gaps at district hospitals to reduce referrals it extended to clinical governance and developing community-oriented primary care - a tall order, requiring strong teamwork.
