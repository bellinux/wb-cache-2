40|$|Abstract 1 — Broadband Wireless Access {{technologies}} {{are expected to}} {{play a central role}} in next generation networks. WiMAX, based on the IEEE 802. 16 standard, has the potential to form the foundation upon which operators will deliver ubiquitous Internet access in the near future. It is also widely anticipated that the next generation wireless networks will handle an exponentially growth of audio/visual content. In order to evaluate the QoS performance over WiMAX, it is important to test the WiMAX system with real time services, such as VoIP and video streaming. This paper presents an evaluation of the WiMAX QoS performance using these services. I.

Our approach is based on a level set method which treats the front as a mathematical discontinuity and allows full coupling between the front geometry and the flow field (Smiljanovski et al. 1997). Two different implementations are described and their physically correct behaviour for simple testcases is shown. Early results of the method applied to the concrete problem of Type Ia supernovae are published separately (Reinecke et al. 1998).

40|$|Aspectual {{classification}} of verbs and clauses {{is necessary for}} interpreting temporal modifiers and determining temporal relations, and is therefore, required for natural language applications that entail the ability to reasonabout time (Siegel and McKeown 2001). For example, the ability to distinguish stative from event clauses is of fundamental importance to applications that involve natural language understanding, while knowledge of lexical aspect is essential for appropriate tense and lexical selections in applications that involve natural language generation, such as machine translation systems. There exist annotated corpora where verbs are marked with their aspect, mostly based on their morphological information (e. g. MULTEXT-East (Erjavec 2004)). However, corpora that are annotated with more fine-grained event information are much more rarely available. One of the fundamental questions, both in theoretical and corpus linguistics, {{is what kind of}} aspectual information is crucial for linguistic analysis and for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.

Using a unique Canadian data set on domestic violence, we estimate the effects of abuse on the marital history as well as current employment using a sequential, multi-state model. In our model, spousal abuse affects labor supply through decreases in utility from leisure as well as through reductions in productivity at work and hence the market wage. In addition, abuse is treated as an initially unobserved spousal characteristic that plays a role in the divorce decision, which in turn influences labor supply. Our analysis reveals three main findings. First, the effects of domestic abuse on employment differ across marital histories. Employment is decreasing in the presence of abuse in current and past marriages for married and divorced women, respectively, consistent with a health effect on the wage.

The hydrodynamic shear modes of the interstellar turbulence, which start out with zero frequency, become Alfven-like elastic waves with frequency kvA, where vA is an effective Alfven speed calculated from the small scale magnetic energy. As the small scale field grows, the linear elastic restoring force acting on the turbulent velocity modes eventually dominates over nonlinear mode coupling, first at small scales but eventually at even the largest turbulent scales, and the interstellar motions make a transition from strong turbulence to weak turbulence.

40|$|When {{events of}} mass {{violence}} {{came to the}} attention of mental health professionals in Western countries in the latter half of the 20 th century, their responses largely reflected that era’s dominant psychiatric paradigms. The primary focus was on the individual psychopathology of traumatic stress. Diagnosing and clinically treating what was eventually named Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was a professional and scientific milestone that led to the relief of suffering for scores of persons and redefined clinical approaches to trauma survivors globally. However, as the traumatic stress theory paradigm was applied to new catastrophe, its limitations in situations of mass traumatisation became more evident to more observers. It could not explain social and cultural phenomena, nor why some never became ill or suffered only transient distress. Trauma work organised around PTSD could also not explain how to deliver helpful services to families and communities or to those individuals that did not seek or accept treatment.

Geographic Information System (GIS) capabilities and data layers provide essential support for efficient, timely, and proactive NEPA evaluations and other Regional responsibilities.

40|$|Abstract: Bonded copper {{interconnects}} were stressed {{with current}} {{to measure the}} specific contact resistance. For bonded copper interconnects without a pre-bonding HCl clean, the corresponding specific contact resistance did not change while increasing the stress current. However, for some interconnects with the pre-bonding HCl clean, an abnormal contact resistance reduction was observed during the increase of the stress current. The rise of temperature at the bonding interface area due to Joule heating under high current density may have caused the decrease of contact resistance. This behavior may be one option for quality enhancement in 3 -D integration at low temperature. 1 The quality of bonded Cu interconnects is crucial to achieve optimum circuit performance while three-dimensional integration (3 -D) using copper interconnect bonding is an attractive candidate for future IC technologies 1 - 4. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> low bonding temperature is an important goal {{in order to meet}} the requirements of various device applications.
