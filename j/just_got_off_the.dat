On the rooftop, Wilhelmina takes out her aggression by beheading mannequins, this time with real thunder.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{embarked}} on this tour after finishing the mixing sessions for its debut album Ten in England. The short {{tour of the}} United States focused on the East Coast. This was the band's only tour with drummer Matt Chamberlain. Chamberlain left the band following this tour and the filming of the [...] "Alive" [...] video on August 3, 1991 in Seattle, Washington at RKCNDY to join the Saturday Night Live band. For his replacement, Chamberlain suggested drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the Ten album. Chamberlain said, [...] "I toured in the van with them, played a bunch of clubs—I had a good time, definitely had a good time. They wanted me to join the band, but Edie Brickell & New Bohemians had just broke up, I had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road after touring for four years straight—I could not imagine doing it again." ...|$|E

50|$|He's a human being; {{we should}} treat {{him the same}} as we treat any other G.I. In my opinion, I think the boy deserves it; he <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> on <b>the</b> wrong track. And I {{know for a fact}} when he went to Korea, he didn't know whether he was going to come back or he was going to stay there. So, maybe he got a little scared when he was captured. Maybe he was pressured, tortured. I don't think it's the boy's own fault. No doubt at the time—I never seen him or never met him—no doubt he was young and he wasn't trained properly.|$|R
5000|$|When John's Children collapsed, {{among other}} problems, the band were stunned to {{discover}} their equipment {{had been stolen}} from a studio, according to a Bolan biographer. But Bolan, unperturbed, rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer Steve Peregrin Took and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: [...] "He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in Melody Maker to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, {{the day of the}} gig. At three o'clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage.... It was a disaster. He <b>just</b> <b>got</b> booed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> stage." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Hi Dave from Bleed the Dream here, After {{many years}} of ups and downs were calling it quits. It's been such a rollercoaster ride from the beginning, from sneaking onto The Warped Tour in 2003 and pissing off its founder Kevin Lyman so bad that he later signed us to his label [...] "Warcon Records". We have {{traveled}} the world many times and made so many cool friends along the way, {{we like to think}} of Bleed the Dream as more than just a band but a family, we have been touched so much by all the love and support you gave us and Scotts family when we lost him to cancer in 2005 and we in return have tried to give that back to you on and off stage. As the saying goes everything must come to an End but that doesn't mean we can't remember all the good times we have enjoyed together, I'll never forget the first time we played on the Kevin Says stage in 2003 when we had no merch no tent no nothing Ha Ha. Then 2 years later we're playing at the Taste of Chaos in front of 15,000 people (we almost shit our pants). Its because of you that {{we have been able to}} make our dreams come true and we could never thank you enough for that. But we think most of all what we will take away from this whole experience is how much it made us grow up and see the world in a better way, we watched our friend Scott Gottlieb go into the studio and record drums everyday sicker then we hope to never be, and that changed us forever! We miss our friend and that being said were gonna dedicate these last 2 shows to Scott and his family and all the friends and fans that are going through the same situation as we did. I truly believe Scott's still with us in spirit, So Scott we got a surprise for you!!! I <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> phone with Brandon Thomas and he's coming to Alaska to sing all the songs on [...] "Built by Blood & Awake" [...] like you would have wanted it… We feel so blessed to have met Tom he has been such a good compliment to Scott's drumming and a great drummer himself and an over all great person. Also I think it was great that Mark dropped everything to come join our band and sing on our last record [...] "Killer Inside"…I'm glad we will all be in Alaska as friends to the end playing songs with Brandon from Awake/Asleep and Built by Blood and songs from Killer Inside with Mark on vocals... But don't feel like your never gonna see us again, We're all musicians to the end, Tom and I are in a new band called [...] "A Permanent Holiday" [...] maybe Keith will join ya know he can't live without me Ha Ha. Scott's probably jamming with Kurt and Jimmy... Brandon's got a new band called Phantom Communique, Marks back in the fashion industry and doing a Solo record.." ...|$|E
40|$|Tracy {{hung up the}} phone, and twirled her pen nervously. She then paced up {{and down}} her office restlessly. She <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> phone with one of the salesmen. He was {{urgently}} pushing for her decision to whether or not to place any orders for an assortment of top designer eyewear. It was to be an assortment that was rather exclusive by the Malaysian eyewear retail industry standard. To compound to the urgency of her decision, it was not every day that salesmen carrying such top designer eyewear would travel all the way to small towns like Changlun to promote such products. It was only due to intense road-shows by the top brands, as part of their concerted large-scale promotion in Asia, that the salesmen were carrying such exclusive high-end brands. If Tracy were to postpone her decision and not place any orders, it could be a long wait for her before the next chance came by. That was why Tracy had to make up her mind overnight, though she had been mulling over it for the past week...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I <b>just</b> know I <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|R
5000|$|Steve {{has also}} been shown to {{occasionally}} struggle with both substance abuse and an addiction to power. In An Apocalypse to Remember, Steve claims to be hooked on [...] "hallucinogenic berries", which ultimately turn out to be poisonous. In a later episode, Steve develops an addiction to the energy drink Cougar Boost, at one point going as far as to defraud his friends with fake tickets in order to obtain money to procure more of the beverage. In the episode Virtual In-Stanity, Francine derides Stan for picking up a drug bunny as a last minute gift, in the process reminding Stan that they <b>just</b> barely <b>got</b> Steve <b>off</b> <b>the</b> heroin from Stan's previous last second gift. In both the pilot episode and You Debt Your Life, Steve demonstrates an addiction to power; in the former case by taking over the school after being turned down by a girl he was trying to impress, in the latter case due to his obsession with making the morning announcements and deciding what is worth broadcasting to the high school. Furthermore, as shown in the episode Jenny Fromdabloc, it is revealed that among his four friends Steve is considered to be the leader of the group going as far back as elementary school, prompting Roger to call Steve the [...] "King of the Nerds". In most cases when his role {{as the leader of the}} group is threatened Steve's drive to maintain this position of power results in erratic behavior such as humiliating his friends with personal or compromising information or threats of physical violence against himself or others. In nearly every case outside of his immediate circle of friends, Steve's position of power or authority ends up stripped or removed from him, or in rare cases, remains with him in a curtailed capacity, as was the case in I am the Walrus.|$|R
