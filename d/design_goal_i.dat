In this paper a further validation of the design procedure, based on TPMC, is provided by means of Incremental Dynamic Analyses (IDA) pointing out the fulfilment of the <b>design</b> <b>goal,</b> <b>i.</b> e. the development of a pattern of yielding consistent with the collapse mechanism of global type where all the links are yielded and all the beams are yielded at their ends while all the columns and the diagonal braces remain in elastic range with the only exception of the base sections of first storey columns. In particular, a study case is designed according to both TPMC and Eurocode 8 provisions and the corresponding seismic performances are investigated by both push-over and IDA analyses. The results show the different performances obtained in terms of pattern of yielding, maximum interstorey drift, link plastic rotation demand and sharing of the seismic base shear between the moment-resisting part and the bracing part of the structural system. The seismic performance improvement obtained by means of TPMC, compared to Eurocode 8 provisions, is pointed out...|$|E
40|$|Access to and {{subsequent}} control of spinal cord function are critical considerations for design of optimal therapeutic strategies for SCI patients. Electrical {{stimulation of the}} spinal cord is capable of activating behaviorally-relevant populations of neurons for recovery of function, and is therefore an attractive target for potential devices. A promising method for accessing these spinal circuits is through their axons, which are organized as longitudinal columns of white matter funiculi along the cord exterior. For this thesis, I hypothesized that these funiculi can be selectively recruited via electrodes appropriately placed {{on the surface of}} the spinal cord, for functional activation of relevant motor circuitry in a chronically-transected spinal cord. My tandem design goal was to fabricate and implement a conformable multi-electrode array (MEA) that would enable this selective stimulation. To accomplish this <b>design</b> <b>goal,</b> <b>I</b> participated in the design, fabrication, and electromechanical testing of a conformable MEA for surface stimulation of spinal tracts. I then assessed the fundamental capability of this MEA technology to stimulate white matter tracts in a precise, controlled, and functionally-relevant manner. This was accomplished via in vitro experiments that explored the ability of this MEA to locally activate axons via single- and dual-site surface stimulation. The results from these evaluation studies suggest that spinal-cord surface stimulation with this novel MEA technology can provide discrete, minimally-damaging activation of spinal systems via their white matter tracts. 	To test my hypothesis that surface stimulation can be used to recruit distinct populations in the spinal cord, I performed studies that stimulated lateral funiculi in both chronically-transected and intact in vitro spinal cords. Results from these studies reveal that selective surface stimulation of white matter tracts in the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) elicit motor outputs not elicited in intact cords. In addition, I was able to demonstrate that the spinal systems activated by this surface stimulation involve synaptic components and are responsive to spatial, temporal, and pharmacologic facilitation. Corresponding labeling of the axonal tracts projecting through the T 12 VLF indicate that, after chronic transection, the remaining spinal neurons whose axons travel through the VLF include those with cell bodies in both the intermediate region and dorsal horn. These electrophysiological results show that surface-stimulating technologies used to control motor function after injury should include focal activation of interneuronal systems with axons in the ventrolateral funiculus. As a whole, these studies provide essential starting points for further use of conformable MEAs to effectively activate and control spinal cord function from the surface of the spinal cord. Ph. D.

40|$|The hereby thesis {{has been}} {{developed}} within the Graduation Studio “Explore Lab”. Explore Lab is a Graduation Laboratory of the Faculty of Architecture, TU Delft. In this Lab I {{had the opportunity to}} follow my fascination on public spaces by doing research and producing a graduation projet out of it. The theme of the project involved the careful analysis of the urban context of Jersey City, NJ {{trying to figure out what}} are the strengths and weaknesses of the site by focusing the attention on public spaces. The main goal of the research was to collect informations and input for the design of the master plan which {{has been developed}} as a group work by merging four differents research on four differents aspects that led me to define the borders and special characteristics of my building site. Moreover, the results of the research have been largely useful to understand and best solve the complexity of an hybrid building that integrates at the same time private and public functions together. Despite the fact that the research outcome aimed to work as a guide line for the masterplan development, in its ensamble it also gave me the tools and the basics to approach the building design in the best way possible. The opportunity given by the Graduation Lab to have the freedom to choose and define the graduation theme has required, during this year of research and design, a constant reconsideration and reorganization of the framework which has led the final design to be unique in its kind. The input given by the location’s circumstances with its needs and its challenges have brought me to extend my knowledge about public spaces, the way they are used and the way they should be used. My design goal has been from start to try transalte my research of public spaces in urban scale inside the building scale. Their integration into a building design have been, finally, a sort of crown for the <b>design</b> <b>goal</b> <b>I</b> was aiming at. Since the direction of the thesis was not given from the Graduation Lab Studio, the method chosen for the thesis research was directly established by me. Firstly, since New Jersey region was chosen, a method to understand how to analyse and design city’s public spaces as people gatherer was researched; by looking at works done by Gehl, and examples in the metropolitan area of New York, Newark and New Jersey done by Mumford, Jacobs, Johnson, Whyte, Smith ecc I had the opportunuty to collect nformations that led me to understand what were the problematics of the area and what were the possible solutions. In a second phase the privately owned public spaces issue came back, as a top layer, introducing a second methodology to analyse the city from a POPS point of view. The deriving methodology used in the research process was fundamental for my thesis design. The elaboration of a method for a new analysis of the city aiming at tackling all kinds of the public spaces issue gave me the opportunity to gain a fixed, generalizable procedure, which finds its conclusions in giving very precise guidelines for the design phase.

Design space exploration {{as an alternative to}} the quantitative approach can be employed to find a right balance between the different design parameters. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced to analytically explore the design space for a coarse grain accelerator and determine a wise design point exploiting data extracted from applications, quantitatively. It also provides flexibility for taking into account new design constraints as well as new characteristics of applications. Furthermore, this approach is a methodological approach which reduces the design time and results in a point which satisfies the <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{calculate}} the critical load of variable inertia columns. The example studied in this paper can be used as a paradigm for other non-uniform columns. The wavelength of equivalent vibratory system is used to calculate the critical load of the trigonometrically varied inertia column. In doing so, the equilibrium equation of the column is theoretically studied using the perturbation method. Accuracy of the calculated results is evaluated by comparing the solution with numerical results. Effect of improving the initial guess on the solution accuracy is investigated. Effects of varying parameters of the trigonometrically varied inertia and the uniformly tapered columns on their stability behavior are studied. Finally, using the so-called “perfectibility” parameter, two <b>design</b> <b>goals,</b> <b>i.</b> e., being lightweight and being strong, are studied for the discussed columns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{connected}} dominating set (CDS) {{has been}} extensively used for routing and broadcast in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Due {{to the nature of}} MANETs, it is preferred that the CDS protocol not only creates a CDS with small size, but also incurs less communication and computational overhead, adapts to the nodal mobility, and generates CDS as quickly as possible. While the CDS protocols developed in the past create small size of CDS, they tend to incur too much communication overhead. In this paper, we propose the Message-Efficient Dominator Tree Connection algorithm (ME-DTC), which significantly reduces the number of control messages during the tree connection phase in Tree-based CDS protocols. By incorporating this algorithm with the Multi-Initiator CDS protocol, we have a CDS protocol which meets all the desirable features in MANETs. The simulation as well as analytical results validate that our proposed algorithm achieves its <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

The suits were also heat-resistant so that SR-71 pilots could survive the high temperatures generated from a Mach 3 ejection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Data centers often hold tens to {{hundreds}} of thousands of servers in order to offer cloud computing services at scale. Ethernet switching and IP routing have their own advantages and limitations in building data center networks. Recent research, such as PortLand and BCube, has proposed scalable data center network designs. A common feature of these designs is that their addressing and routing are customized to specific topologies. In this paper, we propose a generic addressing, routing and forwarding protocol for data center networks, which works on arbitrarily “layered ” network topologies. We first form the network as a multi-rooted tree. Each network node (i. e., hosts and switches) is then assigned one or more locators, and each locator encodes a downward path from the roots to this node. Data center networks often have rich path diversity, so tracking all locators of a destination node will cause switches to have very large forwarding tables. We further use a new forward-ing model to reduce the forwarding states. In addition, the multiple-locator mechanism brings built-in support for multi-path routing, load balancing and fault tolerance. Evaluations based on simulations and prototype experiments demonstrate that our proposal achieves our <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Body Area Networks (BAN) {{is a key}} {{enabling}} technology in E-healthcare such as remote health monitoring. An important security issue during bootstrap phase of the BAN is to securely associate a group of sensor nodes to a patient, and generate necessary secret keys to protect the subsequent wireless communications. Due to the the ad hoc nature of the BAN and the extreme resource constraints of sensor devices, providing secure, fast, efficient and user-friendly secure sensor association is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a lightweight scheme for secure sensor association and key management in BAN. A group of sensor nodes, having no prior shared secrets before they meet, establish initial trust through group device pairing (GDP), which is an authenticated group key agreement protocol where the legitimacy of each member node can be visually verified by a human. Various kinds of secret keys can be generated on demand after deployment. The GDP supports batch deployment of sensor nodes to save setup time, does not rely on any additional hardware devices, and is mostly based on symmetric key cryptography, while allowing batch node addition and revocation. We implemented GDP on a sensor network testbed and evaluated its performance. Experimental results show that that GDP indeed achieves the expected <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

Examples include town hall meetings, occurring during specific times and in specific places, and online forums, where deliberation occurs within profile-based websites for which you need to sign up and to regularly return. This thesis responds to the design challenge and research question: How do you address barriers to minimum effective engagement in community projects, and ensure that all citizens can contribute their input {{on how to improve}} their local communities? In order to raise levels of participation in community projects and expand the range of voices heard in governmental decision-making, {{there is a need for}} a civic engagement platform that is lightweight and compelling enough to enjoy continued use. To this end, I have developed a theoretical basis for effective citizenship through monitorial actions aided by mobile computing, finding connections between various theories of citizenship and learning to fill a gap in the literature and in terms of civic technology design. My argument and <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> for such a system are reinforced by findings from a needs assessment of Boston-area municipalities that confirmed a desire to use new technologies to elicit feedback on community issues from a more diverse demographic than those who currently attend public meetings. Based my analysis of the literature and the distilled <b>design</b> <b>goals,</b> <b>I</b> built and completed early-stage user testing of a prototype smartphone app-based civic engagement platform called Action Path, which uses location-awareness in the form of geo-fences along with push notifications to prompt users to respond to one-item surveys dotting their urban landscape. Interviews with users suggest Action Path might help people see their communities as filled with opportunities for civic intervention, and might increase their sense of efficacy. Additionally, workshops about geo-fence design and curricular design with potential stakeholders showed how Action Path might be effectively deployed through civic technologists and in schools. by Erhardt Graeff.
