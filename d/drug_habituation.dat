A team of specialist from the World Health Organization (WHO) assembled in 1957 {{to address the problem}} of drug addiction and adopted the term [...] "drug habituation" [...] to distinguish some drug-use behaviors from drug addiction. According to the WHO lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, habituation is defined as [...] "becoming accustomed to any behavior or condition, including psychoactive substance use". By 1964 the America Surgeon's General report on smoking and health included four features that characterize <b>drug</b> <b>habituation</b> according to WHO: 1) [...] "a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders"; 2) [...] "little or no tendency to increase the dose"; 3) [...] "some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome"; 4)"detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual". However, also in 1964, a committee from the World Health Organization once again convened and decided the definitions of <b>drug</b> <b>habituation</b> and drug addiction were insufficient, replacing the two terms with [...] "drug dependence". Substance dependence is the preferred term today when describing drug-related disorders, whereas the use of the term <b>drug</b> <b>habituation</b> has declined substantially. This is not to be confused with true habituation to drugs, wherein repeated doses have an increasingly diminished effect, as is often seen in addicts or persons taking painkillers frequently.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>habituation</b> (habit) is a {{condition}} resulting from the repeated consumption of a drug. Its characteristics include (i) a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders; (ii) little or no tendency to increase the dose; (iii) some degree of psychic dependence {{on the effect of}} the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome withdrawal, and (iv) detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of addiction gained some acceptance, but {{confusion in the}} use of the terms addiction and habituation and misuse of the former continued. Further, the list of drugs abused increased in number and diversity. These difficulties have become increasingly apparent and various attempts have been made to find a term that could be applied to drug abuse generally. The component in common appears to be dependence, whether psychic or physical or both. Hence, use of the term drug dependence, with a modifying phase linking it to a particular drug type in order to differentiate one class of drugs from another, had been given most careful consideration. The Expert Committee recommends substitution of the term drug dependence for the terms drug addiction and <b>drug</b> <b>habituation.</b> [...] (emphasis added) ...|$|E
40|$|Electrophysiological {{analysis}} of the blink reflex {{makes it possible to}} quantitate the reflex changes observed in pathology. The authors therefore propose a `habituation index' to be determined by recording the electromyographic reflex response during stimulation at controlled frequencies. Several populations of subjects were tested. It was confirmed that marked differences in blink reflex habituation exist between normals and patients with Parkinson's disease. It was also found that when patients with Parkinsonism were treated with the classical anticholinergic <b>drugs</b> their <b>habituation</b> index remained virtually unchanged. However, treatment with either l-dopa or amantadine caused a rise in the index in almost all patients tested. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that these two new drugs have a highly similar mechanism of action...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} {{impossible}} in practice, and is scientifically unsound, {{to maintain a}} single definition for all forms of <b>drug</b> addiction and/or <b>habituation.</b> A feature common to these conditions {{as well as to}} drug abuse in general is dependence, psychic or physical or both, of the individual on a chemical agent. Therefore, better understanding should be attained by substitution of the term drug dependence of this or that type, according to the agent or class of agents involved, in discussions of these conditions, especially inter-disciplinary. Short descriptions, followed by concise listings of their characteristics, are formulated for the various types of dependence on at present widely abused major groups of substances...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} reasons for adverse drug reaction(ADR) is caused by drug abuse which {{is the main reason}} of <b>drug</b> dependence(addiction or <b>habituation).</b> <b>Drug</b> dependence will bring psychological and economical heavy burden to individuals and families. Hong Kong special administrative region have taken multiple methods to reduce drug abuse and get remarkable achievement in past years. Along with Chinese medicine validated in Hong Kong,the role and prospect of Chinese Medicine on prevent and cure drug abuse in Hong Kong will be an important topic and be discussed between experts in fields of Chinese medicine and drug abuse. It rarely occurs that Chinese medicine has drug dependence and some reports showed that Chinese medicines may have effect against drug dependence. How to exert Chinese medicine on prevent and cure of drug abuse in Hong Kong? What is its future? We believe that some work should be done in order to answer the questions: 1. To establish control system for ADR including drug abuse and ADR of combination of Chinese herbs and Western drugs. 2. To integrate Chinese medicine and Western medicine in treating drug abuse and drug dependence. For example,to evaluate drugs such as the effective Chinese herbs(such as Fu kang Tablet) of its effect in treating drug addiction;to exam the different syndrome and individual therapy of TCM in treating drug addiction;to provide preventing therapy according to TCM constitute classification after abstaining from drug addiction. 3. To study the mechanisms of the effective Chinese herbs in treating drug abuse...|$|R
40|$|Four {{patients}} who had ingested large amounts of phenacetin-salicylate medications were studied during a 12 -month period. Renal failure had progressed slowly {{over a number of}} years. All patients took the drug because of psychogenic headache. Considerable skill was required to elicit the history of <b>drug</b> <b>habituation.</b> The major features of the nephropathy were multiple episodes of metabolic acidosis, minimal proteinuria, pyuria but no bacteriuria, and polyuria and polydipsia early in the course of drug ingestion. Papillary necrosis was not a prominent clinical feature of this series. Discontinuation of drug ingestion by one patient was associated with recovery of a considerable degree of renal function. Preliminary experimental evidence obtained in the dog suggests that salicylate impaired the efficiency of the counter-current multiplier by decreasing sodium transport in the ascending limb of Henle, and decreased the permeability to water of the distal convoluted and collecting tubule; phenacetin had no such effect...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{autosomal}} dominant polycystic kidney disease, renoprotective treatment with a vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonist (V 2 RA) {{is given in}} a fixed dose (FD). Disease progression and <b>drug</b> <b>habituation</b> could diminish treatment efficacy. We investigated whether the renoprotective effect of the V 2 RA can be improved by dose titration of the V 2 RA aiming to maintain aquaresis {{at a high level}}. Methods: The V 2 RA OPC- 31260 was administered to Pkd 1 -deletion mice in an FD (0. 1 %) or in a titrated dose (TD, up to 0. 8 % when drinking volume dropped). Total kidney weight (TKW) and cyst ratio were investigated and compared to non-treated Pkd 1 -deletion mice. Treatment was started early or late (21 or 42 days postnatal). Results: Water intake was significantly higher throughout the experiment in the TD compared to the FD group. FD treatment that was initiated early reduced TKW and cyst ratio but lost its renoprotective effect later during the experiment. In contrast, TD treatment was able to maintain the renoprotective effect. TD treatment, however, was also associated with a higher early termination rate in comparison with FD treatment. Late start of treatment (FD or TD) did not show a renoprotective effect. Conclusions: Titration of a V 2 RA aimed to maintain aquaresis at a high level showed a better renoprotective effect compared to FD administration. However, this treatment regimen was poorly tolerated and did not overcome treatment unresponsiveness when started later in the disease. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{reinforcers}} phasically stimulate dopamine transmission in {{the nucleus}} accumbens shell. This property undergoes one-trial habituation {{consistent with a}} role of nucleus accumbens shell dopamine in associative learning. Experimental studies with place- and taste-conditioning paradigms confirm this role. Addictive drugs share with conventional reinforcers the property of stimulating dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell. This response, however, undergoes one-trial habituation {{in the case of}} conventional reinforcers but not of <b>drugs.</b> Resistance to <b>habituation</b> allows <b>drugs</b> to repetitively activate dopamine transmission in the shell upon repeated self-administration. This process abnormally facilitates associative learning, leading: to the attribution of excessive motivational value to discrete stimuli or contexts predictive of drug availability. Addiction Is therefore the expression of the excessive control over behavior acquired by drug-related stimuli as a result of abnormal strenghtening of stimulus-drug contingencies by nondecremental drug-induced stimulation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell...|$|R
