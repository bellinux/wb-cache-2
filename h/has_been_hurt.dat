5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt,</b> or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, Montevideo's prosperous {{middle classes}} {{have tended to}} abandon the {{formerly}} fashionable downtown areas for the more modern high-rise apartment buildings of Pocitos, a beachfront neighborhood east of the center. Still farther east lies the expensive area of Carrasco, a zone of modern luxury villas {{that has come to}} replace the old neighborhood of El Prado in the north of the city as home to the country's wealthy elite. Its beaches were less polluted than those closer to the center. Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport is located nearby, crossing the border to Canelones Department. The capital's principal artery, 18 July Avenue, was long the principal shopping street of Montevideo, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> since the mid-1980s by the construction of a modern shopping mall strategically located between Pocitos and Carrasco.|$|E
25|$|The {{market has}} also had famous seller, such as Ignacio Contreras, better known as “El Chacharitas,” who was noted among {{collectors}} as able to obtain all kinds of valuable objects at elevated prices. However, those {{who knew how to}} bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques was a very good business in the past but less so now. Much of the reason is the degradation of the neighborhood, and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard’s decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class residents will not use public transportation to get to this market.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} story, The Edge of Destruction, {{tensions between the}} TARDIS crew reach the point of overt conflict when he accuses them of trying to sabotage the TARDIS {{in an attempt to}} return to 1963. Barbara remains level-headed and logical, allowing the Doctor to trace the source of the distress to telepathic influences from the TARDIS (which is trying to warn them of a major failure). Seeing that Barbara <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by his accusations, the Doctor apologises and begins to realise he can rely on the two teachers, sealing a friendship which lasts until their eventual departure from the TARDIS. Although mutually respectful and increasingly affectionate, the relationship between the Doctor and Barbara is often tested by their opposing viewpoints. In The Aztecs, Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of a high priest, Yetaxa, after they find her in possession of his bracelet. Barbara seizes this opportunity to change the course of history, and tries to persuade the Aztecs to abandon human sacrifice, so that by the time Hernán Cortés - who overthrew the Aztec empire - lands he will find a glorious civilisation. The Doctor warns Barbara that she cannot rewrite history, but his protests fall on deaf ears. Barbara fails and, although she has influenced some Aztecs, history remains on course.|$|E

500|$|Narrative {{content was}} in the {{forefront}} of much of Lichtenstein's work as a means to engage the viewer. [...] Measuring 171.6cm × 169.5cm (67.625 in × 66.75 in), Drowning Girl presents [...] "a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river... literally drowning in emotion," [...] according to Janis Hendrickson. The melodrama makes it clear that she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by a [...] "Brad", the name given to several of Lichtenstein's heroes. [...] Vian Shamounki Borchert says that the caption makes it clear that the subject is practically [...] "drowning in a sea of tears".|$|E
500|$|In First Contact, the {{individually}} inscrutable and faceless Borg {{fulfill the}} role of the similarly unreadable whale in Melville's work. Picard, like Ahab, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by his nemesis, and author Elizabeth Hinds said it makes sense that Picard should [...] "opt for the perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight" [...] the Borg rather than take the only sensible option left, to destroy the ship. Several lines in the film refer to the 21st-century dwellers being primitive, with the people of the 24th century having evolved to a more utopian society. In the end it is Lily (the 21st-century woman) who shows Picard (the 24th-century man) that his quest for revenge is the primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use. Lily's words cause Picard to reconsider, and he quotes Ahab's words of vengeance, recognizing the death wish embedded therein.|$|E
500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another boyfriend, or <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves. Mohammad Raed, a Sunni Muslim, is the [...] at school, who prefers playing sports and fooling around with his friends to studying. Unaware of his behaviour at school, his mother believes he is hard-working, self-sufficient and mature, and believes he will graduate and go to university.|$|E

Though the documentary repeated many claims already made, King said he had now had enough. King's attorney said [...] "It was slanted to show Don in the worst way.

On May 29, in his ninth career start, he pitched his first shutout, giving up 5 hits against the St. Louis Cardinals. [...] He ended the season 11–10 with a 4.76 ERA. In 2003, Sheets was troubled by bulging discs in his lower back. [...] "My back <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> but you've {{got to go out}} there and perform," [...] he said. Over the final two months of the season, Sheets pitched poorly and finished the year 11–13 with a 4.45 ERA.|$|E
2500|$|Some initial partner countries, {{including}} the United Kingdom, and Norway, Netherlands {{as well as}} Thailand, Indonesia and Israel, have wavered in their public commitment to the JSF program, hinting that the design goals are overambitious or warning that unless they receive more subcontracts or technology transfer, they will forsake JSF for the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, Dassault Rafale or simply upgrade their existing aircraft. Furthermore, F-35 export competitiveness <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by international buyers finding either its export variant too costly per unit or [...] "watered down".

2500|$|But {{since high}} levels of {{pollution}} were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s, there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing. Commercial fishing in Lake Erie <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by the bad economy as well as government regulations which limit {{the size of their}} catch; one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two-thirds in recent decades. Another concern had been that pollution in the lake, as well as toxins found inside fish, were working against commercial fishing interests. U.S. fishermen based along Lake Erie [...] "lost their livelihood" [...] {{over the past few decades}} described as being [...] "caught in a net of laws and bans", according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and no longer catch fish such as whitefish for markets in New York. Pennsylvania had a special $3 stamp on fishing licenses to help [...] "compensate commercial fishermen for their losses", but this program ended after five years turning Erie's commercial fishing industry into an [...] "artifact." [...] One blamed the commercial fishing ban after a [...] "test of wills" [...] between commercial and recreational fishermen: [...] "One side needed large hauls. The other feared the lake was being emptied." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{strategic}} attempts {{to form an}} [...] "Asian NATO" [...] with India, Japan, the US and Australia. The bilateral agreements have worked out {{for all but the}} Indo-Australian angle, though this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> by India's refusal to sign the NPT and Australia's consequent refusal to provide India with uranium until the latter do so. However, Australia has now cleared uranium sales to India by Labour party decision in Australian parliament and by this development the relations between both the commonwealth nations are set to improve. The Australian and Indian militaries have already worked well together. Of late the {{relations between the two countries}} were jolted by sensationalised media reporting in Indian media about attacks on Indian Community students in Melbourne, Australia. Indian Government lodged strong protests with the Australian Government. Australian Prime Minister Mr. Kevin Rudd said that [...] "Australia valued its education system and International Students are valued more here in Australia." [...] Mr. Rudd though said that his Govt. has ordered a thorough probe into the attacks and also condemned it in strongest possible terms, and whilst no significant break-through was achieved immediately, during the last couple of years the attacks have been virtually eliminated by strong police enforcement and community involvement. Under the leadership of Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard the relations between both the nations have significantly improved on part due to her holistic approach in relations.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2014 at {{a meeting}} with Jewish {{settlers}} on the West Bank who questioned Israel's apparent delay in settler construction, Ya'alon said that settlement construction represented the greatest growth in Israel and with regard to any apparent slowdown, he declared, [...] "It's temporary. There is a certain administration now in the United States, which is leading this policy. This administration will not stay forever and I hope it's temporary." [...] He commented {{that it is important}} for Israel not to antagonize the U.S. at the moment, because [...] American support is needed in countering diplomatic undertakings at the U.N. that he claimed were [...] "anti-Israel." [...] "The publication of construction plans, even in Jerusalem, draws a response from various bodies, including our friends, that attack us," [...] he said. But he noted that he very much wanted to approve construction plans. Ya'alon's remarks about not antagonizing the U.S. came at a time when an opinion poll showed that the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of Israelis believe their country's relationship with the U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hurt</b> {{as a result of the}} poor relationship between Obama and Netanyahu. In response to the Ya'alon's remarks, which were broadcast of Israeli Army Radio, a spokesperson for Ya'alon claimed, [...] "this does not diminish in any way the appreciation and esteem Minister Ya'alon has for the contribution of the U.S. and its government to the security of Israel and the fact that the U.S. is Israel's best friend and strategic anchor." [...] Responding to the latest of Ya'alon negative comments about the Obama administration, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, [...] "This administration’s opposition to settlements is fully consistent with the policies of administrations for decades, including of both parties. So the notion that that would change is not borne out by history." ...|$|E
