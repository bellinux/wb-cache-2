In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization. In 1952, John D. Rockefeller III founded the influential Population Council. Fear of global overpopulation became {{a major issue in}} the 1960s, generating concerns about pollution, food shortages, and quality of life, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women addressed birth control and influenced human rights declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.See also: Petchesky, Rosalind Pollack (2001), [...] "Reproductive Politics", in The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World, Joël Krieger, Margaret E.

40|$|International audienceWe {{define a}} method to {{modularize}} crosscutting concerns in the Behavior Interaction Priority (BIP) component-based framework. Our method is inspired from the Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm which was initially conceived to support the separation of concerns during the development of monolithic systems. BIP has a formal operational semantics and makes a clear separation between architecture and behavior to allow for compositional and incremental design and analysis of systems. We thus distinguish local from <b>global</b> <b>aspects.</b> Local aspects model concerns at the component level and are used to refine the behavior of components. <b>Global</b> <b>aspects</b> model concerns at the architecture level, and hence refine communications (synchronization and data transfer) between components. We formalize <b>global</b> <b>aspects</b> {{as well as their}} integration into a BIP system through rigorous transformation primitives and overview local aspects. We present AOP-BIP, a tool for Aspect-Oriented Programming of BIP systems, and demonstrate its use to modularize logging, security, and fault-tolerance in a network protocol...|$|R

5000|$|Images {{and other}} stimuli contain both local {{features}} (details, parts) and global features (the whole). Precedence {{refers to the}} level of processing (global or local) to which attention is first directed. Global precedence occurs when an individual more readily identifies the global feature when presented with a stimulus containing both global and local features. [...] The <b>global</b> <b>aspect</b> of an object embodies the larger, overall image as a whole, whereas the local aspect consists of the individual features that make up this larger whole. Global processing is the act of processing a visual stimulus holistically. Although global precedence is generally more prevalent than local precedence, local preference also occurs under certain circumstances and for certain individuals. [...] Global precedence is closely related to the Gestalt principles of grouping in that the global whole is a grouping of proximal and similar objects. Within global precedence, there is also the global interference effect, which occurs when an individual is directed to identify the local characteristic, and the global characteristic subsequently interferes by slowing the reaction time.|$|E
