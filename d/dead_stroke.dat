Of all that came after I remember {{no more than a}} flight through air, and the <b>dead</b> <b>stroke</b> of a fall on earth with a stone above me. For such is the fortune of war, whereof a man knows but his own share for the most part, and even that dimly. The eyes are often blinded with swift running to be at the wall, and, what with a helm that rings to sword-blows, and what with smoke, and dust, and crying, and clamour, and roar of guns, it is but little that many a man-at-arms can tell concerning the frays wherein, may be, he has borne himself not unmanly.|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{thrombolysis}} with intravenous recombinant {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (rt-PA) within a 3 -hour time window after stroke onset is the treatment of choice for acute ischemic stroke. Most studies and registries using rt-PA for stroke treatment focus on reporting clinical outcome and its determants after three months. Although rt-PA is administered in the first hours after stroke onset, the clinical benefit was shown only after three months. Little is known whether the treatment benefit is sustained over a longer time period and information about very long-term outcome and its determinants in patients treated with systemic thrombolysis is scarce. The goal of our {{study was to investigate}} the clinical outcome during an extended follow-up period and to assess the long-term risk of death, cerebrovascular and other vascular events in stroke patients treated with intravenous rt-PA. In addition we sought to identify predictors for the long-term outcome in these patients. A total 152 Patients were treated following the protocol. Two patients were later found to be stroke mimics and were excluded from the analysis. One of them had Todd´s paralysis after an epileptic seizure, the other patient was diagnosed to have recurrent hemiplegic migraine. Median age at admission of the remaining 150 patients was 69 years (range 34 - 90 years). Median-NIHSS score at admission was 13. 37 (range 4 - 34). At long-term-follow-up 34 % haf an excellent funcional outcome (Rankin 0 - 1), 26 % of all patients were <b>dead.</b> <b>Stroke</b> recurrence was 11. 3 %, the frequency of symptomatic epilepsy was 9 %. Although a controll group is missing and due to ethical grounds not possible it seems that our patients have a better outcome compared to similiar published cohorts not treated with systemic thrombolysis and this benefit seems to persist. Also mortality seems to be lower while stroke recurrence is similiar. Optimizing stroke prevention seems mandatory. In conclusion the favourable benefit from treatment with systemic thrombolysis after 3 months is sustained at longer follow-up...|$|E
2500|$|Mallet {{dampening}} includes [...] "dead strokes" [...] where {{a player}} strikes a bar, and then instead of drawing the mallet back, directly presses {{the head of}} the mallet onto the bar, causing the ringing to immediately stop. This produces a fairly distinctive [...] "choked" [...] sound and <b>dead</b> <b>strokes</b> are often used just for that particular sound in addition to the dampening aspects.|$|R
40|$|Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra is a twenty-two minute work {{cast in a}} {{traditional}} three movement concerto form. The basic harmonic/melodic materials are hexads and complementary hexads built on intervallic projections as propounded in Howard Hanson's Harmonic Materials of Modern Music. The opening movement is in double exposition form with a cadenza before the recapitulation. Marimba techniques used in the opening movement include chromatic thirty-second notes, mirrored octaves and single hand alternate sticking patterns. The form of the second movement is a rondo song form: a- b- a (inversion) - b (inversion) - c- c (retrograde) - b (retrograde-inversion) - a. The marimba plays rolled chords {{throughout much of the}} movement. The form of the third movement is a fast sonata-rondo form: a - b - a - development - b - a - coda. The development section of this final movement develops materials from both of the preceding movements and thus creates a cyclic form for the work. Marimba techniques explored in the third movement include <b>dead</b> <b>strokes,</b> octave <b>dead</b> <b>strokes</b> alternating with rolled octaves and, thirty-second note hexad patterns in fast alternation with the orchestra. This movement also contains sections in which the xylophone plays in duet with the marimba. Some of the compositional techniques used in the Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra include rhythmic modulation, augmentation, diminution, ostinato, inversion, retrograde, mirroring, odd meters, fragmentation, parallel motion, contrary motion, African rhythmic structure, harmonization with complementary sets and register sweeps...|$|R

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 format, 65 : 32 in length. Elliot Carter, Eight pieces for Four Timpani, Saeta: Associated Music Publishers, 1968. This piece uses a technique of dampening which involves striking the drum {{in the center}} of the head thereby creating a sound which has no distinct pitch. The stopped notes, or <b>dead</b> <b>strokes,</b> provide a counterpoint to the melody which is played near the edge of the two inner drums. Communicating the phrases in a musical manner involves a transition from a tight grip on the mallet to a loose grip while moving from the center of one drum to the edge of the other. The use of metric modulations, in which a rhythmic figure in one meter eventually becomes the tempo of a new meter, is an integral part of this work. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{tracking}} errors {{often occur}} during the position tracking because the hydraulic servo joint is a nonlinear dynamic system with saturation, <b>dead</b> zone and <b>stroke</b> coupling. In order {{to solve this}} problem, the working principal of the joint is described, and the dynamic model of the joint is established. A control compensation method with adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is presented. The method enables to adjust the alterable gain coefficients by the sample data sets training and self-learning. The position tracking errors, in which saturation, <b>dead</b> zone and <b>stroke</b> coupling result, are eliminated. Eventually, the simulation {{results show that the}} method is feasible.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{evidence}} stating that calcium, vitamin D or bisphosphonates may prevent fractures, {{but it is}} also believed that they may be associated with cardiovascular diseases. For calcium and vitamin D, there exists evidence showing an association with a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including stroke. There is uncertainty about the cardiovascular risks associated to bisphosphonates and concern about their safety. We aimed to investigate whether there is an association between bisphosphonate treatment and the risk of stroke. Methods: We used a matched 1 : 1 case-control design with data from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database (GPRD). We compared cases, aged 18 years or above, either living or <b>dead,</b> with <b>stroke</b> during September 2001 to August 2009, with controls, matched for age, sex, calendar time and practice.

(The death of Charles's wife shortly afterwards would result in Victor becoming the guardian of their two children.)

When a schooner of copra harvesters arrives, crewed by Melanesian slaves {{under the direction of}} two white men, Dick wants to speak to them but is attacked. He kills the leader, and the Melanesians stage an uprising and take over the island. Dick and Katafa escape to Karolin. By chance, Dick has picked up a large, beautifully decorated club left by the warriors. Katafa tells Dick that it is the sacred war club, and can be carried only by men of the royal family, so he must be the new king of Karolin, and indeed, when they get there, Uta Matu has died. The people—women, very young men, and little children—have turned against old priestess Le Juan, who has terrorized them for so many years and whose advice had sent all the warriors to die on Palm Tree. She drops <b>dead</b> of a <b>stroke</b> when she sees Katafa, seemingly returned from the dead, and the people proclaim Dick their new king.|$|R
