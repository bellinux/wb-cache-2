Then the indirect LDX <b>instruction</b> <b>points</b> XR1 not at the transfer vector, but through it to the return address, or to any parameters stored in-line after the BSI. SIMPL then does whatever it was written to do, gaining access to any in-line parameters through XR1 (in which case it must increment XR1 for the return address), and returns as follows: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{microprocessor}} system {{is provided with}} added memories to expand its address spaces beyond its address word length capacity by using indirect addressing instructions of a type having a detectable operations code and dedicating designated address spaces of memory {{to each of the}} added memories, one space to a memory. By decoding each operations code of instructions read from main memory into a decoder to identify indirect addressing instructions of the specified type, and then decoding the address that follows in a decoder to determine which added memory is associated therewith, the associated added memory is selectively enabled through a unit while the main memory is disabled to permit the instruction to be executed on the location to which the effective address of the indirect address <b>instruction</b> <b>points,</b> either before the indirect address is read from main memory or afterwards, depending on how the system is arranged by a switch...|$|E
40|$|Embedded {{software}} frequently uses interrupts for timer or I/O processing. If {{a memory}} area {{is used by}} both an interrupt handler and other routines at the same time, the embedded system {{has the potential to}} fail because of unexpected data in the memory. To detect the race conditions of memory, this paper proposes a method of interrupt testing on a CPU emulator. The method consists of two features: one is interrupt generation at the <b>instruction</b> <b>points</b> that possibly causes race conditions; the other is replacing input value from external device to control interrupt handlers. An interrupt is generated just after the program reads or writes data on memory for the purpose of covering all possibility of sharing memory between the interrupt handler and other routines. Sequence of input value from the external device is prepared by hand before program execution. We have applied our method to testing for a race condition of uClinux. The experience of detecting race conditions has shown the mechanism causes interrupts at necessary and sufficient timing compared with random interrupt testing. Also, it is easy to substitute values in memory to detect race conditions.

To exploit this flexibility, however, an instructable agent must be able to learn different types of knowledge from different instructional interactions. This paper presents an approach to learning from flexible tutorial instruction, called situated explanation, that takes advantage of constraints in different instructional contexts to guide the learning process. This makes it applicable {{to a wide range of}} instructional interactions. The theory is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar, that learns new tasks and other domain knowledge from natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability: it can (A) take any command at each <b>instruction</b> <b>point,</b> (B) handle <b>instructions</b> that apply to either the current situation or a hypothetical one (e. g., conditionals), and (C) [...] ...|$|R

A decrease in performance was predicted for the genetic instruction and an increase for the two alternative explanations based on externalizing. Results showed that both women and men are harmed by the genetic explanation and relieved by both the stereotype and the time limit explanations.
