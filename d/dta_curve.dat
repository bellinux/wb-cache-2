50|$|Differential thermal {{analysis}} (or DTA) is a thermoanalytic technique. Similar to differential scanning calorimetry. In DTA, the material under study and an inert reference {{are made to}} undergo identical thermal cycles, while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference. This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (<b>DTA</b> <b>curve,</b> or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a <b>DTA</b> <b>curve</b> provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample.|$|E
40|$|To make a {{automatic}} recording DTA apparatus, PID program controller, DC amplifier, recorder, etc. were assembled. The schematic {{arrangement of}} the appartus is shown in Fig. 7. The accuracy of the apparatus is within ± 5 ℃ in comparison with melting points of standard metals, such as zinc, antimony and aluminium. The DTA of the apparatus was tentatively carried out on behavior of transition, decomposition, and congruent, eutectic and solid solution melting on such sulfide minerals as cubanite, chalcocite, monoclinic pyrrhotite, stibnite, cuprobismuthite CuBiS_ 2 and horobetsuite BiSbS_ 3. The specimen and inert material (alumina) are severally sealed in evacuated silica glass tubes which are able to insert chromel-alumel thermo-couples into their bottoms. The <b>DTA</b> <b>curve</b> (Fig. 12) of chalcocite shows large and small endothermic reactions at 105 ℃ and 485 ℃ which are transitions from orthorhombic to hexagonal form and from hexagonal to cubic form respectively. Cubanite (Figs. 11 and 12) is also found to transform from low temperature form to high temperature form by the <b>DTA</b> <b>curve</b> showing a distinct endothermic peak beginning at 258 ℃. The <b>DTA</b> <b>curve</b> (Fig. 12) of monoclinic pyrrhotite also represents a transition from monoclinic form to hexagonal form at 325 ℃. Both stibnite and bismuth (Fig. 13) are shown to melt congruently at temperatures of 545 ℃ and 273 ℃ respectively. The <b>DTA</b> <b>curve</b> (Fig. 12) of cuprobismuthite shows three endothermic reactions at 487 ℃, 528 ℃ and 615 ℃. The first reaction represents its decomposition into wittichenite and Cu_ 3 Bi_ 5 S_ 9,and {{the second and third}} suggest eutectic melting of the mixture of wittichenite and Cu_ 3 Bi_ 5 S_ 9,corresponding to composition of cuprobismuthite. Horobetsuite is found to be a solid solution of Bi_ 2 S_ 3 and Sb_ 2 S_ 3 from its <b>DTA</b> <b>curve</b> (Fig. 13).

30|$|The {{occurrence}} of the derivative curve peak between 500 and 700  °C in the SMZ <b>DTA</b> <b>curve,</b> which was missing in the NZ <b>DTA</b> <b>curve,</b> confirmed that some HDTMA molecules had been bound to the zeolite surface via electrostatic interaction after the modification process. The weight loss between 500 and 700  °C for SMZ- 200 % was much higher than that for SMZ- 75 %. The suggested bilayer of HDTMA bound on the NZ surface was confirmed by Fig.  5 d. Moreover, the results from Table  2 shows that NZ are hydrophilic materials where the total weight lost is higher (21.47 %) due to water molecules loss compared to SMZ- 75 % (17.13 %). This {{was due to the}} formation of the monolayer of HDTMA that changed into hydrophobic layer as illustrated in Fig.  5 b. With the increased loading of HDTMA as in SMZ- 200 %, the total weight loss by water molecules increased (24.33 %) due to the bilayer formation when the surface became hydrophilic again, and hence becoming increasingly prone to attracting water (Fig.  5 d) (Kim and Ahn 2011).|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} the studies on the thermal {{behavior}} of sulfide minerals has heen studied by the authors {{by means of the}} differential thermal analysis (DTA) in these several years. This paper is the third report of the series and includes the <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> and some discussions about synthetic and natural minerals belonging to the Bi-Sb-S and the Cu-Sb-As-S systems. The analysis was carried out for the sample of 400 - 600 mg in weiht which was sealed in a evacuated silica glass tube. The heating rate was 5 ℃/min. in regular analysis but the rate of 1. 25 ℃/min. was adopted in some cases to determine a more detailed reaction and to know the temperature of the reaction more precisely. The <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> for synthetic phases of the Bi_ 2 S_ 3 -Sb_ 2 S_ 3 system are shown in Fig. 1. Synthetic bismuthinite and stibnite, end member of this system, show sharp endothermic peaks beginning at 765 ℃ and 558 ℃ respectively, but the curves of the phases such as between these two show typical melting reactions of solid solution. The <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> of natural stibnite (Fig. 2), {{as well as that of}} synthetic stibnite are supposed to indicate a congruent melting. Natural bismuthinite from Teine mine does not show a sharp endothermic peak as synthetic one, and its curve suggests some characteristics of solid solution melting like that of horobetsuite (Fig. 3). The remarkable endothermic peaks of the congruent melting reaction beginning at 551 ℃ and 613 ℃ are seen on the <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> for synthetic chalcostibite and stylotypite respectively (Fig. 4). A series of synthetic tetrahedrite-tennantite group minerals having different compositions are analysed and the results are shown in Figs. 5 - 8. Their <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> except Cu_ Sb_ 4 S_ show that they might have a melting reaction of solid solution, and the beginning temperature of the melting changes by their compositions. Namely, the temperature is ascending with increase of Fe content, and descending with increase of Ag content. Also it is getting higher with increase of tennantite molecules in the synthetic minerals of the tetrahedrite-tennantite group. The <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> of the natural minerals of the group are showing the relationship as mentioned above (Fig. 9). Both of synthetic and natural enargite produce a single remarkable endothermic peak beginning around 670 ℃ as shown in Fig. 10. On the <b>DTA</b> <b>curves</b> for natural luzonite-famatinite group minerals, some differences of the melting temperature and/or the type of melting are observed depending on their compositions (Fig. 11). The curves of luzonite from Lepanto and from Mancayan, having composition poor in famatinite molecule, show congruently melting reactions, but those from Kinkaseki and from Teine, rich in famatinite molecule, indicate some character of solid solution melting. The former shows higher melting temperature than the later. The transformation reaction from luzonite to enargite, which is expected around 320 ℃, has not been seen in any curves of luzonite...|$|R
