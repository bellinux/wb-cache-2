Specifically, by adopting a multilevel and experimental approach we can develop an integrated, causal, and psychological model of climato-economics. 11 : 1000 word main text VDV argues that climato-economic conditions influence human needs, stresses, and goals, leading to differences in freedoms. This model can be praised on many dimensions; e. <b>g.,</b> <b>scope,</b> innovation, cross-disciplinary perspective. However, it contains a serious omission: evidence for a direct, causal link between climato-economics through individuals ’ psychology to collective freedoms. The major issue concerns the failure to measure and model individual level 2 BBS Comment processes, which ultimately means that the current approach cannot establish causality.

Consequently it is also very difficult to find statistics on public sector employment which are reasonably comparable between countries. This paper reviews some of the quality issues involved: e. <b>g.</b> <b>scope,</b> definitions and descriptive variables; timeliness and frequency; comparability with other statistics and costs of production of statistics, as well as possible sources for such statistics. It also relates these various quality concerns to three types of issues for which such statistics may be desired: describing the direct impact on public sector employment of variations in public budgets; analyzing the productivity of the public sector; and describing the impact on the affected workers of privatization or sub-contracting of activities which previously have been carried out by (the staff of) public sector units. A key factor to ensure statistics that are adequate for the description and analysis of these issues is that they cover all person employed, regardless of contractual situation. The hope is that this review can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} such issues and eventually also to an improvement of the current situation...|$|E

Hence, large data sets are necessary to fully understand the complex phenomena (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>scope</b> of nursing practice) being studied. The management of these large data sets can lead to numerous challenges in establishing trustworthiness of the study. This article reports on strategies utilized in {{data collection and analysis}} of a large qualitative study to establish trustworthiness. Specific strategies undertaken by the research team included training of interviewers and coders, variation in participant recruitment, consistency in data collection, completion of data cleaning, development of a conceptual framework for analysis, consistency in coding through regular communication and meetings between coders and key research team members, use of N 6 ™ software to organize data, and creation of a comprehensive audit trail with internal and external audits. Finally, we make eight recommendations that will help ensure rigour for studies with large qualitative data sets: organization of the study by a single person; thorough documentation of the data collection and analysis process; attention to timelines; the use of an iterative process for data collection and analysis; internal and external audits; regular communication among the research team; adequate resources for timely completion; and time for reflection and diversion. Following these steps will enable researchers to complete a rigorous, qualitative research study when faced with large data sets to answer complex health {{services research}} questions...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of frontline staff {{is one of}} the most central elements of an effective correctional system. This thesis reports findings related to the organisational psychology of the correctional environment, with special attention to person characteristics that may predict job {{performance of}} corrections officers. The empirical study investigated components of reasoning ability (abstract, verbal, numerical reasoning) on a sample of officers (N = 88) working in seven prison facilities throughout New Zealand. Overseas research repeatedly identified cognitive abilities as a predictor of job performance across a range of occupational settings, including jobs similar to corrections officers. The current study sought to examine this relationship on a New Zealand officer sample, to provide evidence for criterion-related validity of psychometric assessment of reasoning ability, with implications for use in personnel selection procedures. An analysis of internal relationships among ability components was also undertaken. Consistent with theoretical models and extant empirical findings, abstract, verbal, and numerical reasoning were found to be positively related to one another. However, the given components of reasoning ability were unrelated to job performance in the local occupational setting. Potential explanations for the findings are offered in terms of limitations in the measurement tools and processes (e. <b>g.</b> <b>scope</b> of the performance appraisal tool). It is likely that given the unique job tasks and challenges of the corrections environment, officer performance requires important characteristics outside of reasoning ability, when officers perform affect-laden tasks (e. g. understanding their own and others’ emotions and emotion- driven behaviours). Further investigation of potential predictors such as emotional intelligence is warranted, and is expected to assist prediction of performance in a corrections setting...|$|E

Along with establishing collaborative research partnerships, providing professional development to key stakeholders is considered a crucial activity for making and sustaining partnerships. Utilising knowledge from professional development in Australian contexts can be managed creatively for making connections internationally. Indeed, knowledge transfer is a cornerstone for the globalisation of education and needs to occur as a multiplex dialogue between participating countries. This paper presents a qualitative study around the Mentoring for Effective Teaching (MET) program, its growth and development nationally (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>scope</b> and impact) along with insights into making connections within the Asia-Pacific region. At a national level, we outline how to facilitate a program though relationship building and face-to-face implementation of professional learning. Internationally, we highlight how to mould and shape Australian professional learning for the Asia-Pacific region, {{particularly with regard to}} facilitating fluid interactions within environments outside of Australia. The contexts for the study include a university in Hong Kong and another university in the Philippines. In this presentation, examples will be provided from the MET program to demonstrate contextual differences and similarities for implementation in Australian and Asian contexts. For instance, determining strategies for mentoring pedagogical knowledge can elicit viewpoints that align between cultures (e. g., use of specific teaching and questioning strategies) and also present alternative ideas as a result of cultural differences. We have learnt about having a structured program that draws on the research yet has sufficient flexibility to cater for cultures and contexts. With openmindedness, facilitating professional learning can become a two-way knowledge transfer, where learnings from other cultures and contexts can be refined for advancing programs in Australia...|$|E

Their {{physical and chemical}} properties, when known, can provide valuable information for preparing similar dosage forms to patients. One of the important physical characteristics of preparations is their specific gravity. The specific gravity {{is defined as the}} density of the substance divided by the density of water at a given temperature. We purchased ten non-prescription products from a store in North Carolina. We tested three bottles of each product for their specific gravity using Densito 30 PX (Metter Toledo; Switzerland). The instrument is easy to use and allows calibration with a standard liquid (purified water or alcohol, U. S. P.) at different temperatures (0 oC to 40 oC). We measured each bottle of the same product thrice. The following products were tested for their specific gravity at room temperature: Alka-seltzer Plus (Bayer Health Care; Lot#- 276698 L); Children’s Advil (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-B 58397); Children’s Motrin (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-ABM 011); Children’s Tylenol (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-SSM 015); Children’s Zyrtec (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot# for bottle 1 - 809301; Lot# for bottles 2 and 3 - 809302); Listerine (Lot#- 0619 LZ); Oral Health Rinse (TopCare; Lot#- 90 F 1001); Scope (Proctor & Gamble; Lot#- 95609187); Theraflu (Novartis Consumer Health; Lot# for bottles 1 and 3 - 10061769; Lot# for bottle 2 - 10063059); Tylenol Cold (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot# for bottles 1 and 2 - 900009; Lot# for bottle 3 - 808311).

40|$|This study explores three {{syntactic}} {{issues in}} the Romanian DP: the cliticization of the definite article, the syntactic position of postnominal APs, and the syntactic properties and position of cel. First, I show that the affixation of the definite article can be derived by syntactic head movement of the host element to D 0. The distributional asymmetries among adjectives {{with respect to the}} definite article are accounted for by hypothesizing that they occur in two structurally distinct positions. Adjectives that surface prenominally are heads in the extended nominal projection; while adjectives that surface postnominally are maximal projections. I show that prenominal adjectives (a) block head-movement of the noun to D 0, (b) bypass the same elements as the noun, and (c) are blocked by the same element as the noun. In chapter 3, I claim that APs surfacing between the noun and its complement are generated to the left of N; and APs that follow the complement of the noun are generated to the right. The postnominal surface position of the former APs is derived by leftward noun head-movement as opposed to remnant phrasal-movement. The evidence hinges on the relative scope among APs. I show that the symmetric approach, supported here, generates all and only attested word-order [...] -scope pairings; while antisymmetry generates additional, unattested pairs. Finally, I account for the asymmetric distribution of prenominal versus postnominal cel relative to the definite suffix. In previous literature, cel was equated with D 0. Conversely, I claim that cel heads a modifier phrase, say celP. I show that prenominal celP has the same syntactic distribution and properties as demonstratives, including the ability to license a covert definite D 0; while postnominal celP, like all postnominal modifiers, lacks this property. This study provides a guide to the structure and movements in the Romanian DP, from its lower domain, the base position of N, up to the DP domain. Throughout, this work, I argue that several empirical generalizations on syntactic distribution are best accounted for by head-movement and the Head Movement Constraint. The evidence I produce comes from morpho-syntax (e. g. cliticization), semantics (e. <b>g.</b> <b>scope</b> interpretation) and plain linear word-order...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the quality control systems for constructions in seven countries in Europe with the purpose to trace innovative approaches and best practices that can serve as examples for other countries. Design/methodology/approach: The paper {{is based on a}} series of research projects carried out over a number of years. The research results were updated in 2016 with a desktop research project in seven European countries. The results from this latest project form the heart of this paper. The information is organised into tables that describe and analyse the main features of the quality control systems of the countries (e. <b>g.</b> <b>scope,</b> focus and main characteristics of the procedures and quality demands on building professionals). Findings: Several similar trends can be recognised in the quality control systems of the various European Union (EU) countries. Quality control is getting more and more privatised and the control framework is setting checks and balances throughout the construction process. Other findings are that scope and focus of the statutory control is unbalanced. Within the control processes emphasis is put on the safety aspects of complex constructions. Far fewer demands are made {{on the quality of the}} builders. Re-orientation of the building regulatory framework seems to be needed. Research limitations/implications: The paper only focusses on European countries where private quality control is established and on selected topics. The findings are based on desktop research and not on the practical experiences of the stakeholders involved in the countries studied. Practical implications: The paper draws some important recommendations for policymakers in the building regulatory field. It suggests both an enhancement of the effectiveness of the quality control procedure as well as the commitment of builders to comply with the regulations. Social implications: The quality of constructions is essential for the wellbeing and safety of its users, its occupants or its visitors. This applies to the whole range of quality aspects: structural- and fire safety, health, sustainability and usability aspects. The analyses and recommendations of this paper aim to contribute to an improvement of the overall construction quality. Originality/value: The paper makes an original contribution to the (limited) literature that is available in this field. The results can be used to situate the quality control systems of each member state within the EU, to assess the main trends, and it can be used as a guide to develop strategic choices on possible improvements in each country. </p...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{series of}} {{accidents}} on offshore oil platforms have served to raise public awareness {{on the extent}} to which offshore oil exploitation is moving into increasingly deep waters. Underwater oil drilling really took off in the 1970 s, with the dual effect of a political factor – the desire of consumer countries to lessen their dependence on the Gulf States by developing their own activity – and technological developments making it possible to drill ever further from coastlines and at ever greater depths. Whereas just after the Second World War industries were only drilling in around 10 metres of water, it is now increasingly common for rigs to drill at a depth of over 2 km. Almost a third of the oil consumed in the world now comes from underwater areas. However, human domination of the world’s oceans does not look set to abate. The sea has so far revealed only a tiny fraction of its energy potential and new ultra-deepwater drilling technologies are currently being developed. Consequently, many experts believe that despite its environmental, economic and social impact, the recent accidents in Australia (Montara, 21 st August 2009), United States (Deepwater Horizon, 20 th April 2010) or in China (Penglai 19 - 3, 4 th June 2011) are unlikely to halt the rush towards offshore drilling, especially given that the technical cost of deep water oil drilling has been significantly reduced in recent years. These events therefore invite the lawyers to question the suitability of the current international framework for the regulation of offshore oil drilling. Although the 1982 United Nations Convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS) imposes a general obligation to protect the marine environment, no international convention specifically sets international standards determining the conditions under which States should issue drilling permits. As for regional initiatives and conventions, they are often chronically absent (Western Africa, Caribbean, etc.) or of very limited effectiveness or scope (Mediterranean, North West Atlantic, etc.). Recently however, two legal and political processes have been initiated to advance pollution prevention and control: the Indonesian (within the International Maritime Organisation framework) and Russian (within the G 20) proposals are both based on the observation that international law falls well short of covering the cross-border dimensions of offshore oil exploitation when considering the increasing risks involved. Because of the multiplication of accidents, their dramatic consequences both for marine environment and coastal populations and the “four Ds, which, from now on, are destined to characterize the offshore oil industry in its search for black gold: Deep, Distant, Dangerous and Difficult[1]”, it is no more possible to plead for a legal status quo. This presentation will therefore focus on the possible options to strengthen the regulation offshore oil exploitation, (i) reminding the past (draft convention on offshore mobile craft elaborated by the Comité Maritime International in the 1970 s) and current initiatives (Indonesian proposal within the International Maritime Organisation, discussions within the G 20), (ii) identifying the current legal gaps and (iii) addressing crucial issues to address for such a potential initiative to be successful (e. <b>g,</b> <b>scope</b> of a legal agreement; framework and scale in which to develop it; expected reluctance, etc.).

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this work {{is the study of}} {{detector}} systems composed of a scintillator, a photodetector and readout electronics, for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In particular, the timing properties of such detector systems are studied. The first idea is {{to take advantage of the}} good timing properties of the NINO chip, which is a fast preamplifier-discriminator developed for the ALICE Time of flight detector at CERN. This chip uses a time over threshold technique that is to be applied for the first time in medical imaging applications. A unique feature of this technique is that it delivers both timing and energy information with a single digital pulse, the time stamp with the rising edge and the energy from the pulse width. This entails substantial simplification of the entire readout architecture of a tomograph. The scintillator chosen in the detector system is LSO. Crystals of 2 x 2 x 10 mm 3 were used. For the photodetector, APDs were first used, and were then replaced by SiPMs to make use of their higher gain. These different elements that constitute the whole detector system are presented, and their functioning is explained. Within the European FP 6 BioCare project, a test setup comprising 2 identical detector systems in coincidence was developed. Each one is composed of a LSO scintillator, an APD, a preamplifier and the NINO readout electronics. The energy resolution was measured to 16 % for 511 keV y-rays. This is comparable to the resolution obtainable with PMT based systems. The same APD based system was also studied with 122 keV X-rays, to assess its potential for combined PET-CT imaging. The energy resolution in this case was measured to 70 % as compared to 50 % with PMTs. This is explained by a lack of sensitivity of the readout electronics to low charges. The time resolution for 2 such detectors in coincidence was demonstrated to be of 1. 6 ns FWHM. This is 3 times worse than what one could obtain with PMT based systems under the same conditions. The contributions of the different elements of the detector system to the time precision were identified. The relative contributions of the electronics, the APD and the LSO were found to be 20 %, 30 % and 50 %, respectively. However, the fact that the LSO crystal dominates the time resolution is partly attributed to the readout mechanism of the APD. The relatively low gain of the APD prevents the readout electronics from detecting fewer than 20 photoelectrons coming from the LSO whereas the PMT is sensitive to a single photon. Therefore, a new photodetector was chosen and characterized: the Silicon PhotoMultiplier (SiPM). This photodetector finds increasing interest in the scientific community, offering better characteristics than APD in terms of gain and of single photon sensitivity. They could also be used for TOF applications in PET. The SiPM used were supplied by ST microelectronics and tested at CERN in the context of a scientific collaboration. SiPM from Hamamatsu were also tested for comparison. The study of a 1 x 1 mm 2 SiPM has demonstrated that the time resolution of the SiPM coupled to the NINO chip is of 180 ps rms from the detection of single 405 nm laser photon. This means that this combination of SiPM+NINO can also be used as a detector system for the detection of single photons such as in Cerenkov light detection or in fluorescence spectroscopy, where good time precision is required. In the case of PET, the response of the SiPM to LSO photons following the interaction of a 511 keV y-ray was modeled. Since in this case the output current from the SiPM is too high to be directly read out by the NINO circuit, an interface consisting of a differentiating circuit was developed. Furthermore, the typical size of LSO crystals (2 x 2 mm 2) together with the high number of SPAD cells required to detect the photons emitted by the LSO implies that larger size SiPM (3 x 3 mm 2) have to be used. The work done during the thesis has shown a crucial influence of the SiPM terminal capacitance, which may be as high as 320 pF for the Hamamatsu SiPM of 3 x 3 mm 2. In contrast with SiPMs of smaller size, this capacitance in parallel with a load resistance (e. <b>g.</b> <b>scope</b> or NINO) is large enough to significantly increase the rise time of the SPAD signals to the extent that the timing performance of the ensemble is severely degraded. An improved electronics interface is currently being studied to overcome this limitation. Another novel photodetector has also been studied in the context of this thesis: the microchannel plate (MCP) that is made of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The first samples were developed at the Institute of MicroTechnology (IMT) of Neuchatel and tested at CERN in a scientific collaboration. The advantage of this detector is the possibility to deposit on top of ASIC in a direct and vertical integration. Our preliminary investigation indicate that a current increase takes place along the borders of the MCP pores, possibly indicating the generation of a cascade of secondary electrons...|$|E

In Greenlandic Eskimo the nominative, whether it is a subject or an object, is syntactically prominent in the clause, much like a subject in English; but in Warlpiri, the nominative is not prominent, more like an object.

40|$|This paper investigates three {{readings}} of Chinese indefinite NPs, i. e. the specific, the nonspecific, and the cardinal reading, {{in terms of}} temporal reference.

Such analysis further helps to clarify the seemingly confusing <b>scope</b> phenomena, e. <b>g.</b> wide <b>scope</b> indefinites. I propose that the specificity in Chinese should be singled out from the scope interpretation of indefinite NPs so that the seemingly confusing scopal relation is clarified and the Isomorphic Principle in Chinese is still maintained.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this book is motivated by the goal of applying linguistic theorybuilding to the concrete needs of potential linguistic applications such as question answering, dialogue systems, and machine translation. To pursue this goal, a translation of linguistic theory into a framework of “practical linguistics ” is suggested. Database Semantics (DBS) {{is presented as a}} first step towards such a framework. It models the communication between cognitive agents, which can be used, for example, to implement the communicative abilities of a cognitive robot. DBS serves as a single underlying format for modeling communication in that it lends itself to an account of both language processing and language production (thinking is added as a separate component, which refers to inferencing on stored information, and activating content to be verbalized).

A systematic search of key health databases (Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMbase) was conducted to identify literature on ED models of care. Additionally, a focused review of the contents of 11 international and national emergency medicine, nursing and health economic journals (published between 2010 and 2013) was undertaken with snowball identification of references of the most recent and relevant papers. Articles published between 1998 and 2013 in the English language were included for initial review by three of the authors. Studies in underdeveloped countries and not addressing the objectives of the present study were excluded. Relevant details were extracted from the retrieved literature, and analysed for relevance and impact. The literature was synthesised around the study 2 ̆ 7 s main themes. Models described within the literature mainly focused on addressing issues at the input, throughput or output stages of ED care delivery. Models often varied to account for site specific characteristics (e. g. onsite inpatient units) or to suit staffing profiles (e. <b>g.</b> extended <b>scope</b> physiotherapist), ED geographical location (e. g. metropolitan or rural site), and patient demographic profile (e. g. paediatrics, older persons, ethnicity).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{investigating}} how career tracks {{are being developed}} at Swedish higher education institutions {{in the aftermath of}} a new autonomy reform, launched in 2011. The study is based on semi-structured interviews and documentary studies from three Swedish universities of which one is a business private, one is a technical university and one is a comprehensive university. All three universities have introduced tenure track systems based on promotion criteria. The paper revolves around some of the tensions/key issues we have identified in relation to tenure track systems. These include the scope of the tenure track in relation to other academic posts, the use of hard (metrics) or soft (peer review) promotion criteria, the division of academic tasks, and mobility (international and across industries).

40|$|Retransmission based {{error control}} for large scale {{multicast}} applications {{is difficult because}} of two main problems: request implosion and lack of local recovery. Existing schemes (SRM, RMTP, TMTP, LBRRM) have good solutions to request implosion, but only approximate solutions (e. <b>g.,</b> based on <b>scoped</b> multicast) for the local recovery problem. Our scheme achieves finer grain fault recovery by exploiting new forwarding services {{that allow us to}} create a dynamic hierarchy of receivers. We use a new paradigm, where routers provide a more refined form of multicasting (that may be useful to other applications), that enables local recovery. The new services, however, are simple to implement and do not require routers to examine or store application packets; hence, they do not violate layering. Besides providing good local recovery, our scheme integrates well with the current IP model, has small recovery latencies (it requires no back-off delays), produces fewer duplicates than other schemes, a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Integration {{has been}} {{advanced}} {{as a strategy}} for the delivery {{of a number of}} human services that have traditionally been delivered by autonomous agencies with independent processes and funding sources. However, measurement of the dimensions of integration has been hampered by numerous factors, including a lack of definitional and conceptual clarity of integration, and the use of measurement tools with atheoretical foundations and limited psychometric testing. Theory/methods: Based on a review of integration measurement approaches, a comprehensive approach to the measure of multiple dimensions of integrated human service networks was conceptualized. The combination of concepts was derived from existing theoretical, policy, and measurement approaches in order to establish the content validity and comprehensiveness of the proposed measure. Results: The dimensions of human service integration measures are: (1) Observed (current) and expected structural inputs, or the mix of agencies that comprise the network (e. <b>g.</b> extent, <b>scope,</b> depth, congruence within an agency, and reciprocity between agencies). (2) Functioning of the network both in terms {{of the quality of the}} network or partnership functioning and ingredients of the integration of the networks' working arrangements and range of human services provided. (3) Network outputs in terms of network capacity (e. g. what is accomplished, for how many and how quickly given the local demand) measured from dual perspectives of the agency and the family. Conclusion: This newly developed measure unites multiple perspectives in a comprehensive approach to the measurement of integration of human service networks. Content validity has been established. Future work should focus on further refinement of this instrument through psychometric evaluation (e. g. construct validity) in diverse networks and relating these measures of network integration to client and system outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: While a {{considerable}} amount of knowledge has been accumulated about dispute causation, disputes continue to prevail and disharmonise the process of construction with considerable cost. This paper seeks to identify the underlying pathogens that clients and contractors perceive to contribute to disputes in construction projects. The identification of pathogens can provide an ameliorated understanding of the origin of disputes and therefore enable their prevention. Design/methodology/approach: Case law and focus groups with a client and contracting organisation from Western Australia are used to determine the pathogens of disputes. Findings: Analysis of the case law findings revealed that the underlying issues that were brought to litigation were to do with points of law, namely “civil procedure”. A significant number of disputes are thus settled using alternative dispute resolution methods such as adjudication, arbitration and mediation. For clients the underlying latent conditions that resulted in a dispute were {{due to the nature of}} the task being performed (e. g. failure to detect and correct errors) and those arising from people's deliberate practices (e. g. failure to oblige by contractual requirements). For the contractor focus group the circumstances arising from the situation or environment the project was operating in were identified as the main underlying latent condition for disputes (e. <b>g.</b> unforeseen <b>scope</b> changes). Research limitations/implications: Focus groups are only undertaken with clients and contracting groups as they were identified as the main parties involved in dispute during the analysis of litigation cases within Western Australia. Input from consultants and subcontractors may provide a more balanced perspective as to the perceived causes and costs of disputes. Originality/value: The research has been able to provide the initial building blocks for understanding the underlying pathogens contributing to disputes. However, more empirical research is required before conclusive findings can be made, particularly with regard to the influences on subcontractor...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is about dynamic characterization of peat using field seismic geophysical method. There are demands on dynamic characteristics in construction {{due to their}} importance towards the society. The dynamic behaviours of peat are shear velocity (Vs) and shear modulus (<b>G).</b> The <b>scope</b> of this {{research is}} meant for peat and soft clay by using multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) method and seismic refraction method. The estimation of shear modulus is based on shear wave velocity and soil bulk density using the sampler with 0. 5 m depth each. Peat sampler was used to verify the soil profiles at every location except for soft clay. The shear wave velocity for peat is ranging from 26. 02 – 95. 89 m/s. Meanwhile, for soft clay, it has velocity from 61. 25 – 86. 37 m/s. As for shear modulus of peats, the range is between 0. 82 – 7. 26 MPa while for soft clay, the range is between 7. 29 MPa – 13. 92 MPa. The variations of shear wave velocity and shear modulus of peat are due to the differences in peat soils properties in term of organic content, fibre content, void ratio and moisture content for every research location. Furthermore, seismic attenuation in peat is also affected the seismic wave velocity. The dynamic behaviour of peat and soft clay have slight changes in shear wave velocity. However it has significant difference in shear modulus due to the existence of organic content that contributes to their differences. Shear wave velocity was obtained by applying seismic refraction method. The data shows the increment of velocity with depth. The determination of dynamic behaviour of peats was achieved by using seismic geophysical method have shown good findings...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{learning}} {{for small businesses}} should best proceed constitutes a worthwhile, yet challenging, pedagogic project. In order to maintain their viability, small businesses {{need to be able}} to respond to new practices and tasks. Yet small businesses seem neither attracted to, nor to value, the kinds of taught courses that are the standard pedagogic practice of vocational education systems. Small business operators commonly view these courses as being irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccessible. Therefore, identifying the kinds of pedagogic practices that meet their needs and offer effective learning outcomes is a useful project. This paper reports and discusses the findings of a study of how 30 Australian small businesses learnt to implement a new practice: a recently introduced goods and service tax (GST). Interviews were used to understand the pedagogic practices that supported the learning associated with implementing the GST. In most cases, the process of learning comprised a movement from an initial reliance upon external contributions to a greater independence in practice premised on capacities residing within the small businesses. The key and most commonly reported contributions were those provided by localised support and expertise (e. g. experts such as affiliates, accountants, consultants, family, other small businesses). Localised support was potent when it assisted in identifying the goals for learning (e. <b>g.</b> the <b>scope</b> and requirements of the task) and the development of capacities to operate independently, as well as supporting and monitoring the progress with this innovation. A model of learning in small business was generated and validated through further interviews with small businesses. The model illuminates the need to go beyond the orthodox pedagogic practice of vocational education and training to consider options, such as localised learning spaces as the key source of small business learning.

40|$|This paper identifies, explores and {{provides}} a formal analysis to a phenomenon that I will call nominal restatement. Nominal restatement (NR) bears a certain similarity to nominal apposition (NA). However, whether an equality sign can be put between these notions depends largely on our assumptions about the range of facts pertaining to apposi-tion, {{which is not a}} matter of perfect consensus. This paper shows that NR goes beyond the notion of NA developed by Potts (2005) and is not covered by his analysis. It also presents a purely pragmatic account of NR in terms of the discourse relation of restatement (Jasinskaja 2006 b), which both explains the new observations concerning NR (e. <b>g.</b> quan-tification and <b>scope</b> behaviour) {{and provides}} a better explanation to some old observations about NA that are also valid for NR (e. g. case). Finally, I address the question whether the notion of NA can ultimately be done away with by subsuming it under the more general notion of NR and discuss some related problems. The term restatement goes back to Mann and Thompson (1988, cf. p. 277) and originally refers to a rhetorical relation that holds between two discourse segments where the second reformu...|$|R
40|$|Tese de mestrado, Ecologia Marinha, 2009, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de CiênciasResumo alargado em português disponível no documentoHuman populations occupy intensively {{coastal areas}} {{throughout}} the world, probably given {{the goods and}} services provided by coastal systems that contribute significantly to employment and economic activities. Consequently, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) associated to these areas is very high compared to inland areas, contributing clearly to human well-being. As a result, coastal and marine areas are subject to many environmental pressures and impacts. Countries have long been responding to these pressures by implementing different regulatory frameworks. The European Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive {{is one of the most}} important environmental management tools applying by the European Member States (MS), because it covers many activities that are carried out in coastal areas but also because some basic environmental information, necessary to fulfil EIA requirements, might be used in other regulations. Therefore, and because MS transposed and implemented the Directive dissimilarly, the present study analyzes the differences between the legal implementation and practice of the Directive in Portugal and in the United Kingdom (UK), considering this Directive as an example for another ones. To achieve this objective, detailed flow-charts were created based on national regulations and a SWOT (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats) analysis was performed for each stage of the EIA procedure (e. <b>g.</b> Screening, <b>Scoping,</b> Environmental Statement Preparation and Submission, Technical Review, Public Consultation, Decision-Making and Post EIA Process). During this work it was possible to understand that, in some cases, EIA good performance is affected by the regulations such as with the possibility of tacit acceptance or with the consideration of short periods of public consultation. In other cases, it is the practical application that influences the quality of the procedure, for example with the non compliance of the Scoping stage in the majority of the project's development. Consequently, some recommendations were made for several points in order to improve those which are negatively influencing a good performance of the EIA procedure...|$|R
