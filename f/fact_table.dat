2500|$|From a space storage {{point of}} view, {{dimensional}} tables are typically {{small compared to}} fact tables. This often negates the potential storage-space benefits of the star schema {{as compared to the}} snowflake schema. Example: One million sales transactions in 200 shops in 220 countries would result in 1,000,200 records in a star schema (1,000,000 records in the <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> and 200 records in the dimensional table where each country would be listed explicitly for each shop in that country). A more normalized snowflake schema with country keys referring to a country table would consist of the same 1,000,000 record <b>fact</b> <b>table,</b> a 200 record shop table with references to a country table with 220 records. In this case, the star schema, although further denormalized, would only reduce the number or records by a (negligible) factor of 0.9997800923612083 (= divided by [...] ) ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that for complex queries OLAP cubes can produce an answer in around 0.1% {{of the time}} {{required}} for the same query on OLTP relational data. [...] The most important mechanism in OLAP which allows it to achieve such performance {{is the use of}} aggregations. Aggregations are built from the <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> by changing the granularity on specific dimensions and aggregating up data along these dimensions. The number of possible aggregations is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities.|$|E

2500|$|In computing, a {{snowflake}} schema is {{a logical}} arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database such that the entity relationship diagram resembles a snowflake [...] shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables which are connected to multiple dimensions.. [...] "Snowflaking" [...] is a method of normalising the dimension tables in a star schema. When it is completely normalised along all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a snowflake with the <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> in the middle. The principle behind snowflaking is normalisation of the dimension tables by removing low cardinality attributes and forming separate tables.|$|E
5000|$|... "average daily sales" [...] is a {{measurement}} that {{is stored in}} the <b>fact</b> <b>table.</b> The <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> also contains foreign keys from the dimension tables, where time series (e.g. dates) and other dimensions (e.g. store location, salesperson, product) are stored.|$|E
50|$|After {{defining}} the dimensions, {{the next step}} in the process is to make keys for the <b>fact</b> <b>table.</b> This step is to identify the numeric facts that will populate each <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> row. This step is closely related to the business users of the system, since this is where they get access to data stored in the data warehouse. Therefore, most of the <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> rows are numerical, additive figures such as quantity or cost per unit, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Fact tables {{provide the}} (usually) {{additive}} values {{that act as}} independent variables by which dimensional attributes are analyzed. Fact tables are often defined by their grain. The grain of a <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> represents the most atomic level by which the facts may be defined. The grain of a SALES <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> might be stated as [...] "Sales volume by Day by Product by Store". Each record in this <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> is therefore uniquely defined by a day, product and store. Other dimensions might be members of this <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> (such as location/region) but these add nothing to {{the uniqueness of the}} fact records. These [...] "affiliate dimensions" [...] allow for additional slices of the independent facts but generally provide insights at a higher level of aggregation (a region contains many stores).|$|E
5000|$|A {{transactional}} {{table is}} the most basic and fundamental. The grain associated with a transactional <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> is usually specified as [...] "one row per line in a transaction", e.g., every line on a receipt. Typically a transactional <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> holds data of the most detailed level, causing it {{to have a great}} number of dimensions associated with it.|$|E

50|$|In data warehousing, a <b>Fact</b> <b>table</b> {{consists}} of the measurements, metrics or facts of a business process. It {{is located at the}} center of a star schema or a snowflake schema surrounded by dimension tables. Where multiple fact tables are used, these are arranged as a fact constellation schema. A <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> typically has two types of columns: those that contain facts and those that are a foreign key to dimension tables. The primary key of a <b>fact</b> <b>table</b> is usually a composite key that is made up of all of its foreign keys. Fact tables contain the content of the data warehouse and store different types of measures like additive, non additive, and semi additive measures.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to <b>fact</b> <b>tables,</b> {{dimension}} tables contain descriptive attributes (or fields) {{that are}} typically textual fields (or discrete numbers that behave like text). These attributes {{are designed to}} serve two critical purposes: query constraining and/or filtering, and query result set labeling.|$|R

Due to their significance in taking strategic decisions it is fundamental to assure its quality. Although there are some useful guidelines proposals for designing multidimensional data models, objective indicators (metrics) are needed to help designers and managers to develop quality multidimensional data models. In this paper we present two metrics (Number of <b>Fact</b> <b>Tables,</b> NFT and Number of Dimensional Tables, NDT) we have defined for multidimensional data models and an experiment developed in order to validate them as quality indicators. As {{a result of this}} experiment it seems that the number of <b>fact</b> <b>tables</b> can be considered as a solid quality indicator of a multidimensional data model. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} of query processing in a Data Warehouse {{are quite different}} from those of an OLTP system. Major differences exist in the schema, which {{in the case of a}} relational DW is usually some variant of a star schema with rather large <b>fact</b> <b>tables</b> and descriptive dimension tables linked to the <b>fact</b> <b>table(s)</b> through key/foreign key relationships. Query processing typi-cally involves selections on the dimension tables with star joins to the <b>fact</b> <b>tables.</b> DW queries further involve aggregations and presentation in sorted order. These are batch-like operations that in conventional query processing systems require the processing of the whole data set before further processing in sorted order or presentation to the user is possible. However, in OLAP applications, the power user is the scarce resource and response time rather than total execution time should be optimized. This work addresses these problems by first proposing a novel indexing method, encoded bitmap indexing, that complements simple bitmap indexing and bit-slice indexes and is par-ticularly useful for large domains. Bitmap indexing is then used to solve the optimization of aggregation operations, the optimization or substitution of star-joins, and the optimization for response time rather than for execution time. The proposed optimization strategies produc...|$|R
