5|$|The new {{alignment}} of US-6 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was {{planned for the}} next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon as news broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they had {{not seen since the}} slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The <b>Highway</b> <b>Patrol</b> requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as they were unable to disperse the crowds.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, Governor of North Carolina Luther H. Hodges and United States Senator from North Carolina B. Everett Jordan {{requested}} a disaster declaration for the state. President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower designated portions of North Carolina {{impacted by the}} storm as a disaster area. According to the American Red Cross, at least 5,000people were kept in shelters after Helene. Following the large-scale evacuation procedures and resulting low loss of life after the storm, the Weather Bureau recommended that certain organizations be awarded the Outstanding Service to the Public certificate due to their cooperation with the Weather Bureau during the hurricane's duration. The recommended recipients were the radio stations WPTF and WRAL, and the North Carolina State <b>Highway</b> <b>Patrol.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California <b>Highway</b> <b>Patrol</b> agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|During {{the week}} when Emily {{approached}} shore, the North Carolina government {{was scheduled to}} have a two-day emergency management exercise involving a hurricane strike; the storm caused the exercise to be postponed. On August29, a voluntary evacuation was issued for the Outer Banks, and within 36hours of the storm's approach, a mandatory evacuation was issued for Ocracoke and Hatteras Island. A total of 160,000people (mostly tourists) evacuated from the Outer Banks, representing about 90% of the population there. The evacuation was completed within 12hours, expedited by <b>highway</b> <b>patrol</b> and making U.S. Route 158 and the Wright Memorial Bridge only one direction, away from the coast. About 1,000residents on Hatteras Island and another 600 on Ocracoke rode out the storm in their homes. The United States Coast Guard evacuated personnel to the mainland, leaving behind a skeleton crew to maintain their facilities. The National Park Service closed the campground on Ocracoke {{two days before the}} storm. Several towns in southeastern North Carolina were also evacuated, and schools closed across the region.|$|E
5|$|Local {{chapters}} of the American Red Cross organized first-aid stations and shelters; transportation was provided {{to those who were}} unable to reach the shelters. In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba. The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves, while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland. The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort Myers, and the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers from the Florida <b>Highway</b> <b>Patrol</b> was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm. The state also opened all of the school buildings in Dade County as emergency shelters.|$|E

In Nantucket, Massachusetts, a school was converted to a temporary shelter in anticipation of Arthur's arrival.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{potential}} impacts from Helene, the Weather Bureau began to advise prompt emergency evacuation in their advisories. Areas between Beaufort, South Carolina and Cape Fear, North Carolina were urged to begin evacuation procedures immediately. The Southeastern American Red Cross sent ten field staff warnings to locations in Georgia and South Carolina in order to assist in setting up emergency shelters. The Red Cross held 27hurricane preparation conferences to plan preparation procedures. Other civil defense organizations also mobilized hurricane preparation staff and equipment. The Weather Bureau sent a mobile weather station to Charleston, South Carolina in order to monitor weather conditions and alert surrounding populations with short-range radio equipment. Beaches on North Carolina's coast, including Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, were completely evacuated during the night of September27. In Wilmington, North Carolina, 100members of the United States National Guard were dispatched to monitor waterfront property, while 60others were kept on standby. Civilian vehicles attempting to enter Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were sent back by <b>highway</b> <b>patrol</b> 15mi (25km) outside the city borders, following an order issued by Governor of South Carolina George Bell Timmerman, Jr. The order was issued to minimize casualties and prevent looting. Approximately 100members of the National Guard and local police were kept to patrol the beach. Despite repeated orders for mandatory evacuation, a few people remained in Myrtle Beach. Civil Defense authorities forcibly evacuated stragglers, but others were permitted to remain.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{joined the}} Marsh Agency, and {{although}} Lubin landed him his biggest role {{to date in}} The First Traveling Saleslady (1956) and later hired him for Escapade in Japan, without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling. Upon the advice of Irving Leonard, his financial advisor, he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC's Reader's Digest series, and as a motorcycle gang member on a <b>Highway</b> <b>Patrol</b> episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in West Point series and a suicidal gold prospector on Death Valley Days. In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of Navy Log and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on Maverick opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money. Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture Lafayette Escadrille and {{played a major role}} as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in Ambush at Cimarron Pass, a film which Eastwood viewed disastrously and professes to be the lowest point of his career.|$|E
