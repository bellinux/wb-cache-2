40|$|Effective control {{strategies}} {{are needed in}} organic fruit growing to prevent blossom infections by the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora. There are many potential control agents under discussion. 18 preparations have been tested for their efficiency against Erwinia amylovora. Twelve of them were highly effective against E. amylovora in vitro. Nevertheless only five of them led to a symptom reduction of more than 50 % on de-tached apple blossoms. These results and data on field performance from the literature indicate that Blos-som-Protect {{is the most effective}} preparation to prevent blossom infections by fire blight. Therefore further experiments have been performed to develop a strategy for the use of Blossom-Protect in organic fruit grow-ing. The side effect of Blossom-Protect on <b>fruit</b> <b>russeting</b> was tested in two field trials in 2005. No increase of fruit russet was detected in the varieties `Jonagored` and `Golden Delicious` after 2 or 3 applications of Blossom-Protect during bloom...|$|E
40|$|With {{field trials}} over 3 {{years in a}} {{commercial}} organic orchard in Switzerland we have tested the efficacy of Armicarb® (potassium-bi-carbonate) for flower thinning in organic apple production. Over time, Armicarb was tested on 11 cultivars, at different application periods, in different concentrations, and always in comparison to other agents that are already allowed for thinning in organic fruit production in the European Union as e. g. lime sulphur, molasses, mechanical rope-thinner or combinations of methods. Armicarb {{proved to be an}} efficient and reliable thinning agent with an efficacy similar to the now recommended methods with rope device, molasses or lime sulphur but has the advantage to be an environmentally very friendly product. On the other hand, the risk for <b>fruit</b> <b>russeting</b> is comparably elevated especially with cultivars ‘Elstar’, ‘Golden Del. ’ ’and ‘Gala’. Finally, we have elaborated cultivar-specific recommendations for the use of Armicarb for thinning purposes, which were the basis for the Swiss Federal approval to use Armicarb for thinning in conventional and organic apple production in 2011 / 2012...|$|E
40|$|High density {{planting}} {{systems are}} {{a prerequisite to}} economise the use of land and labour costs of orchards. Dwarfing rootstocks controlling the vigour of the scion cultivars {{form the basis for}} such orchards (Wertheim and Webster, 2005). In the Netherlands, rootstock research is limited to and focussed on testing rootstocks selected abroad. For the Dutch pear growers the main selection criteria for new rootstocks are: 1) control of tree size; 2) production; 3) fruit size; 4) fruit quality; 5) production efficiency; 6) frost resistance. Additional criteria for Dutch fruit tree nurseries exporting trees to other countries are: 1) compatibility with scion cultivars; 2) suitability for growth in calcareous soils; 3) easy propagation. In all trials rootstock performance is compared to Quince MC, the most commonly used rootstocks for pears in the Netherlands. Recently, a number of Pyrus (Pyrus communis) and Quince (Cydonia oblonga) rootstocks have been tested with ‘Conference’ and ‘Doyenné du Comice’ as the scion cultivars. Generally, the production efficiency of the Pyrus rootstocks was much less than for Quince MC. Another disadvantage of the evaluated Pyrus rootstocks was their high sensitivity towards pear decline. Several rootstocks were rejected after examination of the graft union because of suspected compatibility problems. Of the tested Quince rootstocks C 132 shows promise because of its control of tree growth in combination with good fruit size and Eline® because of its reduction of <b>fruit</b> <b>russeting</b> in ‘Conference...|$|E

40|$|ReportThe goal of {{this work}} is to develop IPM {{strategies}} for control of apple <b>fruit</b> <b>russet</b> that is caused by Aureobasidium pullulans, a common fungal inhabitant of apple surfaces. We determined that the fungus is highly tolerant of pH changes and therefore attempting to alter the surface pH of the fruit {{is not likely to}} impact russet.

A. pullulans varies considerably with regard to sensitivity to fungicides such as captan, polyram and the strobilurin group. This is likely to result in less than desirable russet control. Isolates of the fungus that were isolated from plants that were not likely to be sprayed with fungicides were more sensitive to the fungicides. This suggests that repeated use of the fungicides has resulted in a population of fungi that are tolerant of them.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Horticulture)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Lack {{of winter}} {{chilling}} {{is a major}} problem in producing temperate-zone fruit in warm climates. Delayed foliation and protracted bud burst and flowering are the main problems necessitating artificial means to break dormancy. In South Africa (SA), most apple production areas receive insufficient winter chilling, and an annual application of rest breaking (RB) agents is included as standard practice. The most used RB agent in SA was dinitro-o-cresol (DNOC) but its use was discontinued. Hydrogen cyanamide (HC) became the replacement. It has been effective in apple, but variable effects on fruit set, blossom, yield and fruit quality have been reported. Thidiazuron (TDZ) has also shown the ability to break dormancy in apples. Another important practice in apple production is chemical thinning (CT). However, results are highly influenced by the type of chemical, weather conditions, cultivar and blossom pattern. With the increasing efficacy of RB and by identifying its effects on vegetative and reproductive development, {{it will be possible to}} determine more effective chemical thinning treatments. The objective of this study was to determine appropriate RB treatments for apple trees in a warm winter climate, identifying their effect on vegetative and reproductive development and the influence on CT efficacy. The research was performed in the Elgin area (34 °S, 300 m) SA, over a period of three years, on ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Royal Gala’. In evaluating the effect of different HC concentrations and oil, no synergistic or antagonistic effects were observed on budburst and yield. Mineral oil at 4 % plus 1 to 2 % Dormex® combined were sufficient to break dormancy. Dormex® at 4 % (2. 08 % HC) reduced fruit set and yield. In general, the rest breaking treatments (DNOC, HC and TDZ) enhanced the final vegetative bud burst compared to the control, while reproductive bud burst in 2002 and 2003 was not significantly influenced. The treatments compressed and advanced flowering periods, but this effect was not always evident when the spring was warm. The treatments synchronised flowering on the tree and between the two cultivars. The mixture of 0. 245 % HC and 4 % oil was less effective in terms of increasing bud burst in ‘Royal Gala’ compared to other rest-breaking treatments. The mixture of 0. 49 % HC and 4 % oil effectively compressed and synchronised flowering in ‘Golden Delicious’. TDZ-oil used at the lower rates also increased bud burst and concentrated flowering. However, it appears that after a cooler winter, higher rates could result in an exacerbated bud burst effect with excessive vegetative growth. The rate and timing of TDZ-oil application influenced the reproductive development of apples and therefore fruit quality. In ‘Golden Delicious’ increased fruit set, number of seeds, and reduced <b>fruit</b> <b>russeting</b> appear as beneficial results of TDZ-oil, whereas fruit set and russeting was not affected in ‘Granny Smith’. TDZ-oil, when applied late and at increasing rates, led to an increase in the malformation of calyx cavities, especially when chemical thinning was performed using the cytokinin-like compound benzyladenine. The effect seemed to be cultivar specific, with ‘Golden Delicious’ being the most severely affected. Increased return bloom in response to late TDZ application in ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Royal Gala’ appeared to be beneficial...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} copper {{formulations}} registered for fire blight control at various timings in NYS. Copper is historically {{used to reduce}} the amount of bacteria available for blossom infection by intercepting and killing some of the bacteria oozing from the overwintering cankers. But copper also has a reputation for <b>russetting</b> <b>fruit</b> finish if applied too close to bloom time. Timing the copper application closer to dormant so there is little residue available when fruitlets are susceptible to fruit finish damage can minimize <b>fruit</b> <b>russet.</b> But this may be too early since fire blight cankers do not become active and produce bacterial ooze until closer to bloom. Cuprofix Disperss is a recently registered material in NYS with fire blight control on the label between silver tip and green tip at 10 - 20 lb. /acre. This study was conducted to evaluate fire blight control if 2 applications of Cuprofix Disperss between silver tip and green tip provided improved control and improved fruit finish compared to other grower practices. Since blossom blight is the primary mode of fire blight epidemics and not completely controlled by copper treatments applied prebloom, streptomycin continues to be a critical control method for minimizing fire blight infections in orchards...|$|R

40|$|In organic {{fruit growing}} {{effective}} control strategies {{are needed to}} prevent blossom infections by the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Many potential control agents are under discussion and have been tested in vitro and in vivo. 19 out of 27 tested preparations showed a high efficacy against E. amylovora in vitro. Nevertheless, on detached apple blossoms only 7 of them led to a symptom reduction by more than 50 %. In six field trials conducted according to the EPPO guideline PP 1 / 166 (3) BlossomProtect (82 %), Myco-sin (65 %) and Funguran (58 %) had the highest efficiency. In 2006 and 2007, strategies to integrate BlossomProtect in spray schedules of organic apple production have been tested. The use of sulphur or lime-sulphur before or after BlossomProtect did not influence the efficiency of BlossomProtect, which showed that fire blight control is possible without compromising apple scab control.

40|$|In a 4 -year {{study in}} a whole-field {{sanitized}} organic apple orchard, the ef- fectiveness of nine fungicide treatments, including potassium mono- and bicarbonate and their combinations with wettable sulfur, were evaluated for scab and powdery mildew control on two cultivars with different sus- ceptibility to scab and powdery mildew, under two pruning treatments. The whole-field sanitation practice {{was performed by}} removal of infected fallen leaves. Treatment effects on phytotoxicity and yield were also determined. Pruning significantly reduced leaf scab incidence but only on the more scab-susceptible Idared. Pruning significantly reduced mil- dew incidence in most years and on both cultivars but the more mildew- susceptible Jonathan showed significantly higher mildew incidence than Idared. Among products approved for organic production, the best scab control was achieved with a potassium mono- or bicarbonate treatment combined with wettable sulfur, except for Jonathan in 2011 on leaf and in 2014 on both leaf and fruit, and for Idared in 2013 on fruit. The best mildew control was also achieved with potassium mono- or bicar- bonate treatments combined with wettable sulfur, with exceptions on shoots of Idared in 2011 and 2013 and on fruit of Idared in 2012. Leaf phytotoxicity was significantly higher in all potassium carbonate treat- ments compared with untreated plots, except for Idared in 2012, while <b>fruit</b> <b>russet</b> in these treatments {{did not differ significantly}} from the un- treated plots.

40|$|In a field {{experiment}} conducted over two growing seasons, the effectiveness and phytotoxicity of inorganic fungicides such as sulphur, lime sulphur, copper, silicon and Armicarb (a new formulation of potassium bicarbonate) was compared with {{water for the}} control of primary apple scab infections in Belgium on high, medium and low scab-susceptible cultivars (cvs. ‘Pinova’, ‘Pirouette’ and ‘Reinette des Capucins’, respectively). In order to drastically {{reduce the amount of}} fungicide applied in the orchard, two approaches were used: (i) a strategy involving spraying during the infection process, just before conditions for infection had been fulfilled according to the RIMpro software warning system; and (ii) a tunnel sprayer machine for treatment applications. Under field conditions that were highly favourable for disease, low rates of elemental sulphur (31. 8 and 38. 6 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in 2005 and 2006, respectively) combined with low rates of copper (2. 1 kg ha- 1 year- 1 in both years) provided the best scab control and reduced its severity on the fruits of cv. ‘Pinova’ by 97 and 98 % compared with water control in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Lime sulphur was much more effective than wettable sulphur and appeared to be efficient at temperatures below 10 °C, but its effectiveness against apple scab decreased if the treatments were applied 12 – 24 h later than in the ‘during-infection’ spray strategy. Armicarb used alone significantly reduced apple scab severity on the leaves and fruits of the three cultivars compared with water control. Its effectiveness was as good as wettable sulphur applied using the same timing and dosage. Silicon reduced apple scab on fruits very slightly, but not on leaves. The amounts of wettable sulphur, lime sulphur, copper, silicon and potassium bicarbonate used in this experiment to control apple scab were not phytotoxic, did not increase <b>fruit</b> <b>russet,</b> did increase the yield of each cultivar and did not affect summer density of the beneficial Typhlodromus pyri.
