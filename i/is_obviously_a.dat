25|$|A simple {{example of}} such a problem is to find the curve of {{shortest}} length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, where the optical length depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least action.|$|E
25|$|Climate, {{especially}} temperature, <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> {{factor in}} determining distributions of northern flora. Halliday and Brown (1943) suggested that white spruce’s northern limit corresponds “very closely” with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10°C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean net radiation especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).|$|E

25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical frame members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E

[...] Kathy Parsons of MainlyPiano states that [...] "Joseph <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> very versatile musician, {{and there are a}} lot of influences and musical styles that meld together to make Paint the Sky an exceptional musical experience." [...] Michael Debbage of MainlyPiano writes that Paint the Sky represents Joseph’s most complete recording since his landmark album Rapture.

500|$|The {{injury to}} Larwood's foot {{meant that he}} {{scarcely}} bowled for Nottinghamshire in 1933. However, such was his drawing power that the county continued to play him as a batsman until mid-July, when his unfitness prematurely ended his season. Meanwhile, on 28 April the Australian Board had unilaterally adopted a regulation that specifically outlawed bodyline bowling in Australia; MCC's initial response was to declare this law impractical, but as {{the events of the}} season unfolded they modified their stance. The ICC meeting on 31 July produced no immediate resolution, but did elicit a verbal promise from the MCC that bodyline would not be used in the projected 1934 tour by the Australians. In exchanges of telegrams with the Australian Board, the MCC still contrived to avoid a specific commitment, while emphasising that they had [...] "always agreed that a form of bowling which <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> direct attack by the bowler upon the batsman would be an offence against the spirit of the game". On that basis, the Australian Board agreed to the 1934 tour.|$|E
500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E
