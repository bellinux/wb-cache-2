40|$|Current {{residence}} time distribution models for counter-rotating extruders are mainly developed for fully filled machines. However, in practical situations, these extruders operate under starved conditions. To overcome this missing {{link in the}} current models, this paper describes the average <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> in the situation of starvation. This <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> {{is determined by the}} length over which the extruder is fully filled and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> in the partially filled zone. The comparison of the experiments with the theory shows that the existing theory underestimates the length of the fully filled zone by about 30 %. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> in the partially filled zone is well predicted by taking into account all non-pressure driven leakage flows. ...|$|E

40|$|After the {{polymerisation}} reaction different {{low molecular}} solvents {{remain in the}} polymer. They are separated from the polymer during a degassing step. Because of the high viscosity of the polymers machines with rotating devices like extruders are used for the degassing step. For the design and the economic instigation of these machines {{it is necessary to}} calculate the flow field and the mass transfer in the degassing section. In the experimental part of the work the mass transfer is investigated. A bench-scale unit and a corotating twin-screw extruder are used. The barrel walls of the machines are transparent in order to observe the flow field. The mass transfer takes place out of polymer films which are permanently renewed. In the rotating screw channel of the extruder a melt pool is formed in front of the screw, at the barrel wall thin films are formed. In the polymer melt bubble can be nucleated, the polymer can foam. The influence of different parameters on the efficiency of the degassing is investigated.

Observations of inhomogeneous extinction of bands under crossed polars, show the opening direction across the vein. The ion content of the fluid inclusion that {{find their way into}} the interstice are controlled by low frequency and temperature. Microthermometric data on primary inclusions indicate that there are two main types of fluids: partly aqueous (CO 2 -rich) fluid, and aqueous (H 2 O- rich,) fluid.

The RR of SG reindeer contained mainly grasses, while grasses dominated in NS reindeer and woody plants and lichens in NW reindeer. Mean ruminal plant cell-wall contents (CWC) comprised 37 % of organic dry matter (OM) in SG reindeer and 50 and 69 % in NS and NW reindeer, respectively. The high CWC in NW reindeer was due to high intake of lichens containing as much as 45 % hemi-cellulose. Mean ruminal content of lignin was as low as 5 % of OM in SG reindeer, which was different (P < 0. 05) from NS (14 %) and NW reindeer (15 %), respectively. The mean total gastro-inresrinal tract (GIT) (fill and tissue) weight was 27 % of BM in SG reindeer, different (P < 0. 05) from NS (18 % of BM) and NW reindeer (22 % of BM), respectively. Wet weight RR content was 14. 5 % of BM in SG reindeer, not different from NS (12. 2 % of BM) and NW reindeer (14. 2 % of BM). The ratio between the wet weight content of the distal fermentation chamber (DFC) and the RR wet weight content was 1 : 10 in SG reindeer, different (P < 0. 05) from NS (1 : 14) and NW reindeer (1 : 14).

Using Mn 2 + as a Ca 2 + surrogate for plasma membrane Ca 2 + channels, we found that Mn 2 + uptake by rat thymocytes is inversely related to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> the intracellular Ca 2 + stores. This store-dependent plasma membrane permeability is inhibited by oxygen scavenging, CO, imidazole antimycotics and other cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors.

Several calmodulin antagonists, both phenothiazinic (trifluoperazine, fluphenazine and chlorpromazine) and dibenzodiazepinic (clozapine), accelerate Mn 2 + uptake by cells with Ca 2 (+) -filled stores, and this effect is prevented by imidazole antimycotics. Our results suggest that cytochrome P- 450 may be the link between the stores and the plasma membrane Ca 2 + pathway. We propose a model in which this cytochrome, sited at the stores, stimulates plasma membrane Ca 2 + influx. This stimulatory effect is, in turn, prevented by the presence of Ca 2 + inside the stores, possibly via a calmodulin-dependent mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Co-rotating twin-screw {{extruders}} {{are unique}} and versatile machines {{that are used}} widely in the plastics and food processing industries. Due to {{the large number of}} operating variables and design parameters available for manipulation and the complex interactions between them, it cannot be claimed that these extruders are currently being optimally utilised. The most significant improvement to the field of twin-screw extrusion would be through the provision of a generally applicable dynamic process model that is both computationally inexpensive and accurate. This would enable product design, process optimisation and process controller design to be performed cheaply and more thoroughly on a computer than can currently be achieved through experimental trials. This thesis is divided into three parts: dynamic modelling, measurement and control. The first part outlines the development of a dynamic model of the extrusion process which satisfies the above mentioned criteria. The dynamic model predicts quasi- 3 D spatial profiles of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill,</b> pressure, temperature, specific mechanical energy input and concentrations of inert and reacting species in the extruder. The individual material transport models which constitute the dynamic model are examined closely for their accuracy and computational efficiency by comparing candidate models amongst themselves and against full 3 D finite volume flow models. Several new modelling approaches are proposed {{in the course of this}} investigation. The dynamic model achieves a high degree of simplicity and flexibility by assuming a slight compressibility in the process material, allowing the pressure to be calculated directly from the degree of over-fill in each model element using an equation of state. Comparison of the model predictions with dynamic temperature, pressure and residence time distribution data from an extrusion cooking process indicates a good predictive capability. The model can perform dynamic step-change calculations for typical screw configurations in approximately 30 seconds on a 600 MHz Pentium 3 personal computer. The second part of this thesis relates to the measurement of product quality attributes of extruded materials. A digital image processing technique for measuring the bubble size distribution in extruded foams from cross sectional images is presented. It is recognised that this is an important product quality attribute, though difficult to measure accurately with existing techniques. The present technique is demonstrated on several different products. A simulation study of the formation mechanism of polymer foams is also performed. The measurement of product quality attributes such as bulk density and hardness in a manner suitable for automatic control is also addressed. This is achieved through the development of an acoustic sensor for inferring product attributes using the sounds emanating from the product as it leaves the extruder. This method is found to have good prediction ability on unseen data. The third and final part of this thesis relates to the automatic control of product quality attributes using multivariable model predictive controllers based on both direct and indirect control strategies. In the given case study, indirect control strategies, which seek to regulate the product quality attributes through the control of secondary process indicators such as temperature and pressure, are found to cause greater deviations in product quality than taking no corrective control action at all. Conversely, direct control strategies are shown to give tight control over the product quality attributes, provided that appropriate product quality sensors or inferential estimation techniques are available...|$|E

It was deformed by {{the regional}} polyphase Caledonian D 1 -D 3 ductile deformation and a weaker D 4 phase, that comprised essentially minor crenulation and normal faulting. The S 2 foliation dominates, and {{was accompanied by}} chlorite-zone, greenschist facies metamorphism and formation of Caledonian quartz veins. Intrusion of Tertiary mafic dykes, {{has given rise to}} modifications of Caledonian vein quartz microstructure and the characteristics of trapped fluid inclusions. Three groups of veins: (1) Caledonian quartz + chlorite + muscovite veins (VI), and (2) quartz (chlorite + muscovite) veins (V 2), mostly concordant with regional Caledonian S 2 foliation and cut by mafic dykes, and (3) post- Caledonian dolomite + calcite quartz veins parallel to sub-parallel to the dykes, occur. By petrographic analysis in a series of traverses (0 - 150 cm) away from dykes of varying width (up to 5 m) the veins are shown to contain medium (0. 5 - 2 mm) to coarse (> 2 mm) recrystallized equigranular quartz that becomes more equant nearer to the dykes. Close to dykes the quartz shows a bimodal grain-size distribution and linear fluid inclusion arrays that define healed micro-cracks. Two fluid inclusion populations (Types A & B) are defined based on their nature and occurrence. These are: Type A; isolated inclusions (Al) in clean quartz cores, and inclusion clusters (A 2) along grain boundaries representing the initial fluid inclusion populations in the veins. (2) Type B; mostly short, straight intracrystalline trails that represent the secondary fluid inclusion populations. Both populations are aqueous fluids of very low salinity (1. 65 - 5 wt% NaCl equivalent). They are dominantly 5 - 10 m in size and inclusions ^O!!! are uncommon. The Type A inclusions re-equilibrated at approximately 250 C (219 - 298 C) and Type B at 150 C (116 - 200 C) under 0. 19 - 2. 17 kb hydrostatic pressure and have experienced systematic post-entrapment modifications with increasing proximity to dykes. Intrusion-related static recrystallization occurs and the zone affected varies systematically with dyke thickness. The mean distance of vein overheating to cause fluid inclusion modification is about 5 cm from the vein-dyke contacts for thin dykes (lm thick). Of Type A inclusions > 12 m diameter, 80 - 100 % decrepitated between 0 - 30 cm in veins intercepted by 100 C), cause overpressuring > 1. 0 kb and induce decrepitation of inclusions in the zone. For veins intruded by 2 m and 5 m thick dykes the width of the zone is 0 - 70 cm and 0 - 160 cm respectively. This zone represents the maximum width of the veins significantly affected by heat-induced recrystallization and modification of fluid inclusions. It is established that fluid inclusion leakage is systematic and quantifiable in response to heat-induced overpressure due to dyke intrusion. Large- (> 12 m) and medium-size (5 - 12 m) inclusions leaked and deformed from irregular and ellipsoidal to polygonal forms close to the vein-dyke contact. The leakage produces a decrease in density and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fill</b> of early-formed fluid inclusions. This produces a spread of homogenization temperature (Th) values to higher T, such that careful interpretation is needed to avoid serious underestimate of trapping pressures (Pt).

The water changes the intensity of the SAXS in a way that depends on how the pores are filled. With wetting liquids such as hexane, a pseudo binary model can be assumed in which pore-filling in reciprocal space q is described by a density function p(q). For water, clusters develop, even in the most oxidized carbon, creating a fully ternary system. In the Porod scattering region, however, the final slope is insensitive to the liquid-vapour interfaces. In this region, for the less oxidized samples, p(q) shows reasonable agreement with the adsorption isotherms.

Raman spectroscopic scans to determine the N- 2 /O- 2 ratios on different planes through a clathrate, in which the two axes of the scans are perpendicular to each other, give no indication of fractionation effects on the N- 2 /O- 2 concentrations within a clathrate specimen. The frequency shift of the N- 2 and O- 2 peaks due to decomposition of a clathrate to an air bubble is shown qualitatively. From their peak integrals there is no indication of different retransformation rates to air bubbles between the oxygen and the nitrogen contents of clathrates. In air bubbles resulting from clathrate decomposition, the N- 2 /O- 2 ratio shows similar values to those observed in clathrates and present atmospheric values.

40|$|The {{transport}} of a two-component gas mixture in subnanometer channels is investigated theoretically for an arbitrary <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> channels. Special {{attention is paid}} to consistent inclusion of density effects, which are associated both with the interaction and with a finite size of particles. The analysis is carried out using the hard-sphere model, in which the interaction is manifested as the effective (dynamic) attraction of particles, leading to their correlation. The adsorption isotherm is calculated and the ground state of the mixture in one-dimensional channels is investigated. It is shown, using the density functional method, that the two-component mixture in channels with increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> is transformed into a spatially inhomogeneous state. This gives rise to short-lived clusters with size and lifetime increasing with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> channel <b>filling.</b> The description <b>of</b> transport in subnanometer channels is reduced in this case to the description of diffusion in a spatially inhomogeneous high-density one-dimensional system. The {{transport of}} particles in a medium with short-lived clusters occurs as a collective effect of the barrier-free transfer of density excitation. It is shown that, for high fill factors, the two-component mixture acquires a new property: clusters with a definite size are stabilized in channels due to effective attraction emerging between particles. The lifetime of formed clusters increases exponentially in accordance with the Arrhenius law; at a low temperature, channels with such clusters might be blocked to transport of particles of the mixture. The dependences of fluxes on the mixture composition (<b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling)</b> and pressure obtained theoretically are in good agreement with the experimentally observed regularities.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of the crystal chemistry of the halotrichite group XAl 2 (SO 4) 4 · 22 H 2 O along the joints of the X = Fe-Mg-Mn-Zn compositional tetrahedron by means of X-ray powder diffraction and the Rietveld method on synthetic samples. Complete solid solution along the joints has been observed. The volume vs. plot (mean ionic radius of the X cation) indicate fairly large departures from the expected linearity. The reason/s of the departure from linearity is, at present, not clearly understood and could be possibly related to the combined effect <b>of</b> the different <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> the d shell of the transition elements, the corresponding attraction/ repulsion with the five facing lone pairs of the water molecules pertaining to the XO(H 2 O) 5 octahedron, and to the different <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> ionicity of the X-O bond. © 2006 E.

40|$|The {{study by}} Planche et al. [1] {{provides}} important new information addressing intracellular volume depletion {{in children with}} severe childhood malaria, but {{does not address the}} question of whether intravascular volume depletion (hypovolemic shock) is present. Using sophisticated methodology to determine total body water and extracellular water, they demonstrate a 6. 7 % deficit in total body water and an 11. 7 % deficit of intracellular water, providing an important indication of the volumes of fluid that may be required to optimize hydration. The data, however, do not address the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> the intravascular compartment, nor should they be used to answer the question about the state of tissue and organ perfusion.

40|$|AbstractProblematic rock {{classification}} criteria used in civil engineering require correction. Particular {{attention should be}} paid to frost resistance test methods and criteria of acceptable absorption levels. The classification of frost resistance levels may be incorrect due to insufficient number of freeze-thaw cycles, and the criterion of rock absorption is inaccurate. Based {{on the results of}} research completed to date, the authors conclude that all rocks with capillary volumetric absorption below 0. 6 % are highly frost resistant, regardless of their origin. All rocks with capillary volumetric absorption above 1. 5 % are not frost resistant {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. Rocks with capillary volumetric absorption between 0. 6 % and 1. 5 % may show both low and high frost resistance. This group of rocks is characterized in this article. The structural features compared include mineralogical composition (derivatography and X-ray analysis), appearance and size of crystallite (analysis with an optical microscope, and SEM). The texture features evaluated include total porosity, pore size distribution MIP, capillary water absorption, vacuum absorption, and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> the pores with water. It has been found that increasing the number of freeze-thaw cycles allows better assessment of the rock's potential durability. The capillary water absorption in combination with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> the pores can be an effective durability indicator for use in the classification of rock construction products...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in present-day hydrological sciences is {{to enhance the}} performance of existing distributed hydrological models through a better description of subgrid processes, in particular the subgrid connectivity of flow paths. The Relative Surface Connection (RSC) function was proposed by Antoine et al. (2009) as a functional indicator of runoff flow connectivity. For a given area, it expresses {{the percentage of the}} surface connected to the outflow boundary (C) as a function <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> the depression storage. This function explicitly integrates the flow network at the soil surface and hence provides essential information regarding the flow paths' connectivity. It has been shown that this function could help improve the modeling of the hydrograph at the square meter scale, yet it is unknown how the scale affects the RSC function, and whether and how it can be extrapolated to other scales. The main objective of this research is to study the scale effect on overland flow connectivity (RSC function). For this purpose, digital elevation data of a real field (9 &times; 3 m) and three synthetic fields (6 &times; 6 m) with contrasting hydrological responses were used, and the RSC function was calculated at different scales by changing the length (l) or width (w) of the field. To different extents depending on the microtopography, border effects were observed for the smaller scales when decreasing l or w, which resulted in a strong decrease or increase of the maximum depression storage, respectively. There was no scale effect on the RSC function when changing w, but a remarkable scale effect was observed in the RSC function when changing l. In general, for a given <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> the depression storage, C decreased as l increased, the change in C being inversely proportional to the change in l. However, this observation applied only up to approx. 50 – 70 % (depending on the hydrological response of the field) <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> depression storage, after which no correlation was found between C and l. The results of this study help identify the minimal scale to study overland flow connectivity. At scales larger than the minimal scale, the RSC function showed a great potential to be extrapolated to other scales...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of opal-ZnO composites is studied by {{transmission electron microscopy}} and X-ray phase analysis. It is shown that, under thermal treatment of infiltrated samples, a solid-phase reaction proceeds at the opal-ZnO interface. As a result, zinc silicate beta-Zn 2 SiO 4 and its high-temperature phase, willemite Zn 2 SiO 4, are formed. The structure and emission properties of the nanocomposite are studied {{in relation to the}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling.</b> For a sample subjected to 25 cycles <b>of</b> <b>filling,</b> luminescence controlled by the beta-Zn 2 SiO 4 phase is detected in the blue spectral region (at 430 nm).
