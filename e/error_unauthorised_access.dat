Despite major advances in addressing this clearly using formal models, {{there is still a}} need for a more robust formulation, especially incorporating strict guidelines on assignment of access rights and how to perform such tasks as delegation of access rights. In this respect, this paper proposes a precise mathematical framework, capable of considering important factors such as the relative security risks posed by different access operations when performed by different users. This is based on a novel concept of a security risk ordering relation on such tasks, to be established by a detailed independent risk assessment process. In the case of lack of information on security risks, the approach makes conservative assumptions, thus forcing the security analyst to re-assess such situations if he disagrees with this default interpretation. The risk ordering relation is central to a security-orientated definition of role hierarchies and a security-risk minimising strategy to role delegation. ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} (WLANs) have enjoyed a {{rapid increase in}} usage in recent years. WLANs serve to connect users to the Internet by means of radio or infrared frequencies. The rise in WLAN usage has however served to highlight some of the inadequacies of the present laws governing <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> to WLANs. At present, the legislation serves to make <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access,</b> modification or impairment of electronic communications illegal. It {{is clear that the}} provisions prohibit the hacking of computer systems and denial of service attacks. However, it is unclear whether the legislation extends to additional forms of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> such as wardriving (using software to identify and map freely available WLAN) and joyriding (accessing a network with no further damage to the connection). The liability of Internet Service Providers and those engaged in <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> in public places also remains unclear. Finally, the relationship of the offence of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> to the tort of trespass and the laws of copyright remain untested. The objective {{of this paper is to}} consider the measures necessary to increase the effectiveness of WLAN laws. The paper will begin by considering the nature of WLAN technology and the policy discourse to date. This will be followed by an examination of the present Australian law and an identification of areas of uncertainty. Finally, the paper will consider the measures required to enhance the certainty and effectiveness of the laws governing <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> to WLAN. 7 page(s...|$|R

Realising the numerous benefits of the system, EHR adoption is growing globally and many countries invest heavily in electronic health systems. In Australia, the Government invested $ 467 million to build key components of the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR) system in July 2012. However, in the last three years, the uptake from individuals and health care providers has not been satisfactory. <b>Unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> of the PCEHR was one of the major barriers. We propose an improved access control model for the PCEHR system to resolve the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> issue. We discuss the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>access</b> issue with real examples and present a potential solution to overcome the issue to make the PCEHR system a success in Australia...|$|R

These privacy safeguards are in addition to pre-existing obligations, pursuant to clause 4.6.3 of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code (C628:2012), which stipulate that service providers must have 'robust procedures to keep its Customers' Personal Information in its possession secure and restrict access to personnel who are authorised by the Supplier'.|$|R
