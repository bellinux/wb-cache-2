40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} in the recent theoretical literature that both macroeconomic and individual bank weaknesses, in terms of asset risk and capital structures, {{have to be taken}} into account when explaining systemic banking crises, which are characterized by significant bank failures and <b>deposit</b> <b>runs.</b> To date, there is little cross-country empirical evidence at the bank level for Emerging Markets on the role of individual bank weaknesses in contributing to both bank failures and <b>deposit</b> <b>runs.</b> This paper analyzes recent episodes of systemic banking crisis in Emerging Markets during the nineties using bank-level data in order to test two fundamental questions. First, did bank failures reflect the relative weaknesses of certain banks in the face of common asset-value shocks? Second, did <b>deposit</b> <b>runs</b> cause relatively healthy institutions to fail? or did <b>deposit</b> <b>runs</b> during these crises periods reflect an act of market discipline of weaker banks? The main conclusions for East Asia and Latin America are that failed banks were relatively weak prior to the onset of the crisis, in terms of asset risk and capital structures, so that bank failures were not importantly random, and that depositors attempted to sort among ex-ante solvent and ex-ante insolvent banks in the context of shocks on the value of bank’s assets...|$|R

40|$|Seylan Bank PLC, {{the sixth}} largest {{commercial}} bank in Sri Lanka, faced a <b>deposit</b> <b>run</b> {{towards the end}} of December 2008. This was a severe blow to the Sri Lankan financial system because no other commercial bank in the country had suffered a similar situation in the past. Since this distress occurred along with the US subprime crisis, it was often presumed that Seylan Bank failure was directly attributable to the crisis. This paper sheds a light on the Seylan Bank’s profitability and financial stability over the period from 2004 to 2008 while exploring its links with other financial institutions to investigate the causes of distress. The evidence suggests that the Seylan Bank distress was mainly resulted from the long standing management deficiencies prevailed in the bank rather than due to direct effects of the US subprime crisis. Failure of the Golden Key Credit Card Company Ltd. can be directly attributed to the crisis. The resulting contagion effects have triggered the distress in the bank which was already vulnerable to an external shock even though severe issues in the fundamentals of the bank could not be observed. The findings of the study emphasize the neces-sity of a dynamic regulatory framework and measures to increase the financial literacy among the public to maintain a satisfactory level of financial system stability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to distinguish between di¤erent theories of bank runs. Our method identi…es bank runs from raw deposit market data, while controlling for the e¤ects of alternative shocks. We construct hypothesis tests, conditional on bank runs, which quantify the role of panic-induced deposit withdrawals {{as well as the}} extent to which withdrawals are based on information. We provide an application for the Russian deposit market. The method identi…es one severe bank run. Information external to the model con…rms the timing of the run. We …nd evidence in favor of both the panic and the information-based views of bank runs. In particular, panic e¤ects induce signi…cant runs at solvent banks with uninsured deposits, relative to banks whose deposits are insured. In addition, insolvent banks face runs that are four times as harsh, which establishes the signi…cance of information-based theories. In the aggregate, panic accounts for almost 90 % of the <b>deposit</b> <b>run,</b> while information is responsible for the remaining 10 %. The fact that, in our application, both the panic and fundamentals view exert e¤ects has strong policy implications. While market discipline adds to the stability of the deposit market, it does not eliminate the possibility of panic runs. Our approach builds on structural identi…cation techniques frequently used in macroeconomics. We extend these time-series methods by extracting information from cross-sectional heterogeneity. We show that such information is very useful for identifying structural shocks, cross-validating the model and extracting testable implications. The method can easily be extended to apply to alternative types of shocks, as well as other markets...|$|E

Bank runs seem to usually be information based. For example, improvements in bank transparency such as new accounting rules can reveal a bank’s insolvency and trigger a run. However, bank runs, as seen {{a few years ago}} in East Asia, Bulgaria and Russia, may also be accompanied by runs on national currencies. We include a bank run model that shows a bank may issue liquid demand <b>deposits</b> and avoid <b>runs</b> without <b>deposit</b> insurance as long as it also issues less liquid time <b>deposits.</b> Self-fulfilling <b>runs</b> are prevented through elimination of the maturity mismatch. The well-known Diamond & Dybvig (1983) model is modified to account for depositors’ risk affinities, whereby high-risk depositors hold their savings as demand deposits and low-risk depositors prefer time deposits. These deposit choices transfer liquidity optimally from low-risk to high-risk depositors who value liquidity. By exploiting these choices, a bank can improve its intertemporal risk-sharing by issuing deposits of varying degrees of liquidity. This maturity transformation does not necessarily raise the economy’s total liquidity. ansition economies; bank panics; bank regulation; financial crises...|$|R
