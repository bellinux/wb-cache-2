500|$|In November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever. On {{the subject}} of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, [...] "My father wrote her a formal letter {{inviting}} her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her house ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous.</b> In the note he enclosed a pin which she was to wear if she accepted the invitation. The next day she had the pin on." [...] In 1958, when Rice was sixteen, her father moved the family to north Texas, purchasing their first home in Richardson. Rice first met her future husband, Stan Rice, in a journalism class while they were both students at Richardson High School.|$|E
500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. Iâ€™ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
2500|$|At first , we {{were called}} Force. I {{think we had}} gotten that name from a UFO album, {{but there was also}} a band called Rising Force with Yngwie Malmsteen. And then I thought, 'We should move up. We should do {{something}} else.' That night, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> telling them I thought it should be Europe. They got so quiet after I told them. But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album is}} DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, {{following}} {{a period of}} drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute I stepped into the studio <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous,</b> but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous,</b> and {{so ashamed}} that I {{accepted}} my strange escort without inquiry or remonstrance. He helped me, with remarkable politeness {{for a common}} policeman, across to the Custom House, where I sat waiting for my luggage. Reporters and sightseers, meanwhile, pressed obtrusively around me. My protector held them back. I was half wild with embarrassment. I'm naturally a reserved and somewhat sensitive girl, and this American publicity made me crimson with bashfulness.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} bit creepy all alone on the wharf that night. I don't deny it. Twice I thought I 'eard {{something}} coming up on tip-toe behind me. The second time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that I began to sing to keep my spirits up, and I went on singing till three of the hands of the Susan Emily, wot was lying alongside, came up from the fo'c'sle and offered to fight me. I was thankful when daylight came.|$|E
60|$|I cordially assented. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> very <b>nervous,</b> that <b>I</b> {{had already}} lighted the Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged {{to blow it}} out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good.' Mr. Snitchey {{wiped his}} {{forehead}} again. 'It's a great relief. <b>I</b> haven't <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> since we've <b>been</b> in partnership. [...] I intend {{to spend the}} evening now, Mr. Craggs.' ...|$|R

Barbara <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{calm and}} resolute, that--that--" [...] Was Lady Jane really going to regret {{anything}} in her sister? She did not say it, however; but Kate heard her sigh, and add, [...] "Ah, well! if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> stronger, perhaps we could make her happier; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous.</b> <b>I</b> must try not to look distressed when her spirits do break out, for perhaps it is only natural. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> sorry to have brought all this on her, and spoilt those poor children's pleasure!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Isn't she a wonder, Bertie?' he said, devoutly. 'I hadn't {{a notion}} {{she was going}} to be there. She's playing at the Auditorium this week, and she can only just have had time to get back to her matinee. She risked being late, just to come and see me through. She's my good angel, Bertie. She saved me. If she hadn't helped me out I don't know what would have happened. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> I didn't know what I was doing. Now that I've got through the first show I shall be all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor can I imagine. I {{shall be}} a riot. I know {{just the sort}} of stuff that's needed--simple, manly, optimistic stuff {{straight}} from the shoulder. This shoulder," [...] said Gussie, tapping. [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> this morning I can't imagine. For anything simpler than distributing a few footling books to a bunch of grimy-faced kids I can't imagine. Still, for some reason I can't imagine, I was feeling a little nervous, but now I feel fine, Bertie--fine, fine, fine--and I say this to you as an old friend. Because that's what you are, old man, when all the smoke has cleared away--an old friend. I don't think I've ever met an older friend. How long have you been an old friend of mine, Bertie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous,</b> Diana. When Mr. Allan {{called out}} my name I really cannot tell how I ever {{got up on}} that platform. I felt as if a million eyes were {{looking at me and}} through me, and for one dreadful moment I was sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never {{have been able to get}} through. Did I groan all right?" ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{half a mile}} {{along the}} beach I became aware {{of one of my}} three Beast Folk {{advancing}} out of the landward bushes towards me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> now <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> with my own imaginings that I immediately drew my revolver. Even the propitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm me. He hesitated as he approached.|$|R
6000|$|DEAR MR. TRENT,--We {{had such}} sad {{news from the}} Hall after you left. Sir William was seized {{with a kind of}} fit. It appears that he had just {{returned}} from the horse show, and had given his mare to the groom while he walked to the garden entrance. The groom saw him turn at the yew hedge, and was driving to the stables when he heard a queer kind of cry, and turning back to the garden front, found poor Sir William lying on the ground in convulsions. The doctor was sent for, and Mr. Brunton and I went over to the Hall. The doctor thinks it was something like a stroke, but he is not certain, and Sir William is quite delirious, and doesn't recognize anybody. I gathered from the groom that he had been DRINKING HEAVILY. Perhaps it was well that you did not see him, but I thought you ought to know what had happened in case you came down again. It's all very dreadful, and I wonder if that is why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> all the afternoon. It may have been a kind of presentiment. Don't you think so? ...|$|E
60|$|The city looked doleful. Although it was {{not very}} early in the morning, there were very few people about. Some men could be seen on the decks of the vessels at the wharves, and a big steamer for one of the {{northern}} ports was getting up steam. I could not help thinking how happy the people must be who were going away in her. On one of the piers near where we were going to stop--we were coming in now--were a few darkey boys, sitting on a wharf-log, and dangling their bare feet over the water. I wondered how they dared laugh, and be so jolly. In a few minutes Corny must be wakened. On a post, near these boys, a lounger sat fishing with a long pole,--actually fishing away as if there were no sorrows and deaths, or shipwrecked or broken-hearted people in the world. I was particularly angry at this man--and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that all sorts of things made me angry--because he was old enough to know better, and because he looked like such a fool. He had on green trousers, dirty canvas shoes and no stockings, a striped linen coat, and an old straw hat, which lopped down over his nose. One of the men called to him to catch the line which he was about to throw on the wharf, but he paid no attention, and a negro boy came and caught the line. The man actually had a bite, and couldn't take his eyes from the cork. I wished the line had hit him and knocked him off the post.|$|E
60|$|The elation and the {{excitement}} of the previous night had burnt away, and a chilling reaction followed. I was very hungry, for I had had no dinner before starting, and chocolate, though it sustains, does not satisfy. I had scarcely slept, but yet my heart beat so fiercely and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> and perplexed about the future that I could not rest. I thought of all the chances that lay against me; I dreaded and detested more than words can express the prospect of being caught and dragged back to Pretoria. I do not mean that I would rather have died than have been retaken, but I have often feared death for much less. I found no comfort in any of the philosophical ideas which some men parade in their hours of ease and strength and safety. They seemed only fair-weather friends. I realised with awful force that no exercise of my own feeble wit and strength could save me from my enemies, and that without the assistance of that High Power which interferes in the eternal sequence of causes and effects more often than we are always prone to admit, I could never succeed. I prayed long and earnestly for help and guidance. My prayer, as it seems to me, was swiftly and wonderfully answered, I cannot now relate the strange circumstances which followed, and which changed my nearly hopeless position into one of superior advantage. But after the war is over I shall hope to lengthen this account, and so remarkable will the addition be that I cannot believe the reader will complain.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{touched by}} your petit mot. De gros mots {{seem to me}} to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> much more {{applicable}} to my fallen state. The only thing that can be said for it is that it <b>is</b> not <b>so</b> low as it may perhaps be to-morrow--after the vulgar ordeal of to-night. Let me therefore profit by the few remaining hours of a recognizable status to pretend to an affectionate reciprocity. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> yours and your wife's while yet <b>I</b> may <b>be.</b> After 11 o'clock to-night <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> the world's--you know--and <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> the undertaker's. <b>I</b> count upon you both to spend this evening in fasting, silence and supplication. I will send you a word in the morning--wire you if <b>I</b> can--if there <b>is</b> anything at all to boast of. My hopes rest solely on intrinsic charms--the adventitious graces of art are not [...] "in it." [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that <b>I</b> miswrite and misspell. Pity your infatuated but not presumptuous friend, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it doesn't come in there," [...] Bathurst laughed. [...] "Morally <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>nervous</b> <b>so</b> far as I know, {{physically}} <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> {{would give}} a great deal if I could get over it, but, as I have said, it is constitutional." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, you dear Agnes," [...] Ada said, almost crying on my neck, [...] "don't {{be angry}} with me; but <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous,</b> though <b>I</b> knew you would say 'no.' Still, it must require so much courage to refuse a nobleman; I know I never could;" [...] and so she went on till she coaxed me into a good humour again, and we talked {{a long time before}} we went to bed. And so my gaieties ended, and next morning, bidding adieu to Ada and Lady Desborough, who was very gracious, and even kissed me, I started for Canterbury, under charge of a lady who was going down, and whom I met by {{arrangement}} on the platform of the station.|$|R

5000|$|Stevens {{joined the}} cast of Neighbours soon after taking part in Young Talent Time. The actor was {{required}} to complete one screen test and soon secured the role. Stevens was contracted until December 1989. Stevens' first scene consisted of Nick trying to find his stolen Walkman. He told a reporter from Fast Forward that he was terrified prior to filming, adding [...] "I stood outside with my knees knocking. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> I went to the toilet 60 times!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{another letter}} to Cutolo's sister, Rosetta, he used even {{stronger}} words while describing about his project: [...] "My dearest comare, regarding this crawling vermin (the traitors), be confident. I {{will give you}} full satisfaction. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that my own liver rotted {{because i did not}} have a chance yet to meet and greet these scumbags. I am telling you: be calm. I will take care of them {{with the help of the}} people who love the prince (Cutolo) for life and death." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>so</b> chanced that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in {{the upper}} room trying to gain {{some idea of the}} time, when there came two sharp raps on the shutter through which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> peering, and <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> had I become that I cried aloud in fear, darting back to the trap-door, {{positive}} that none other than a lobster back or a Tory could be thus striving to attract our attention.|$|R
60|$|As {{the last}} day passed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> filled with <b>nervous</b> {{agitation}} that I could not control myself, but ran ceaselessly about my cell, like a mouse in a cage. Every moment I thought that the warder would detect the looseness of the bar, or that the sentry would observe the unmortared stone, which I could not conceal outside, as I did within. As for my companion, he sat brooding upon {{the end of his}} bed, looking at me in a sidelong fashion from time to time, and biting his nails like one who is deep in thought.|$|R
5000|$|Tom {{recruited}} {{friend and}} comic Rich Hall {{to accompany him}} and help with finding humor {{in the third world}} surroundings.

[...] "I can tell you about Dien Bien Phu and the French getting their {behinds} kicked and General Giap. I didn't want to look like Pauly Shore walking around a college campus. I wanted to know everything".|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{were a lot}} {{of nerves}} that third night, a lot of nerves. I didnâ€™t sleep well. John came and got me. We went to A & W. He said I was a real basket case. He was almost worried about me before the fourth day. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> the third night I called home and talked to friends for hours, but I guess once I got up and got started then things eased up. Once I started {{shooting}} and got into the rhythm of things, I knew I was ok." ...|$|E
5000|$|On October 9, Always B Miki {{entered the}} Allerage Farms open pace at the Red Mile in Lexington. A one-mile oval with banked turns, the Red Mile {{is known as}} one of the fastest tracks in the sport so a world record was viewed as a possibility.

5000|$|After small {{roles in}} Robert Redford's Quiz Show and Whit Stillman's Barcelona, she {{was cast in}} the 1995 Woody Allen film Mighty Aphrodite. Her {{portrayal}} of a happy-go-lucky prostitute made her a star, winning her an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. While the film garnered Sorvino international notoriety, she described the shooting of the film as extremely stressful: [...] "I was absolutely neurotic doing Mighty Aphrodite," [...] she recalled. [...] "Every night brought a new nervous breakdown. I'd cry and talk to God, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous.</b> Then the next day, I'd show up and do my scenes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ...In {{writing to}} your father (which, however, <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> able to do by this same post) I will tell him a little better what has been {{happening}} to me and why <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> unsociable. This unsociability is in truth all that has been happening--as {{it has been the}} reverse of the medal, so to speak, of the great arrears and urgent applications (to work) that awaited me here after I parted with you. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> working in one way and another with great assiduity, squeezing out my American Book with all desirable deliberation, and yet in a kind of panting dread of the matter of it all melting and fading from me before I have worked it off. It does melt and fade, over here, in the strangest way--and yet I did, I think, while with you, so successfully cultivate the impression and the saturation that even my bare residuum won't be quite a vain thing. I really find in fact that I have more impressions than I know what to do with; so that, evidently, at the rate <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going, <b>I</b> shall have pegged out two distinct volumes instead of one. I have already produced almost the substance of one--which <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> sending to [...] "Harper" [...] and the N.A.R., as per contract; though publication doesn't begin, apparently, in those periodicals till next month. And then (please mention to your Dad) all the time <b>I</b> haven't <b>been</b> doing the American Book, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> revising with extreme minuteness three or four of my early works for the Edition DÃ©finitive (the settlement of some of the details of which seems to be hanging fire a little between my [...] "agent" [...] and my New York publishers; not, however, in a manner to indicate, I think, a real hitch.) Please, however, say nothing whatever, any of you to any one, about the existence of any such plan. These things should be spoken of only when they are in full feather. That for your Dad--I mean the information as well as the warning, in particular; on whom, you see, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> shamelessly working off, after all, a good deal of my letter. Mention to him also that still other tracts of my time, these last silent weeks, have gone, have had to go, toward preparing for a job that I think I mentioned to him while with you--my pledge, already a couple of years old to do a romantical-psychological-pictorial [...] "social" [...] London (of the general form, length, pitch, and [...] "type" [...] of Marion Crawford's Ave Roma Immortalis) for the Macmillans; and <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> feeling <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> of late about the way America has crowded me off it, that I have had, for assuagement of my nerves, to begin, with piety and prayer, some of the very considerable reading the task will require of me.
