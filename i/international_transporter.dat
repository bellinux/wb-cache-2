30|$|Due to the {{critical}} roles of transporters in the ADME of drugs, a variety of drug transporter assays are required by both FDA and EMA prior to testing of a New Chemical/Molecular Entity (NCE/NME). Potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may cause severe, adverse reactions in patients due to alteration in ADME by transporters. Most DDIs via transporters involve, but are not restricted to, the main transporters in drug ADME: P-gp, BCRP, OATP 1 B 1 / 1 B 3, OAT 1 / 3, OCT 1 and OCT 2 (Tweedie et al. 2013).

An <b>international</b> <b>transporter</b> process involves multiple ground pickup and delivery operations, package sorting and palletizing, airport operations and air transport. This paper describes a successful two-machine implementation of a distributed simulation model for an international transportation system in a supply chain network operation using Run Time Infrastructure of High Level Architecture software developed by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, the Distributed Manufacturing Simulation Adapter developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and ARENA simulation tool. By incorporating the capabilities provided by these tools, it was successful to establish the information flow exchange between the machines where one machine houses transporter while the other has suppliers, customers, and distribution centers located in different parts of world. This research tool attempts to facilitate the development of distributed simulations so they can be used to analyze and solve manufacturing related problems...|$|E
40|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Transporter</b> Consortium (ITC) has {{recently}} described seven transporters of particular relevance to drug development. Based {{on the second}} ITC transporter workshop in 2012, we have identified additional transporters of emerging importance in pharmacokinetics, interference of drugs with transport of endogenous compounds, and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in humans. The multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs, gene symbol SLC 47 A) mediate excretion of organic cations into bile and urine. MATEs are important in renal DDIs. Multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs or ABCCs) are drug and conjugate efflux pumps, and impaired activity of MRP 2 results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The bile salt export pump (BSEP or ABCB 11) prevents accumulation of toxic bile salt concentrations in hepatocytes, and BSEP inhibition or deficiency may cause cholestasis and liver injury. In addition, examples are presented on the roles of nucleoside and peptide transporters in drug targeting and disposition...|$|E

While increasing insulin concentrations led to gradual increases {{in both the}} amount of recycling GLUT 4 molecules and cell surface GLUT 4 levels, the kinetics {{of the increase in}} time was independent of insulin concentration. To determine whether there are GLUT 4 subpools that have a distinct insulin sensitivity, adipocytes were consecutively stimulated twice with a low concentration of insulin while recycling GLUT 4 molecules were continuously labeled. This revealed that not the same pool of GLUT 4 molecules was mobilized twice and thus that upon insulin stimulation, GLUT 4 is likely to be recruited at random for insertion within the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceGlutamate <b>transporters</b> are {{operative}} at {{an early}} developmental stage well before synapse formation, but their functional significance has not been determined. We now report that blockade of glutamate transporters in the immature neocortex generates recurrent NMDA receptor-mediated currents associated with synchronous oscillations of [Ca 2 +]i in the entire neuronal population. Intracerebroventricular injections of the blocker to pups generate seizures that are prevented by coinjections of NMDA receptor blockers. Therefore, the early expression of glutamate transporters plays a central role to prevent the activation by local glutamate concentrations of NMDA receptors and the generation of seizures that may alter the construction of cortical networks. A dysfunction of glutamate transporters may be a central event in early infancy epilepsy syndromes...|$|R
30|$|The {{biological}} function of transporters {{has been investigated}} using multiple approaches. Among them, metabolomic studies have been quite valuable for substrate identification of transporters systemically, which identify the alterations of many metabolites or their substrates directly. Alternatively, the uptake of substrate candidates can be evaluated by radio-tracer or radio-free LC/MS quantification. This method was used to identify thiamine and ergothioneine as the physiological substrates of OCT 1 (SLC 22 A 1) and OCTN 1 (SLC 22 A 4) respectively (Chen et al., 2014; Gründemann et al., 2005). Clinically, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have proved a powerful method for identifying disease susceptibility genes. GWASs indicate that genes coding {{for a variety of}} transporters are susceptibility genes for many diseases (Gottesman and Ambudkar, 2001; Stefková et al., 2004; Grisanzio et al., 2012; Suhre et al., 2011; Diabetes Genetics Initiative et al., 2007), suggesting that transporters have important physiological/pathophysiological roles in disease. The function of transporters in drug ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) has been intensively studied {{during the past two decades}} but their physiological roles have been much under studied. There is emerging evidence that understanding the physiological roles of transporters in normal as well as pathophysiological conditions is of great value for the development of new drugs and therapies (the <b>International</b> <b>Transporter</b> Consortium et al., 2010; Mizuno et al., 2003). In this review, we summarize recent progress in the study of physiological roles of transporters, including new methodology in transporter biology, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and drug-endogenous substrate interaction. Finally, we discuss pharmaceutical implications of transporters using the roles of transporters in metabolic diseases as examples.|$|E
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceGlutamate <b>transporters</b> {{catalyze}} concentrative uptake of the neurotransmitter into glial {{cells and}} neurons. Their transport cycle involves binding and {{release of the}} substrate on the extra- and intracellular sides of the plasma membranes and translocation of the substrate-binding site across the lipid bilayers. The energy of the ionic gradients, mainly sodium, fuels the cycle. Here, we used a cross-linking approach to trap a glutamate transporter homolog from Pyrococcus horikoshii in key conformational states with the substrate-binding site facing either the extracellular or the intracellular side of the membrane to study binding thermodynamics. We show that the chemical potential of sodium ions in solution is exclusively coupled to substrate binding and release, not to substrate translocation. Despite the transporter's structural symmetry, the binding mechanisms are distinct on the {{opposite sides of the}} membrane and more complex than the current models suggest...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceCystine-glutamate <b>transporters</b> import cystine into {{cells for}} {{glutathione}} synthesis and protection from oxidative stress, but also export {{significant amounts of}} glutamate. Increasing evidence suggests that 'ambient extracellular glutamate' secreted by cystine-glutamate transporters in the nervous system modulates glutamatergic synapse strength and behavior. To date, the only cystine-glutamate transporter mutants examined behaviorally are Drosophila genderblind mutants. These animals contain loss-of-function mutations in the 'genderblind' gene, which encodes an xCT subunit essential for cystine-glutamate transporter function. Genderblind was named based on a mutant courtship phenotype: male genderblind mutants are attracted to normally aversive male pheromones and thus court and attempt to copulate with {{both male and female}} partners equally. However, genderblind protein is expressed {{in many parts of the}} fly brain and thus might be expected to also regulate other behaviors, including behaviors not related to male courtship or chemosensation. Here, we show that genderblind mutants display faster recovery and increased negative geotaxis after strong mechanical stimuli (e. g., they climb faster and farther after vial banging). This phenotype is displayed by both males and females, consistent with strong genderblind expression in both sexes...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceDrug <b>transporters</b> are now {{recognized}} as major actors in pharmacokinetics, involved notably in drug-drug interactions and drug adverse effects. Factors that govern their activity, localization and expression are therefore important to consider. In the present review, {{the implications of}} protein kinases C (PKCs) in transporter regulations are summarized and discussed. Both solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters can be regulated by PKCs-related signaling pathways. PKCs thus target activity, membrane localization and/or expression level of major influx and efflux drug transporters, in various normal and pathological types of cells and tissues, often in a PKC isoform-specific manner. PKCs are notably implicated in membrane insertion of bile acid transporters in liver and, in this way, are thought to contribute to cholestatic or choleretic effects of endogenous compounds or drugs. The exact clinical relevance of PKCs-related regulation of drug transporters in terms of drug resistance, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and drug toxicity remains however to be precisely determined. This issue is likely important to consider {{in the context of}} the development of new drugs targeting PKCs-mediated signaling pathways, for treating notably cancers, diabetes or psychiatric disorders...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceGlucose <b>transporter</b> GLUT 4 (also {{known as}} SLC 2 A 4) {{plays a major}} role in glucose {{homeostasis}} and is efficiently retained intracellularly in adipocytes and myocytes. To simplify the analysis of its retention, here, various intracellular GLUT 4 domains were fused individually to reporter molecules. Of the four short cytoplasmic loops of GLUT 4, only the first nine-residue-long loop conferred intracellular retention of truncated forms of the transferrin receptor and CD 4 in adipocytes. In contrast, the same loop of GLUT 1 was without effect. The reporter molecules to which the first loop of GLUT 4 was fused localized, unlike GLUT 4, to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), possibly explaining why these molecules did not respond to insulin. The retention induced by the GLUT 4 loop was specific to adipocytes as it did not induce retention in preadipocytes. Of the SQWLGRKRA sequence that constitutes this loop, mutation of either the tryptophan or lysine residue abrogated reporter retention. Mutation of these residues individually into alanine residues in the full-length GLUT 4 molecule resulted in a decreased retention for GLUT 4 -W 105 A. We conclude that the first intracellular loop of GLUT 4 contains the retention motif WLGRK, in which W 105 plays a prominent role...|$|R

In {{red blood cells}} (RBC), while the major function of UT-B is to transport urea, {{it is assumed that}} this protein is able to conduct water. Here, we have revisited this last issue by studying RBCs and ghosts from human variants with defects of aquaporin 1 (AQP 1) or UT-B. We found that UT-B's osmotic water unit permeability (pf unit) {{is similar to that of}} AQP 1. The determination of diffusional permeability coefficient (P d) allowed the calculation of the P f /P d ratio, which is consistent with a single-file water transport. Molecular dynamic simulations of water conduction through human UT-B confirmed the experimental finding. From these results, we propose an atomistic description of water–protein interactions involved in this permeation. Inside the UT-B pore, five water molecules were found to form a single-file and move rapidly along a channel by hydrogen bond exchange involving two critical threonines. We further show that the energy barrier for water located in the central region coincides with a water dipole reorientation, which can be related to the proton exclusion observed experimentally. In conclusion, our results indicate that UT-B should be considered as a new member of the water channel family...|$|R

Sequence analysis indicates that HlyB contains a C 39 peptidase-like domain at its N-terminus. C 39 domains are thiol-dependent peptidases that cleave their substrates after a GG motif. Interestingly, the catalytically invariant cysteine is replaced by a tyrosine in the C 39 -like domain of HlyB.

UT-B 1 urea transporter is widely distributed in rat and human tissues. Because mice exhibit high urea turnover {{and are the}} preferred species for gene engineering, we have delineated UT-B 1 tissue expression in murine tissues. A cDNA was cloned from BALB/c mouse kidney, encoding a polypeptide that differed from C 57 BL/ 6 mouse UT-B 1 by one residue (Val- 8 -Ala). UT-B 1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in brain, kidney, bladder, testis, lung, spleen, and digestive tract (liver, stomach, jejunum, colon). Northern blotting revealed seven UT-B 1 transcripts in mouse tissues. Immunoblots identified a nonglycosylated UT-B 1 protein of 29 kDa in most tissues and of 36 and 32 kDa in testis and liver, respectively. UT-B 1 protein of gastrointestinal tract did not undergo N-glycosylation. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization localized UT-B 1 in urinary tract urothelium (papillary surface, ureter, bladder, and urethra), prominently on plasma membranes and restricted to the basolateral area in umbrella cells. UT-B 1 was found in endothelial cells of descending vasa recta in kidney medulla and in astrocyte processes in brain.

Antidepressants targeting these high-affinity transporters, however, do not provide positive treatment outcomes for all patients. Other monoamine transport systems, with lower affinity, have been detected in the brain, but their role is largely unknown. Here we report that OCT 2, {{a member of the}} polyspecific organic cation transporter (OCT) family, is expressed notably in the limbic system and implicated in anxiety and depression-related behaviors in the mouse. Genetic deletion of OCT 2 in mice produced a significant reduction in brain tissue concentrations of NE and 5 -HT and in ex vivo uptake of both these neurotransmitters {{in the presence of the}} dual 5 -HT-NE transport blocker, venlafaxine. In vivo clearance of NE and 5 -HT evaluated using microiontophoretic electrophysiology was diminished in the hippocampus of OCT 2 -/- mice in the presence of venlafaxine, thereby affecting post-synaptic neuronal activity. OCT 2 -/- mice displayed an altered sensitivity to acute treatments with NE and/or 5 -HT-selective transport blockers in the forced-swim test. Moreover, the mutant mice were insensitive to long-term venlafaxine treatment in a more realistic, corticosterone-induced, chronic depression model.

Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or tremor disorders can be achieved with high degrees of accuracy in cases with full expression of classical clinical features, however, diagnosis can be difficult since {{there is a substantial}} clinical overlap especially in monosymptomatic tremor (dystonic tremor, essential tremor, Parkinson tremor). The use of DAT-SPECT can prove or excludes with high sensitivity nigrostriatal dysfunction in those cases and facilitates early and accurate diagnosis.

However, this effect {{has never been}} described in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, despite that they often receive SSRIs {{for the treatment of}} depression. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of the SSRI citalopram against dyskinesia in two experimental models of PD, the 6 -OHDA-lesioned rat and 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated macaque. First, we studied the acute and chronic effect of citalopram, given at different time points before L-DOPA, in L-DOPA-primed parkinsonian rats. Moreover, the acute effect of citalopram was also evaluated in dyskinetic MPTP-treated macaques. In L-DOPA-primed rats, a significant and long-lasting reduction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) was observed only when citalopram was given 30 min before L-DOPA, suggesting that the time of injection relative to L-DOPA is a key factor for the efficacy of the treatment. Interestingly, an acute challenge with the 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonist eltoprazine, given {{at the end of the}} chronic study, was equally effective in reducing LID in rats previously chronically treated with L-DOPA or L-DOPA plus citalopram, suggesting that no auto-receptor desensitization was induced by chronic citalopram treatment.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceOmp 85 <b>transporters</b> mediate protein {{insertion}} into, or translocation across, membranes. They have a conserved architecture, with POTRA domains that {{interact with}} substrate proteins, a 16 -stranded transmembrane β barrel, and an extracellular loop, L 6, folded {{back in the}} barrel pore. Here using electrophysiology, in vivo biochemical approaches and electron paramagnetic resonance, we show that the L 6 loop of the Omp 85 transporter FhaC changes conformation and modulates channel opening. Those conformational changes involve breaking the conserved interaction between the tip of L 6 and the inner β-barrel wall. The membrane-proximal POTRA domain also exchanges between several conformations, and the binding of FHA displaces this equilibrium. We further demonstrate a dynamic, physical communication between the POTRA domains and L 6, which must take place via the β barrel. Our findings thus link all three essential components of Omp 85 transporters and indicate that they operate in a concerted fashion in the transport cycle...|$|R

Analysis of the single and double mutants shows that fatty acid beta-oxidation occurs in both organelles. Furthermore, the peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathways are both dispensable for vegetative and sexual development. They are, however, differently required for ascospore pigmentation and germination, this latter defect being restored in a DeltapABC 1 and DeltapABC 2 background.

We thus investigated developmental changes in the bovine heart and perirenal adipose tissue in two glucose transporter isoforms, namely GLUT 1 and GLUT 4, the latter being responsible for the regulation of glucose uptake by insulin. Other key players of the glucose/insulin axis were also assessed. Plasma glucose concentration in the foetus was lower at 8 and 8. 5 months of age than previously. In the heart, GLUT 1 protein level markedly decreased between 3 and 4 months of age, whereas the number of insulin and IGF-I binding sites continually decreased, especially between 7 and 8 or 8. 5 months of age. On the contrary, the GLUT 4 level increased until 8  months of age and remained high until 2 weeks after birth. The activities of enzymes of glucose metabolism (namely phosphofructokinase [PFK] and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) increased throughout gestation and reached a plateau at 6 and 8. 5 months of age for PFK and LDH, respectively. The activities of enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism increased especially at birth. In perirenal adipose tissue, high mitochondrial activity was detected before birth which is a characteristic of brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, lipoprotein lipase activity and GLUT 4 protein level markedly increased to reach a maximum at 6 - 7 and 8  months of age, and sharply decreased thereafter, whereas GLUT 1 protein level increased between 6 and 7 months of age. In conclusion, considerable changes in the regulation of the insulin/glucose axis were observed from 6 months onwards of foetal development in both the heart and adipose tissue of cattle, which probably alters the potential of these tissues to use glucose or fat as energy sources...|$|R

Functionally characterized NAT transporters from bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals are ion-coupled symporters specific for the uptake of purines, pyrimidines and related analogues. The characterized mammalian NATs are specific for the uptake of L-ascorbic acid. In this work we identify in silico a group of fungal putative transporters, named UapD-like proteins, which represent a novel NAT subfamily. To understand the function and specificity of UapD proteins, we cloned and functionally characterized the two Aspergillus brasiliensis NAT members (named AbUapC and AbUapD) by heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans. AbUapC represents canonical NATs (UapC or UapA), while AbUapD represents the new subfamily. AbUapC is a high-affinity, high-capacity, H(+) /xanthine-uric acid transporter, which can also recognize other purines with very low affinity. No apparent transport function could be detected for AbUapD. GFP-tagging showed that, unlike AbUapC which is localized in the plasma membrane, AbUapD is ER-retained and degraded in the vacuoles, a characteristic of misfolded proteins. Chimeric UapA/AbUapD molecules are also turned-over in the vacuole, suggesting that UapD includes intrinsic peptidic sequences leading to misfolding. The possible evolutionary implication of such conserved, but inactive proteins is discussed...|$|R

The use of these dyes for transporter analyses may, however, be hampered by classic pitfalls of fluorescence technology, such as quenching. Transporter-independent processes such as passive diffusion of dyes through plasma membrane or dye sequestration into subcellular compartments must also be considered, as well as the redundant handling by various distinct transporters of some fluorescent probes.

Glutamate also appears {{to play a role}} in the development of the nervous system of vertebrates. Here we report the characterization of a vesicular glutamate transporter of lamprey (lVGluT), a novel member of the VGluT gene family. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that lVGLUT cannot be assigned to any of the three VGLUT isoforms characterized in teleosts and mammals, suggesting that these classes may have been fixed after the splitting between cyclostomes and gnathostomes. Expression pattern analysis during lamprey embryogenesis and prolarval stages shows that lVGluT expression is restricted to the nervous system. The first structure to express lVGluT was the olfactory epithelium of late embryos. In the brain of early prolarvae, lVGluT was expressed in most of the neuronal populations that generate the early axonal scaffold. lVGluT expression was also observed in neuronal populations of the rhombencephalon and spinal cord and in ganglia of the branchiomeric, octaval and posterior lateral line nerves. In the rhombencephalon, lVGluT expression appears to be spatially restricted in dorsal and ventral longitudinal domains. Comparison of the early expression of VGluT genes between the lamprey and some anamniotan gnathostomes (frog, zebrafish) reveals a conserved expression pattern, likely to reflect ancestral vertebrate characteristics...|$|R

To obtain information on its expression in plants, we generated NtPDR 1 -specific antibodies and, using Western blotting, found that this transporter is localized in roots, leaves, and flowers and this was confirmed in transgenic plants expressing the ß-glucuronidase reporter gene fused to the NtPDR 1 promoter region. Expression was seen in the lateral roots and in the long glandular trichomes of the leaves, stem, and flowers. Western blot analysis and in situ immunolocalization showed NtPDR 1 to be localized in the plasma membrane. Induction of NtPDR 1 expression by various compounds was tested in N. tabacum BY 2 cells. Induction of expression was observed with the hormones methyl jasmonate and naphthalene acetic acid and diterpenes. Constitutive ectopic expression of NtPDR 1 in N. tabacum BY 2 cells resulted in increased resistance to several diterpenes.

This is probably due to its capacity to bind Sec 24 D, {{a component of the}} COPII complex. This ER export motif was active when introduced into the related GLYT 2 transporter but not in the unrelated VSVG protein. GLYT 1 protein in which this motif was mutated was not transported to the plasma membrane, although this effect was rescued by co-expressing these mutants with wild-type GLYT 1. This behavior suggests that GLYT 1 might form oligomers along the trafficking pathway. Cross-linking assays performed in rat brain synaptosomes, and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy in living cells confirmed the existence of GLYT 1 oligomers. In summary, we have identified a motif involved in the ER exit of GLYT 1 and in analyzing the influence of this motif, we have found evidence that oligomerization is important for the trafficking of GLYT 1 to the cell surface. Because this motif is conserved in the NSS family, it is possible that this finding could be extrapolated to other related transporters...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceOrganic cation <b>transporters</b> (OCTs) are polyspecific {{facilitated}} diffusion transporters {{that contribute to}} the absorption and clearance of various physiological compounds and xenobiotics in mammals, by mediating their vectorial transport in kidney, liver or placenta cells. Unexpectedly, a corpus of studies within the last decade has revealed that these transporters also fulfill important functions within the brain. The high-affinity monoamine reuptake transporters (SERT, NET and DAT) exert {{a crucial role in the}} control of aminergic transmission by ensuring the rapid clearance of the released transmitters from the synaptic cleft and their recycling into the nerve endings. Substantiated evidence indicate that OCTs may serve in the brain as a compensatory clearance system in case of monoamine spillover after high-affinity transporter blockade by antidepressants or psychostimulants, and in areas of lower high-affinity transporter density at distance from the aminergic varicosities. In spite of similar anatomical profiles, the two brain OCTs, OCT 2 and OCT 3, show subtle differences in their distribution in the brain and their functional properties. These transporters contribute to shape a variety of central functions related to mood such as anxiety, response to stress and antidepressant efficacy, but are also implicated in other processes like osmoregulation and neurotoxicity. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge and emerging concepts on the role of OCTs in the uptake of aminergic neurotransmitters in the brain and in these various physiological functions, focusing on the implications for mental health...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceVesicular {{glutamate}} <b>transporters</b> (VGLUTs) {{mediate the}} packaging of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles. Three VGLUT subtypes {{have so far}} been identified, with distinct expression patterns in the adult brain. Here, we investigated the spatial distribution of the three VGLUTs in the rat olfactory bulb, a brain region containing a variety of glutamate synapses, both axodendritic and dendrodendritic. Using multilabelling confocal microscopy and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, we showed that each VGLUT isoform has a highly selective localization in olfactory bulb synapses. VGLUT 1 is present at dendrodendritic synapses established by the output neurones (mitral and tufted cells) with bulbar interneurones in the glomerular layer and external plexiform layer, {{as well as in}} axonal synapses of the granule cell layer. By contrast, VGLUT 2 is strongly expressed in axon terminals of olfactory sensory neurones, which establish synapses with second-order neurones in the glomerular neuropil. VGLUT 2 is also found in the outer part of the external plexiform layer and in the granule cell layer but colocalizes only partially with VGLUT 1. Finally, we showed that VGLUT 3 is exclusively located in the glomerular neuropil, where it colocalizes extensively with the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter vesicular GABA transporter, suggesting that it is associated with a subset of inhibitory synapses. Together, these observations extend previous findings on VGLUT distribution in the forebrain, and suggest that each VGLUT subtype has a specific function in the distinct features of axodendritic and dendrodendritic synapses that characterize the olfactory bulb circuit...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe sugar <b>transporter</b> GLUT 2, {{present in}} several tissues of the gut-brain axis, has been {{reported}} {{to be involved in the}} control of food intake. GLUT 2 is a sugar transporter sustaining energy production in the cell, but GLUT 2 can also function as a receptor for extracellular glucose. A glucose-signaling pathway is indeed triggered, independently of glucose metabolism, through its large cytoplasmic loop domain. However, it remains to determine the contribution of the receptor function over the transporter function of GLUT 2 in the control of food intake. Thus, we generated transgenic mice that express a GLUT 2 -loop domain, blocking the detection of glucose, but leaving GLUT 2 -dependent glucose transport unaffected. Inhibiting GLUT 2 -mediated glucose detection augmented daily food intake by a mechanism that increased the meal size but not the number of meals. Peripheral hormones (ghrelin, insulin, leptin) were unaffected, leading to a focus on central aspects of feeding behavior. We found defects in c-Fos activation by glucose in the arcuate nucleus, and changes in the amounts of TRH and orexin neuropeptide mRNA, which are relevant to poorly controlled meal size. Our data provide evidence that glucose detection by GLUT 2 contributes to the control of food intake by the hypothalamus. The sugar transporter-receptor, i. e. 'transceptor' GLUT 2, may constitute a drug target to treat eating disorders and associated metabolic diseases, particularly by modulating its receptor function without affecting vital sugar provision by its transporter function...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceCell-surface {{glutamate}} <b>transporters</b> {{are essential}} for the proper function of early cortical networks because their dysfunction induces seizures in the newborn rat in vivo. We have now analyzed {{the consequences of their}} inhibition by DL-TBOA on the activity of the developing CA 1 rat hippocampal network in vitro. DL-TBOA generated a pattern of recurrent depolarization with an onset and decay of several seconds' duration in interneurons and pyramidal cells. These slow network oscillations (SNOs) were mostly mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in pyramidal cells and by GABA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in interneurons. However, in both cell types SNOs were blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, suggesting that their generation requires a glutamatergic drive. Moreover, in interneurons, SNOs were still generated after the blockade of NMDA-mediated synaptic currents with MK- 801, suggesting that SNOs are expressed by the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. Long-lasting bath application of glutamate or NMDA failed to induce SNOs, indicating that they are generated by periodic but not sustained activation of NMDA receptors. In addition, SNOs were observed in interneurons recorded in slices with or without the strata pyramidale and oriens, suggesting that the glutamatergic drive may originate from the radiatum and pyramidale strata. We propose that {{in the absence of an}} efficient transport of glutamate, the transmitter diffuses in the extracellular space to activate extrasynaptic NMDA receptors preferentially present on interneurons that in turn activate other interneurons and pyramidal cells. This periodic neuronal coactivation may contribute to the generation of seizures when glutamate transport dysfunction is present...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceActive {{cellular}} <b>transporters</b> {{of harmful}} agents-multidrug resistance (mdr) proteins-are present in tumor, stem and endothelial cells, among others. While mdr proteins are broadly studied in tumor cells, {{their role in}} non-tumor cells and the significance of their action not connected with removal of harmful xenobiotics is less extensively documented. Proper assessment of mdr proteins expression is difficult. Mdr mRNA presence is most often evaluated {{but that does not}} necessarily correlate with the protein level. The protein expression itself is difficult to determine; usually cells with mdr overexpression are studied, not cells under physiological conditions, in which a low expression level of mdr protein is often insufficient for detection in vitro. Various methods are used to identify mdr mRNA and protein expression, together with functional tests demonstrating their biological drug transporting activities. Data comparing different methods of investigating expression of mdr mRNAs and their corresponding proteins are still scarce. In this article we present the results of a study concerning mdr mRNA and protein expression. Our goal was to search for the best method to investigate the expression level and functional activity of five selected mdr proteins-MDR 1, BCRP, MRP 1, MRP 4 and MRP 5 -in established in vitro cell lines of human endothelial cells (ECs) and their progenitors. Endothelial cells demonstrated mdr presence at the mRNA level, which was not always confirmed at the protein level or in functional tests. Therefore, several different assays had to be applied for evaluation of mdr proteins expression and functions in endothelial cells. Among them functional tests seemed to be the most conclusive, although not very specific...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceHepatic drug <b>transporters</b> are now {{recognized}} as major actors of hepatobiliary elimination of drugs. Characterization of their regulatory pathways is therefore an important issue. In this context, {{the present study}} was designed to analyze the potential regulation of human hepatic transporter expression by protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Treatment by the reference PKC activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) for 48 h was shown to decrease mRNA expression of various sinusoidal transporters, including OATP 1 B 1, OATP 2 B 1, NTCP, OCT 1 and MRP 3, but to increase that of OATP 1 B 3, whereas mRNA expression of canalicular transporters was transiently enhanced (MDR 1), decreased (BSEP and MRP 2) or unchanged (BCRP) in human hepatoma HepaRG cells. The profile of hepatic transporter mRNA expression changes in PMA-treated HepaRG cells was correlated to that found in PMA-exposed primary human hepatocytes and was similarly observed in response to the PKC-activating marketed drug ingenol mebutate. It was associated with concomitant repression of OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 2 B 1 protein expression and reduction of OATP, OCT 1, NTCP and MRP 2 activity. The use of chemical PKC inhibitors further suggested a contribution of novel PKCs isoforms to PMA-mediated regulations of transporter mRNA expression. PMA was finally shown to cause epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HepaRG cells and exposure to various additional EMT inducers, i. e., hepatocyte growth factor, tumor growth factor-β 1 or the HNF 4 α inhibitor ≡I 6015, led to transporter expression alterations highly correlated to those triggered by PMA. Taken together, these data highlight PKC-dependent regulation of human hepatic drug transporter expression, which may be closely linked to EMT triggered by PKC activatio...|$|R
