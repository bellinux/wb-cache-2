5|$|In October 2009 in an {{out-of-court}} discussion, {{lawyers on}} behalf of El-Sherbini's family and widower approached the Ministry of Justice of the State of Saxony about compensation. In the verdict on 11 November 2009, Judge Birgit Wiegand granted the claimant's request (Adhäsionsantrag, § 406 StPO) to claim for damages against the defendant in an 'adherent case' within the remit of this criminal case. It established — without a separate trial for a private law claim — that Wiens <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> to compensate Okaz and El-Sherbini's beneficiaries for having harmed Okaz and killed El-Sherbini.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial judge}} <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> to ensure an {{impartial}} jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require {{the court to}} permit voir dire {{on the subject of}} the juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E

This help in the economic realm should be manifest in two ways. First, relatively wealthy Christians must be aware of people who need economic help and provide what is needed in a timely manner by personally serving those who are less fortunate. Second, Christians should espouse a support for free-market capitalism. Our support should not be uncritical, but tempered with biblically informed reason...|$|R

2500|$|Yibbum (...) or levirate {{marriage}} in Judaism, {{is one of}} the most complex types of marriages mandated by Torah law (...) by which, according to the law, the brother of a man who died without children <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>obligation</b> to marry the widow. However, if either of the parties refuses to go through with the marriage, both are required to go through a ceremony known as halizah, involving a symbolic act of renunciation of their right to perform this marriage. Jewish law (halakha) has seen a gradual decline of yibbum in favor of halizah, to the point where in most contemporary Jewish communities, and in Israel by mandate of the Chief Rabbinate, the former is prohibited.|$|E
