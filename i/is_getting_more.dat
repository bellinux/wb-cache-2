25|$|In the Philippines, {{the use of}} {{simplified}} characters <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> {{and more}} popular. Before the 1970s, Chinese schools in the Philippines were {{under the supervision of}} the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. Hence, most books were using the Traditional Characters. Traditional Characters remained prevalent until the early 2000s. However, institutions like the Confucius Institute, being the cultural arm of the People's Republic of China, are strong proponents of the use of Simplified Characters. Also, many new schools are now importing their Mandarin textbooks from Singapore instead of Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|A Pew Research poll {{conducted}} August 14–17 among 1,000 adults, found stark racial and political divisions in {{reactions to the}} shooting. By about four-to-one, African Americans (80% to 18%) said the shooting raised important issues about race, while whites, by 47% to 37%, said {{the issue of race}} <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> attention than it deserves. The divide in public opinion was also observed across partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats (including 62% of white Democrats) believing the incident raises important issues about race that merit discussion, compared with 40% of Independents and 22% of Republicans. Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to view the police response as appropriate (43%), compared with 21% of Democrats; 65% of Republicans expressed confidence in the investigations into the incident, compared with 38% of Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} {{carry the}} electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, {{which are the}} vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch. They are then extruded and shaped, baked to carbonize the binder (pitch), and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000°C, at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to 11feet long and 30 inches in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005.|$|E

25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing {{in the presence of}} therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the point of care (POC) or in emergency laboratories <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs. Several reports confirm that application of TEM is cost effective by reducing the consumption of blood products.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "highlight" [...] for Lynch was {{the scene}} where Kurt, Mercedes and Rachel were {{watching}} Twilight together, {{not only because the}} [...] "friendship between Kurt and Mercedes" [...] has been [...] "sadly downplayed", but because it was [...] "nice to see the Glee kids just being kids sometimes". The subsequent conversation between Kurt and Finn in the locker room was described by Canning as [...] "one of the truest moments of the season so far". Votta wrote, [...] "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception." [...] Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting [...] "its scope too wide", credited their storyline as the [...] "only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song". Votta stated that [...] "Glee <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can shake a stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence [...] "helped build their relationship into something we care more about". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her [...] "to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane".|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions. The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s {{been going on for a}} long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E

She said, [...] "My disease is progressing and our race <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> urgent.

He commented that the material was [...] "quite a little edgier than Ray of Light, elaborating that [...] "It's almost like we started off {{with a lot of}} slow ballad songs and she's started to kind of chuck 'em out in favor of more edgy tracks. The album <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> kind of fast, very European sounding, very English and French sounding, naturally, 'cause everybody working on it apart from her is English or French. Pretty exciting, actually. It's like a follow-up for Ray Of Light without stopping still. It's perfect". But after some recording sessions, she felt she needed a different sound for her project, scrapping most of the material and began looking for new producers to work with. Recording sessions began in January 2000 at Sarm West and East Studios in London, England.|$|E
