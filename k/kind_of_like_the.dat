In an interview with MTV News the video's director, Anthony Mandler said, [...] "Part of the objective of making this video was to do that same twist again, to give you something unexpected, not only tonality with the song but with the video thematically. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> anti-love love story. It's really about crossing lines, what was said in the first scene.
