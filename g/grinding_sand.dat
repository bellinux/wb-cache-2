He beheld his father ponderously <b>grinding</b> <b>sand,</b> his mother fierily {{breaking}} butterflies, his brother labouring at {{the pleasures of the}} Hawbuck with the ardour of a soldier in a doubtful battle; and the vital sceptic looked on wondering. They were careful and troubled about many things; for him there seemed not even one thing needful. He was born disenchanted, the world's promises awoke no echo in his bosom, the world's activities and the world's distinctions seemed to him equally without a base in fact. He liked the open air; he liked comradeship, it mattered not with whom, his comrades were only a remedy for solitude. And he had a taste for painted art. An array of fine pictures looked upon his childhood, and from these roods of jewelled canvas he received an indelible impression. The gallery at Stallbridge betokened generations of picture-lovers; Norris was perhaps the first of his race to hold the pencil. The taste was genuine, it grew and strengthened with his growth; and yet he suffered it to be suppressed with scarce a struggle. Time came for him to go to Oxford, and he resisted faintly. He was stupid, he said; it was no good to put him through the mill; he wished to be a painter. The words fell on his father like a thunderbolt, and Norris made haste to give way. [...] "It didn't really matter, don't you know?" [...] said he. [...] "And it seemed an awful shame to vex the old boy." ...|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to <b>grind,</b> <b>sand</b> and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas.

In Titanium and Ti 6 Al 7 Nb surface by mechanical <b>grinding</b> and <b>sanding</b> acid corrosion are different processing to prepare a smooth surface and rough surface with holes, SEM and EDX analyze titanium surface morphology and elemental composition, laser confocal microscopy analyze surface roughness of titanium plate and a three-dimensional structure, inductively coupled plasma spectrometer to measure the internal elements of titanium and titanium alloy precipitation, observe different titanium surface adhesion of osteoblast cells by scanning electron microscope and analyze the proliferation of osteoblast by MTT test. Our results showed that sandblasted etched titanium surface treated to form a porous structure, the roughness of the surface is much larger than mechanical polishing, the precipitation of element content among titanium and titanium alloys is minimal in simulated body fluid, osteoblastic adhesion, proliferation, differentiation on titanium surface with Sandblasted etching group {{is much better than}} the mechanical grinding group.

5000|$|Die {{grinders}} and rotary {{tools are}} handheld power tools used for <b>grinding,</b> <b>sanding,</b> honing, polishing, or machining material (typically metal, but also plastic or wood). All such tools are conceptually similar, with no bright {{dividing line between}} die grinders and rotary tools, although the die grinder name tends {{to be used for}} pneumatically driven heavy-duty versions whereas the rotary tool name tends to be used for electric lighter-duty versions. Flexible shaft drive versions also exist. The die grinder name comes from one of their earliest and archetypal applications, tool and die work, where they were used to create the precise contours of dies or molds. Especially before the advent of widespread CNC usage, they were heavily relied upon for contouring via manual skill comparable to a sculptor's. CNC now provides much of the contouring for die and mold interior surfaces, but die grinders are still very useful for hundreds of cutting needs, from sculpture-like contouring in the absence of CNC, to cut-off of bar stock, to any of the cutting and grinding needs of fabrication, such as in the work of welders, boilermakers, millwrights, ironworkers (steel erectors), sheet metal workers (such as auto body workers and HVAC technicians), to woodworking (especially cabinet making), hacking, and other hobby or business pursuits. Die grinders are often used for engraving, cylinder head porting, and general shaping of a part.|$|R

Here, we provide an initial exploration into the problem domain of continuous activity recognition using on-body sensing. We use a mock “wood workshop ” assembly task to ground our investigation. We describe a method for the continuous recognition of activities (sawing, hammering, filing, drilling, <b>grinding,</b> <b>sanding,</b> opening a drawer, tightening a vise, and turning a screwdriver) using microphones and threeaxis accelerometers mounted at two positions on the user’s arms. Potentially “interesting ” activities are segmented from continuous streams of data using an analysis of the sound intensity detected at the two different locations. Activity classification is then performed on these detected segments using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the sound channel and hidden Markov models (HMMs) on the acceleration data. Four different methods at classifier fusion are compared for improving these classifications. Using user-dependent training, we obtain continuous average recall and precision rates (for positive activities) of 78 percent and 74 percent, respectively. Using user-independent training (leave-one-out across five users), we obtain recall rates of 66 percent and precision rates of 63 percent.

The sediments presented low water (15. 6 - 37. 2 %), organic matter (0. 7 - 5. 0 %) and carbonates (0. 3 - 1. 0 %) contents, prevailing fine to very fine sand at surface.
