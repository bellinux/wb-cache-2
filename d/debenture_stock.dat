On count 1 Kylsant was charged with issuing a document, namely the annual report for 1926 with intent to deceive the shareholders about the true state of the company, Morland was charged with aiding and abetting this offence. Count 2 was an identical count relating to the annual report for 1927 against both defendants and on count 3 Kylsant alone was charged with issuing a document—the <b>debenture</b> <b>stock</b> prospectus of 1928 with intent to induce people to advance property to the company.

50|$|As {{a result}} of being unable to pay the {{interest}} on <b>debenture</b> <b>stocks</b> and partly due to financial malfeasance by the Secretary, the line went into bankruptcy in 1885. In 1906 there was a move to join up with the Central Line at Loughborough but nothing came of it and the terminus remained at Loughborough's Derby Road. The Company then came up with two initiatives designed to improve profitability; Cheap-to-run railmotor services, which were introduced between Loughborough and Shackerstone, and on 2 April 1907 three halts were opened for use with them.|$|R
500|$|The {{money to}} build the CLR was {{obtained}} through a syndicate of financiers including Ernest Cassel, Henry Oppenheim, Darius Ogden Mills, {{and members of the}} Rothschild family. On [...] 1894, the syndicate incorporated a contractor to construct the railway, the Electric Traction Company Limited (ETCL), which agreed a construction cost of £2,544,000 (approximately £ today) plus £700,000 in 4per cent <b>debenture</b> <b>stock.</b> When the syndicate offered 285,000 CLR company shares for sale at £10 each in June 1895, only 14per cent was bought by the British public, which was cautious of such investments following failures of similar railway schemes. Some shares were sold in Europe and the United States, but the unsold remainder was bought by members of the syndicate or by the ETCL.|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} {{state of}} the company was difficult immediately on opening, and the company was losing money on operating account. The construction had cost more than was budgeted, and there had also been serious irregularities in the financial control. New preference stock was issued soon after the opening: the Company was [...] "issuing £105,000 [...] 5% preference stock, which will be a first charge on the gross receipts of the railway after paying the interest on the <b>debenture</b> <b>stock,</b> amounting to £3,830 per annum... The new capital {{is required for the}} completion of the works under the first contract, amounting to about £25,000; the new wharves at Chepstow; branches to tinplate-works and other works and mills on the line, about one mile in length; the Brockweir-bridge and enlarged sidings, made {{at the request of the}} Great Western Railway Company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 152. Let me {{take two}} or three simple {{instances}} by way of illustration. The following has happened to myself. All my life through--from the time when my income was not a tenth part {{of what it is}} now--I have felt it a duty, while endeavoring to discharge all proper claims, to live within that income, so to adjust my expenditure to it {{that there should be a}} margin on the right side. This margin, of course, accumulated, and reached in time, say, £1000. Just then, say, the London and North-Western Railway Company proposed to issue <b>Debenture</b> <b>Stock,</b> bearing four per cent. interest, for the purpose of extending the communications, and so increasing the wealth, of the country. Whom in the world am I injuring--what conceivable wrong am I doing--where or how am I thwarting [...] "the Will of God"--if I let the Company have my £1000, and have been receiving from them £40 a year for the use of it ever since? Unless the money had been forthcoming from some quarter or other, a work which was absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the nation, and which finds remunerative employment (K) for an immense number of Englishmen, enabling them to bring up their families in respectability and comfort, would never have been accomplished. Will you tell me that this method of carrying out great commercial enterprises, sanctioned by experience (L) as the most, if not the only, practicable one, is [...] "not according to the Will of God"? ...|$|E

50|$|Instances of perpetuities are the {{dividends}} {{upon the}} public stocks in England, France {{and some other}} countries. Thus, although it is usual to speak of £100 consols, the reality is the yearly dividend which the government pays by quarterly instalments. The practice of the French in this is arguably more logical. In speaking of their public funds (rentes) they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the annuity or annual payment that is received by the public creditor. Other instances of perpetuities are the incomes derived from the <b>debenture</b> <b>stocks</b> of railway companies, also the feu-duties commonly payable on house property in Scotland. The number of years' purchase which the perpetual annuities granted by a government or a railway company realize in the open market, forms a very simple test of the credit of the various governments or railways.|$|R

40|$|Using {{multiple}} equation Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system estimation {{procedures and}} monthly data {{at the three}} maturity horizons of 6, 9 and 12 months, the paper explores whether conditional spreads between futures and spot rates on five contracts traded on LIFFE have a common predictable component driven by a single unobservable source of risk. The future contracts studied are: 3 -month ECU; 3 -month Euromark; FT 100 Index; German Government Bond; and 3 -month Short Sterling. The sample period is October 1989 through August 1996. Movement {{in the price of}} systematic risk is proxied by ex ante variables that have been shown to have predictive power for returns from bond and stock markets. These are: the return on the US Standard and Poor index; the return on the German Dax index; the UK and US 3 -month treasury bill yield differential; the spread between the UK 20 -year gilt yield and the UK 3 -month treasury bill yield; the spread between the <b>debenture</b> and loan <b>stock</b> yield and, the 20 -year gilt yield; the dividend yield on the FT Actuaries All Share index; and the change in the yields on UK government consol 2. 5 % bonds. The results indicate that common variation in bases exists and that relative conditional covariances are constant over all horizons. The evidence reported also suggests that, at short horizons, common basis variation is associated with both spot price forecasts and futures market risk while, at medium and long horizons, the dominant source of the reported common basis variation is due to the systematic risk associated with the futures position.

40|$|Samuel Street {{was born}} in Connecticut in 1775. He came to Chippawa, Upper Canada in 1787 {{to live with his}} uncle Samuel Street after his father was killed in New York. His uncle was {{involved}} in mercantile affairs in the Niagara Peninsula, which helped Samuel Street Jr. in establishing successful businesses and partnerships in later years. As the son of a Loyalist he was also entitled to 200 acres of land, but his uncle successfully petitioned for an additional 400 acres. In 1798, Street struck up a partnership with Thomas Clark, an important merchant in Queenston. They parted ways the following year, but renewed their association around 1809. The result was the firm of Clark and Street, a business that proved to be one of Upper Canada’s largest, and endured until Thomas Clark’s death in 1835. Initially the business centred on two milling complexes, the Falls Mills and Bridgewater Mills. Both mills were destroyed by fire in 1814 and only the Falls Mills was rebuilt. The success of their milling operation provided Clark and Street with a large amount of capital. They utilized this capital by money-lending, and became one of the largest financiers in Upper Canada. The firm’s clients ranged from farmers to prominent political, business and religious leaders such as Attorneys general William Henry Draper and Christopher Alexander Hagerman, Bishop John Strachan, William Hamilton Merritt, and Captain Hugh Richardson. Clark and Street further diversified their business by investing in <b>stocks,</b> <b>debentures,</b> transportation schemes, and land. Samuel Street owned shares in the Bank of Upper Canada, Gore Bank, Bank of Montreal, and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District. He owned provincial debentures and those issued by the Gore and the Wellington Districts, as well as stock in the Welland Canal Company, the Erie and Ontario Railroad Company, and Grand River Navigation Company. He also speculated in land extensively, either owning land or holding a mortgage on land in almost every district in the province. Street employed agents to purchase land for him in various districts, acquiring desirable land at favourable prices, such as lands sold at sheriff’s sales due to tax arrears. Samuel Street died in August, 1844 in Port Robinson, Upper Canada, leaving his fortune to his son Thomas Clark Street, and his four surviving daughters. 	 Thomas Clark {{was born in}} Scotland. He arrived in Upper Canada in 1791 to work for his cousin Robert Hamilton, a businessman in Queenston. In 1796 Clark opened a shop in Queenston, and soon after established a partnership with Samuel Street. This first partnership was short-lived, and Clark formed a partnership with Robert Nichol, establishing the firm of Thomas Clark and Company. The firm traded in flour and other commodities in 1802 and 1803, but the business did not prove to be beneficial to either partner and was dissolved. Clark renewed his partnership with Samuel Street around 1809. During the War of 1812, Clark served as lieutenant-colonel of the 2 nd Lincoln Militia and was at the Battle of Queenston Heights, as well as the American surrender at Beaver Dams and raids on Fort Schlosser (Niagara Falls), N. Y., and Black Rock (Buffalo). After the war, {{he was one of the}} commissioners who assessed war losses in the Niagara District. Unlike his partner, Clark became active in politics, becoming a member of the Legislative Council in 1815. Clark had business interests separate from his partnership with Samuel Street, including an agreement with John Jacob Aster of New York and some of his business associates for the sale and shipment of flour in Montreal, New York and Jamaica. He also conducted business with the Earl of Selkirk, including support for the Red River expedition in 1816. Clark also speculated in land independently of his firm with Street, but not nearly as extensively as his partner. Thomas Clark died in 1835 in Niagara Falls. It was estimated that the value of his estate was £ 100, 000. He was survived by his wife Mary Margaret Kerr. The collection consists of correspondence and legal documents concerning Thomas Clark, Samuel Street and his son Thomas Clark Street. Some of the material is related to Thomas Clark and Samuel Street’s joint business ventures. Most of the correspondence is addressed to Samuel Street and involves his dealings in land speculation. There is also correspondence to Samuel Street from Thomas Clark’s widow Mary M. Clark, as well as two letters to Thomas Clark. The first letter concerns his involvement with the Lincoln Militia. The other letter is from Dani Hazen, an early land surveyor in Niagara. One letter is from Samuel Street to Alexander Hamilton and includes a statement of Hamilton’s account. The legal documents include a summons to Thomas Clark and Samuel Street to appear in court; 2 deeds of bargain and sale to Samuel Street; 1 deed of bargain and sale from Thomas Clark Street to William Allan; 2 sheriff’s deeds for lands purchased at public auction by Thomas C. Street; and a last will and testament of Samuel Street...|$|R
