25|$|The {{structural}} homology {{described above}} {{indicates that the}} PA clan members are descended from a common ancestor of the same fold. Although PA clan proteases share a common ancestor some families use serine as the nucleophile in their catalytic triad whilst others use cysteine. The catalytic triad {{is a set of}} three residues that together perform nucleophilic catalysis and are therefore a vital component of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>active</b> <b>site.</b> This is therefore an extreme example of divergent enzyme evolution since during evolutionary history, the core catalytic residue of the enzyme has switched. In addition to their structural similarity, directed evolution {{has been shown to be}} able to convert a cysteine protease into an active serine protease. All cellular PA clan proteases are serine proteases, however there are both serine and cysteine protease families of viral proteases.|$|E

50|$|Squalene monooxygenase is a {{flavoprotein}} monooxygenase. Flavoprotein monooxygenase form flavin hydroperoxides at the <b>enzyme</b> <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> {{which then}} transfer the terminal oxygen atom of the hydroperoxide to the substrate. Squalene monooxygenase differs from other flavin monooxygenases {{in that the}} oxygen is inserted as an epoxide {{rather than as a}} hydroxyl group. Squalene monooxygenase contains a loosely bound FAD flavin and obtains electrons from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, rather than binding the nicotinamide cofactor NADPH directly.|$|E

It includes a conserved aspartic acid (D564) and a glutamic acid (E566) residue that non-covalently bind a divalent metal cofactor ion through the carboxylic acid functional groups. This metal ion can be magnesium, manganese or cobalt depending on the organism, and its role is to coordinate the phosphoenolpyruvate molecule {{as well as the}} reaction intermediates. A histidine (H138) residue at the active site is believed to facilitate proton transfer during the catalytic mechanism.|$|E

However, these Hydrogenase enzymes were found to be highly sensitive with di-oxygen, which can over oxidize and inactivate them. Even after the oxygen was removed, they don’t regain catalytic activity immediately but through multiple processes.|$|E

The computational methods described allow the incorporation of transition-state structures and other small molecules into protein design calculations. These design procedures were tested through redesign of the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> of Escherichia coli chorismate mutase. The six predicted mutations were experimentally characterized and most maintained or increased the catalytic activity of the enzyme. To further investigate the context of the mutations predicted in the calculation and the tolerance of a natural <b>enzyme</b> to secondary <b>active</b> <b>site</b> mutations, extensive substitution experiments were performed. The effect of every amino acid in five <b>active</b> <b>site</b> hydrophobic positions and one N-capping position was evaluated.
