2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} Erebor, the Dwarves sent Bilbo into Smaug's lair, and he {{was initially}} successful in stealing a beautiful golden cup as Smaug slept fitfully.

[...] Unsuccessful, he returned to his hoard to lie in wait. [...] Having been nearly killed in the dragon's search, the Dwarves send Bilbo down the secret tunnel a second time. Smaug sensed Bilbo's presence immediately, even though Bilbo had rendered himself invisible with the One Ring, and accused the Hobbit (correctly) of trying to steal from him.
