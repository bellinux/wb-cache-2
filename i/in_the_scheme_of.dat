5|$|The first element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> painted {{architecture}} is {{a definition of}} the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, {{the symbol of the}} family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is a saprotrophic species, {{deriving}} {{nutrients from}} dead and decomposing organic matter, and grows {{in and around}} stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on bark, particularly the secondary phloem, rather than the wood. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> the succession of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, C.micaceus is a late stage colonizer, and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached [...] "a friable softened consistency". A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an endophyte, inhabiting the woody tissue of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms. The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots; {{it has also been}} noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments. In one instance it was discovered about 120m (400ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden gangways and props used to support the roof.|$|E

Even in the 21st century, the Statute of Anne is [...] "frequently invoked by modern judges and academics as embodying the utilitarian underpinnings of copyright law". In IceTV v Nine Network, for example, the High Court of Australia noted that the title of the Statute [...] "echoed explicitly the emphasis on the practical or utilitarian importance that certain seventeenth-century philosophers attached to knowledge and its encouragement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> human progress". Despite [...] "widely recognised flaws", the Act became a model copyright statute, both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Christophe Geiger notes that it is [...] "a difficult, almost impossible task" [...] to analyse the relationship between the Statute of Anne and early French copyright law, both because it is difficult to make a direct connection, and because the ongoing debate over both has led to radically different interpretations of each nation's law.|$|E

At the service, the ministers voted to march to Loeb's office that day and insist he address the workers' grievances and end the strike; led by Wax and William Dimmick, the dean of St. Mary's Cathedral, 250 clergymen marched in pairs to Loeb's office, where he was urged in front of television cameras to end the strike. In his sermon at Temple Israel, Wax told the congregation: [...] "This city shall witness a new spirit and the memory of this great prophet of our time shall be honored. There will be bigots and segregationists and the so-called respectable but unrighteous people who will resist. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> history, God's will does prevail."

500|$|Over {{time the}} Liliaceae became {{increasingly}} broadly, and somewhat arbitrarily, defined as all {{species of plants}} with six tepals and a superior ovary. They eventually came to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species, within the order Liliales <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> Arthur Cronquist (1981). Cronquist was a [...] "lumper" [...] preferring {{a small number of}} very large groupings and his classification of the Liliaceae represented the greatest expansion of the family to date. Cronquist placed most flowering petaloid monocots with six stamens in this very broad (and clearly polyphyletic) family, hence the alternative name lilioid monocots. He rejected the importance of ovary position and thus included with the Liliaceae with their superior ovary (hypogynous), the Amaryllidaceae, some species of which had an inferior ovary (epigynous), and which others separated into a distinct family. The Liliaceae were one of the major families in the Cronquist system which included 22 families in addition to Liliaceae in the more restricted sense (sensu stricto, s.s.) used by others. Later more conventional schemes include the system of Robert F. Thorne and that of Armen Takhtajan which characterised the family as petaloid monocots, characterised by showy flowers with tepals and without starch in the endosperm.|$|E

2500|$|This form of {{legislative}} over-ruling, if done frequently, has two major detrimental effects.

Speaking in Parliament during the Second Reading of the bill amending the Constitution to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze, the Minister for Law S.

2500|$|Hegel's {{thinking}} can {{be understood}} as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes Plato and Immanuel Kant. To this list one could add Proclus, Meister Eckhart, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Plotinus, Jakob Böhme, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from materialists like Epicurus and Thomas Hobbes, and from empiricists like David Hume, is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important ontological implications, for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the Phaedo, Republic, and Timaeus) of the soul as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While Aristotle criticizes Plato's [...] "Forms," [...] he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos, and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom, as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.|$|E

[...] Levy also wrote, [...] "Like Bonnie & Clyde, Dominik's seminal Western is a brilliant, poetic saga of America's legendary criminal as well as meditative deconstruction of our culture's most persistent issues: link of crime and fame, myths of heroism and obsession with celebrity." [...] Lewis Beale of Film Journal International said [...] "Impeccably shot, cast and directed, this is a truly impressive film from sophomore writer-director Andrew Dominik... but suffers from an unfortunate case of elephantiasis." [...] Beale said Affleck is [...] "outstanding in a breakout performance" [...] and said Pitt is [...] "scary and charismatic." [...] Beale wrote, [...] "The director seems {{so in love with}} his languorous pacing, he's incapable of cutting the five or ten seconds in any number of scenes that could have given the film a more manageable running time. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> things, however, this amounts to little more than a quibble."

2500|$|A {{month later}} (15 October 1935), the General Staff {{released}} {{a revision of}} the doctrinal guide for the Air Corps, training regulation TR 440-15 Employment of the Air Forces of the Army. [...] A year earlier MacArthur had changed TR 440-15 to clarify [...] "the Air Corps's place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> national defense and... (to do away with)... misconceptions and interbranch prejudices." [...] The General Staff characterized its latest revision as a [...] "compromise" [...] with airpower advocates, to mitigate public criticism of the Joint Action Statement, but the newest revision parroted the anti-autonomy conclusions of the Drum and Baker Boards, and reasserted its long-held position (and that of the Secretary Dern) that auxiliary support of the ground forces was the primary mission of the Air Corps. [...] TR 440-15 did acknowledge some doctrinal principles asserted by the ACTS (including the necessity of destroying an enemy's air forces and concentrating air forces against primary objectives) and recognized that future wars would probably entail some missions [...] "beyond the sphere of influence of the Ground Forces" [...] (strategic bombardment), {{but it did not}} attach any importance to prioritization of targets, weakening its effectiveness as doctrine. The Air Corps in general assented to the changes, as it did to other compromises of the period, as acceptable for the moment. TR 440-15 remained the doctrinal position of the Air Corps until it was superseded by the first Air Corps Field Manual, FM 1–5 Employment of Aviation of the Army, on 15 April 1940.|$|E
