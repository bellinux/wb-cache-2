40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} characterization {{of a typical}} indoor wireless propagation channel is performed. This channel characterization is needed for short range applications (< 10 m), utilizing Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) techniques. Both the line of sight (LOS) and the non line of sight (NLOS) scenarios are taken into account. The characterization is done using time domain measurements of the transmission-reception path, using very short pulses that are propagating through the wireless channel. In order to obtain the channel’s impulse response we utilize the CLEAN algorithm for the time-domain deconvolution technique. The characteristics of the channel that are measured {{in this study are}} the path loss, the shadowing effect, the mean <b>excess</b> delay <b>spread,</b> the RMS delay spread and the number of dominant paths...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To characterize epigenetic signatures of autism in prefrontal cortex neurons. DESIGN: We performed fluorescence-activated sorting and separation of neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei from postmortem prefrontal cortex, digested the chromatin with micrococcal nuclease, and deeply sequenced the DNA from the mononucleosomes with trimethylated H 3 K 4 (H 3 K 4 me 3), a histone mark associated with transcriptional regulation. Approximately 15 billion base pairs of H 3 K 4 me 3 -enriched sequences were collected from 32 brains. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 subjects diagnosed as having autism and 16 control subjects {{ranging in age from}} 0. 5 to 70 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genomic loci showing autism-associated H 3 K 4 me 3 changes in prefrontal cortex neurons. RESULTS: Subjects with autism showed no evidence for generalized disruption of the developmentally regulated remodeling of the H 3 K 4 me 3 landscape that defines normal prefrontal cortex neurons in early infancy. However, <b>excess</b> <b>spreading</b> of H 3 K 4 me 3 from the transcription start sites into downstream gene bodies and upstream promoters was observed specifically in neuronal chromatin from 4 of 16 autism cases but not in controls. Variable subsets of autism cases exhibit altered H 3 K 4 me 3 peaks at numerous genes regulating neuronal connectivity, social behaviors, and cognition, often in conjunction with altered expression of the corresponding transcripts. Autism-associated H 3 K 4 me 3 peaks were significantly enriched in genes and loci implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases.

A {{recently}} described selective {{tibial nerve}} block at the popliteal crease presents {{a viable alternative}} to sciatic nerve block for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. In this two-part investigation, we describe the effects of a tibial nerve block at the popliteal crease. Methods. In embalmed cadavers, after the ultrasound-guided dye injection the dissection revealed proximal spread of dye within the paraneural sheath. Consequentially, in the clinical study twenty patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty received the ultrasound-guided selective tibial nerve block at the popliteal crease, which also resulted in proximal spread of local anesthetic. A sensorimotor exam was performed to monitor the effect on the peroneal nerve. Results. In the cadaver study, dye was observed to spread proximal in the paraneural sheath to reach the sciatic nerve. In the clinical observational study, local anesthetic was observed to spread a mean of 4. 7 + 1. 9 (SD) cm proximal to popliteal crease.

Securitisation is advantageous both for originating banks, who incur savings on bank capital costs and for investors, who acquire a stake in leveraged credit portfolio risk, an exposure type rarely accessible otherwise. Securitisation is cost-efficiently implemented by structured credit derivatives, issued securities are therefore referred to as synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). We perform arbitrage-free pricing of synthetic CDOs referring to investment grade European corporate debt, such that a comparison with observed transactions can be drawn. CDO payout rules are formalised, taking both direct risk transfer structures and synthetic transactions using SPVs for <b>excess</b> <b>spread</b> trapping into account. Underlying losses are captured by a reduced-form affine multi-factor model, exploiting the strong observed comovement of corporate spreads for systematic factor estimation.

A comparison with transactions accommodating our modelling approach with regard to payout rules and reference debt quality supports the hypothesis that investors have a strong preference for CDO investments: Observed note issuance spreads provide no adequate compensation for the leveraged portfolio risk exposure.

40|$|Abstract: Cyclic Prefix (CP) {{is one of}} the key OFDM parameters. It is used to {{completely}} eliminate both Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) as long as the CP length is greater than the channel delay spread. By eliminating the ISI and ICI, the CP compensates for the effect of the multi-path dispersion; but it consumes a considerable amount of the scarce spectrum and the power. Contemporary OFDM systems usually use a fixed and large CP length to tolerate worst case channel condition. This technique, however, causes a loss in bandwidth efficiency as well as consumes relatively more transmitter energy. Therefore, there is a need to adopt the CP length based on the channel parameters. This paper investigates the effect of varying the CP length on the OFDM system over different wireless channel models, where the variable CP length is estimated based on the Maximum <b>Excess</b> Delay <b>Spread</b> (MEDS) of the channel. According to this method, the estimated CP length optimizes the system capacity and improves the overall system performance...|$|R

The performance of narrowband and wideband direction-based beamformers is investigated in terms of improving channel metrics such as the delay <b>spread,</b> <b>excess</b> delay, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The perfor-mance of the direction-based beamformers is compared with dominant eigenmode transmission and statistical beamforming. Our analysis reveals that in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, the two direction-based beamformers have a similar performance that approaches the upper bound set by dominant eigenmode transmission. In non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios, the direction-based beamformers show a performance degradation in relation to the upper bound, with the narrowband beamformer worse off than the wideband variant. The array gain in our measured NLOS scenarios is observed to exceed the theoretical upper limit valid for a rich scattering environment. We show that this result follows from the spatial structure of the measured NLOS channels that has only a few strong reflected components. We investigate the influence of array size on beamforming performance; 5 × 5 planar arrays are observed to improve the channel’s delay metrics as well as the larger 7 × 7 planar arrays.

The performance of narrowband and wideband direction-based beamformers is investigated in terms of improving channel metrics such as the delay <b>spread,</b> <b>excess</b> delay, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The performance of the direction-based beamformers is compared with dominant eigenmode transmission and statistical beamforming. Our analysis reveals that in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, the two direction-based beamformers have a similar performance that approaches the upper bound set by dominant eigenmode transmission. In non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios, the direction-based beamformers show a performance degradation in relation to the upper bound, with the narrowband beamformer worse off than the wideband variant. The array gain in our measured NLOS scenarios is observed to exceed the theoretical upper limit valid for a rich scattering environment. We show that this result follows from the spatial structure of the measured NLOS channels that has only a few strong reflected components. We investigate the influence of array size on beamforming performance; 5 × 5 planar arrays are observed to improve the channel's delay metrics as well as the larger 7 × 7 planar arrays...|$|R
40|$|The escape widths {{for direct}} proton decay from {{isobaric}} analog states in Sb and 1 nuclei {{have been obtained}} by combining calculated single-particle widths with experimental spectroscopic information for neutron pickup reactions on the respective Sn and Te target nuclei. They display a pronounced odd-A/even-A staggering effect with very small widths for the even-A isotopes due to the lower proton decay energies. Only data for odd-A nuclei are available, and there is good agreement. Combining the calculated escape widths with the known experimental total widths yields values for the spreading widths. As expected, and in agreement with theoretical predictions, the spreading widths are essentially constant and dependent only weakly on neutron <b>excess.</b> interestingly, the <b>spreading</b> widths are independent of whether statistical isospin-violating neutron decay is energetically possible or not, {{as is the case}} for the isobaric analog states of the light Sn isotopes with A < 116. The branching ratios for the isospin-forbidden neutron decays from the isobaric analog states average about 95 % for the heavier even-A Sb isotopes, and about 60 % for the odd-A isotopes. Gamma-ray deexcitation and direct and statistical proton decay compete in the decays of the IAS of the light Sn isotopes, and a branching ratio of about 90 % for gamma-ray deexcitation is expected for the IAS in 112 Sb...|$|R
