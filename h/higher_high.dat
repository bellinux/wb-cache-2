25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high waters and two low waters each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters {{on a given}} day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> water and the lower high water in tide tables. Similarly, the two low waters each day are the higher low water and the lower low water. The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the moon}} is moving in its orbit around the earth {{and in the same}} sense as the Earth's rotation, a point on the earth must rotate {{slightly}} further to catch up so that the time between semidiurnal tides is not twelve but 12.4206 hours—a bit over twenty-five minutes extra. The two peaks are not equal. The two high tides a day alternate in maximum heights: lower high (just under three feet), <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> (just over three feet), and again lower high. Likewise for the low tides.|$|E

25|$|The Pacific (inter-)decadal {{oscillation}} is {{a climate}} switch phenomenon {{that results in}} changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño. This {{has an effect on}} sea levels. For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Niño on sea levels to an upward pressure of La Niña on sea levels, which upward pressure causes more frequent and <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> tide levels. The Perigean spring tide (often called a king tide) can result in seawater flooding low-lying areas of the islands of Tuvalu.|$|E
25|$|The {{exposure}} of Kiribati {{to changes in}} sea levels is exacerbated by the Pacific decadal oscillation, which is a climate switch phenomenon that results in changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño. This {{has an effect on}} sea levels. For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Niño on sea levels to an upward pressure of La Niña on sea levels, which upward pressure causes more frequent and <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> tide levels.

25|$|Cuckoo hashing, another {{technique}} for implementing hash tables, guarantees constant time per lookup (regardless of the hash function). Insertions into a cuckoo hash table may fail, causing the entire table to be rebuilt, but such failures are sufficiently {{unlikely that the}} expected time per insertion (using either a truly random hash function or a hash function with logarithmic independence) is constant. With tabulation hashing, on the other hand, the best bound known on the failure probability is <b>higher,</b> <b>high</b> enough that insertions cannot be guaranteed to take constant expected time. Nevertheless, tabulation hashing is adequate to ensure the linear-expected-time construction of a cuckoo hash table for a static set of keys that does not change as the table is used.|$|E

2500|$|Studies {{have also}} {{examined}} {{the impact of}} homeschooling on students' GPAs. Cogan (2010) found that homeschooled students had <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> school GPAs (3.74) and transfer GPAs (3.65) than conventional students. Snyder (2013) provided corroborating evidence that homeschoolers were outperforming their peers {{in the areas of}} standardized tests and overall GPAs. Looking beyond high school, a study by the 1990 National Home Education Research Institute (as cited by Wichers, 2001) found that at least 33% of home schooled students attended a four-year college, and 17% attended a two-year college. [...] This same study examined the students after one year, finding that that 17% pursued higher education. Thus, the data indicates that homeschooling can also prepare students for success in higher education.|$|E
50|$|In other words, despite {{stronger}} momentum {{as seen by}} the <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> {{or lower}} low in the RSI, price could not make a <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> or lower low. This is evidence the main trend is about to resume. Cardwell noted that positive reversals only happen in uptrends while negative reversals only occur in downtrends, and therefore their existence confirms the trend.|$|E
50|$|One {{break-out}} {{above the}} previous highest high or ceiling of a trading range is termed a <b>higher</b> <b>high.</b> Since trading ranges {{are difficult to}} trade, the price action trader will often wait after seeing the first <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> and on {{the appearance of a}} second break-out followed by its failure, this will be taken as a high probability bearish trade, with the middle of the range as the profit target. This is favoured firstly because the middle of the trading range will tend to act as a magnet for price action, secondly because the <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> is a few points higher and therefore offers a few points more profit if successful, and thirdly due to the supposition that two consecutive failures of the market to head in one direction will result in a tradable move in the opposite.|$|E

50|$|Tides in Puget Sound are of {{the mixed}} type with two high and two low tides each tidal day. These are called <b>Higher</b> <b>High</b> Water (HHW), Lower Low Water (LLW), Lower High Water (LHW), and Higher Low Water (HLW). The {{configuration}} of basins, sills, and interconnections cause the tidal range to increase within Puget Sound. The difference in height between the <b>Higher</b> <b>High</b> Water and the Lower Low Water averages about 8.3 ft at Port Townsend on Admiralty Inlet, but increases to about 14.4 ft at Olympia, {{the southern end of}} Puget Sound.|$|E
