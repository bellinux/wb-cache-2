For outpatient records with a progress note, SUD clinic stop code, SUD diagnosis code, and mental <b>health</b> <b>procedure</b> code, we found chart documentation of SUD care in 92. 0 % of 601 records: 82. 5 % of 372 records with a SUD clinic stop code and SUD diagnosis code but no mental <b>health</b> <b>procedure</b> code, 21. 9 % of 379 records with a SUD clinic stop code and mental <b>health</b> <b>procedure</b> code but no SUD diagnosis code, and 55. 3 % of 318 records with a SUD clinic stop code but no SUD diagnosis or mental <b>health</b> <b>procedure</b> code. For inpatient stays with a SUD bed section code and a progress note, we found chart documentation of SUD care in 99. 0 % of 699 records accompanied by a SUD diagnosis but 0 % of 39 records without a SUD diagnosis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: As special {{education}} teachers have increasing numbers of students requiring <b>health</b> care <b>procedures</b> in their classrooms, school nurses need to help these teachers maintain a safe, healthy environment for their students. Part of this consists of having teachers know the steps to take should certain problems arise. This article examines the receptivity of using an expanded version of an individualized health care plan (IHP) to provide critical information to address health care problems, as well as having individualized education program (IEP) objectives for instructional targets identi®ed in the IHP. The ®ndings {{of this study indicate}} that a high percent-age of school nurses and {{special education}} teachers were in favor of an expanded version of the IHP. There was also support for teaching students to independently or partially participate in performing their own <b>health</b> care <b>procedures</b> and having this instruction formalized as IEP objectives.

40|$|Background: Increased life {{expectancy}} {{for people with}} intellectual disability is accompanied by increased age-related health concerns. People ageing with intellectual disability experience more health conditions and are relocated to aged care earlier than their age peers. Method: Group home staff were surveyed about their (a) training and confidence in 11 health conditions and 7 <b>health</b> <b>procedures,</b> and (b) attitude to relocating residents with health needs to aged care. Results: Staff training in each of 10 health conditions and 7 <b>health</b> <b>procedures</b> was positively associated with increased confidence in supporting residents with those health issues. Higher staff confidence in caring for residents with 9 conditions and requiring 4 procedures was negatively associated with a likelihood of recommending that a person with those health needs should relocate to aged care. Conclusions: Targeted training of staff in age-related health issues may contribute to better health care and delay residents relocating to aged care...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the oral health status and oral microflora {{of children who}} have received heart and heart-lung transplants. Parental knowledge and current practice of oral <b>health</b> <b>procedures</b> by the child were also investigated. SAMPLE AND METHOD: Thirty-five children attending the Cardio-Thoracic Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children were included. Measurements were compared with children matched by age and gender attending the trauma clinic at the Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital. Teeth were examined for {{the presence or absence}} of caries or enamel defects. Plaque deposition, gingivitis, gingival bleeding and gingival enlargement were measured and a swab was taken to look at the oral microbial flora. A questionnaire was used to assess parental knowledge of dental <b>health</b> <b>procedures</b> and the current practice of these. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between transplant and control children in caries experience, plaque or gingivitis. Children with heart or heart-lung transplants had significantly greater numbers of enamel defects and more gingival enlargement than control children, children in the heart transplant group had significantly more gingival bleeding. There was little difference in the dental knowledge and reported behaviour of the transplant group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The dental needs of heart and heart-lung transplant patients treated at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children were similar to those of the control group in this study, however further improvement could be made in educating parents and children on the importance of caries prevention and good oral hygiene.
