5000|$|According to Elite {{the title}} track [...] "4 Your Eyez Only" [...] started the entire concept of the album, he said: [...] That was a beat he found on SoundCloud by a {{producer}} who was pretty unknown BLVK and just blacked out for like 24 hours. He wrote and wrote and wrote to that loop. That was one song he expressed to me like, ‘we got to make this worthy of an album.’ You can’t just have an eight-minute song. [...] The track [...] "Ville Mentality" [...] features a spoken interlude performed by a young girl. The girl was recorded by Cole while visiting and speaking with kids at an elementary school in his hometown, Fayetteville, North Carolina. The foundation for the track [...] "For Whom the Bell Tolls" [...] was produced by New York University student Elijah Scarlett, Dreamville president Ibrahim Hamad discovered the beat on SoundCloud in January 2016 and reached out to Scarlett. Cole provided co-production, Nico Segal, Anthony Ware, and Theo Croker added horns, while duo Chargaux added strings. 4 Your Eyez Only is Scarlett's first major production credit, having previously only collaborating with friends. Producer Cardiak with help from Frank Dukes created the beat for the track [...] "Immortal" [...] with Cole in mind shortly {{after the release of}} Cole's previous album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive. In an interview with XXL [...] magazine Cardiak said, [...] "You know I was just always working on stuff for J. Cole. I had a idea of like the type of tracks he wanted, the sound and all that. I was just crafting a couple tracks. Shortly after 2014 Forest Hills Drive came out, I sent that beat over and he liked it and he told me to put it to the side and here we are today." [...] Classical string duo Chargaux are credited on seven of the album's ten tracks, and were on many of the songs that got cut. They previously collaborated with Cole on the track [...] "St. Tropez" [...] from 2014 Forest Hills Drive. They provided string arrangements, background vocals and addition production on 4 Your Eyez Only. Similar to his previous album, 4 Your Eyez Only contains no features, other than Dreamville signee Ari Lennox who provided additional vocals on the track [...] "Change". Ibrahim Hamad (Cole's manager) spoke on it saying: [...] "Cole's never gonna force anything. He's not the guy that's out, hanging out with rappers or in the studio with rappers all day. He's really in the studio with his team and making music with his producers and his artists. He's done songs with other people involved but it might not make the album. artist Ari Lennox's voice made the album on [...] "Change" [...] because she came in, added something to it and it worked. If it doesn't work, Cole's not gonna put it on there because it's a name. He's never gonna put it on there just to say he got a feature." [...] He continued saying, [...] "He also didn't go into it like, [...] "I'm gonna have no features on this album." [...] He didn't go into Forest Hills Drive initially saying he was gonna have no features. That's just how it ended up. At the end of the day, {{the most important thing to}} him and to all of us <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> get this point that we're trying to get through and how do we make the best version of a song?".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Scottish initiative (arising {{out of a}} EU funded development project) involving university researchers, a local authority curriculum development officer {{and a group of}} teachers interested in developing more inquiry based approaches in science education. The project is not one in which the researchers bring prescriptions from research. Rather, it is seen as a joint effort aimed at solving practitioners' conceptual and practice issues. The overall question for the teachers <b>was,</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> I (<b>we)</b> make our practice more inquiry based? The question for the researchers <b>was,</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> help you (the interested science teachers) to make your practice more inquiry based? This has two sub-questions: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> help you to conceptualise the issues? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> help you to solve the practice problems? As it turned out, the particular group of teachers <b>we</b> worked with <b>did</b> not ask for help with practice issues, so we have not made much progress in answering the second question. Therefore, this paper will focus on the first. We seem to have been successful in helping the teachers to acquire some useful conceptual tools for thinking about and changing their practice in ways that they valued for themselves. Perhaps the answer to the second question is that researchers can help teachers to solve their practice problems by helping them to conceptualise the issues...|$|R

40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} {{models of}} human and animal learning usually concentrate on how we learn the relationship between different stimuli or actions and rewards. However, in real world situations stimuli are ill-defined. On the one hand, our immediate environment is extremely multi-dimensional. On the other hand, in every decision-making scenario only a few aspects of the environment are relevant for obtaining reward, while most are irrelevant. Thus a key question <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> learn these relevant dimensions, that <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> learn what to learn about? We investigated this process of representation learning experimentally, using a task in which one stimulus dimension was relevant for determining reward at each point in time. As in real life situations, in our task the relevant dimension can change without warning, adding ever-present uncertainty engendered by a constantly changing environment. We show that human performance on this task is better described by a suboptimal strategy based on selective attention and serial hypothesis testing rather than a normative strategy based on probabilistic inference. From this, we conjecture {{that the problem of}} inferring relevance in general scenarios is too computationally demanding for the brain to solve optimally. As a result the brain utilizes approximations, employing these even in simplified scenarios in which optimal representation learning is tractable, such as the one in our experiment...|$|E
