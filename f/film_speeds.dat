500|$|Nick Chinlund {{returned}} to the series to reprise his role as Pfaster. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, eventually settled on Scott Wilson {{for the role of}} Orison believing that he could pull off the [...] "dual nature" [...] of the character better than anyone else. The episode featured several complex scenes, most notably the shot at the beginning, where time slows to a stop. Bowman used several different takes, all filmed at different <b>film</b> <b>speeds</b> in order to achieve the right effect. The final fight scene between Scully and Pfaster took {{a day and a half}} to film. Many of the episodes scenes were filmed in Downey, California. Make-up for the episode was done by John Vulich, who sought to [...] "pay homage" [...] to the make-up in the original episode. In order to do this, Vulich perused several fan sites and downloaded photos that he used as models.|$|E
500|$|The Bomb Squad {{listened to}} various music records and used {{devices such as}} the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler, the Akai S900 sampler, and a Macintosh {{computer}} to arrange samples and sequence tracks. The sessions, which were recorded by Shocklee for future reference, had the group playing beats and records while collecting potential sample material. Chuck D has said that [...] "95 {{percent of the time}} it sounded like mess. But there was 5 percent of magic that would happen." [...] Shocklee compared their production to that of filmmaking, [...] "with different lighting effects, or <b>film</b> <b>speeds,</b> or whatever", while Chuck D found their intention to [...] "blend sound" [...] similar to a visual artist [...] "tak yellow and blue and come up with green". He said of their approach in a 1990 interview for Keyboard Magazine, [...] "We approach every record like it was a painting. Sometimes, on the sound sheet, {{we have to have a}} separate sheet just to list the samples for each track. We used about 150, maybe 200 samples on Fear of a Black Planet." ...|$|E
2500|$|On modern cameras, {{especially}} when aperture {{is set on}} the camera body, f-number is often divided more finely than steps of one stop. Steps of one-third stop (1/3 EV) are the most common, since this matches the ISO system of <b>film</b> <b>speeds.</b> Half-stop steps are used on some cameras. Usually the full stops are marked, and the intermediate positions are clicked. As an example, the aperture that is one-third stop smaller than 2.8 is 3.2, two-thirds smaller is 3.5, and one whole stop smaller is 4. The next few f-stops in this sequence are: ...|$|E

2500|$|The video {{features}} prominent {{special effects}} scene transitions between shots. Notably, a high-speed zoom effect {{which makes it}} appear that the foreground subject has not changed to a new shot while the background has, fades {{in and out of}} white, and shifting between different <b>film</b> <b>speeds</b> during shots. Another special effects sequence using greenscreen, in which the band, dressed in white, would perform a dance sequence while being manipulated over the backdrop of the Tom Bradley terminal lobby was mostly cut from the video, as it was felt that a dance sequence did not fit with the song, though elements of the dance remain in the second chorus, as do non-dance elements in that sequence.|$|E
