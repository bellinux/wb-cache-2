5|$|Murray cod, like {{a number}} of other Murray-Darling native fish species, have also managed to cross the Great Dividing Range at least once through natural river capture events, leading to several species and {{subspecies}} of coastal cod. The best known are eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> South Wales, and Mary River cod of the Mary River system in south eastern Queensland, both of which are endangered, but survive today. Coastal cod were also found in the Richmond River system <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> South Wales and the Brisbane River system in southern Queensland, but are now extinct.|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the Clarence River <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> South Wales. His surname is {{believed}} to have possibly derived from that of Francis Henry Marsh, whose property Camira was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range. Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.|$|E

5|$|Like other banksias, Banksia spinulosa plays host to a {{wide variety}} of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. Banksias have been the subject of many studies about their pollination; B.spinulosa is no exception. A 1998 study in Bungawalbin National Park <b>in</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>New</b> South Wales found that B.spinulosa var.collina inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, {{including}} marsupials such as Antechinus flavipes (yellow-footed antechinus), which carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectar-eating birds, making them effective pollinators. The same study noted that, unlike other banksias studied, B.spinulosa var.collina was visited predominantly by native bees rather than the introduced Apis mellifera (European honeybee).|$|E

5|$|September 28, 2004- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Jeanne, combined with two cold fronts, produce heavy rainfall peaking at 8.01inches (203mm) in Newark. The precipitation leads to rising rivers, including the Red Clay Creek which crests at 13.59feet (4.14m) The rainfall also floods {{roads in the}} northern portion of the state, resulting in trapped vehicles. The {{remnants of}} Jeanne also spawn an F2 tornado <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> Castle County. The tornado's 5mile (8km) path includes moving through the New Castle Airport and several buildings. The tornado damages numerous planes and buildings {{at the airport and}} injures five people.

5|$|The {{final stage}} of the {{campaign}} saw the Japanese resistance finally break. A swift advance by the Australians along the northern coast of the peninsula followed and in January 1944 they captured Sio. At the same time, the Americans landed at Saidor. After this, mopping up operations were undertaken by Allied forces around Sio until March and Madang was captured in April. A lull period then followed <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> Guinea until July when US forces clashed with the Japanese around the Driniumor River. This was followed by further fighting in November 1944 when the Australians opened a fresh campaign in Aitape–Wewak.|$|E

5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>New</b> Mexico.|$|E
