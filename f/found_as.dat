5|$|He {{disappeared}} from the records until <b>found</b> <b>as</b> Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is possible that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295. Nicholas is <b>found</b> <b>as</b> Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E

This copy is a poor-quality videocassette dub and has a burned-in time code in the corner indicating that the film was not meant for public viewing. However, the European, Japanese and Australian DVD releases restore three minutes of the violent footage missing from the Region 1 DVD (that was cut for an R rating), making them the versions closest to Woo's original cut.|$|E
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} <b>found</b> <b>as</b> incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging.

5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been <b>found</b> <b>as</b> ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found to}} be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was <b>found</b> <b>as</b> far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not <b>found</b> <b>as</b> a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early bells not only have an important role in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. With the emergence of other kinds of bells during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also <b>found</b> <b>as</b> part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E

Cottontail rabbits and wood rabbits live throughout the Hills, as do squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, and porcupines. Wild burro and bobcat can be <b>found,</b> <b>as</b> well as bison in limited quantity. Woodpecker, robin, sparrow, jay, bobwhite, and wren are Black Hills birds.|$|E

5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been <b>found</b> <b>as</b> far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E
5|$|DNA is <b>found</b> <b>as</b> linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is {{an organized}} structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|Early on August3, Colin's {{forward motion}} increased, and the cyclone {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted. As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August4, but no closed circulation was <b>found.</b> <b>As</b> the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August5, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August5 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280mi (450km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
