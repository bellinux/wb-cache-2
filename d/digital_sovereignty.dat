40|$|The {{digitalisation}} of {{an ever-increasing}} number {{of goods and}} services is causing an unprecedented and radical shift in consumer lifestyles and habits: The distinction between suppliers and demanders is becoming blurred, and consumers are more and more frequently taking on the role of supplier of those goods or services. Regulatory tasks which were previously the prerogative of the State can now be found as the default settings in algorithms applied by private-sector companies. The Advisory Council for Consumer Affairs (Sachverständigenrat für Verbraucherfragen, SVRV) has set itself the task of investigating whether consumer law as it currently stands is able to meet the requirements of a digital world. For the Advisory Council, “consumer law 2. 0 ” means that it is no longer possible to carry on with business as usual and that consumer law urgently needs an update. This report builds upon external studies which the Advisory Council commissioned in 2016 and upon papers published in its Working Paper Series. It continues a series of reports which the Advisory Council has published on digitalisation in trade, finance, health and crowdfunding, and it prepares the ground for forthcoming reports on <b>digital</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and consumer scoring. The Advisory Council would like to express its particular thanks to Prof Dr Hans-W. Micklitz, who had overall responsibility for this report, to Prof Gesche Joost and Ms Helga Zander- Hayat for their outstanding support, to Ass-Prof Dr Kai Purnhagen, Prof Dr Peter Rott, Prof Dr Gerald Spindler, Ass-Prof Dr Stefan Wahlen and Prof Dr Christiane Wendehorst, who made their expertise available {{in the context of the}} external studies, and to the Advisory Council Office, especially Dr Irina Domurath, for providing contextual and administrative assistance in the writing of the report...|$|E
40|$|Mobile phones {{have become}} {{important}} daily companions {{for millions of}} people which help to organize both their private and their professional lives. Having access to data such as the calendar or the address book anywhere, anytime, has become commonplace. Sensor data such as the phone's GPS location and accelerometer help users navigate through the physical world. Users can furthermore extend the functionality of their phone using small programs called apps from various developers and vendors in an open ecosystem. Undoubtedly, having all this data merged on a device that is always-on and always-connected and that can easily be extended with new software greatly improves user convenience. On the other hand, it also poses new questions with regard to privacy and security. Apps may misuse the data stored on the phone or obtained from the sensors to infringe upon the user's privacy. In fact, companies already now use location data and app usage statistics to build user profiles for the purpose of targeted advertisement. The user is oftentimes unaware of these data leaks originating from his phone and has little means for analyzing the actual behavior of a given app with regard to privacy. Static data flow analysis has been proposed as a means for automatically enumerating the data flows inside a program. Still, either do not support Android's platform-specific semantics or fall short on precision, recall, or scalability. In this thesis, we therefore propose techniques for efficiently and precisely performing static data flow analysis on real-world binary-only Android apps with large code sizes. We present the FlowDroid tool and show that it can detect data leaks in popular apps such as Facebook, Paypal, and LinkedIn. The FlowDroid reports improve the user's <b>digital</b> <b>sovereignty</b> by allowing his to asses the behavior of the app before installing it on his device and thereby entrusting it with his personal data. We allow the user to verify which of his data leaves the device and how. On the DroidBench micro-benchmark suite, we show that FlowDroid achieves a precision of more than 87...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and use of}} steadily growing sets of data from business processes and consumer interactions and the intelligent linking of data provide tremendous development potential for the digital economy, but also involve risks that are widely discussed in association with data privacy. At the same time, of course, consumers also benefit from innovative and new products and services which are only made possible by intelligent data analysis. But when digital data becomes the raw material for value added {{on the one hand}} and appealing products for connected life and work on the other hand it appears that these principles alone do not suffice any longer. Not least because due to technical reasons alone the cross‐linking of economy and society generates large amounts of new data that are often not even acknowledged by consumers and the creation of which they cannot prevent. Up until now, there has only been insufficient systematic assessment of the consumers’ experience associated with their data <b>sovereignty,</b> <b>digital</b> self‐determination respectively. However, the exercise of digital self‐determination by the consumers themselves and a corresponding rise of awareness is a key prerequisite for acting confidently in the digital world of the Internet of Things and in digital business processes. The following study provides answers to the following questions related to consumers’ digital self‐determination: What is a coherent, plausible concept of ‘digital self‐determination’? How can we measure (dimensions of) ‘digital self‐determination’? What degree/amount of ‘digital self‐determination’ do customers/users of digital media want? Based on the empirical results the concept of “digital self‐determination” is described and accentuated. On the one hand, it can thus be a foundation for a consumer‐centered adaptation of manufacturing or business processes. On the other hand, it can also provide implications for policy‐steering considerations...|$|R
