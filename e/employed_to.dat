5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, {{unemployment}} exceeded 25% statewide. Southern Indiana {{was hard}} hit, and unemployment topped 50% during the worst years. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) began operations in Indiana in July 1935. By October of that year, {{the agency had}} put 74,708 Hoosiers to work. In 1940, there were still 64,700 people working for agency. The majority of these workers were <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> improve the state's infrastructure: roads, bridges, flood control projects, and water treatment plants. Some helped index collections of libraries, and artists were <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> create murals for post offices and libraries. Nearly every community had a project to work on.|$|E
