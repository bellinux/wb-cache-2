5|$|In September 2013, Rolls-Royce {{announced}} that it had increased the AE-1107C engine's power by 17 percent via {{the adoption of a}} new Block 3 turbine, an increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> flow capacity, and accompanying software updates. The upgrade should increase the reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions and boost maximum payload limitations from 6,000ft to 8,000ft. A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26 percent, producing close to 10,000hp, and improve fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
25|$|The 1994 Formula One {{cheating}} controversy was {{a series}} of allegations made throughout the 1994 Formula One season. Several Formula One teams were involved, with the main allegations surrounding Benetton Formula. Initially, Benetton were alleged to have been using illegal software—namely traction control—to their advantage in races; however, this could not be sufficiently proven by the FIA. A refuelling fire on Jos Verstappen's Benetton car at the German Grand Prix led to renewed allegations and an investigation by Intertechnique at Benetton's team factory. Following the investigation, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) revealed Benetton had been using an illegal <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> without a fuel filter that allowed fuel into the car 12.5% faster than a legal <b>fuel</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

25|$|Atlantiss {{external}} {{tank for}} the STS-135 mission was put through a tanking test on 15 June 2011 {{to check the}} health of the tank's stringers. It was slightly delayed due to a lightning storm which passed over the Kennedy Space Center. During the test, technicians detected a hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> leak in Atlantiss main engine No. 3, as it recorded temperatures below normal levels. The leaking hydrogen valve was replaced on 21 June.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 1924, {{taking off}} at 3:58 A.M., Army test pilot First Lieutenant Russell Maughan left Mitchel Field, New York, in PW-8 24-204, {{modified}} with additional fuel and oil tanks, made a dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the US. Refueling five times, he landed at Crissy Field, San Francisco, California, at 9:46p.m., one minute before dusk, covering 2,670mi (4,297km) in 20 hours and 48 minutes. His flight time included four planned 30-minute stops at McCook Field, Ohio; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Salduro Siding, Utah; and an unplanned stop in North Platte, Nebraska for additional fuel when a muddy field in Missouri {{did not permit}} him {{to take on a}} full load. He also lost an hour at McCook to repair a broken <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> after an over-eager mechanic had over-torqued the valve, damaging it.|$|E
25|$|The first launch {{attempt was}} delayed by 24 hours due to weather concerns, {{including}} multiple weather violations in NASA's launch rules beginning over 2 {{hours before the}} scheduled launch. During the second attempt on Wednesday morning, {{a problem with a}} LH2 fill-and-drain <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> inside Discoverys aft compartment led to another scrubbing. The problem arose when sensors did not detect the closure of the valve when commanded to do so. The issue was thought to be with the sensors rather than the valve itself. After inerting the orbiter's tank, which involved draining it, tests were conducted on the valves. Despite the valves working normally, another delay was called for to have more confidence in the system, and to give the console operators who performed the test some rest. The launch team evaluated the issue, passing on a possible launch window on 27 August 2009 at 01:10 EDT. The launch was delayed until 23:59 EDT, 28 August 2009, to allow the engineers to be fully satisfied with the vehicle. Later the mission was cleared for launch which involved a flight rule waiver for cycling the valve and a discussion to analyze the test failure of an Ares-1 booster that was similar to the SRBs used for the mission. NASA feared another delay when storms formed near the Kennedy Space Center on 28 August 2009, but the weather cleared in time for a successful launch of Discovery at 23:59 EDT.|$|E

500|$|The HPFTP is a three-stage {{centrifugal}} pump {{driven by a}} two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the probe}} is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue's forward {{internal}} receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. [...] The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a NATO standard and were originally developed by the company Flight Refuelling Limited in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s. [...] This standardization allows drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations the ability to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations. [...] The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to {{the end of the}} probe. [...] This is so that if a large side or vertical load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> breaks off, rather than the probe or receiver aircraft suffering structural damage. [...] A so-called [...] "broken probe" [...] (actually a broken <b>fuel</b> <b>valve,</b> as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. [...] Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.|$|E

According to P-51 designer Edgar Schmued, the NA-73 was lost because test pilot Paul Balfour refused, before a high-speed test run, {{to go through}} the takeoff and flight test procedure with Schmued while the aircraft was on the ground, claiming [...] "one airplane was like another". After making two high speed passes over Mines Field, he forgot to put the <b>fuel</b> <b>valve</b> on [...] "reserve" [...] and during third pass ran out of fuel. Emergency landing in a freshly plowed field caused wheels to dig in, aircraft flipped over, airframe was not rebuilt, the second aircraft being used for subsequent testing.|$|E

In the following race in Argentina {{he was involved in}} a first-lap collision with McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen, and retired with an engine failure after only six laps. He finished eighth at the San Marino Grand Prix, and scored points with a fifth-place finish in Spain. After retiring from the Monaco Grand Prix, Irvine secured the first podium of his Formula One career with third place in Canada.

50|$|Fuel is piped through {{fuel lines}} to a <b>fuel</b> control <b>valve</b> (usually {{known as the}} <b>fuel</b> selector). This <b>valve</b> serves several {{function}}s. The first function is {{to act as a}} <b>fuel</b> shut-off <b>valve.</b> This is required to provide the crew with a means to prevent fuel reaching the engine in case of an engine fire. The second function is to allow the pilot to choose which tank feeds the engine. Many aircraft have the left tank and right tank selections available to the pilot. Some Cessna airplanes feed only from both tanks; and many have the option to feed from left, right, or both tanks. The reason to have left only and right only options is to allow pilots to balance fuel load to reduce the banking moment. In some aircraft, the shut-off function is a different valve located after the <b>fuel</b> selector <b>valve.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fuel leakage has {{the risk}} of being ignited by {{external}} ignition sources, and therefore it is important to detect any fuel leakage before the departure of the aircraft. Currently, there are no fuel leak detection systems installed on commercial aircrafts, to detect fuel tank leakage, while {{only a small number of}} more recent aircraft, have a fuel monitoring system, that generates a fuel leak-warning message in cockpit in the case of fuel imbalance between the tanks. The approach proposed in this paper requires the fuel vent ports on the wings to be replaced with <b>fuel</b> vent <b>valves,</b> which can be controlled to be in open or close position. The <b>fuel</b> vent <b>valve</b> will be in close position, when certain conditions are fulfilled (all the related <b>fuel</b> <b>valves</b> closed, pumps not operating, etc.), the fuel tank ullage area is then pressurized to 4 psi and the rate of change of the pressure is measured over a period. Several experiments have been conducted and, the result show that a continuous fuel leak of one liter per minute can be detected. Further experiments show that if the fuel tank is pressurized to higher pressures, a fuel leak can be detected sooner...|$|R
