40|$|Training and <b>exercises</b> are an {{important}} part of emergency management. Plans are developed based on threat assessment, but they are not useful unless staff members are trained on how to use the plan, and then practice that training. <b>Exercises</b> are also essential for ensuring that the plan is effective, and outcomes from <b>exercises</b> are used to improve the plan. <b>Exercises</b> have been {{an important}} part of gauging the preparedness of response organizations since Civil Defense days when full-scale <b>exercises</b> often included the community. Today there are various types of <b>exercises</b> that can be used to evaluate the preparedness of public agencies and communities: seminars, drills, tabletop <b>exercises,</b> functional <b>exercises,</b> facilitated <b>exercises</b> and full-scale <b>exercises.</b> Police and fire agencies have long used drills and full-scale <b>exercises</b> to evaluate the ability of staff to use equipment, protocols and plans. Transit and transportation agencies have seldom been included in these plans, and have little guidance for their participation in the <b>exercises.</b> A research plan was designed to determine whether urban transit systems are holding <b>exercises,</b> and whether they have the training and guidance documents that they need to be successful. The main research question was whether there was a need for a practical handbook to guide the development of transit system <b>exercises...</b>|$|R
