5|$|The Red Barn Murder was {{a notorious}} murder {{committed}} in Polstead, Suffolk, England in 1827. A young woman, Maria Marten, {{was shot dead}} by her lover William Corder. The two had arranged to meet at the Red Barn, a local landmark, before eloping to Ipswich. Maria was never seen alive again and Corder fled the scene. He sent letters to Marten's family claiming {{that she was in}} good health, but her body was later discovered buried in the barn after her stepmother spoke of having <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> the murder.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis {{themselves were}} at times not free from {{sharing in the}} popular beliefs. Thus, {{while there is a}} whole catalog of prognostications by means of Dreams in Ber. 55 et seq., and Rabbi Johanan claimed that those dreams are true which come in the morning or are <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> us by others, or are repeated, Rabbi Meïr declares that dreams help not and injure not. Dream interpretation is not however a factor in considering mythologyfication of Talmud knowledge since it was at the time a part of the wider nascent development of what later became the discipline of Psychology, and also incorporated Astrology, and effect of digestion on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationships}} between India {{in the days}} of the British Raj and the US were thin. Swami Vivekananda promoted Yoga and Vedanta in America at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, during the World's Fair in 1893. Mark Twain visited India in 1896 and described it in his travelogue Following the Equator with both revulsion and attraction before concluding that India was the only foreign land he <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> or longed to see again. Regarding India, Americans learned more from English writer Rudyard Kipling. Mahatma Gandhi had an important influence on the philosophy of non-violence promoted by Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|From its beginning, the Italian Nationalist Movement had <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> Italy {{joining the}} modernized World Powers. In the North, {{extensive}} industrialization {{and the building}} of a modern infrastructure was well underway by the 1890s. Alpine railway lines connected Italy to the French, German and Austrian rail systems. Two south-going coastal lines were also completed. Most of the larger industrial businesses were founded with considerable investment from Germany, Britain, France and others. Subsequently, the Italian state decided to help initiate heavy industry such as car factories, steel works and ship building, adopting a protectionist trade policy from the 1880s onward. Northern Italian agriculture was modernized, as well, bringing larger profits, underpinned by powerful co-operatives. The South, however, did not experience the same kind of development in any of the above-mentioned areas.|$|E

25|$|The narrator {{introduces}} a character he once <b>dreamed</b> <b>about,</b> an Abyssinian maid who sings of another land. She is {{a figure of}} imaginary power within the poem who can inspire within the narrator his own ability to craft poetry. When she sings, {{she is able to}} inspire and mesmerise the poet by describing a false paradise. The woman herself is similar to the way Coleridge describes Lewti in another poem he wrote around the same time Lewti. The connection between Lewti and the Abyssinian maid makes it possible that the maid was intended as a disguised version of Mary Evans, who appears as a love interest since Coleridge's 1794 poem The Sigh. Evans, in the poems, appears as an object of sexual desire and a source of inspiration. She is also similar to the later subject of many of Coleridge's poems, Asra, based on Sara Hutchinson, whom Coleridge wanted but was not his wife and experienced opium induced dreams of being with her.|$|E
25|$|Radulovics' final {{major event}} was the European Championship in 2004, as she retired from {{international}} handball after the tournament. Although she <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> winning {{the gold medal}} in front of home crowd, Radulovics had to be content herself with a bronze after Hungary lost to Norway in the semifinals and beat Russia in the third place match. The Hungarian team set off with a three match winning run, with that they easily won their preliminary group. Radulovics played in terrific form, especially against Austria, hitting the back of the net 13 times. During the main round phase Hungary continued to play top quality handball, but suffered a one-goal defeat against Denmark, which cost them the top spot of the group and as a result, they had to face prime title candidates and eventually winners Norway in the semifinal. Radulovics scored ten goals against the Hammerseng-led Scandinavians, but it was not enough to go through the finals, since {{the rest of the team}} slightly underperformed and Hungary suffered a heavy loss (29–44).|$|E
25|$|Pope Boniface VIII, born Caetani, was {{the last}} pope {{to fight for the}} church's {{universal}} domain: he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna and in 1300, called for the first Jubilee of Christianity, which brought to Rome millions of pilgrims. However, his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair, who took him prisoner and slashed him in Anagni, causing his death. Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377). During this period the city was neglected, until the power fell in the hand of a plebeian man, Cola di Rienzo. An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming the power with the title of Tribuno, his reforms were rejected by the populace. Forced to flee, Cola could come back among the suite of cardinal Albornoz, in charge of restoring the church power in Italy. Back in power for a short time, he was lynched by the populace, and Albornoz could take possession of the city, that in 1377 under Gregory XI became again the seat of the papacy. The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the western Schism (1377–1418), and during the next forty years, the city was prey of the fights which shattered the church.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening of}} Part Two, wherein Smithers {{realizes that he}} merely <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> {{shooting}} Mr. Burns, is {{a reference to the}} episode [...] "Blast from the Past" [...] from Dallas, in which the events of the entire ninth season were explained away as being merely a character's dream. The dream itself, in which Smithers and Burns are undercover detectives on the 1960s Speedway racing circuit, parodied The Mod Squad. Groundskeeper Willie's interrogation, and particularly his crossing and uncrossing his legs, is a parody of Sharon Stone's famous interrogation scene in Basic Instinct. The nightclub is called 'Chez Guevara', a reference to Communist revolutionary Che Guevara.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, he portrayed Pontius Pilate in The Passion, a BBC/HBO {{adaptation}} of the {{last week in the}} life of Jesus. He had originally rejected the script due to other filming commitments, but accepted the role after his agent told him to re-read it before making a final decision. He was pleased to learn that the serial was being produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark, whose Bleak House adaptation he had enjoyed, and that he would be appearing with his Jekyll co-star Denis Lawson. Contrary to previous portrayals of Pilate, Nesbitt played the biblical figure as [...] "nice", and—as when playing Jack Parlabane—used his own accent. The serial was broadcast in the UK during Easter week 2008. Shortly after filming The Passion, he filmed the part of journalist Max Raban in the Carnival Films thriller Midnight Man, which was shown on ITV in May 2008. It won him a joint nomination (along with the 2007 series of Murphy's Law) for the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for Best Actor. At the end of the year, he had a starring role in the low-budget independent film Blessed. The writer and director Mark Aldridge scripted the character of Peter with Nesbitt in mind to play him. The film had a limited release throughout 2008 and 2009 before the BBC screened it on television in 2010. Nesbitt said, [...] "The role of Peter is what I have <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> playing, you wait your whole life for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Italian {{historian}} Carlo Ginzburg {{has been}} cited as being willing to give [...] "some slight support" [...] to Murray's theory. Ginzburg stated that although her thesis had been [...] "formulated in a wholly uncritical way" [...] and contained [...] "serious defects", it did contain [...] "a kernel of truth". He stated his opinion that she was right in claiming that European witchcraft had [...] "roots in an ancient fertility cult", something that he argued was vindicated by his work researching the benandanti, an agrarian visionary tradition recorded in the Friuli district of Northeastern Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several historians and folklorists {{have pointed out that}} Ginzburg's arguments are very different to Murray's: whereas Murray argued for the existence of a pre-Christian witches' cult whose members physically met during the witches' Sabbaths, Ginzburg argued that some of the European visionary traditions that were conflated with witchcraft in the Early Modern period had their origins in pre-Christian fertility religions. Moreover, other historians have expressed criticism of Ginzburg's interpretation of the benandanti; Cohn stated that there was [...] "nothing whatsoever" [...] in the source material to justify the idea that the benandanti were the [...] "survival of an age-old fertility cult". Echoing these views, Hutton commented that Ginzburg's claim that the benandantis visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on [...] "imperfect material and conceptual foundations". He added that Ginzburg's [...] "assumption" [...] that [...] "what was being <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies" [...] dating to [...] "pagan times", was entirely [...] "an inference of his own" [...] and not one supported by the documentary evidence.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Carey's debut album, which {{featured}} a more contemporary pop and R background, Emotions {{proved to be}} far different. It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, R, soul, pop and 1960s and 1970s influences. The album's lead single [...] "Emotions" [...] borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register. The song's lyrics were described as [...] "joyful" [...] by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover. One of the album's more gospel infused songs, [...] "And You Don't Remember," [...] featured organ chord changes and held minimal production {{in order to give}} the vocals a more [...] "raw and sixties feel." [...] It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to Motown ballads, with the inclusion of soft church choir vocals, and sole musical arrangement by Carey. Its lyrics reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her and moves to the next one. After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him [...] "Don't You Remember" [...] all those things he had promised her, and the things they had spoken and <b>dreamed</b> <b>about</b> doing together. [...] "Can't Let Go," [...] the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content. The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from fifties balladry. For the duration {{of the first half of}} the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the belted crescendo and falsetto and whistle finish. Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on [...] "Make It Happen," [...] which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia. It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "very Motownish," [...] as well as noting its soft gospel infusion. Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres. According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation: ...|$|E
