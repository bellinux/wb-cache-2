25|$|As Amp Radio, CKMP gained notoriety {{for several}} {{controversial}} on-air promotions, including a 2011 contest where the station gave away a breast implant, and a 2013 stunt where listeners voted {{in favour of}} burning $5,000 in an incinerator rather than giving <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> an on-air contest. In August 2014, CKMP {{became the subject of}} further notoriety when it changed its format to utilize shortened edits of songs, of around two minutes in length, to double the volume of music played per-hour and maintain listener interest. After only three weeks, the format was dropped and reverted to a standard top 40 format following legal threats by unspecified artists, alongside public complaints by Canadian musician Jann Arden—who felt that the shortened edits were disrespectful to musicians.|$|E

25|$|On January 6, 2004, the Maple Leafs {{were playing}} {{a game against the}} Nashville Predators, when Leaf captain Mats Sundin's stick broke on an {{attempted}} shot at the blue line and he threw <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> disgust. Instead of hitting the glass, the stick accidentally went over and into the crowd. The NHL reacted by giving him a one-game suspension. The game he was suspended for was a game against the Senators in Toronto. During the game, Daniel Alfredsson's stick broke, and he immediately faked a toss of his stick into the stands. This caused an uproar with the Maple Leafs, in part because they had also lost the game 7–1. Alfredsson dismissed the Leafs' reaction, calling it an over-reaction. This incident added to the rivalry, and Leafs fans continue to boo Alfredsson at future games.|$|E
25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised {{to be a tough}} test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up to}} expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being presented to them. The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only to throw <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the final minutes to draw yet again. A win did come before the end of the month, however, Morgan again netting in the final ten minutes to snatch all three points away to Torquay.|$|E

500|$|However, Tom Burns of Underground Online had {{previously}} criticized Supernatural for ruining a surprise ending by giving <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the show's recap.

Burns liked the episode, but did find some fault with it. He felt that [...] "Part One" [...] focusing on Sam and [...] "Part Two" [...] on Dean was a mistake since [...] "Supernaturals strongest asset has always been the chemistry between the leads". In addition, Burns felt the season had set up the question of whether Sam was going to [...] "go evil", and the finale did not follow through, which Burns described as a [...] "tease".|$|E
500|$|Reviews from {{critics were}} mostly strong, with many {{saying that the}} {{extended}} length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels as interesting as the original games. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: [...] "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, Pokémon Gold and Silver blow <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating. Nintendo Power listed the Gold and Silver versions of it combined as the sixth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.|$|E

500|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three-storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines. The private access road was intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and to avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The ground floor contained a grand entrance hall and staircase for mourners attending first and second class funerals, a smaller entrance hall and staircase for those attending lower classes of funeral, and two mortuaries which occupied {{the majority of the}} floor. A large room adjacent to the mortuary held a reserve stock of around 300 coffins. [...] Most mourners would have commissioned their own coffins, or used coffins bought by the deceased during their lifetime but, explained an official of the LNC (in 1898) the reserve of coffins was kept so that [...] "should a guest die in a hotel, and the landlord wished to keep it quiet, we are notified, {{and in the middle of}} the night we come for the corpse, and take <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> one of our ready-made wooden overcoats". The first floor held the LNC's boardroom, the LNC's funerary workshops, a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending second and third class funerals, and the building's main toilets. The second floor, level with the LSWR railway line, held the train shed covering the two private rail lines and the single platform at which the trains stopped, eight or nine waiting rooms for first class mourners, and further toilets for their use. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level. A glass roof was positioned in order that no shadow be cast on the hearse carriage waiting at the platform at the time the trains were scheduled to depart, and the western wall was windowless to avoid passengers using the LSWR station being able to see into the Necropolis station. Glass panels inset between the two rail lines allowed sunlight through to the private access road below. Unlike most railway stations of the period, the designs of the first, second and third class waiting rooms were largely identical with only superficial differences.|$|E

At 13:16 he left the Quayside Shopping Centre and walked along Wine Street {{in the direction of the}} bus station, still carrying all three bags.

2500|$|Later Act IV, Scene 1, Ariel says: [...] "when I {{presented}} Ceres / I {{thought to}} have told thee of it / but I feared lest I might anger thee." [...] Earlier in the same scene, Ceres, along with Iris and Juno, had appeared at Prospero's command in a Masque. Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare originally intended the actor for Ariel to cover Ceres' role, and give <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> this line. The need for a dual role may {{have been caused by}} a shortage of boys capable of playing female parts (boys usually played all female roles in Shakespeare's day) as there are many female roles in The Tempest. This changing of parts requires a change in costume, which explains a lot of Ariel's delay in scene four in carrying out Prospero's orders. Time is allowed for the character to change from Ariel to Ceres and back. On the other side, Ceres may have been associated, by Shakespeare, to the Kairos figure, related to rhetorics, personating the opportune moment to present the convincing argument in a speech. Early critics were sceptical of the idea, saying that [...] "presented Ceres" [...] could merely mean that Ariel introduced Ceres to the gathering. More recent studies, however, have revealed that, given the small number of boys travelling with the King's Men and the large number of parts for them to fill, there would have been little choice in the matter. The entire scene comes together in a way that leads scholars to believe that the Masque scene with the three goddesses was added as an afterthought to work around costuming and role-playing issues.|$|E
