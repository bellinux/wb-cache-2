40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the consumer perceptions towards particleboard as a premier furniture material. The {{data for this}} study was collected from a questionnaire survey, completed by 500 buyers who attended the international furniture fairs in Malaysia in 2008. Correlation analysis showed that the success factors of particleboard as a <b>furniture</b> <b>stock</b> are primarily its low cost and environmental friendly status. Further, the study also revealed that the major advantages of particleboard made from oil palm empty-fruit bunch (EFB), a potential substitute for the conventional wood-based particleboard, are its comparatively lower cost and greater environmental friendliness. Since, particleboard-based furniture are perceived as being inexpensive and fragile, the choice of using particleboard in furniture manufacturing is driven primarily on cost, rather than performance. Therefore, the market potential of oil palm EFB particleboard is dependent on its comparative cost, which could increase market share if the material is available at a competitive price...|$|E

The play {{takes place in a}} single hotel room in New Haven, Connecticut where Hinkley has taken up residence in order to be closer to Jodie Foster. Throughout the course of the play the audience witnesses Hinkley leaving and returning to this room, recounting his attempts to get Foster’s attention to a bellhop that has befriended Hinkley. The play unfolds as the obsession for Jodie Foster continues to build until the closing moments in which Hinkley departs from the hotel with plans on assassinating Reagan.

50|$|The act dealt {{mostly with}} the {{earnings}} of married women and was not very specific about married women's property rights. A major loophole was that any property a woman had in her own name before marriage legally became her husband's property. By entering a marriage women were gaining the legal union of marriage and also losing legal ownership over their possessions: “upon marriage deprived a woman of her independent legal existence”. Before the Act was passed women lost all ownership over their property when they became married: “From the early thirteenth century until 1870, English Common law held {{that most of the}} property that a wife had owned as a feme sole came {{under the control of the}} husband at the time of the marriage”. This property included money, <b>furniture,</b> <b>stocks</b> and livestock. However, after the marriage, she could inherit property in her own name from her next of kin. The act was not retroactive; thus, any woman who married before this act became legally effective could not recover property she had held before marriage (if she had any). This greatly limited the effect this act had on married women.|$|R

Sustained by sharing of access to goods and services typically coordinated through community-based online services, these widely accessible peer-to-peer based transactions are transforming the urban landscape, making us global locals that belong anywhere. However, in desirable urban spaces, AirBnB is facilitating the cultivation of a gentrified monoculture that jeopardises diversity. Consequently, an AirBnB neighbourhood is not a profitable means to collectively consume, but an international bedroom community of "post-tourist" upwardly mobile workers. AirBnB makes cities more affordable, as its influx of guests undertakes a much more utilitarian approach to the urban realm, yet raises questions as to whether this form of social behaviour liberates or further entraps our society; as these newly administered laws of exchange slowly relieve us {{of a sense of}} ownership and identity.

40|$|During {{the first}} four decades {{of the nineteenth century}} the City and County of Philadelphia {{transformed}} from a commercially oriented entrepot into a manufacturing oriented urban center. Commerce did not completely decline, but the precipitous growth of industrial activity dominated Philadelphia 2 ̆ 7 s landscape. This study examines the early industrialization of one particular craft or industry, cabinet and chairmaking in Philadelphia from 1800 - 1840. In its early stages industrialization involved a reorganization of production through a division of labor instituted to increase output. This was achieved by breaking down tasks and by adding to the work force. During the 18302 ̆ 7 s the steam powered circular saw and lathe made a valuable contribution to the efficient operation of the hand processes of production by reducing the cost and increasing the availability of preprocessed raw materials to the trade. The motivation behind reorganization of production and reduction in manufacturing costs was the exploitation of growing local, coastal, and foreign markets. An increased supply of furniture, made possible by the reorganization of production and aided by the new technology, necessitated significant alterations in marketing. By the 18302 ̆ 7 s, a carefully planned system of retail and wholesale outlets was developed to dispense of <b>furniture</b> <b>stocks</b> to local and distant markets. Certain features of both the manufacturing and marketing components of the industry as they evolved over the forty year period were not, however, favored by journeymen since they diluted skill and threatened to lower wages. From the start of the nineteenth century, but especially from 1825 on, an organized group of journeymen effectively responded to changes in the trade resulting from early industrialization. The five chapters in this study examine early industrialization in the following areas: the actual methods of production, the architecture of the workshop and the wareroom, the tactics employed to market furniture to local, coastal, and foreign markets, and the organized activities of journeymen working in the furniture industry. ...|$|R
