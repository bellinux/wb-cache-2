[...] "Together we must stop the practices that feed corruption or undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of national institutions." [...] The international aid is tied to a mechanism that will regularly review how it is being spent, and to guarantees from Kabul that it will seriously take on its deep-rooted corruption problems – what the conference called a roadmap of accountability. Kabul must also demonstrate efforts to improve governance and finance management, and safeguard the democratic process, {{rule of law and}} human rights – especially those of women. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the need for reform to safeguard changes achieved in Afghanistan. [...] "That must include fighting corruption, improving governance, strengthening the rule of law, increasing access to economic opportunity for all Afghans, especially for women," [...] she said. A <b>follow-up</b> <b>conference</b> will be hold in Britain in 2014.
