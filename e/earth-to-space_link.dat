40|$|Review {{of several}} variable-rate optical {{transmission}} schemes over an <b>earth-to-space</b> <b>link</b> which neutralize {{the effects of}} atmospheric turbulence. These adaptive laser communication systems exploit atmospheric reciprocity and the relatively long coherence time of the turbulence to monitor the time-varying state of the earth-to-space channel by using a satellite beacon and making appropriate measurements at the ground terminal. Optimal variable-rate strategy based on this channel-state information results is considerably improved performance in comparison with nonadaptive optical communication systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{degradation of the}} European Space Agency (ESA) Deep Space Telecommand receiving subsystem due {{to the presence of}} cross-modulation and ranging interference for simultaneous ranging and command operations on the <b>Earth-to-space</b> <b>link</b> is investigated. The most important result is that under imperfect carrier reference the command subcarrier and the ranging tone frequencies can be selected to suppress the cross-modulation interference and interference from the ranging channel for the specified command bit rate and ranging code component. Recommendations as to use of specific command subcarrier frequency, command bit rate, and ranging tone frequency are made for consideration in future standards systems...|$|E
40|$|A revised {{statistical}} model {{for evaluating the}} diversity performance of <b>Earth-to-space</b> radio <b>links</b> using the orbital diversity (OD) technique is discussed. The present method includes the more complicated but practical unbalanced diversity case. The results are compared with the only available set of experimental data relative to the asymmetric orbital diversity configuration located at Fucino, Italy between the SIRIP an...|$|R
40|$|Since their dawning, space {{communications}} {{have been}} among the strongest driving applications for the development of error correcting codes. Indeed, space-to-Earth telemetry (TM) links have extensively exploited advanced coding schemes, from convolutional codes to Reed-Solomon codes (also in concatenated form) and, more recently, from turbo codes to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The efficiency of these schemes has been extensively proved in several papers and reports. The situation is a bit different for <b>Earth-to-space</b> telecommand (TC) <b>links.</b> Space TCs must reliably convey control information as well as software patches from Earth control centers to scientific payload instruments and engineering equipment onboard (O/B) spacecraft. The success of a mission may be compromised because of an error corrupting a TC message: a detected error causing no execution or, even worse, an undetected error causing a wrong execution. This imposes strict constraints on the maximum acceptable detected and undetected error rates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{technology}} {{advances have}} made CubeSats {{not only an}} affordable means of access to space, but also promising platforms {{to develop a new}} variety of space applications. In this paper, we explore the idea of using nanosatellites as access points to provide extended coverage to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to- Machine (M 2 M) communications. This study is mainly motivated by two facts: on the one hand, it is already obvious that the number of machine-type devices deployed globally will experiment an exponential growth over the forthcoming years. This trend is pushed by the available terrestrial cellular infrastructure, which allows adding support for M 2 M connectivity at marginal costs. On the other hand, the same growth is not observed in remote areas that must rely on space-based connectivity. In such environments, the demand for M 2 M communications is potentially large, yet it is challenged by the lack of cost-effective service providers. The traffic characteristics of typical M 2 M applications translate into the requirement for an extremely low cost per transmitted message. Under these strong economical constraints, we expect that nanosatellites in the low Earth orbit will play a fundamental role in overcoming the IoT digital divide. The objective of this paper is therefore to provide a general analysis of a nanosatellite-based, machine-type data collection network aiming to extend coverage for the IoT. We put emphasis in the engineering challenges faced in designing the <b>Earth-to-Space</b> communication <b>link,</b> where the adoption of an efficient multiple-access scheme is paramount for ensuring connectivity to a large number of terminal nodes. In this context, we overview {{the state of the art}} of current developments and propose a novel access approach suitable for delay-tolerant applications. Thus, by keeping a system-level standpoint, we identify key issues and discuss perspectives towards energy efficient and cost-effective solutions...|$|R
