Yet, the known as Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot (Hasemag) has written under the prohibitive command # 138, Tarba de-Aqlivusta: Rashi has explained the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone) as being the small bone lying on that bone which is called French hanche (haunch or hip), and is connected to the vertebrae of the tail the sheep from above, upon which there is suet beneath the loin, and which is among that suet found on the flanks.Now these are the words used by Rabbi A. of Meitze: [...] "Near the tail can be found the <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> of the sheep's tail, upon which is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone), and that same suet and <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> of the sheep's tail cling one to another, etc." [...] But in book Sheiltot of Rabbi Ahai Gaon, and in book Halachot Gedolot, they have written: [...] "The suet which is upon the flanks is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone), where the hind legs attach themselves."

5000|$|Now {{what we have}} {{received}} as being the way to surgically remove all fatty tissue as follows: After undressing the animal, they tear away the outer ruminant stomach from the hind legs unto the chest-wall cavity, and they take out the inner stomach, and remove, in its entirety, the blanket-like covering suet which is spread out over it. And they take special precautions over the thin of suet which {{is connected to the}} large intestines, which {{is at the end of}} place called, the [...] "coils of the ileum" [...] (Heb. Hadar Hakanoh), near the place where he excretes excrement, and which, on the one side, the [...] "suet of the innards" [...] is attached, while on the other side, the fat of the kanoh (ileum). That suet which lies next to it is the suet of the small intestines, which is prohibited according to the Geonim, of blessed memory. They take precaution, likewise, over that side which clings somewhat unto the ileum (Heb. Senei Dhebei = [...] "hatred of wolves"), surgically removing all of it thoroughly. They also take precaution to remove all of the suet that is found upon the abomasum (Heb. Kevah) externally, which is known as the ḥūmṣā, until nothing remains of it. Moreover, they take away the suet which is inside the abomasum, from within, which distinctively adheres itself to the abomasum. Yet, that which is not spread out like a blanket is that which is permitted, it being that which is ritually clean, and it is called bar ḥūmṣā. Now that which is spread over the omasum (Heb. Messos) the reticulum like a blanket is forbidden, which is an even layer of fat covered with a membrane and easily peeled, and which happens to be included among the [...] "suet which lies upon the innards." [...] Now they scrape away suet from the intestine which comes out of the abomasum (the fourth ruminant stomach) for the space of about a cubit (ca. 54 cm.), it also being the suet of the small intestines which is prohibited according to Maimonides, (Nachmanides) and Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, seeing that it is a close neighbour to the suet which lies upon the innards. Afterwards, they take out all of the entrails (intestines), and the inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), as well as the liver, aside from the mesentery (Heb. Ḥalūḥelet), for he still needs to clean it from the suet which is upon it. Afterwards, they peel away all of that lining membrane which is upon the flanks, which is forbidden on account of suet. They are scrupulous about its removal that nothing remains of it. The beginning of its place is from where there is the white tissue which is in the centre of the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs, extending downwards unto the thighs the hind legs and running width-wise along all the flanks, unto the spinal column (vertebrae). They remove it (i.e. the lining membrane) with the suet that lies upon it which is situate at the end of the thighs and which lies upon that flesh which is beneath the loins, which is called [...] "lonbel" [...] in the foreign, French language and mutemaziqah in Arabic. Now this suet is categorically included among the suet which lies upon the flanks. Afterwards, they pull out the five [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are upon the flanks, these being three on the right side and two on the left. The three on the right side, each one branches off into two separate veins, while the two [...] "threads" [...] on the left side, each one of them branches off into three separate veins, while one of its heads is attached to the spinal column, and they are called the [...] "threads (nerves) that are in the hip," [...] the [...] "threads of the walls the chest," [...] and the [...] "threads that are upon the flanks," [...] their prohibition being on account of suet. Now if they are pulled off while they are still warm, they can be pulled off altogether. However, if they have become cold, they can no longer be pulled off, and one must then poke around after them. Afterwards, they rend with a knife the thin membrane that is conspicuously located upon the two sides of the spinal column, beneath the loins and extending as far as the ribs. It is the place that appears to the eyesight as a whitish colour by the light of the sun or by the light of a candle from the hind side of the animal, and which can be seen on its inside, and where there is no flesh that lies upon it. After the membrane has been rent, they remove the forbidden fat (suet) that is beneath it, extending down as far as the <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> that lies beneath that same suet, it being that which divides between the hide of the animal and the said suet, and it is permitted. Now he removes this suet from two sides of the spinal column, its length extending from beneath the loins all the way up to the ribs; while its breadth extending outwards until it becomes covered over in flesh, and once it has been covered over in flesh, is permitted. They scrape away the suet that is upon the spinal column from within, where lies the flesh of the loins which is called Arabic mutemaziqah, and they excise fatty tissue from the mutemaziqah, removing all of the forbidden fat (suet) that lies upon it externally. Then they dislodge the fat of the kidneys from the place of its attachment on the spine, above the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs, towards the side of the animal's loins, surgically removing all suet beneath it, or else they remove the central bone of the spinal column entirely. Afterwards, he opens up the pelvic bone that joins together the two thighs, the two thighs, taking out all fat that is within it which lies over the fat of the kidneys, it being the forbidden [...] "fat that is upon the flanks," [...] or what is also called Aramaic Tarba de-Aqlivusta. They surgically remove it up to the place where the tail begins in large domesticated animals, but in sheep they continue to scrape away the outer part of the fatty tail (rump) towards its inner side which knocks upon the thighs, with the fat of the kidneys and the flanks, all that which is high up at the top of the fatty tail (rump), at the place where it excretes excrement, extending as far as the bones of the fatty tail (rump). Now beneath it there is a marked difference in the thin membrane between the said suet and the suet in the fatty tail, as well as between the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) which draw nourishment from the fat of the kidneys and the flanks. Now they scrape away all the fat (suet) which is between the sinews (Heb. Peqoqeloth) the loins, which in Arabic is as al-falakh (Coccyx), along with the [...] "threads (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that enter inside the perforations in the bones which join together the loins of the animal above, wherein ends the spinal cord. He then dismembers the thighs, each one individually, and opens up each one from its flesh on that side where the hide is attached, until the displaced tendon (Heb. Gid Hanasheh) can be seen which is on the hollow of the thigh, removing it and digging up after it in all the flesh of the thighs. Now on part of the of the thigh which is called Arabic mukheh, requires removing the tendon from without and from within, and on the calf leg which is called Arabic sā‘ed, requires removing the tendon from without and from within, and on the flesh which is upon it, which grows from the bunch of converging sinews the calf (Heb. Ṣūmmat Hagīdīm), called Arabic suqleh, with all of the fat of the tendon, in every place where it is to be found. Now there are found on the two sides of the of the thigh which is called Arabic mukheh and in its socket are known as stems (Heb. Qenuqenoth), as well as the fat (Heb. Shoman) of the displaced tendon, both being virtually impossible to clean them very well. Therefore, let him remove them and cast them away. Now there are in the calf, underneath its flesh, three small tendons, they being of the displaced tendon. Therefore, let him open up the flesh and remove them. And as for the spleen, let him peel away the membrane which is upon it, and pull away the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. blood vessels and nerves) that are inside of it which are three, their prohibition being on account of suet, and one is required to dig-up after them. The inner ruminant stomach (Heb. Kores), the omasum (Heb. Messos) and the reticulum (Heb. Beith Hakossoth), (as well as the rump of sheep), require being cleaned of all suet that clings to them. The membrane which is upon the diaphragm (Heb. Tarfash) divides the digestive organs from the respiratory organs, alongside the liver, is forbidden on account of suet, and that which is alongside the lung is customarily removed lest he who sees it becomes skeptical, although it is permitted. They also remove the lower membrane which is upon the kidneys, it being forbidden on account of suet, also the tunic membrane. As for the [...] "threads" [...] (i.e. veins and arteries) that are forbidden on account of blood, they do not have it as a practice in these countries to remove them, seeing that they cut up the animal in several pieces.

40|$|Arrested {{coalescence}} is an unique instability {{observed in}} oil-in-water emulsions. It occurs when droplets begin the coalescence process but then stop at an intermediate state {{because of some}} resistance, usually rheological, in origin. Emulsions with arrested structures can either aid or harm product quality {{depending on whether the}} resultant structures enhance or disrupt product aesthetics. Past work has examined doublets, two same-sized droplets forming a stable arrested structure, but this thesis extends that work to consider differences in size, the behaviour of greater numbers of droplets in arrested structures, and the effects of <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> crystallization on arrest. The first part of this project evaluates the effect of droplet size on the final deformation of the resulting doublet. An increase in size of droplets caused less deformation, and a decrease in size caused high deformation, because of the resulting curvature differences. When doublets form from two different sized-droplets they form a less compact structure than equivalent mono-disperse droplets because of differences in surface area. Addition of a third droplet to doublets can cause rearrangement of the newly-added droplet if the liquid meniscus bridge overlaps with one of the existing droplets. Restructuring is shown to produce more compact shapes but only occurs for systems with sufficiently low internal elasticity and when the approach angle is low. In the second part, microstructures formed by larger numbers of arrested droplets in a bulk emulsion were studied, to evaluate whether the mechanisms of structure formation by doublets and triplets is broadly valid. Important differences occur when flow dominates, as rotation and restructuring can occur, as can larger droplet deformation because of inertial effects, resulting in more compact structures. The final part applies the current model to more complex <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> systems: coconut oil, goose fat and duck fat. In these systems heterogeneity of the crystallization causes coalescence and arrest to be much more variable and irregular than in the model systems previously studied. Different locations of the crystals in droplets can trigger or prevent coalescence...|$|E

Dairy producers, particularly in soybean cropping areas, often use whole soybeans as a source of fat and protein in rations for lactating cows. Relative to other protein supplements for lactating dairy cows, solvent-extracted soybean meal (SBM) has a favorable amino acid profile (Schwab, 1995) and high post-ruminal protein digestibility (Stern et al., 1994), but its ruminal protein degradability is high (Stern et al., 1994). In addition to its high ruminal degradability (Faldet et al., 1992), the protein in raw, whole soybeans suffers reduced intestinal digestibility because of trypsin inhibitor (Aldrich et al., 1997). Various methods of heat processing are used commercially to reduce the degradation of soy protein by rumen microbes. This reduction in ruminal protein degradation via heat treatment occurs because of Maillard type reactions between sugar residues and amino acids (Van Soest, 1982).

Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with fats and oils have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. We consider short run (monthly) demand relationships for <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils. In that monthly quantities of fats and oils are likely to be relatively fixed, we utilize an inverse AIDS specification. Our analysis consists of two components. In the first, we utilize a smooth transition function to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS) that assesses short-run demand conditions for <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils in the U. S. Our results suggest that short-run demand conditions for fats and oils experienced a rather rapid structural shift in the early 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in flexibilities across regimes are modest in most cases. Our results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most fats and oils in response to consumption increases are rather small. Scale flexibilities are relatively close to - 1, suggesting near homothetic preferences for fats and oils. An important distinction occurs for lard and tallow, which exhibit a very elastic scale response. This suggests that scale increases in the consumption of <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils will significantly decrease consumers' marginal valuation of these animal fats. A second segment of our analysis considers dynamic extensions to the IAIDS model that recognize habit effects. Although nested hypothesis testing supports the dynamic specification over the static IAIDS model, price and scale flexibilities are quite similar to the static case.

40|$|The Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency (CVUA) Stuttgart has {{detected}} glycidol {{fatty acid}} esters in refined vegetable fats on a palm oil base. The analytical methods currently available do not, however, permit the determination, merely {{the estimation of}} the exact levels. Fur-thermore, {{we do not know}} what levels of glycidol are released from the glycidol fatty acid esters during digestion in humans. Based on findings from animal experiments, glycidol is classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. Because of this major hazard potential and because refined edible fats are used in products like margarine and in infant formula, too, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) takes the findings of CVUA Stuttgart seriously and presents its initial evaluation of the as-sessment whether the detected ester-bound glycidol could constitute a threat to health. This evaluation is based on the worst case scenario that glycidol is released fully during digestion from the fatty acid esters and is then available in the organism. As the exact levels of glycidol fatty acid esters could not be reliably determined up to now in vegetable fats, BfR adopts the hypothetical assumption that one kilogram of <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> contains one milligram glycidol. Based on this calculation, BfR comes to the conclusion that infants who are fed exclusively industrially prepared infant milk formula would take in harmful levels of glycidol...|$|E
40|$|For decades it {{has been}} {{postulated}} that the main environmental factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) was the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Nevertheless, confirmation {{of the role of}} SFA in CHD through intervention trials has been disappointing. It was only when the diet was enriched in n- 3 fatty acids that CHD was significantly prevented, especially cardiac death. In addition to n- 3 fatty acids, many other foodstuffs or nutrients such as fibers, antioxidants, folic acid, calcium and even alcohol contribute to prevent CHD. Thus the relationship between diet and CHD morbidity and mortality appears to be much more complex than formerly suspected considering as key factors only SFA, linoleic acid, cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Some of the mechanisms are briefly described, but many additional nutrients (or non nutrients) may also {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of CHD. Finally, as a result of the most recent epidemiologic studies the ideal diet may comprise: 8 % energy from SFA, 5 % from polyunsaturated fatty acids with a ratio 5 / 1 of linoleic/alpha-linolenic acid+longer chains n- 3, oleic acid as desired, large intake of cereals, vegetables, legumes and fruits, fish twice a week, cheese and yogurt as dairy products, rapeseed and olive oils as <b>edible</b> <b>fat.</b> Without side effects, such a diet can be highly palatable, easily enjoyed by many populations and may prevent effectively and rapidly (within a few weeks or months) CHD...|$|E
40|$|Shea trees grow across 4 million km 2 of sub-Saharan Africa. Shea parklands {{provide a}} {{sustainable}} source of <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> (shea butter) that, {{in terms of}} volume, is currently second only to cocoa butter as a vegetal source of stearic acid in the multi-billion dollar chocolate and cosmetic sectors. However, in terms of international trade, shea has been opaque to consumers of edible products (where the majority of shea exports end their global journey) and actually only well-known in western markets as a cosmetic ingredient. The millions of women collectors have been disconnected from global supply chains, as {{the majority of their}} sheanuts are factory processed, supplied by traders who, in many cases, do not understand quality issues nor share knowledge with their village-based collectors—this is the “Paradox of paradoxa”. This review provides the background to this issue by contextualizing the industry and describing how weak post-harvest quality control impacts the shea supply chain. The paper then explains how this knowledge was incorporated into a 3 D animation available for free transmission to rural African audiences and viewing on portable devices like video capable mobile phones. This tool offers the potential of low-cost multiple benefits to users, which we term here a win-cubed [win 3] opportunity, where women collectors can receive free knowledge of using less resources to produce higher quality shea kernels which in turn offer higher extraction yields, lowering production costs, of a better and more marketable product...|$|E
50|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} laundry soap and <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> still contributed around half of Unilever's {{corporate}} profits. However a stagnant market for yellow fats and increasing competition in detergents and soaps from Procter & Gamble forced Unilever to diversify. In 1971, Unilever acquired the British-based Lipton Ltd from Allied Suppliers. In 1978, National Starch was acquired for $487 million, marking {{the largest ever}} foreign-acquisition of a US company at that point.|$|R

In the process of coagulation volume was tested of three different coagulants containing various amount of reactive aluminum: PAX 18, PAC 16 and sodium aluminate. Efficiency of physical-chemical treatment of fatty wastewater was determined based on change in indicators of pollution; chemical oxygen demand, phosphate and sulphate...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils {{suffered}} a severe loss of image by being considered {{to be one of}} the main causes for the steady rise in overweight and diseases of civilisation among the Western population. Numerous recent research studies on characteristics of specific fatty acids (type and composition) call for a paradigm shift reevaluating <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> by placing greater emphasis on the quality rather than quantity of total fatty intake. This includes for instance, unhealthy LDL-increasing trans-fatty acids &# 8211; formed during the hydrogenation process of vegetable oils &# 8211; and saturated fatty acids from animal products. These ought to be replaced by vegetable oils of which rapeseed and olive oil are regarded to be particularly physiological point of view. Due to their high content of monoand polyunsaturated fatty acids in combination with a most suitable fatty acid pattern, they harbour a strong cardioprotective and anti-atherogenic potential. Other health promoting fatty sources &# 8211; as supported by the example of the Mediterranean Diet &# 8211; are fish rich in omega- 3 -fatty acids...|$|R
