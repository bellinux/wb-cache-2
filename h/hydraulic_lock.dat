5000|$|The {{steam dome}} is a vessel fitted {{to the top}} of the boiler of a steam engine. It {{contains}} the opening to the main steam pipe and its purpose is to allow this opening to be kept well above the water level in the boiler.

50|$|At 02:15 the {{following}} morning, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> of the cleaning vessel lid was released, and immediately the dose rate increased significantly (6-12 millisieverts/hour) around {{the spent fuel}} pond and the pool containing the cleaning machine, and the water level dropped for a short time, by about 7 cm. Water samples from the pond showed contamination due to damaged fuel rods. The lid on the cleaning machine was winched up at 04:20, {{but one of the}} three lifting cables attached to it broke; and it was not finally removed until 16 April.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> {{can occur}} in steam engines due to steam {{condensing}} back into water. In most steam engine designs {{there must be a}} small moment {{at the end of the}} return stroke of the piston when all the valves are shut and it is compressing any remaining steam. Water can be introduced from the boiler or in a cold engine, steam will condense to water on the cool walls of the cylinders and can potentially hydrolock an engine. This is just as damaging as it is to internal combustion engines and in the case of a steam locomotive can be very dangerous as a broken connecting rod could puncture the firebox/boiler and cause a steam explosion. Steam engines (with the exception of small model and toy machines) are always fitted with cylinder drain cocks which are opened to allow excess water and steam to escape during warm up.|$|E
40|$|The {{present state}} of {{knowledge}} on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> phenomena of oil hydraulic control system components is reviewed briefly. A general one-dimensional solution of the Reynolds equation which governs <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> is presented. The solution embraces the particular solutions of past workers, and allows ready solution for piston-cylinder configurations for which a one-dimensional solution is adequate. A general method for making full solutions of the Reynolds equation is presented, requiring {{the use of a}} digital computer for particular solutions. Pressure distribution, the lateral force on the piston which produces <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock,</b> and the location of the lateral force can be obtained. The commonly occurring case of a single-land piston lying tilted in its bore is examined in detail. The limit of accuracy of a one-dimensional solution is clearly shown by illustrating the discrepancies between the one-dimensional and two-dimensional solutions for several configurations...|$|E

40|$|Material {{feeding and}} {{handling}} {{systems have been}} cited {{as one of the}} most common causes of process downtime where thermochemical conversion processes are concerned. New and emerging fuels come in a variety of forms, and if such fuels are to be deployed widely it is imperative that material feeding and handling systems are designed appropriately. This study proposes an approach for designing material feeding and handling systems for use with coarse solid fuels. The data obtained from this study indicates particle size to be one of the key issues affecting the flowability of bulk solids further to the uniformity in particle shape. Coarse bulk solid samples were shown to flow more freely than their milled and pulverised counterparts, generating higher degrees of flowability. The results from this study were also applied to a new feed system used for feeding solid fuels to high pressure processes named the <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lock</b> Hopper. In this study the <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lock</b> Hopper demonstrated the feeding of wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets, and ground anthracite coal grains against a pressure of 25 barg in two modes of operation. Energy savings compared to conventional lock hopper systems were recorded in the region of 80 %...|$|E

The PID design consists of two coupled valves, each capable of fluid isolation {{through the use of}} individually operated opposing poppets. An integral level clamping mechanism couples the two valves and locks the bodies together. The coupling lever is locked in position by turning the valve stems that have foolproof caps. The stem shaft has an integral cam that turns inside a yoke to open the poppet to permit fluid flow. Results of 5000 life cycle tests, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> test, leakage tests, and pressure drop tests are included...|$|E

Adopting a numerical approach based on the Reynolds equation property combined with the continuity equation, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>locking</b> phenomena are studied for different tapered clearances of practical interest in the presence of different groove configurations. The variation in groove axial length, number and axial position makes it possible to collect important information about the multigrooved spool in a thin film of fluid, including fundamental data for a proper spool design...|$|R
40|$|The {{large size}} of the cab of an {{electro-hydraulic}} elevator necessitates the arrangement of two cylinders located symmetrically {{on both sides of}} the cab. This paper reports the design of an electro-hydraulic system which consists of three flow-control proportional valves. Speed regulation of the cab and synchronization control of the two cylinders are also presented. a pseudo-derivative feedback (PDF) controller is applied to obtain a velocity pattern of the cab that proves to be close to the given one. The non-synchronous error of the two cylinders is kept within +/- 2 mm with a constrained step proportional-derivative (PD) controller. A solenoid-actuated non-return valve, i. e, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock,</b> is also developed to prevent cab sinking and allow easy inverse-fluid flow.

40|$|A {{new system}} for {{efficiently}} feeding solid fuels to high pressure processes {{has been developed}} {{over the course of}} this PhD study. The system, named the <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lock</b> Hopper (HLH), {{takes the form of a}} new lock hopper that utilises water as an incompressible fluid during the compression stage. It disposes of the need for inert gas or gas compressors as is required by conventional lock hopper systems, and vastly increases their operational efficiency. The HLH has demonstrated the feeding of a range of fuels including wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets and ground anthracite grains to pressures as high as 25 barg. Two modes of operation have been developed, one whereby the energy requirement to feed is minimised (Mode 1), and another whereby the volume of high pressure gas vented to the atmosphere is reduced to near nil (Mode 2). In addition to this, the HLH has been developed to operate without the forward leakage of air in order to minimise explosive atmospheres...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe electro-hydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) {{is a kind}} of power-by-wire (PBW) actuator {{that converts}} the electrical power into localized hydraulic power for flight control. By removing the central hydraulic power supply together with hydraulic pipes, an EHA's reliability and efficiency are greatly improved but its frequency width and stiffness decreased. To overcome the drawback, this article proposes a novel structure of EHA associated with a power regulator. Composed of a high-pressure accumulator and a proportional valve, it can store and harness the hydraulic power flexibly according to the changing control requirements. The concept of transferred volume is put forward to estimate the capability of the power regulator. The actuator output position can be kept fixed with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock.</b> The compounded control is specially developed to ensure the actuator system to operate in a correct manner. The simulation results indicate that the new-brand actuator results in efficient expanding of the system frequency width with an optimal power supply...|$|E

25|$|The Finnpusku {{system uses}} a unique rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two <b>hydraulic</b> <b>locking</b> pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the latest}} our works, Performance of a fixed displacement- {{hydraulic}} balance vane pump, theoretically and practically was studied by {{application of the}} basic hypertrochoid curve in the inner surface of its stator. Also {{the effect of the}} inertia force of the vanes on the performance of the pump with this curve was studied. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the internal pressure distribution in the pump, and of the resulting forces and torques applied to its components. This analysis is essential {{to the study of the}} pump dynamics and control, the pump design, and selection of the pump bearings. These forces are shown to be a function of the line pressure, the shaft rotational speed, the fluid bulk modulus, the fluid viscosity, and the design geometry. These forces are composed of two components: a continuous component due to the exposure of chambers to the line port, and an intermittent component due to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> phenomenon...|$|E
5000|$|The Ragonnet {{power reverse}}, {{patented}} in 1909, {{was a true}} feedback controlled servomechanism. The power reverse amplified small motions of reversing lever in the locomotive cab made with modest force into much larger and more forceful motions of the reach rod that controlled the engine cutoff and direction. [...] It was usually air powered, but could also be steam powered. [...] The term servomotor was explicitly used by the developers of some later power reverse mechanisms. [...] The use of feedback control in these later power reverse mechanisms eliminated {{the need for a}} second cylinder for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism, and it restored the simplicity of a single operating lever that both controlled the reversing linkage and indicated its position.|$|R
50|$|Stealths {{restraint}} system {{consists of a}} thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints. Because the over-the-shoulder portions of the restraint are not rigid, the hand grips are mounted to the lap bar.These restraints use a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>locking</b> system (rather than a ratchet system) which allows them to be pulled down to any position; when locked, they can move down to any position but not up. In contrast, a ratchet-based restraint only locks at each notch, and will often be too loose or uncomfortably tight. Stealths restraints are also held down by a belt in case the main locking system fails. In order to speed up loading, riders are asked to secure their own restraints if they are able to.This {{restraint system}} is identical to many Intamin Launch coasters, including Kingda Ka and Rita at Alton Towers.|$|R
