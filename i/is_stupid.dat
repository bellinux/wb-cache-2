25|$|By February 1920 Wilson's Staff {{wanted to}} reduce {{commitment}} to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), despite inevitable loss of prestige, as {{occupation of the}} whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. In May 1920 Wilson submitted a joint paper with Churchill and Trenchard (Chief of Air Staff) complaining {{about the cost of}} keeping 10,000 British and 50,000 Indian troops there. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements (he also needed troops for Ireland and the UK), but Lloyd George said that Curzon “would not stand it”. By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that “we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided”. Wilson was privately scathing about what he called “Hot Air, Aeroplanes & Arabs” – Trenchard's plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 – although glad at the reduction in military commitment, and wrote to Rawlinson that when trouble came Churchill would “hop into an aeroplane and fly away, waving Ta-Ta to any poor bloody native who <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> enough to back us”.|$|E
500|$|Because Kyle {{also feels}} sex {{addiction}} {{is not a}} disease, but rather a natural male desire that can be kept under control with the proper discipline, others suggest he is somehow immune from the [...] "spell" [...] of the wizard alien. He is brought to Independence Hall along with Butters and both are given rifles by the SWAT team. The hauled-off SWAT member, gagged and bound in an alien wizard costume, stumbles into the room. On orders from the SWAT team, Kyle and Butters shoot the costumed officer dead and the [...] "spell" [...] is suddenly lifted. Woods announces he is cured of his sex addiction, and the next incarnation of his video game once again focuses on golf. Cartman and Stan reject the new game, with Stan proclaiming that [...] "golf <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> again." ...|$|E
500|$|Suddenly {{the volcano}} erupts. The hunters try to flee, but find {{themselves}} trapped {{on the other}} side of the trench. The real Scuzzlebutt then appears, and Jimbo apologizes to the boys for their seemingly imminent deaths, just before realizing that Scuzzlebutt is weaving a wicker basket to carry the hunting party to safety. The lava then flows through the trench just as Randy planned, but due to a miscalculation he made, the trench leads the lava to Denver, destroying it. However, in a misguided attempt to prove he can kill something and impress his uncle, Stan kills Scuzzlebutt. Unfortunately for Stan, Jimbo is less than impressed, telling Stan that he will always be his nephew but that [...] "some things you do kill and some you don't." [...] Stan does not understand, since Jimbo tried to kill Scuzzlebutt earlier. Ned states that he now understands the folly of guns and drops his rifle, which accidentally fires, killing Kenny. Finally, the boys decide that hunting <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> and go home to watch cartoons.|$|E

500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] is a R power ballad which {{lasts for}} 4:01 (four minutes, one second). Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line [...] "Let me tell you somethin' / Never / Have I ever / Been a size 10 in my whole life." [...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus. The bridge consists of Rihanna singing [...] "Trying {{to make this work}} / but you act like a jerk." [...] As noted by Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice, the bridge represents the moment when Rihanna realizes that it is not worth her while to stay in the relationship, writing [...] "the dunce cap is off". [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] contains a lyrical metaphor, [...] "Blood on your hands." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir <b>is</b> <b>stupid.</b> Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them together}} that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer {{note how}} Cordelia {{is also a}} subversive {{representation}} of feminine stereotypes, describing [...] "Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to {{the stereotype of the}} insensitive bitch", what she actually does is [...] "offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in [...] "Earshot", where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, [...] "her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical" [...] and because of this she embodies an [...] "antithesis of female self-sacrifice" [...] in these years but also [...] "the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women". Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia's [...] "lack of depth" [...] becoming [...] "her strength". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> however, pointing out [...] "Cordy's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible." [...] Jowett feels Cordelia's confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, [...] "bitchiness enhances Cordelia's comic appeal", as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth-telling.|$|E

500|$|Bart's rebellious {{attitude}} {{has made him}} a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and is well aware of it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he <b>is</b> <b>stupid.</b> This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bollock-head" [...] is a vulgar British {{term for}} a shaven head. [...] It can also refer to someone who <b>is</b> <b>stupid,</b> as can [...] "bollock-brain". The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) cites the {{expression}} [...] "His brains are in his ballocks", to designate a fool.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1934, Cioculescu was scandalized by the Nu ("No"), {{a radically}} voiced {{manifesto}} by Eugène Ionesco (later {{known as a}} dramatist), and, with fellow critic Tudor Vianu, voted against granting him the Editura Fundaţiilor Regale prize (they {{were the only ones}} to do so). Reputedly, Nu had especially scandalized Cioculescu for denying the merit of Tudor Arghezi's poetry, and for defining Arghezi himself as a [...] "mechanical poet". Nu also featured provocative remarks and allegations about critics in general and Cioculescu in particular: [...] "A critic is a stupid animal. [...] The stupid man is the man to whom realities are opaque. The literary critic has to be stupid. In fortunate cases, the critic <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> by obligation, because of professional habit, and some other times the critic <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> by vocation. A professional with a vocation is somebody who cannot have any other profession except the one he has and who, if that profession does not exist, invents it. [...] critic by professional habit: Mr. Şerban Cioculescu." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{choice to}} have Frank and Claire run as running mates was highly criticized by some reviewers. Jonathan Holmes of Radio Times wrote that [...] "there {{are limits to}} the stupidity viewers are willing to accept, and with season four [...] may have stepped over the line. Claire {{demanding}} her selection as Frank's running mate <b>is</b> <b>stupid.</b> Moronic. It turns a canny political operator into a ham-brained fish-eyed jar-opener." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic wrote that [...] "in moments like this it's good to remember that Cards really, fundamentally is a stupid TV show instead of a particularly cunning comment on political reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|His musicality {{and fame}} abroad {{impacted}} on {{many areas of}} pop culture. Aznavour's name inspired {{the name of the}} character Char Aznable by Yoshiyuki Tomino in his 1979 mecha anime series, Mobile Suit Gundam. His song [...] "Parce que tu crois" [...] was sampled by producer Dr. Dre for the song [...] "What's the Difference" [...] (feat. Eminem & Xzibit), from his album 2001. He is mentioned in The Psychedelic Furs song [...] "Sister Europe" [...] ("The radio upon the floor / <b>is</b> <b>stupid,</b> it plays Aznavour"), the Kemal Monteno song [...] "Stavi tiho Aznavoura" [...] ("Play Aznavour quietly"), and the Jonathan Richman song [...] "Give Paris One More Chance." ...|$|E

When Toko finds Nanami by the river, Toko is upset {{to the point of}} illness by what she saw at the Peace Memorial Museum, and Nanami finds them a hotel room and cares for her, even though she has flashbacks to seeing her mother's last illness when she was a young child. In another flashback, Asahi proposes to a grown Kyoka, against his mother's wishes, as Kyoka was exposed to the bomb.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} of Islam, such as [...] Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Sulaiman Al-Alwan, have supported suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, arguing {{that they are}} army reservists and hence {{should be considered as}} soldiers, while Hamid bin Abdallah al-Ali declared that suicide attacks in Chechnya were justified as a [...] "sacrifice". Many prominent Islamic scholars, including al-Qaradawi himself, have issued condemnations of terrorism in general terms. For example, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia has stated that [...] "terrorizing innocent people [...] constitute a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by Islam", while Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, Grand Imam of al-Azhar and former Grand Mufti of Egypt has stated that [...] "attacking innocent people is not courageous; it <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> and will be punished on the Day of Judgment".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second half}} of the book takes place after the {{renovation}} is complete, allowing India and Thorn {{to be in the same}} location. [...] As they secretly court each other, India and Thorn are forced to confront their own insecurities and fears and to determine how to handle society's expectations of them. [...] In this half, Lala's character is also heavily developed. [...] Other characters perceive her as sweet and biddable, a counterpoint to the independence and spirit attributed to India. [...] In actuality, Lala has definite opinions, and she does not want to marry Thorn, who intimidates her. [...] As the book progresses, it is revealed that Lala cannot read. [...] Although most of the other characters, with the exception of India, believe this means Lala <b>is</b> <b>stupid,</b> readers can recognize that she is actually dsylexic.|$|E
2500|$|Poet Charles Baudelaire was a {{contemporary}} critic of George Sand: [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>stupid,</b> heavy and garrulous. [...] Her ideas on morals {{have the same}} depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women... The {{fact that there are}} men who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation." [...] Other writers of the period, however, differed in their assessment. Flaubert, by no means an indulgent or forbearing critic, was an unabashed admirer. Honoré de Balzac, who knew Sand personally, once said that if someone thought George Sand wrote badly, it was because their own standards of criticism were inadequate. He also noted that her treatment of imagery in her works showed that her writing had an exceptional subtlety, having the ability to [...] "virtually put the image in the word".|$|E
