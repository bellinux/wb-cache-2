25|$|The BMI adds roughly 10% {{for a large}} (or tall) {{frame and}} subtracts roughly 10% for a smaller frame (short stature). In other words, persons with small frames would be {{carrying}} more <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> optimal, but their BMI reflects that they are normal. Conversely, large framed (or tall) individuals may be quite healthy, with a fairly low body fat percentage, but be classified as overweight by BMI.|$|E
25|$|Males {{typically}} have less body <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> females. Recent results indicate androgens inhibit {{the ability of}} some fat cells to store lipids by blocking a signal transduction pathway that normally supports adipocyte function. Also, androgens, but not estrogens, increase beta adrenergic receptors while decreasing alpha adrenergic receptors- which results in increased levels of epinephrine/ norepinephrine {{due to lack of}} alpha-2 receptor negative feedback and decreased fat accumulation due to epinephrine/ norepinephrine then acting on lipolysis-inducing beta receptors.|$|E

50|$|In geometry, a fat {{object is}} {{an object in}} two or more dimensions, whose lengths in the {{different}} dimensions are similar. For example, a square is fat because its length and width are identical. A 2-by-1 rectangle is thinner than a square, but it is fat relative to a 10-by-1 rectangle. Similarly, a circle is <b>fatter</b> <b>than</b> a 1-by-10 ellipse and an equilateral triangle is <b>fatter</b> <b>than</b> a very obtuse triangle.|$|R
25|$|During this period, also in {{response}} to rising levels of estrogen, {{the lower half of}} the pelvis and thus hips widen (providing a larger birth canal). Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty. On average, at 10 years, girls have 6% more body <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> boys.|$|E
25|$|Bacon is a {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from cured pork. It is first cured using {{large quantities of}} salt, either a brine or a dry packing. Fresh bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, {{or it may be}} boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It can be made from the pork belly or from back cuts, which has less <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> the belly.|$|E

India is famous for a large number of localized 'chips shops', selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, yam chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from arrowroot and casava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been released and marketed as lower in <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> its potato counterparts.|$|E

25|$|Trans fats {{are used}} in {{shortenings}} for deep-frying in restaurants, {{as they can be}} used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available. As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> those from Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E

2500|$|Bergmann's rule {{establishes}} {{that among}} endothermic animals {{of the same}} species, body size increases with latitude. [...] Studies have tested whether this rule also applies to social insects. [...] L. acervorum workers were counted {{in a sample of}} colonies from Erlangen and Karelia. [...] The worker size was significantly larger in the Karelian population, with the average thorax length being 1.15mm ± 0.07mm. [...] The average thorax length from the Erlangen population was 1.08 ± 0.05mm. [...] As evidenced, the workers from Karelia were on average 10% larger than the workers from Erlangen. The results suggest that larger body sizes in L. acervorum from boreal habitats might result from selection for increased fasting endurance. [...] Larger workers had more <b>fat</b> <b>than</b> small workers, and would survive longer in colder environments. [...] Leptothorax acervorum might extend their survival time in areas with long winters and unpredictable climate by storing more reserves.

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over <b>fat,</b> <b>than</b> to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat.

Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact.

Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E
