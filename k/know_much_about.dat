5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Browns' 1954 {{training}} camp, Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case. Sheppard, an osteopath, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> their relationship.|$|E

Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries {{did not have the}} information she needed.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal {{has little to do with}} any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E

25|$|Since {{scientists}} cannot <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{the internal}} mechanisms of extinct creatures, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism. However, {{it is generally}} agreed that endothermy first evolved in non-mammalian synapsids such as dicynodonts, which possess body proportions associated with heat retention, high vascularised bones with Haversian canals, and possibly hair. More recently, {{it has been suggested}} that endothermy evolved as far back as Ophiacodon.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while {{he or she might}} not need to <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).|$|E
25|$|Helena Lopata {{argued that}} a Polish {{nationalism}} grew in Polish Americans during World War I, but fell sharply afterward. Polish immigrants to the United States did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Poland aside from their local villages. In preparation for World War I, the Polish government asked for donations using appeals {{on behalf of the}} safety of their loved ones back home, as well as promises of a good high status back in Poland when they returned home. Lopata found that after World War I, many Polish Americans continued to receive requests for aid in Poland, and feelings of anger for all the years they had delayed bettering their own situation were common. Return immigrants who had dreamed of using their American savings to buy status symbols in Poland (farmlands, houses, etc.) were still treated as peasants in Poland, creating resentment towards the motherland.|$|E

25|$|Ardashir had an {{outstanding}} {{role in developing}} the royal ideology. He tried to show himself as a worshiper of Mazda related to god and possessing khvarenah. The claim of the legitimacy of his reign as a rightful newcomer from {{the line of the}} mythical Iranian shahs and the propagations attributed to Ardashir against the legitimacy and role of the Parthians in the Iranian history sequence show the valuable place that the Achaemenid legacy had {{in the minds of the}} first Sasanian shahanshahs; though the current belief is that the Sasanians did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the Achaemenids and their status. On the other hand, some historians believe that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their succeeding shahanshahs deliberately turned to the Kayanians. They knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to attribute their past to the Kayanians; and that was where they applied holy historiography.|$|E
25|$|Through {{his wife}} Eleanor, {{he had come}} to <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Ireland and {{especially}} Northern Ireland. She came from the Protestant plantation community of Ulster, originating largely in south-western Scotland. Presumably because of this knowledge, Davis was in 1985 induced by Sir David Wills into a project in historical education, to be financed by the Wills Trust, to encourage better understanding between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and presumably between Catholics and Protestants in the North. Davis recruited teachers, school inspectors and academics to serve on a committee to frame a curriculum of Irish history which would be acceptable to schools in both North and South. The committee oversaw the writing of the Questions in Irish History series of history books. The Teaching of History Trust has continued to work long afterwards, sponsored by Longman. The first volumes of the series are dedicated to Ralph Davis' memory. He was still actively working for peace in Northern Ireland when he died.|$|E

He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer.

500|$|Kent Hughes {{was unique}} among {{prominent}} Australians in publicly identifying as a fascist, although he never joined a fascist organisation or acted overtly {{in a way}} that could be described as fascist and {{there is no evidence to}} suggest he was an anti-semite. His biographer Frederick Howard maintains that Kent Hughes did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> fascism and used the word mainly for its shock value. [...] "Kent Hughes does not seem to have paid enough attention to the difference between theory and practice in Mussolini's Italy," [...] he observes.|$|E
500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy Remixed was generally negative. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters {{explained that the}} remixers' efforts ultimately make Bloc Party's work [...] "less engaging, less meaningful". Ben Patashnik of NME stated that the album is largely monotonous and includes too many pedestrian experiments in dance music. Drowned in Sound's Chris Power indicated that [...] "in putting their names to the album Bloc Party {{seem to be saying}} they either don't care about what they ask fans to spend their money on or they don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> electronic music".|$|E

At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I’m busy enough with that, so I really don’t need more on my plate." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilhelm {{was noted}} {{during this period}} for his {{mentoring}} of relief pitcher Wilbur Wood, {{who came to the}} 1967 White Sox in a trade. Wood sometimes threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged him to throw it full-time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and earned a 1.87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, as the White Sox coaches did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> how to throw it. Between 1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games (241) than any other pitcher and more innings (...) than any other relief pitcher.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make {{love to me}} when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't let me go / Make love to me when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
