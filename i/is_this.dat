When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
