The company, founded in 1962, is a large heavy machinery manufacturer. Packer’s balance sheet at December 31, 1997 includes a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 22 million related to net future <b>deductible</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>differences.</b> However, realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the U.

Although realization is not assured, Packer management {{in the past has}} been pretty sure that such benefits will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income. Management has carefully considered various factors in assessing the probability of realizing these deferred tax benefits. Brett recalls the complexity surrounding the judgmental nature of accounting for deferred taxes under generally accepted accounting principles. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109 (FAS 109), Packer could be required to record a deferred tax asset for future deductible amounts and carry-forwards and record a valuation allowance, if {{it is likely that the}} tax asset will not be realized.
