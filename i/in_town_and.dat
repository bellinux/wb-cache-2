5|$|June 26, 2009: An EF1 tornado hit {{the town}} of Wethersfield. Widespread damage across town {{especially}} near the area of Wolcott Hill. Many downed trees caused damages, most notably in Old Wethersfield where a tree split a house <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> destroyed a front porch. Damage was estimated at around $2.4 million.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> is a testament to the economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E

5|$|Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 30, 1935, James Charles Taylor had two paper {{routes to}} help his widowed mother make ends meet. He {{delivered}} the morning and afternoon routes by bicycle for three dollars a week, which helped to develop his leg muscles. Though he did not play football until his junior year, he was a star athlete in four sports at Baton Rouge High School, and graduated in 1954. He stayed <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> played college football at Louisiana State University for coach Paul Dietzel's LSU Tigers football team. Taylor played on LSU's freshman team in 1954, but due to struggles in the classroom, he transferred to Hinds Community College in Raymond, Mississippi as a sophomore, where he met his future wife Dixie Grant. He then returned to LSU as a junior.|$|E
5|$|By 2001 NFF was in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> the conversion of gravel and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|Darrin, {{a shallow}} New York {{advertising}} executive, traveled {{to a small}} town in the deep south upon receiving word that his aunt has died and left him a sizable inheritance. Once in town, Darrin is informed that he will only receive the money if he successfully leads a local gospel group to victory at an upcoming competition. Reluctant but strapped for cash, Darrin takes on the task of finding the best singers <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> shaping the group up. Along the way, he becomes acclimated to the town {{with the help of his}} cousin Lucius (played by Mike Epps) and meets Lilly, a single mother who not only possesses an incredible voice but also the ability to warm Darrin's cold heart.|$|E

5|$|In early January 1923 Stroheim {{arrived in}} San Francisco, where he scouted {{locations}} and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for Greed, he attended society functions <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother Charles and his sister-in-law Kathleen. To capture the authentic {{spirit of the}} story, Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.|$|E
5|$|Levanger Station is {{the most}} {{spectacular}} station {{on the line and}} also the best preserved town station. Built entirely in stone, it has a dominant position <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> with a park in front of the station. It was designed in combined Medieval style, with strong elements of Gothic and Romanesque style. Steinkjer Station was the other station entirely built in stone. It has a combined Baroque Revival and Art Nouveau style, and is more anonymous than Levanger Station. Its characteristics were largely lost after it was connected with the bus station. Three stations, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger, have been preserved, while Skatval and Hell have been protected.|$|E
5|$|M-78 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with M-66 in Pennfield Township, north of Battle Creek in Calhoun County. The trunkline passes through rural farm lands as it runs due east and northeast. It briefly crosses {{the southeast corner}} of Barry County as it enters Eaton County. There M-78 follows Battle Creek Highway past some small ponds and into the town of Bellevue. The trunkline becomes Capitol Avenue <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> turns south onto Main Street {{in the middle of the}} central business district. M-78 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway before leaving town. Main Street turns easterly and becomes Butterfield Highway. M-78 crosses the Battle Creek River before terminating at I-69's exit48 in Bellevue Township.|$|E

Nina is upset to learn that Trixie and Nick are no longer together, and, when Trixie tells {{her that she was}} not married to her father, Nina leaves for Bombay to see Nick. Trixie and Lou later marry. Nina returns a year later after {{becoming}} an actress in Bollywood. She goes to see Jack and tells him that she wants to be with him. She also visits Lou and gives him some money, as Trixie had left him bankrupt. Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) tells Nina that Jack needs to stay in Australia so he can sort himself out. Nina performs her last concert at Lou's Place, and she tells Jack that she will wait for him. Months later, Jack flies out to Los Angeles to be with Nina.|$|E
5|$|The Get Up Kids toured relentlessly {{for almost}} three years in {{promotion}} of the record. As well as touring Europe, Japan, and Australia, they shared bills with acts such as Green Day, The Anniversary, Koufax, Hot Rod Circuit, Jebediah, Weezer and Ozma. Their 2000 tour with The Anniversary and Koufax was sponsored by Napster. Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth. Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand {{by the time the}} band arrived <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform. To capitalize on anticipation for the band's next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation Eudora in 2001. Eudora consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band's formation. Likewise, Doghouse released a re-mastered edition of Four Minute Mile and a compilation entitled The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day, combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one compact disc.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} US2, one mile (1.6km) south of Engadine and crosses the Canadian National Railway line before {{entering}} town. In Engadine, M-117 meets the western terminus of H-40 which runs on Hiawatha Trail. The trunkline passes a small pond <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> some farm fields north of Engadine. The terrain transitions to forest as the highway crosses into Luce County. The route angles {{slightly to the}} northeast to avoid Kaks Lake south of M-28 near Newberry. M-117 provides an important connection {{between two of the}} main highways in the UP. This connection is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Of the ten state trunklines that connect M-28 and US2, M-117 is one of three that do not overlap either. The others are US45 and Interstate 75.|$|E

5|$|Wickersham {{estimated}} 500 people <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> another count estimated 1,000, with 387 houses under construction, six saloons, and no churches. Before spring arrived, Wickersham {{published the}} first {{newspaper in the}} settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy. But even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling {{for as little as}} $10. Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged {{for the establishment of a}} post office at his settlement.|$|E
5|$|With ESPN's College GameDay <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> {{in front}} of a sold out Williams–Brice, Alabama was upset by the South Carolina Gamecocks 35–21. After Alabama scored on its opening drive with a 32-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal, South Carolina responded with three {{consecutive}} touchdowns. Stephen Garcia threw three touchdown passes, with the first to Marcus Lattimore for nine-yards followed by strikes of 26 and 15-yards to Alshon Jeffery, to give South Carolina a 21–3 lead in the second quarter. Alabama reached the end zone late in the second on a nine-yard Greg McElroy pass to Julio Jones to make the halftime score 21–9 after the extra point failed.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt outlived his brothers, {{and due to}} {{the fame}} Wyatt gained from Lake's {{biography}} and later adaptations of it, he is often mistakenly viewed as the central character and hero of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. In fact, Virgil Earp, as Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone City Marshal, actually held the legal authority in Tombstone {{the day of the}} shootout. Virgil had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal than did Wyatt. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons <b>in</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> to disarm the Cowboys. Wyatt was only a temporary assistant marshal to his brother.|$|E
