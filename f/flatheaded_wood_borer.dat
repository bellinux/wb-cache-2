40|$|The {{preservative}} potentials of Vetiver (Vetiveria nigritana) plant extracts on Ceiba pentadra wood against termites and <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> was investigated. Samples were extracted using {{water and}} methanol. The wood samples {{were treated with}} the extracts and exposed to termites and <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> for 12 weeks. The modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, decay resistance and field exposure were tested for in the samples and recorded before and after treatment for comparison in accordance to ASTM standards. Results were analysed using ANOVA. Laboratory analysis on Vetiver plant indicated the following: Na (0. 5 %), K (0. 96 %), Ca (1. 28 %), Mg (1. 06 %), P (0. 46 %). Mechanical tests revealed that V. nigritana extracts {{do not have any}} significant effect on the strength properties of the wood. Grave yard test showed that the untreated and V. nigritana water extract treated wood samples were damaged up to 40 %, while no significance deterioration was observed in those treated with V. nigritana methanol extract.

40|$|Non-indigenous {{marine species}} {{are a major}} concern worldwide. For some species, {{insufficient}} historical and biogeographical data can leave their origin and patterns of dispersal difficult to determine. Among such species are marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers.</b> This thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach, combining both historical and biological methods, to address marine borer impacts, management attempts, and their status in New Zealand. This research had two key components. Firstly, a historical review sought to improve the understanding and awareness of the historic impacts and responses to borers, with particular reference to New Zealand between 1850 and 1930. Marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> have had profound impacts throughout history, responsible for significant structural and economic damage to wooden ships and marine infrastructure globally. In New Zealand, trade and economy {{played an important role}} in providing both the transportation vectors and infrastructure for marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> to inhabit. Ongoing trialling of timber alternatives and chemicals for the preservation of infrastructure followed, with little success until the introduction of ferro-concrete in the early 1900 s. When considered in a global context, the New Zealand case study of borer impacts and management attempts highlights their significant role in environmental history. Mitochondrial DNA (COI) sequence analyses were used to examine the questionable invasion histories and status of common marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> in New Zealand. It has been assumed that many marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> invaded New Zealand via wooden ships. However, these purported introductions are historic, and the specific origins of many species are unclear. Species from three families and two phyla were collected around the North Island, New Zealand; Teredinidae (Bivalvia: Mollusca), Sphaeromatidae and Limnoriidae (Isopoda: Arthropoda). Low levels of genetic divergence (0 - 2 %) were found among the New Zealand populations of two species, Limnoria quadripunctata and Sphaeroma quoianum, suggesting a non-indigenous status. Limnoria quadripunctata also showed a close genetic affinity to populations in Chile, supporting a non-indigenous status, with its widespread distribution in New Zealand explained by multiple introductions. For Lyrodus pedicellatus, a lack of genetic affinity to conspecifics sequenced elsewhere (France), greater genetic diversity compared to the native Bankia australis, and evidence of population structuring among New Zealand locations, suggested L. pedicellatus may be native to New Zealand. Lyrodus pedicellatus from New Zealand was highly divergent (> 20 %) from global L. pedicellatus populations, suggesting that either identifications of specimens on global databases are incorrect, or the New Zealand species represents a morphologically undescribed cryptic congener. In conclusion, COI sequences provided a useful tool in elucidating the status of marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> in New Zealand, and highlighted a need for taxonomic resolution of some species. Collectively the two chapters illustrate the knowledge gaps and lack of recognition surrounding marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers,</b> globally and in New Zealand. This research provides an extensive understanding of their significant historical role in marine environmental history and assists in re-evaluation of their current native or non-indigenous status in New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>borer</b> Xylotrechus arvicola has {{recently}} become a pest of vineyards {{in most of}} the productive winegrowing areas of Spain. The activity of its larvae has important consequences on grapevine production. Different production parameters such as bunch length and weight, number of flowers, wood weight, leaf pigments and Baumé degree of the must were registered in Viura and Tempranillo varieties in La Rioja, separating X. arvicola affected and not affected branches on the individual plants. All the considered parameters were influenced by the <b>wood</b> <b>borer</b> activity, except the Baumé degree.

40|$|The {{digestion}} of lignocellulose {{is attracting}} attention {{both in terms}} of basic research into its metabolism by microorganisms and animals, and also as a means of converting plant biomass into biofuels. Limnoriid <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> are unusual because, unlike other wood-feeding animals, they do not rely on symbiotic microbes to help digest lignocellulose. The absence of microbes in the digestive tract suggests that limnoriid <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> produce all the enzymes necessary for lignocellulose digestion themselves. In this study we report that analysis of ESTs from the digestive system of Limnoria quadripunctata reveals a transcriptome dominated by glycosyl hydrolase genes. Indeed, >  20 % of all ESTs represent genes encoding putative cellulases, including glycosyl hydrolase family 7 (GH 7) cellobiohydrolases. These have not previously been reported in animal genomes, but are key digestive enzymes produced by wood-degrading fungi and symbiotic protists in termite guts. We propose that limnoriid GH 7 genes are important for the efficient digestion of lignocellulose in the absence of gut microbes. Hemocyanin transcripts were highly abundant in the hepatopancreas transcriptome. Based on recent studies indicating that these proteins may function as phenoloxidases in isopods, we discuss a possible role for hemocyanins in lignin decomposition...|$|R

40|$|A 14 month {{study was}} {{conducted}} of the marine <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> present on monthly suspended wooden blocks at nine stations in Los Angeles Harbor in 2013 - 2014, and compared {{to the results of}} a marine borer study conducted in 1950 - 1951. Many environmental changes have occurred in the harbor over the past 60 + years. The harbor land mass of the outer harbor has been expanded towards the breakwater, channels were deepened, and the water quality improved as a result of pollution abatement. Existing pilings were removed, replaced or covered with two layers of polyethylene. The isopod Limnoria tripunctata and the pelecypod Lyrodus pedicellatus were the principal species and present at nearly all stations. Station C located in the Consolidated Slip area of the inner harbor was the site of 87 and 58 percent of the Limnoria and Lyrodus, respectively, counted during the study. Neither of these species was present at this station in 1950 - 1951. The dissolved oxygen concentration at this station improved from a mean of 0. 1 ppm in 1950 - 1951 to a mean of 6. 7 in 2013 - 2014 as a result of improved environmental conditions. Larval settlement at Station D numbered in the thousands in 1950 - 1951 but only 22 were counted during the 2013 - 2014 survey. This difference was attributed to the effect of piling covering or removal. It is recommended that existing creosoted pilings be covered or removed in the inner harbor area since this was the region of greatest occurrence of <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> in 2013 - 2014...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of insects}} in the {{decomposition}} of and nutrient release from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsugamenziesii (Mirb.)

In April 1976, two large-diameter (average diameter at breast height, 41. 7  cm) and two small-diameter (average diameter at breast height 26. 3  cm) trees were felled. Three pairs of 91  cm length sections were cut from each tree. Half the sections were covered with window screening to prevent insect entry. The number of Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonuspseudotsugae Hpk.) attacks on each section, {{as well as the}} frass production, were monitored. After 10 years, decomposition rates were determined by mass loss. Douglas-fir beetles attacked large-diameter (23 attacks/m 2) and small-diameter (27 attacks/m 2) log sections at similar rates. Total frass production was also similar (33. 6  g•m− 2 for large logs and 32. 6  g•m− 2 for small logs). Large-diameter unscreened log sections tended to decompose faster (k =  0. 050 per year) than small diameter unscreened logs (k =  0. 026 per year) owing to the presence of <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> (Monochamusscutellatus (Say)) in the larger logs. Screening of logs to reduce insect attack tended to reduce the rate of decomposition. A brown rotting fungus (Oligoporusplacentus (Fr.) Gilb. and Ryv.) fruited on unscreened large-diameter logs. <b>Wood</b> <b>borers</b> had a greater influence on log decomposition than Douglas-fir beetles. Frass produced by the Douglas-fir beetle contributed very little to litter fall and nutrient cycling. After 10 years there was a net release of N, P, K, Ca, and Mn from decomposing logs.

However, some sibling species of this genus {{are very difficult to}} distinguish because of their similar morphological features. To address this issue, we conducted phylogenetic and genetic analyses of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 28 S RNA gene sequences from eight species of Sclerodermus reared from different <b>wood</b> <b>borer</b> pests. The eight sibling species were as follows: S. guani Xiao et Wu, S. sichuanensis Xiao, S. pupariae Yang et Yao, and Sclerodermus spp. (Nos. 1 - 5). A 594 -bp fragment of COI and 750 -bp fragment of 28 S were subsequently sequenced. For COI, the G-C content was found to be low in all the species, averaging to about 30. 0 %. Sequence divergences (Kimura- 2 -parameter distances) between congeneric species averaged to 4. 5 %, and intraspecific divergences averaged to about 0. 09 %. Further, the maximum sequence divergences between congeneric species and Sclerodermus sp. (No. 5) averaged to about 16. 5 %. All 136 samples analyzed were included in six reciprocally monophyletic clades in the COI neighbor-joining (NJ) tree. The NJ tree inferred from the 28 S rRNA sequence yielded almost identical results, but the samples from S. guani, S. sichuanensis, S. pupariae, and Sclerodermus spp. (Nos. 1 - 4) clustered together and only Sclerodermus sp.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of eucalypt forestry worldwide {{has been accompanied}} by accidental and deliberate introductions of Australian insects associated with eucalypts. Local insect species have also colonised introduced eucalypts in many regions. This situation provides a unique opportunity to observe the development of new insect communities across trophic levels. Here the history of Australian invaders and native colonisers on eucalypts outside Australia is reviewed from the perspective of herbivore guilds: leaf chewers, sap suckers, <b>wood</b> <b>borers,</b> gall formers, termites. Historical patterns of invasion are identified across these guilds. Very few species of Australian leaf chewers, <b>wood</b> <b>borers</b> or termites have become widespread but these guilds are proportionately high in native colonisers. In contrast, sap suckers have multiple invasive species globally with relatively fewer native colonisers. The gall former guild also has several invasive species but so far includes no native colonisers, perhaps due to their tendency to have highly specific host plant associations. Natural enemies of Australian invaders are also members of new eucalypt insect communities, partly through planned biological control programs, but the rate of accidental introductions at higher trophic levels is increasing steadily. At the same time, local natural enemies enter eucalypt communities either to form new associations with Australian invaders or to follow native colonisers into this new habitat. Australian sap suckers have attracted far more new associations than other guilds so far. Native leaf chewers have often been followed by their local natural enemies into eucalypt communities, particularly in Brazil. Generally there are fewer records relating to local natural enemies and their role in new eucalypt communities. The complexity of new eucalypt communities outside Australia is expected to increase in future...|$|R
