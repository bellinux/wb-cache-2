40|$|Background:Many ancient civilizations {{have used}} plants for {{medicinal}} purposes and indeed research {{has suggested that}} plant-derived compounds can be useful for treating many ailments, including cancer and infectious diseases. One such plant, Equisetum arvense, commonly known as horsetail, is a herbal plant that grows in Saudi Arabia and is traditionally used as a diuretic. Objective (s) : We sought to determine whether <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> exhibits 1) cytotoxic activity on cell lines and 2) antibacterial activity on the bacterial strain Escherichia coli. Materials and Methods: Using dried aerial part of the horsetail plant, a methanolic extract was prepared for screening. This extract was examined for its cytotoxic effect on the following cell lines: cervical adenocarcinoma and breast adenocarcinoma as a cancer cell model; lung fibroblast as a normal cell model; and human embryonic kidney. After 72 hours of treatment, the cells were assayed to determine the relative percentages of dead and live cells. Microscopical examination was used to give approximate percentages and a general overview of the effect on cell morphology. The LIVE⁄DEAD® Viability⁄Cytotoxicity kit was used to determine viability of cells in the population by using two dyes: the green-fluorescent calcein-AM which stains living cells, and the red-fluorescent ethidium homodimer- 1 which stains dead cells. The alamarBlue® assay, based on a fluorometric/colorimetric growth indicator that detects metabolic activity, was used to establish a relative percentage of the living cells in a population treated with the plant extract compared to untreated cells (control). To determine antibacterial activity, the disc diffusion method was used. Results: Preliminary screening suggests that the <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> induces death on the four tested cell lines with the greatest effect on human embryonic kidney cells followed by breast adenocarcinoma. The extract also displayed antibacterial activity at the highest concentration tested. Future studies will focus on identifying and characterizing the active components within the <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> that exert the cytotoxic and/or antibacterial activity. This may provide a new and novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of cancer and specifically renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) patients. This also may suggest nephrotoxic effect possessed by the plant which has not been investigated by any previous studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{application}} of three dosages (5, 10 and 15 mL/L) and two frequencies (each 6 and 8 days) of ethanoic extracts obtained from cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume) and common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.) on incidence {{and severity of}} grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) on strawberry crop (Fragaria ananassa cv. Albion) was evaluated. Experiment {{was carried out in}} a randomized block design with factorial arrangement 2 x 3 x 2 + 1, with three replications. Lower incidence and severity percentage in flower and fruit (10. 24 and 24. 43 %, respectively) were observed after application of cinnamon extract at 15 mL/L at 6 days interval. Similarly, lower fruit severity (11. 86 %) was observed with the same treatment. In general, reduction in B. cinerea incidence and severity was lower when common <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> was used, compared to cinnamon extracts. According to our results, using of cinnamon hydro-ethanoic extracts could be considered as sustainable alternative for grey mold management in strawberry crops...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Europe, {{extracts}} of Equisetum arvense (common horsetail) have a {{long tradition}} {{in the treatment of}} inflammatory disorders. To understand the molecular basis for its use, we investigated the immunomodulatory capacity of a standardized commercially available common <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> on human primary lymphocyte function in vitro. Methods: The standardized extract of Equisetum arvense was phytochemically characterized. Effects on proliferation, viability and activity of mitogen-activated human lymphocytes were assessed in comparison to cyclosporine A using annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays and flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterization, respectively. Intracellular levels of effector molecules (IL- 2, IFN-γ and TNF-α) were analyzed with cytokine assays. Results: T cell proliferation was inhibited dose dependently by the Equisetum extract without induction of apoptosis or necrosis. This effect was mediated through inhibition of lymphocyte activation, specifically by diminishing CD 69 and IL- 2 surface receptor expression and intracellular IL- 2 production. Furthermore, treatment with Equisetum arvense inhibited effector functions, as indicated by reduced production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Conclusions: The data indicate that the used extract of Equisetum arvense interferes with the polyfunctionality of immunocompetent cells thereby providing an anti-inflammatory mode-of-action...|$|E
40|$|Equisetum arvense L. is a {{herbaceous}} medicinal plant, {{commonly known}} as <b>horsetail,</b> whose <b>extracts</b> {{have been reported to}} possess diuretic and haemostatic properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of fingerprint chromatographic methods on commercially available raw materials or preparations of E. arvense L. in order to ascertain their quality and identify possible adulterants using HPLC and HPTLC densitometry. Two chromatographic methods were used to determine the chemical fingerprints of E. arvense and other allied species. The first was based on HPTLC identification followed by densitometric measurement at 350 nm. The second was based on HPLC separation. The ease of sample preparation and the possibility of simultaneous analysis of several samples in a short time make HPTLC a method of choice for the comprehensive quality evaluation of herbal products...|$|R
40|$|The global cycling of silicon, {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the Earth's crust, is a process driven almost entirely by biological organisms. Silicon accumulation and cycling {{plays a major role}} in controlling the global carbon cycle by fertilizing terrestrial and aquatic photosynthetic organisms, which, in turn, influences global climate. Today, grasses are the dominant organisms in the terrestrial cycle, but there are many other plants that also accumulate weight-percent silicon in their leaves. The relatively young age of grasses suggests that, in the past, there were most likely other species of plants which controlled the global terrestrial silicon cycle. We aim to reconstruct the evolution of silicon uptake by examining the mechanisms of accumulation in early-diverging plant lineages, specifically the fern Equisetum, commonly known as the <b>horsetail.</b> After <b>extracting</b> and reverse transcribing RNA from different species of Equisetum, we attempted to amplify silicon transporter sequences using primers previously developed for Equisetum arvense. After amplification, we observed a band in our gel analysis, indicating that a gene was successfully cloned. By analyzing these sequences and comparing them to existing sequences in more recent plant lineages, we will be able to determine if methods of silicon accumulation are conserved across species. This information will allow us to reconstruct the history of the terrestrial silicon cycle, putting us in a better position to understand how plants have shaped, and will continue to shape, terrestrial ecosystems and global climate...|$|R
40|$|In this work, active films {{based on}} starch and PVA (S:PVA ratio of 2 : 1) were {{developed}} by incorporating neem (NO) and oregano essential oils (OEO). First, a screening of the antifungal effectiveness of different natural extracts (echinacea, <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract,</b> liquid smoke and neem seed oil) against two fungus (P. expansum and A. niger) was carried out. The effect of NO and OEO incorporation on the films’ physical and antimicrobial properties was analyzed. Only composite films containing OEO exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activity. Antibacterial activity occurred at low OEO concentration (6. 7 %), while antifungal effect required higher doses of OEO in the films. Incorporation of oils did not notably affect the water sorption capacity and water vapor barrier properties of S-PVA films, but reduced their transparency and gloss, especially at the highest concentrations. The mechanical response of the S-PVA films was also negatively affected by oil incorporation but this was only relevant at the highest oil ratio (22 %). S-PVA films with 6. 7 % of OEO exhibited the best physical properties, without significant differences {{with respect to the}} S-PVA matrix, while exhibiting antibacterial activity. Thus, the use of OEO as a natural antimicrobial incorporated into starch-PVA films represents a good and novel alternative in food packaging applications...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the active}} {{substances}} allowed in organic production are now approved as basic sub- stances under the EU plant protection products regulation. Previously, all organic farming permitted active substances were approved as conventional plant protection products. In accordance with the criteria of Article 23 of the EU regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009, basic substances are granted without maximum residue limits {{and have a good}} prospect for being included in Annex II of organic farming Regulation (EC) 889 / 2008. In fact, most of them are already permitted in organic farming. At this stage, it seems desirable to organize applications in order to avoid duplications and to clarify strategy across Europe. This organization should be planned in order to identify corresponding knowledge and data from field experiments, and to further constitute the most crucial issues related to organic production. A work of this nature was initially supported by IFOAM-EU for lecithin, calcium hydroxide and Quassia extract. The Institut Technique de l’Agriculture Biologique (ITAB) was previously engaged in a large-scale approval plan motivated by the continuous demand for the regularization of compounds/substances already in use and has a mandate for testing and approving new compatible substances. Thus, the <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> (Equisetum arvense) was the first approved basic substance and ITAB has obtained 11 of the 15 basic substances approved at the EU level. <br /...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a strong}} need for {{effective}} products, simple to use and safe for a chronic use {{in the management of}} nail psoriasis. Recently, a non-drug, water-soluble nail lacquer became available, containing hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH), <b>horsetail</b> <b>extract</b> (Equisetum arvense) and methylsulphonyl-methane (DMSO(2)). This product was effective in strengthening the nails and reducing fragility and roughness in brittle nails. A clinical trial was performed to verify whether this product was able to improve nail psoriatic signs and appearance. Thirty adult patients affected by mild to moderate symmetric psoriasis of the matrix and/or of the nail bed in at least one fingernail diagnosed more than 6 months before screening and with negative mycology findings were recruited. The nail lacquer was applied once daily on the affected fingernails of the left hand for 24 consecutive weeks. The right hand was used as control. The extent and severity of nail psoriasis was assessed on a target fingernail by means of the recently proposed Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score. The value at baseline was 2. 83 (+/- 0. 99). At the end of treatment, the patients judged the treatment effect and their willing to continue product application. Adverse events were carefully recorded. Overall, 28 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. At the end of treatment, results showed a 72 % reduction in pitting, 66 % reduction in leukonychia, 63 % reduction in onycholysis and a reduction of 65 % in NAPSI score compared to baseline, respectively. No changes were observed in the untreated nails. Patients' treatment evaluation was classified as very satisfying or good by 78. 6 % of patients. The acceptability of the treatment was excellent in all patients both for the easiness and for the organoleptic characteristics of the product and 75 % of them decided to continue the application {{after the end of the}} study. No adverse reactions were reported. In our experience, the new water-soluble nail lacquer proved to be effective in decreasing signs and symptoms of nail dystrophy in psoriatic patients. The effect was particularly evident on NAPSI and on pitting. The product was very well accepted by the patients. None declared...|$|E
