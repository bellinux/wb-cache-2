The new sequence occurs at low angular momenta and changes into the single <b>dot</b> <b>sequence</b> at a critical angular momentum determined by the strength of the inter-dot electron tunneling. We also propose that the magic numbers can be investigated experimentally in vertically coupled dots. Because of the generalized Kohn theorem, the far-infrared optical absorption spectrum of a single dot is unaffected by correlation but the theorem does not hold for two vertically coupled dots which have different confining potentials. We show that the absorption energy of the double dot should exhibit discontinuities at the magnetic fields where the total angular momentum changes from one magic number to another.

This study examines this issue in patients with Turner syndrome (TS), a genetic condition characterized by a specific cognitive profile frequently associating poor mathematical achievement, low spatial skills and reduced STM abilities. In order to identify the influence of visuo-spatial and STM processing on numerical magnitude abilities, twenty female participants with TS and twenty control female participants matched for verbal IQ and education level were administered a series of magnitude comparison tasks. The tasks differed {{on the nature of the}} magnitude to be processed (continuous, discrete and symbolic magnitude), on visuo-spatial processing requirement (no/high) and on STM demands (low in simultaneous presentation vs. high in sequential presentation).

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of motion flow {{estimation}} for a scene with multiple moving objects, observed from a possibly moving camera. We take as input a (possibly sparse) noisy velocity field as obtained from local matching, and produce a set of overlapping layers, each corresponding to a smooth vector field with precise boundaries. For a fixed observer, these layers correspond to objects in motion, and capture occlusion information. For a moving observer, further processing is required to segment independent objects and infer structure. Unlike previous approaches, which generate layers by iteratively fitting data to a set of predefined parameters, we instead find boundaries first, then infer regions and address occlusion overlap relationships. All computational steps use a common framework of tensors to represent velocity information, together with saliency (confidence), and uncertainty. Communication between sites is performed by convolution-like tensor voting. The scheme is non-iterative, and the only free parameter is the scale, related to neighborhood size.

However, recent neuropsychological findings reveal a dissociation between numerosity {{and duration}} processing, which suggests the existence of partially distinct mechanisms. In this study, we tested the idea of partially common and distinct mechanisms by investigating, for the first time, both numerical and temporal processing abilities in non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients known to suffer from duration impairment and in healthy elderly adults known to have impaired performance in duration tasks. The aim was to assess whether this impaired duration processing would extend to numerosity processing. The participants had to compare either the numerosity of flashed <b>dot</b> <b>sequences</b> or the duration of single dot displays. The results demonstrate an effect of aging on duration comparison, healthy elderly participants making significantly more errors than healthy young participants. Importantly, the performance of PD patients on the duration task was worse than that of the healthy young and elderly groups, whereas no difference was found for numerosity comparison.

40|$|Numerosity and {{duration}} processing have been modeled by a functional mechanism taking {{the form of}} an accumulator working under two different operative modes. Separate investigations of their cerebral substrates have revealed partly similar patterns of activation, mainly in parietal and frontal areas. However, the precise cerebral implementation of the accumulator model within these areas has not yet been directly assessed. In this study, we asked participants to categorize the numerosity of flashed <b>dot</b> <b>sequences</b> or the duration of single dot displays, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the common neural correlates of these processes. The results reveal a large right-lateralized fronto-parietal network, including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and areas in the precentral, middle and superior frontal gyri, which is activated by both numerosity {{and duration}} processing. Complementary psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses show a functional connectivity between the right IPS and the frontal areas in both tasks, whereas the right IPS was functionally connected to the left IPS and the right precentral area in the numerosity categorization task only.

In the parietal cortex of monkeys, some populations of neurons were found to respond selectively to sequentially- or simultaneously-presented numerosities, whereas other populations showed similar activation in both modes of presentation. However, whether such mode-dependent and -independent representations of numerosity also exist in humans is still unknown. Here, we used fMRI to identify the areas involved in numerosity processing while participants classified linear arrays of dots (simultaneous stimuli) or flashed <b>dot</b> <b>sequences</b> (sequential stimuli). The processing of simultaneous numerosities induced activations bilaterally in several areas of the IPS, whereas activations during the processing of sequential numerosities were restricted to the right hemisphere. A conjunction analysis showed that only the right IPS and precentral gyrus showed overlapping activations during the judgement of sequential and simultaneous stimuli. Voxelwise correlations confirmed the highly similar pattern of activation found in these regions during both tasks. This pattern was weaker or absent in mode-dependent regions, like the right inferior frontal cortex and the lateral occipital complex. Finally, a close look at the right IPS revealed an anterior-to-posterior gradient of activation with selective activation for sequential and simultaneous stimuli in the anterior and posterior areas, respectively, and overlapping activations in-between. This study provides the first direct evidence that, in humans, the right IPS contains both mode-dependent and mode-independent representations of numerosity...|$|R

Working memory capacity {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured <b>dots</b> in <b>sequence</b> on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|R
40|$|Adult humans, infants, pre-school children, and {{non-human}} animals {{appear to}} share a system of approximate numerical processing for non-symbolic stimuli such as arrays of <b>dots</b> or <b>sequences</b> of tones. Behavioral studies of adult humans implicate a link between these non-symbolic numerical abilities and symbolic numerical processing (e. g., similar distance effects in accuracy and reaction-time for arrays of dots and Arabic numerals). However, neuroimaging studies have remained inconclusive on the neural basis of this link. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to respond selectively to symbolic numerical stimuli such as Arabic numerals. Recent studies, however, have arrived at conflicting conclusions regarding {{the role of the}} IPS in processing non-symbolic, numerosity arrays in adulthood, and very {{little is known about the}} brain basis of numerical processing early in development. Addressing the question of whether there is an early-developing neural basis for abstract numerical processing is essential for understanding the cognitive origins of our uniquely human capacity for math and science. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 4 -Tesla and an event-related fMRI adaptation paradigm, we found that adults showed a greater IPS response to visual arrays that deviated from standard stimuli in their number of elements, than to stimuli that deviated in local element shape.

40|$|Five-year-old {{children}} {{categorized as}} skilled versus unskilled counters were given verbal estimation and number word comprehension tasks with numerosities 20 – 120. Skilled counters showed a linear relation between number words and nonsymbolic numerosities. Unskilled counters showed the same linear relation for smaller numbers {{to which they}} could count, but not for larger number words. Further tasks indicated that unskilled counters failed even to correctly order large number words differing by a 2 : 1 ratio, whereas they performed well on this task with smaller numbers, and performed well on a nonsymbolic ordering task with the same numerosities. These findings provide evidence that large, approximate numerosity representations become linked to number words around the time that children learn to count to those words reliably. Although infants represent and discriminate large numerosities (Lipton & Spelke, 2003; Xu & Spelke, 2000) and adults draw on large-number representations when they perform symbolic arithmetic (Dehaene, 1997; Gallistel & Gelman, 2000), {{it is not known}} whether preschool children use these nonverbal representations of number to master the symbolic number system. The present experiment investigates whether children link number words to nonsymbolic representations of numerosity before, during, or after they have learned to count to large numbers reliably.

Result: A pronounced load effect occurred for both correctness of sequences and spatial accuracy. Sequence performance declined with increasing load in an exponential fashion. At load 6, only 32 of the sequences were reproduced without error. The Levensthein correctness term dropped from 100 to 58 only. Spatial accuracy decreased linearly with increasing load from 0. 75 ° (load 1) to 2. 7 ° (load 6).

Using Atlantic cod β-parvalbumin (rGad m 1) displaying high IgE cross-reactivity, we found that formation of amyloid fibres under simulated gastrointestinal conditions accounts for the resistance to acid and neutral proteases, {{for the presence of}} membrane active species under gastrointestinal relevant conditions and for the IgE-recognition in the sera of allergic patients. Incorporation of the anti-amyloid compound epigallocatechin gallate prevents rGad m 1 fibrillation, facilitates its protease digestion and impairs its recognition by IgE. CONCLUSIONS: the formation of amyloid by rGad m 1 explains its degradation resistance, its facilitated passage across the intestinal epithelial barrier and its epitope architecture as allergen.

40|$|Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons {{constitute}} {{a significant part}} of eukaryotic genomes and {{play an important role in}} genome evolution especially in plants. Jute is an important fiber crop with a large genome of 1, 250 Mbps. This genome is still mostly unexplored. In this study we aimed at identifying and characterizing the LTR retrotransposons of jute with a view to understanding the jute genome better. In this study, the Reverse Transcriptase domain of Ty 1 -copia and Ty 3 -gypsy LTR retrotransposons of jute were amplified by degenerate primers and their expressions were examined by reverse transcription PCR. Copy numbers of reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of Ty 1 -copia and Ty 3 -gypsy elements were determined by <b>dot</b> blot analysis. <b>Sequence</b> analysis revealed higher heterogeneity among Ty 1 -copia retrotransposons than Ty 3 -gypsy and clustered each of them in three groups. Copy number of RT genes in Ty 1 -copia was found to be higher than that of Ty 3 -gypsy elements from dot blot hybridization. Cumulatively Ty 1 -copia and Ty 3 -gypsy may {{constitute a}}round 19 % of the jute genome where two groups of Ty 1 -copia were found to be transcriptionally active. Since the LTR retrotransposons constitute a large portion of jute genome, these findings imply the importance of these elements in the evolution of jute genome...|$|R
