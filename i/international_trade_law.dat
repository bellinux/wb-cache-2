5|$|The {{third party}} can be {{identified}} by name or {{as a member of}} a particular group, and does not need to exist when the contract was made.

2500|$|The {{resolution}} of these restrictions came shortly after 1585, {{when a new}} Court of Exchequer Chamber was established to hear common law appeals. In 1602, in Slade v Morley, a grain merchant named Slade claimed that Morley had agreed to buy wheat and rye for £16, but then had backed out. Actions for debt were in {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court of Common Pleas, which had required both (1) proof of a debt, and (2) a subsequent promise to repay the debt, so that a finding of deceit (for non-payment) could be made against a defendant. But if a claimant wanted to simply demand payment of the contractual debt (rather than a subsequent promise to pay) he could have to risk a wager of law. The judges of the Court of the King's Bench was prepared to allow [...] "assumpsit" [...] actions (for obligations being assumed) simply from proof of the original agreement. With a majority in the Exchquer Chamber, after six years Lord Popham CJ held that [...] "every contract importeth in itself an Assumpsit". Around the same time the Common Pleas indicated a different limit for contract enforcement in Bret v JS, that [...] "natural affection of itself is not a sufficient consideration to ground an assumpsit" [...] and {{there had to be some}} [...] "express quid pro quo". Now that wager of law, and sealed covenants were essentially unnecessary, the Statute of Frauds 1677 codified the contract types that were thought should still require some form. Over the late 17th and 18th centuries Sir John Holt, and then Lord Mansfield actively incorporated the principles of <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>law</b> and custom into English common law as they saw it: principles of commercial certainty, good faith, fair dealing, and the enforceability of seriously intended promises. As Lord Mansfield held, [...] "Mercantile law is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations", and [...] "the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same".|$|E

40|$|The United States is the world’s largest {{importing}} country, {{with nearly}} $ 2 trillion in {{imports of goods}} during 2007. Given the ever- increasing volume of <b>international</b> <b>trade,</b> the United States has put in place an intricate body of laws designed to regulate the flow of goods and has created federal agencies responsible for the enforcement of those laws, including U. S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), the U. S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”), the U. S. <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> Commission (“ITC” or “Commission”), and the Office of the U. S. Trade Representative (“USTR”). Each agency is charged with different responsibilities over the fair and efficient administration of the United States’ <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> regime. Certain <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> disputes arise at the agency level, however, which in turn creates a role for the U. S. courts. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”), created in 1982, has exclusive jurisdiction over any “appeal from a final decision of the United States Court of <b>International</b> <b>Trade.</b> ” The U. S. Court of <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> (“CIT”), in turn, has exclusive jurisdiction over numerous types of civil actions arising under the <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>laws</b> including, inter alia, disputes related to the classification and valuation of imported merchandise, Commerce’s and the ITC’s determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, and any other action relating to the administration and enforcement of <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>laws.</b> Given {{the broad range of}} issues under the CIT’s exclusive jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit is frequently called upon to address a multitude of different legal questions involving <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> issues...|$|R
