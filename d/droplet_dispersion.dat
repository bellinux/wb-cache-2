Two droplet nuclei sizes, 0. 01 and 10 µm, are selected as they represent very fine and coarse droplets. The flow field is modeled using k-ε RNG model.

Under the conventional ventilation scheme, both fine and coarse droplets are homogeneously dispersed within approximately 50 s. Droplet nuclei exhibit distinctive dispersion behavior, particularly for low airflow microenvironment.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} indoor airborne infections has prompted attention upon {{the investigation of}} expiratory <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> and transport in built environments. In this study, a source (i. e. a patient who generates droplets) and a receiver (i. e. a susceptible object other than the source) are modeled in a mechanically ventilated room. The receiver's exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0. 1 and 10 μm, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts. The <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> and mixing characteristics under well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes are evaluated and compared numerically. Results show that the <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> and mixing under displacement ventilation is consistently poorer. Very low concentration regions are also observed in the displacement scheme.

40|$|A Pease-Anthony Venturi {{scrubber}} is a {{gas cleaning}} device that uses liquid, injected in the equipment as jets, to remove contaminants from the gas. The liquid jet is atomized into droplets, which are dispersed throughout the equipment {{due to the}} turbulence.

Although CFD models have been used to predict the <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion,</b> these models are expensive. Alternatively, the concept of "jet spreading angle" {{could be used as a}} simple and quick way to estimate <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The purpose of this paper is to measure the spreading angle of jets transversally injected into the throat of a Venturi scrubber and correlate it with both gas and jet velocities.

The ensemble-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the electrostatic potential equation are solved using a finite volume method.

The {{equations of motion}} of droplets are solved using a Lagrangian particle tracking scheme, and the inter-phase momentum exchange is described by the Particle-In-Cell scheme. The electrostatic force caused by an applied electrical potential is calculated using the electrostatic field obtained by solving a Laplacian equation and the force exerted by charged droplets is calculated using the Coulombic force equation. The method is applied to solve electro-hydrodynamic sprays. The calculated droplet velocity distributions for <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersions</b> occurring in a stagnant surrounding are in good agreement with the measured data.

40|$|Globally {{averaged}} cloud {{changes from}} GCMs on average show {{a doubling of}} the Twomey effect, which is the change in cloud albedo with respect to changes in droplet concentrations for fixed cloud water and <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In contrast, ship-track measurements show a much more modest amplification of the Twomey effect, suggesting that the GCMs are exaggerating the indirect aerosol effect. We have run large-eddy simulations with bin microphysics of marine stratocumulus from multiple field campaigns, and find that the large-eddy simulations are in much better agreement with the ship-track measurements. The inversion strength over N. Pacific stratocumulus (as measured during DYCOMS-II) is generally much stronger than over N.

40|$|Solvent {{extraction}} (SX) is {{the only}} commercially viable hydrometallurgical separation and purification technique {{for a range of}} metals that allows high product throughput and consistently high recoveries. After over 50 years of commercial application, however, limitations inherent to the mechanical agitation used within the most widely used commercial SX contactor – the mixer-settler – have become apparent. It is now generally accepted that mechanical agitation results in regions of high shear within the mixer, which favours the formation of crud, non-uniform droplet sizes and the formation of numerous ultra-fine droplets. The other commercially used contactor, the pulse column, does not suffer from as many problems as the mixer-settler but it is not suitable for systems with slow kinetics. A promising alternative to these mechanically agitated solvent extraction contactors are electrostatically agitated solvent extraction (ESX) contactors. Bench-scale studies indicate that these contactors allow higher rates of mass transfer, excellent control of droplet size, and lower shear agitation than mechanically agitated contactors. There are also suggestions that the technique requires {{only a fraction of the}} power relative to that of mechanical agitation. Despite these promising attributes, a commercial application has not been achieved. This may be attributed to a poor understanding of electrostatically-assisted <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> over a range of commercially applicable solution properties, the designs of ESX contactors already proposed being unsuitable for scale-up and the performance of an ESX contactor never having been evaluated on a pilot-scale. To better understand electrostatically-assisted <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion,</b> a dispersion study that allowed the measurement of dispersed droplet sizes was carried out over a range of commercially applicable solution properties. To develop an ESX contactor suitable for scale-up and industrial application, various types of electrostatic field conditions were evaluated and numerous electrode designs were developed and evaluated. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the ESX contactor on a pilot-scale, a pilot-scale ESX column was constructed and its performance was compared to that of a sieve-plate pulse column, which was refurbished for this purpose. In pursuing the first objective it was found that: •The viscosity of both the solvent and the PLS, and the interfacial tension affect the droplet size distribution generated by electrostatic dispersion largely by affecting the number of ultra-fine droplets that form. The solvent conductivity affects <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> by affecting the degree of interfacial polarisation of the droplet. • Electrostatic <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> occurs either via a necking or jetting dispersion mechanism. In ESX, <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> by necking is favourable as it impedes the formation of ultra-fine droplets. The predominance of one mechanism over the other is influenced by the viscosity of the PLS and solvent. In pursuing the second objective it was found that: • An individual electrostatic PLS disperser is not appropriate for an industrially applicable ESX column. • Droplet motion within an electrostatic field is influenced by the electric charge that droplets carry and also by the strength and frequency of the electrostatic field. Increases in the charge of the droplet favours droplet motion and agitation; increases in the frequency of the electrostatic field favours droplet oscillation; decreases in the frequency of the electrostatic field favours droplet zigzagging. • A horizontal rod electrode arrangement within a column type contactor was found to be the most appropriate design for scale-up because it allowed (1) good <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> and agitation, (2) adequate aqueous fluxes to be achieved, and (3) coalescence of any ultra-fine droplets that form. In pursuing the third objective it was found that: • An electrostatic field strength of 6. 5 kV/cm and electrostatic field frequency of 40 Hz yielded the highest extraction of nickel metal from sulphate/chloride solution. Under these conditions, the fluxes achieved within the ESX column were comparable to those used in pulsed columns. This is particularly significant as it disproves the commonly perceived main limitation of electrostatic dispersion. • Concurrent operation of the ESX and sieve-plate columns, each with an aqueous flux of 37 m³/h/m², revealed that the metal extraction achieved within each column was comparable, with a height equivalent to a theoretical stage (HETS) of 3. 30 m. This demonstrates that ESX columns can handle industrially applicable aqueous fluxes. Further improvements in the ESX column design promise enhanced results...|$|E

40|$|Liquid sprays {{are governed}} by a {{multitude}} of fluid- and thermodynamic transport processes between the liquid droplets and the continuous gas phase. At the phase boundary, interfacial transport processes lead to liquid atomization, droplet deformation and breakup, turbulent dispersion and modulation, air entrainment and vaporization into the gas phase. Within the disperse phase, droplet collisions make a major contribution to momentum transport and energy dissipation, and interfere with spray dynamics to great extent. Numerical simulations of disperse multiphase flows are based on sub-models for all significant transport processes. For collisional transport processes within the disperse phase, various collision algorithms and models have been developed, which predict collision incidents and the collision outcomes. However, existing algorithms are restricted to isotropic flows with small velocity gradients, which are not found in typical applications such as high-velocity engine sprays. To describe collisional transport processes under such conditions, a new collision algorithm has been derived in the present work, which accounts for anisotropic <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersions</b> and velocity gradients in the disperse phase, and increases the order of accuracy significantly over benchmark collision algorithms. The new algorithm is validated by synthetic validation cases, and tested with exemplary simulations of turbulent engine sprays.

40|$|Simulations of <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> behind {{cylinder}} wakes and downstream of icing tunnel spray bars were conducted. In both cases, a {{range of}} droplet sizes were investigated numerically with a Lagrangian particle trajectory approach while the turbulent air flow was investigated with a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes/Large-Eddy Simulations approach scheme. In the first study, droplets were injected downstream of a cylinder at sub-critical conditions (i. e. with laminar boundary layer separation). A stochastic continuous random walk (CRW) turbulence model was used to capture the effects of sub-grid turbulence. Small inertia droplets (characterized by small Stokes numbers) were affected by both the large-scale and small-scale vortex structures and closely followed the air flow, while exhibiting a dispersion consistent {{with that of a}} scalar flow field. Droplets with intermediate Stokes numbers were centrifuged by the vortices to the outer edges of the wake, yielding an increased dispersion. Large Stokes number droplets were found to be less responsive to the vortex structures and exhibited the least dispersion. Particle concentration was also correlated with vorticity distribution which yielded preferential bias effects as a function of different particle sizes. This trend was qualitatively similar to results seen in homogenous isotropic turbulence, though the influence of particle inertia was less pronounced for the cylinder wake case. A similar study was completed for <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> within the Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) at the NASA Glenn Research Center, where it is important to obtain a nearly uniform liquid water content (LWC) distribution in the test section (to recreate atmospheric icing conditions) [...] For this goal, droplets are diffused by the mean and turbulent flow generated from the nozzle air jets, from the upstream spray bars, and from the vertical strut wakes. To understand the influence of these three components, a set of simulations was conducted with a sequential inclusion of these components. Firstly, a jet in an otherwise quiescent airflow was simulated to capture the impact of the air jet on flow turbulence and droplet distribution, and the predictions compared well with experimental results.

The higher nonlinear spread rate of the droplet-laden mixing layer was attributed to the size-dependent <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> and was correlated to the local Stokes number and relevant time scales of both the droplets and the flow. <b>Droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> mechanisms inside the mixing layer were analyzed and supported by a full documentation of the evolution of size-based probability distributions across the layer at different shear. ^ An experimental study targeting dispersion and evaporation of droplets in a differentially-heated mixing layer followed. Differential heating was found to alter droplet and flow time scales ending with a Stokes number modification. The combined effect of small droplet disappearance and large droplet size reduction, shifted more droplets into the dispersed Stokes regime. The interplay between dispersion and evaporation at different heating and shear, was completely described by the evolution of the pdf histograms of droplet size distribution across the differentially heated mixing layer. High shear appeared to balance out the heating effect on size based growth, overwhelm it for intermediate shear and fall short of it at low shear. ^ Visualization using Mie scattering from water droplets and laser induced fluorescence from acetone vapor gave a qualitative confirmation of all the features of the mixing layers under investigation. ...|$|E

In these examples, the accuracy and the predictive capacity of LES are clearly demonstrated, even for unsteady phenomena. However most industrial burners are fed with liquid fuel and require the description of <b>droplets</b> <b>dispersion,</b> evaporation and burning. The presence of liquid fuel strongly modifies the fuel vapor distribution in the chamber, leading to different flame ignition and stabilisation processes, as well as different flame structures. Extending the LES technique to two-phase reacting flow is therefore crucial to capture and predict the behavior of such burners. This has been done in the code AVBP, coupling an eulerian solver for the liquid spray with a LES solver for the gas flow. This approach allows to work on unstructured grids and therefore to calculate the flow in complex geometries. In the present paper, the main steps of the extension of LES to two-phase flow are described and an example of validation is given.

Such fundamental knowledge is essential for understanding/modeling the environmental problems associated with water-fuel mixing, and/or industrial processes involving mixing of immiscible fluids. The project has had experimental and numerical components: 1. The experimental part of the project has had two components. The first involves measurements of the lift and drag forces acting on a droplet being entrained by a vortex. The experiments and data analysis associated with this phase are still in progress, and the facility, constructed specifically for this project is described in Section 3. In the second and main part, measurements of fuel <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> rates have been performed in a special facility with controlled isotropic turbulence. As discussed in detail in Section 2, quantifying and modeling the of <b>droplet</b> <b>dispersion</b> rate requires measurements of their three dimensional trajectories in turbulent flows. To obtain the required data, we have introduced a new technique - high-speed, digital Holographic Particle Image Velocimetry (HPIV). The technique, experimental setup and results are presented in Section 2. Further information is available in Gopalan et al. (2005, 2006). 2. The objectives of the numerical part are: (1) to develop a computational code that combines DNS of isotropic turbulence with Lagrangian tracking of particles based on integration of a dynamical equation of motion that accounts for pressure, added mass, lift and drag forces, (2) to perform extensive computations of both buoyant (bubbles) and slightly buoyant (droplets) particles in turbulence conditions relevant to the experiments, and (3) to explore whether the corresponding predictions can explain the experimentally-observed behavior of the rise and dispersion of oil droplets in isotropic turbulence. A brief summary of results is presented in Section 4...|$|E
40|$|Imagine a clean {{capillary}} droplet evaporating in a fakir {{state on}} a superhydrophobic micro-structured surface. When the superhydrophobicity is robust enough, the droplet will always remain {{on top of}} the micro-structure and the droplet will retain its spherical shape until its ``death. '' Very often one can observe the remains of the impurities within the droplet left {{on top of the}} structure {{at the end of the}} process. In this work, instead of using clean liquid droplets, we use dilute colloidal <b>dispersion</b> <b>droplets</b> of monodisperse polymer micro-spheres (sizes from 0. 2 to 2 μm). The colloidal <b>dispersion</b> <b>droplet</b> retains its spherical shape during its whole life, even when the whole solution has been evaporated. The remaining object consist on a spherical-shaped massive cluster of particles with diameters ranging from a few tens of microns up to several hundreds of microns, depending on the amount of micro-particles present in the solution and on the final packing fraction. We will discuss on the different observed packing fractions, particle arrangements and their governing parameters. Additionally some predictions will also be introduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to obtain an improved understanding of the behavior of droplets in vaporizing sprays, particularly under conditions typical of those in high pressure rocket sprays. Experiments are conducted in a variety of high pressure, high temperature, optically-accessible flow systems, including one which is capable of operation at pressures up to 70 atm, temperatures up to 600 K, gas velocities up to 30 m/sec and turbulence intensities up to 40 percent. Single droplets, 50 to 500 micron in diameter, are produced by an aerodynamic droplet generator and transversely injected into the flow. Measurements are made of the droplet position, size, velocity and temperature and of the droplet's vapor wake from which <b>droplet</b> drag, <b>dispersion,</b> heating, vaporization and breakup are characterized...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} methodology {{to simulate the}} <b>dispersion</b> of water <b>droplets</b> in the air flow typical of an Icing Tunnel. It {{is based on the}} understanding the physical parameters that influence the uniformity and the distribution of cloud of droplets in the airflow and to connect them with analytical parameters which may be used to describe the dispersion process. Specifically it investigates the main geometrical and physical parameters contributing to the <b>droplets</b> <b>dispersion</b> at different tunnel operative conditions, finding a consistent numerical approach to reproduce the local droplets dynamic, quantifying the possible limits of commercial CFD methods, pulling out the empirical parameters/constant needing to simulate properly the local conditions and validating the results with calibrated experiment. An overview of the turbulence and multiphase flow theories, considered relevant to the Icing Tunnel environment, is presented as well as basic concepts and terminology of particle dispersion. Taylor’s theory of particle dispersion has been taken as starting point to explain further historical development of discrete phase dispersion. Common methods incorporated in commercial CFD software are explained and relative shortcomings underlined. The local aerodynamic condition within tunnel, which are required to perform the calculation with the Lagrangian particle equation of motions, are generated numerically using different turbulent models and are compared to the historical K-ε model. Verification of the calculation is performed with grid independency studies. Stochastic Separated Flow methods are applied to compute the particle trajectories. The Discrete Random Walk, as described in the literature, has been used to perform particle dispersion analysis. Numerical settings in the code are related to the characteristics of the local turbulent condition such as turbulence intensity and length scales. Cont/d.
