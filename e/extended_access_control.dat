To ensure that the deployment of usage control policies in target domains achieves the required security goals, policy verification and analysis tools are needed. In this paper, we present an approach for the dynamic analysis of usage control policies using formal descriptions of target domains and their usage control policies. Our approach provides usage control management explicit labeled transition system semantics and enables the automated verification of usage control policies using model checking. ...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{malicious}} insider {{attacks on}} cloud computing environments, a new Context-Aware <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> Model for cloud computing (CAACM) was presented. According to the characteristic of cloud computing, we take spatial state, temporal state and platform trust level as context. The model establishes mechanisms of authorization from cloud management role to objects, which enables dynamic activation of role permission by associating cloud management role with context. It also achieves fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>control</b> on cloud objects by supervising {{the permission of}} management role in full life cycle. Moreover, it introduces the concept of exclusive managerial role, which <b>extends</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> from static protection on resources to dynamic authorization on managerial roles.

40|$|Abstract. Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) {{is going}} to be the {{preferred}} technol-ogy for the realization of Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs), and has been deployed in the last generation of e-passports. The proposed technical specifications for e-passport systems have been analyzed and criticized by security experts showing various functional, security and privacy deficiencies. The next generation of e-passports will imple-ment more advanced cryptographic mechanisms, collectively known as <b>Extended</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control,</b> and in particular a protocol referred to as Chip Authentication that protects an e-passport against cloning and transferability attacks. The <b>Extended</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> suite of protocols has found minor attention in the literature until now. In this paper we point out possible attacks against Chip Authentication as proposed in the current specifications for <b>Extended</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control.</b> In particular, we show that the possibility of transferability and reset attacks weaken the claimed security of the underlying Chip Authentication protocol. We also discuss the shortcomings of the existing literature on the security definitions for resettable identification protocols and propose a new definition that is more suited for real world scenarios. Based on known cryptographic techniques we finally propose an efficient protocol that is instead secure against such attacks. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. ePassports are {{biometric}} identification documents that contain RFID Tags and are primarily used for border security. The embedded RFID Tags {{are capable of}} storing data, performing low cost computations and cryptography, and communicating wirelessly. Since 2004, we have witnessed the development and widespread deployment of three generations of electronic passports- The ICAO First Generation ePassport (2004), <b>Extended</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (EAC v 1. 0) ePassports (2006), and <b>Extended</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> with Password Authentication and Connection Establishment (EAC v 2. 1) ePassports (2008). Currently, over thirty million ePassports have been issued around the world. In this paper, we provide an introductory study of the technologies implemented in ePassports- Biometrics, RFID, and Public Key Infrastructures; {{and then go on}} to analyze the protocols implemented {{in each of the three}} generations of ePassports, finally we point out their shortcomings and scope for future related research. ...|$|E

40|$|XML {{is gaining}} {{predominance}} {{as the standard}} for data representation and exchange. <b>Access</b> <b>control</b> for XML data is nontrivial as witnessed {{from the number of}} <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models presented in literature. Existing models provide the ability to <b>extend</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> to data as well as structure and enforce the specified <b>access</b> <b>control</b> via view materialization. However, view materialization based approaches suffer from update issues and maintaining such views may not be realistic. In this context, We introduce ACXESS(Access Control for XML with Enhanced Security Specifications), a framework for formalizing, presenting and enforcing security constraints for XML documents. Through ACXESS, we present SSX- an algebraic view specification language that provides an effective way to capture all the tree transformations achieved by existing <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models using a set of atomic primitives. We choose not to materialize the security views and introduce a notion of virtual security views that enforce the access constraints via query rewrites. A Security Annotated Schema(SAS) is proposed as the internal representation for virtual views expressed using SSX and the virtual security view exposed to the user can be automatically constructed from the SAS. Finally, we propose a rule based rewrite algorithm (SQR) that rewrites user XPath queries on the security view into equivalent XQuery expressions that can be evaluated against the original data, with the guarantee that the users only see information in the security view. Experimental evaluation and theoretical proofs demonstrate the capability of SSX in representing the access constraints expressible in existing <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models and also demonstrate the use of SAS and the SQR rewrite algorithm in enforcing the access constraints without view materialization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we propose a {{solution}} to enable an accurate terminal revocation in the <b>Extended</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (EAC). Chaabouni and Vaudenay in [CV 09] pointed out the need for an accurate revocation procedure, but failed to provide a complete solution description. We aim at filling this gap. Our solution relies on augmenting terminal authentication with a t-out-of-ℓ threshold signature provided by neighboring terminals. These terminals will be in charge of checking the revocation status of the requested terminal. As Terminals have a real clock embedded and more computational power than Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs), they are better suited for checking revocation status. ...|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of RBAC, the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model was synonymous with MAC and file system permissions were synonymous with DAC. These were considered to be the only known models for access control: if a model was not BLP, it was considered to be a DAC model, and vice versa. Research in the late 1990s demonstrated that RBAC falls in neither category. Unlike context-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (CBAC), RBAC does not look at the message context (such as a connection's source). RBAC has also been criticized for leading to role explosion, a problem in large enterprise systems which require <b>access</b> <b>control</b> of finer granularity than what RBAC can provide as roles are inherently assigned to operations and data types. In resemblance to CBAC, an Entity-Relationship Based <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (ERBAC, although the same acronym is also used for modified RBAC systems, such as <b>Extended</b> Role-Based <b>Access</b> <b>Control)</b> system is able to secure instances of data by considering their association to the executing subject.|$|R
