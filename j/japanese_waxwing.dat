5|$|The {{range of}} the Bohemian waxwing {{overlaps}} those of both {{the other members of}} the genus. The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch. Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing</b> is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{waxwings}} are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky {{birds with}} soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese waxwings. DNA studies and shared {{features such as}} a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus. Although only the cedar and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing,</b> suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that the cedar waxwing diverged early from {{the other members of}} the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.|$|E
500|$|The Bohemian waxwing's call {{is a high}} trill sirrrr. It is less {{wavering}} and lower-pitched {{than that}} of the cedar waxwing, and longer and lower-pitched than the call of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing.</b> Other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents, and courtship calls, also given during nest construction, have a particularly large frequency range. Although not a call as such, when a flock takes off or lands, the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard [...] away.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing</b> breeds in {{coniferous}} {{forests in}} the Russian Far East and in Heilongjiang province, north-east China. It is at some risk of becoming threatened with extinction due to loss and degradation of its forest habitat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing</b> (Bombycilla japonica) is {{a fairly}} small {{passerine}} bird of the waxwing family found in north-east Asia. It feeds mainly on fruit and berries but also eats insects during the summer. The nest is a cup of twigs lined with grass and moss which is built in a tree.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing</b> {{is about}} 18 cm {{in length and}} its plumage is mostly pinkish-brown. It has a pointed crest, a black throat, a black stripe through the eye, a pale yellow centre to the belly and a black tail with a red tip. The wings have a pattern of black, grey and white with a reddish-brown stripe running across them. Its call is a high-pitched trill {{but there is no}} true song.|$|E

50|$|The {{waxwings}} are passerine birds classified in {{the genus}} Bombycilla. They are brown and pale grey with silky plumage, {{a black and white}} eyestripe, a crest, a square-cut tail and pointed wings. Some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. According to most authorities, this is the only genus placed in the family Bombycillidae, although Phainoptila is sometimes included. There are three species, the Bohemian waxwing (B. garrulus), the <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing</b> (B. japonica) and the cedar waxwing (B. cedrorum).|$|E

5000|$|Cedar {{waxwings}} are {{a medium-sized}} bird approximately 6 - 7 in long and weigh roughly 30 g. They are {{smaller and more}} brown than their close relative, the Bohemian waxwing (which breeds farther {{to the north and}} west). It is a [...] "silky, shiny collection of brown, gray, and lemon-yellow, accented with a subdued crest, rakish black mask, and brilliant-red wax droplets on the wing feathers." [...] These droplets may be the same color as the madrone berries they are known to eat. These birds' most prominent feature is this small cluster of red wax-like droplets on tips of secondary flight feathers on the wings, a feature they share with the Bohemian waxwing (but not the <b>Japanese</b> <b>waxwing).</b> The wings are [...] "broad and pointed, like a starling's." [...] The tail is typically yellow or orange depending on diet. Birds that have fed on berries of introduced Eurasian honeysuckles while growing tail feathers will have darker orange-tipped tail-feathers. The tail is somewhat short, and square-tipped. Adults have a pale yellow belly. The waxwing's crest often [...] "lies flat and droops {{over the back of the}} head." [...] It has a short and wide bill. The waxwing's black mask has a thin white border. Immature birds are streaked on the throat and flanks, and often do not have the black mask of the adults. Males and females look alike.|$|E
40|$|The type {{specimens}} in {{the bird}} {{collection of the}} Zoological Museum of the University of Amsterdam (ZMA) are listed and discussed. The ZMA, founded 1838, has types of 51 taxa, at least 31 of these are still in use as valid names of species or subspecies, the remainder are synonyms of taxa described earlier or require confirmation. Twenty-three of the 51 taxa in the ZMA consist of holotypes (22 specimens), 11 are syntypes (17 specimens), and 33 are paratypes (110 specimens), and altogether 149 specimens have type status. Among the types of valid species are those of birds like <b>Japanese</b> <b>Waxwing</b> Bombycilla japonica (described 1824) and Sillemâ€™s Mountain-finch Leucosticte sillemi (described 1992). Also, 23 taxa are discussed of which the ZMA has no types, either because they are apparently lost (three taxa) or of which one would expect the ZMA has any because they were described by stalf associated with the ZMA (15 taxa) or taken by collectors associated with the ZMA (five taxa); these are listed in square brackets. Of the 74 taxa enumerated below, most were described in 1863 - 1876 (12 taxa), 1937 - 1953 (27), and 1992 - 2000 (19). New names introduced in this paper are Cacatua tanimberensis (new name for Plictolophus goffini Finsch, 1867, a name preoccupied by Lophochroa goffini Finsch, 1863, which latter is a synonym of Plyctolophus ducorps Bonaparte, 1850) for the Tanimber Corella, and Pericrocotus cinnamomeus osmastoni, a validation of a name originally intended by Snouckaert, 1930, but not formally described, for the Andaman Small Minivet. The designation of a neotype for Limosa baueri Naumann, 1836, is corrected: the action was invalid as the original holotype is still present in Vienna...|$|E
