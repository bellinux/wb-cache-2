In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Fort Greene and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid 19th century Radyr was a {{collection}} of small farms, crofts and cottages, but after Radyr railway station opened in 1863, the population rose from 400 to more than 600 in 20 years. The Taff Vale Railway and its successor, the Great Western Railway, brought significant employment to Radyr. Junction Terrace (the first street in Radyr) was built to house the railway workers. It {{was the start of}} strong <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> in Radyr that transformed the hamlet. The Barry Railway's Walnut Tree Viaduct, built in 1901, dominated the village for some 70 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{catastrophic flood}} in March 1913, {{known as the}} Great Dayton Flood, led to the {{creation}} of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914. Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the republic, Istanbul was {{overlooked}} in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing,</b> and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E

40|$|Real house {{prices are}} {{forecast}} to rise {{over the next}} two decades by about the same amount hey rose over the past two decades.

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the first}} of three papers {{describing}} a model of housing demand. The present paper sets out the theoretical framework for the model, which is based on a number of recent theories in economics. The main interest in the research lies in the development of urban models for obtaining information directly relevant to the analysis of costs and benefits for alternative urban programs, in this case housing programs. The research <b>for</b> the <b>housing</b> model, therefore, is concerned with housing services, their relative demand prices, and <b>demand</b> equations <b>for</b> these services. The second paper, "A residential model: 2. Implicit prices <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> services", contains results <b>for</b> <b>demand</b> prices <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> characteristics as services estimated by multiple regression analysis, using data for selling price and housing characteristics from the town of Reading, Berkshire. The research described in the third paper, "A residential model: 3. <b>Demand</b> equations <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> services", includes results for the wide differences in prices <b>for</b> similar <b>housing</b> between tenure groups, and <b>for</b> <b>demand</b> equations <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> services at three levels of aggregation as a function of household attributes of income, social status, stage in family cycle, and household size. ...|$|R

40|$|In Norway, {{the average}} house size has {{increased}} with 8. 4 m 2 between 2001 and 2013. During the same time, households {{have experienced a}} huge increase in disposable income, house prices have reach unprecedentedly high levels {{and the size of}} households have been reduced. This paper examines which forces determine the owner-occupiers’ <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>house</b> size in Norway and why the average house size has increased between 2001 and 2013. Using household level data from Statistics Norway’s Survey of Living Conditions, I estimate an identical cross-sectional regression for each of the five survey years, regressing the number of square meter house size on income, price, household characteristics, geographical and structure related variables. Inserting average values for all explanatory variables, I find given the explanatory variables, higher predicted house size each survey year. The increase in predicted house size exceeds the increase in the average square meters indicating changes inherent in my explanatory variables combined reduce <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>house</b> size. Specifically, a trend towards smaller households drives down the size of dwellings, all else equal. Instead, macroeconomic variables including the interest rate, credit availability and price expectations can help explain why we live bigger...|$|R
