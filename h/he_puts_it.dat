5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
25|$|Various anecdotes in Livy's {{history of}} Rome reflect the toga's {{symbolic}} value. In one, the patrician hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, retired from public life and clad (presumably) in tunic or loincloth, is ploughing his field when emissaries of the Senate arrive, {{and ask him}} to put on his toga. His wife fetches it and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> on. Then he is told that he has been appointed dictator. He promptly heads for Rome. Donning the toga transforms Cincinnatus from rustic, sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless, of impeccable stock and reputation – into Rome's leading politician, eager to serve his country; a top-quality Roman. Rome's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all Rome's great men wore togas, and must always have done so.|$|E
25|$|Monty {{has brought}} {{supplies}} and persistently comes on to Marwood. He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> {{out of his mind}} quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E

500|$|Conatus is {{a central}} theme in the {{philosophy}} of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, [...] "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, as <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (Ethics, part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, [...] "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and conatus is the word he most often uses to describe this force.|$|E
500|$|Author Elliot Huntley views Living in the Material World as {{a concept}} album on which the material–spiritual [...] "quandary" [...] evident in the title track is [...] "eloquently expressed" [...] through the artwork's mix of {{religious}} symbolism and an inner-gatefold photograph that showed [...] " [...] band indulging in a gratuitously sumptuous feast". The stretch-limousine image was a detail taken from this photo, the concept for which reflected Harrison's view that the material world is not only related to money and possessions, but to [...] "everything which is gross, physical, or material {{as opposed to the}} subtle, astral or casual", as <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in I, Me, Mine when discussing the song. NME critic Bob Woffinden also commented on the symbolism of this picture showing [...] "Harrison with his musicians (Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner, Ringo – the usual lot) enjoying a hearty repast, passing the no-doubt vintage wine, while in the background the longest limousine in the world awaits their convenience".|$|E

500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", as <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled {{to be asked to}} play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|After Wally goes AWOL for {{a second}} day, David is pressed into service. [...] He admits to Karros and the judge in {{chambers}} {{that he has never}} seen the inside of a courtroom. [...] Karros, in a moment of humanity, offers a deal: if David finishes the trial, she will not pursue sanctions against Finley & Figg. [...] Judge Seawright offers to help David through the trial and adds that Finley & Figg probably won't suffer from any malpractice lawsuits if the trial goes through. [...] David agrees to finish the trial but there is hardly any real case for him to present. Karros tears to pieces the main Finley & Figg expert witness: a Russian doctor of very questionable credentials and whose English is atrocious even after fifteen years in the U.S. The second expert, an equally shady pharmacologist, escapes without testifying, pocketing the $50,000 he got from Finley & Figg. Rueben Massey, Varrick's CEO, instructs Karros not to move for likely successful summary judgment, he is determined to have a jury clear Krayoxx of all charges and Varrick's public relations machine stands ready to trumpet this decision in all the media. Zinc declineS to cross-examine the row of expert witnesses that Varrick calls, all having impeccable credentials and David having no facts with which to shake their defense of Krayoxx. Rather, he spends the time studying Karros' methods, [...] "learning from a master", as <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> in his own mind.|$|E

500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E
500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the sort of work which above all others he most despises– and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E

After-images are dismissed as presenting no problem for the Transparency Theory because, as <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> after-images being illusory, there is nothing that one sees.|$|E
