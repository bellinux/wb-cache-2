5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 1914, {{the ship}} was reassigned to the 4th CS of the North America and West Indies Station and sailed that day to join the squadron.

Bristol spent most of June in Tampico, but sailed for Veracruz {{at the end of}} the month where Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock, the squadron commander, inspected the ship and her crew on 1 July. The ship departed for Puerto México (present day Coatzacoalcos) on the 15th and served as temporary refuge for members of the family of ex-president Victoriano Huerta for a few days as they were fleeing the country at the time of the United States occupation of Veracruz. Bristol sailed for Jamaica on the 31st as tensions with Germany rose.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina {{was back}} in Norfolk by 20 December, where she {{remained}} until 6 January 1913.

The ship then took part in maneuvers off Guantanamo Bay before returning to Norfolk on 22 March. Another cruise off the east coast of the United States followed, and included a stop in New York from 28 to 31 May, where the USS Maine National Monument was dedicated. The ship briefly trained midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in June before departing at the end of the month <b>for</b> <b>Mexico.</b> There, she cruised off Tampico and Veracruz to protect American interests during the Mexican Civil War.

During the various events, a temple becomes covered in flames and idols to the pagan gods appear once again. This {{is followed by}} the Aztecs telling the Welsh to leave before attacking them. A battle takes place in the water surrounding the Aztec city on boats, and the superior Welsh ships are able to win. The Aztecs, unwilling to stop, turn to superstitious rituals and priests travel to a sacred mountain to make sacrifices. However, a sudden lava eruption kills the priests. This causes the Aztecs to believe {{that they do not have}} the support of their gods and they cease their fighting. Admitting defeat, the Aztecs leave the area and head south <b>for</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} was {{not quite}} the end for Linois' squadron: the last survivor, the frigate Sémillante had originally been ordered to sail <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> in March 1805. This plan was foiled by an encounter with the British frigate HMS Phaeton in the Philippines, and Captain Léonard-Bernard Motard returned to the Indian Ocean, operating {{for the next three}} years against British shipping from Île de France. Eventually the old frigate was assessed as worn out and sold from service in 1808, operating as a privateer for a year before she was captured in 1809. Napoleon refused to exchange Linois for a British prisoner, and the Emperor's fury at the admiral's failures in the Indian Ocean prevented any subsequent appointments. In 1814, after Napoleon's abdication, the new French regime made Linois governor of Martinique, but when the Hundred Days began, Linois declared for Napoleon and the British invaded and captured his island. His career over, Linois retired. He died some 34 years later, in 1848.|$|E
5|$|When Ferdinand VII {{assumed the}} throne of Spain in 1813, Valero became {{critical}} of the new king's policies towards the Spanish colonies in Latin America. He developed a keen hatred of the monarchy, resigned his commission in the army, and headed <b>for</b> <b>Mexico.</b> There he joined the insurgent army headed by Agustín de Iturbide, in which Valero was named chief of staff. He fought for and helped achieve Mexico's independence from Spain. After the Mexican victory, Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico. Since Valero had developed anti-monarchist feelings following his experiences in Spain, he revolted against Iturbide. His revolt failed and he attempted to escape from Mexico by way of sea.|$|E

5|$|As Allen {{approached}} the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane warnings were raised for the northeast Yucatán peninsula of Mexico from {{the afternoon of}} August 6 into the morning of August 8. Gale warnings were in effect for the Florida Keys from the evening of August 6 into the early morning of August 8. As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of August 8 until the morning of August 9 <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> and the afternoon of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during the afternoon of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during the afternoon of August 9 and south of Freeport during the afternoon of August 10.

5|$|At 18:00UTC on August19, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Chetumal to Progreso, Yucatán, while {{a tropical}} storm watch was placed between Pinar del Río Province and Isle of Pines, Cuba. Just three hours later, another tropical storm warning was put into effect between San Pedro Town, Belize, and the Mexican border. On August20, the tropical storm watch was discontinued for Cuba, as the system was {{moving away from the}} area. At 15:00UTC, another tropical storm warning was issued from Progreso, Yucatán, to Ciudad del Carmen. Only an hour later, {{a tropical storm}} warning from Cozumel to Chetumal was upgraded to a hurricane warning. By 21:00UTC on August20, all warnings south of Cozumel were discontinued. Just six hours later on August 21, all tropical storm warnings east of 88°W were discontinued. Shortly after that, a tropical storm warning east of Progreso was removed. All warnings <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> were discontinued at 15:00UTC on August21. When Dolly entered the Bay of Campeche on August22, a hurricane watch was put into action for Veracruz, La Pesca, and all areas in between, at 09:00UTC. Only six hours later, the watch became a hurricane warning until Dolly made landfall at 18:00UTC on August23, when all remaining warnings were removed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1821, Iturbide began peace {{negotiations}} with Guerrero, suggesting they unite {{to establish an}} independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became {{the basis of the}} Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'Donojú, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'Donojú had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of Córdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> could be written. O'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Itrubide.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February, {{the ship}} {{departed}} <b>for</b> <b>Mexico,</b> {{as the country}} {{was in the midst}} of the Mexican Revolution; Vermont was tasked with protecting American interests in Veracruz. She arrived in the port on 17 February and remained there until 29 April, when she returned to the United States. She rejoined the fleet in Hampton Roads before beginning a training cruise for midshipmen at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis on 6 June. Following the conclusion of the cruise, she operated in Block Island Sound and stopped in Newport. Starting in July, the ship's normal overhaul at Norfolk began, with the work lasting until October. She then took part in gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. Vermont made a second trip to Europe on 25 October, this time to French Mediterranean waters. She stopped in Marseille from 8 November to 1 December and then recrossed the Atlantic. While on the voyage back, a severe storm damaged one of her propellers, which necessitated a tow back to Norfolk, where she arrived on 20 December. Repairs were effected there, which were followed by a short period of sea trials to test the propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he was}} not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|On November7, Tropical Depression Ida re-entered the Caribbean Sea and restrengthened into a {{tropical}} storm, prompting the NHC to issue {{a tropical}} storm watch for areas between San Felipe, Yucatán and Punta Allen in Mexico {{as well as in}} Pinar del Río Province, Cuba. Several hours later, the watches were upgraded to warnings and a new tropical storm warning was declared for Grand Cayman. A tropical storm watch was also issued for Isla de la Juventud and a hurricane watch for areas between Tulum and Cabo Catoche, Mexico. Early on November8, the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch <b>for</b> <b>Mexico</b> were modified to include areas from Punta Allen to Playa del Carmen and Tulum to Playa del Carmen respectively. A hurricane warning was also declared for areas between Playa del Carmen and Cabo Catoche. Later that day, the tropical storm warning for Grand Cayman was discontinued as Ida moved away from the island. Early on November9, all watches and warnings for Cuba and Mexico were discontinued as Ida moved into the Gulf of Mexico and towards the United States.|$|E
