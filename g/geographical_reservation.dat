In particular, we present a number of techniques that can enable QoS guarantees in ad hoc networks, including <b>geographical</b> <b>reservation</b> and clusterhead election (GRACE), therequest-to-reserve/object-to-reserve/clearto-reserve (ROC) reservation mechanism, andad-hoc MPLS. We introduce a scheme for signaling, reservation, and QoS adaptation in ad hoc mobile wireless networks and the Internet. Finally, we propose geographical subpath protection, geographical circumscribed protection, andgeographical extension protection with shared virtual reservation for nondisrupted QoS guarantees {{in the presence of}} interference, high mobility, bursty traffic, and/or other faults, without wasting expensive radio resources unnecessarily...|$|E

Moreover, some calls such as emergency rescue or business transactions cannot be dropped before service completion. These applications will require the handoff guaranteed service. For guaranteed and handover routing in low earth orbit constellation, Galtier (2001) suggested the <b>geographical</b> <b>reservation</b> scheme. Huang et al. (2004) proposed a traffic model consisting of three service classes: handoff priority, handoff guarantee and best effort. To reduce the blocking probability of handoff voice calls in progress, a few researchers have proposed a subrating scheme. According to this scheme the reserve channels are splitted into two half rate channels to serve more than one call. Jain and Rakhee (2001) suggested the subrating channel assignment for PCS networks for integrated voice/data cellular traffic model. Jain (2003) and Jain et al. (2003 a, b) proposed prioritized handover scheme with subrating. Again, Jain (2005) developed a queuing model with cutoff priority scheme, in which the subrating of guard channels was provided to serve more handover voice calls. Islam and Murshed (2007) investigated an advance resource reservation and call admission control scheme for cellular networks to achieve efficient results in case of network congestion. Wu et al. (2009) developed analytic models based on 1 -D Markov process in microcell and 2 -D Markov process in macrocell, in which a call admission control scheme based on the channel sub-rating is used. A mathematical model to estimate the dropping probabilities of cellular wireless networks by queuing handoff instead of reserving guard channels was proposed by Samanta et al. (2010). Hashemin and Fatemi Ghomi (2012) developed a mathematical model for the resource allocation in stochastic networks using multi-objective decision making algorithm. A heuristic method for consumable resource allocation in multi-class dynamic PERT networks was considered by Yaghoubi et al. (2013). Jain et al. (2015) presented an ANN model for multi channel infinite buffer queue under N-policy.|$|E
40|$|We use the Italian Labour Force Survey and the European Household Panel Survey {{to analyse}} the {{distribution}} of the reservation wages reported by jobseekers. In Italy, reservation wages appear to be higher in the South - the low income and high unemployment area of the country - than in the North and Centre. A similar, rather counterintuitive, pattern, however, can also be found in Finland, France and Spain. First, we show that the way in which these data are commonly collected generates double selection bias. Second, we show that this bias has a strong effect on the estimation of the <b>geographical</b> pattern of <b>reservation</b> wages in many countries. The size of this bias is substantial in Italy. When controlling for it, reservation wages are 10 per cent higher in the North and Centre than in the South. reservation wages, sample selection, regional differentials...|$|R
