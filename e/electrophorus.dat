Electric fish can be further divided into three categories: strongly discharging, weakly discharging, and fish that sense but is unable to generate electric fields. Strongly electric fish generate strong electric field up to 500 volts for predatory purposes; Strongly electric fish include both marine and fresh water fishes (two freshwater taxa- African electric catfish (Malapterurus electricus) and the Neotropical electric eel (<b>Electrophorus</b> electricus) and the marine torpedo rays (Torpedo)). Weakly electric fish generates electric fields mainly for communication and electrolocation purposes; weakly electric fish are found in fresh water only and includes African freshwater Mormyridae and Gymnarchus and Neotropical electric knifefishes.

2500|$|Electricity {{has been}} a subject of {{scientific}} interest {{since at least the}} early 17th century. [...] William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, who was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term [...] "electricity". He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke invented a device later named <b>electrophorus</b> that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} was when Abraham Bennet, the {{inventor}} of the gold leaf electroscope, described a [...] "doubler of electricity" [...] (Phil. Trans., 1787), as a device similar to the <b>electrophorus,</b> but that could amplify a small charge by means of repeated manual operations with three insulated plates, {{in order to make it}} observable in an electroscope. Erasmus Darwin, W. Wilson, G. C. Bohnenberger, and (later, 1841) J. C. E. Péclet developed various modifications of Bennet's device. Francis Ronalds automated the generation process in 1816 by adapting a pendulum bob as one of the plates, driven by clockwork or a steam engine – he created the device to power his electric telegraph. In 1788, William Nicholson proposed his rotating doubler, which can be considered as the first rotating influence machine. His instrument was described as [...] "an instrument which by turning a winch produces the two states of electricity without friction or communication with the earth". (Phil. Trans., 1788, p.403) Nicholson later described [...] a [...] "spinning condenser" [...] apparatus, as a better instrument for measurements.|$|E

50|$|An <b>electrophorus</b> or electrophore is {{a simple}} manual {{capacitive}} generator used to produce electrostatic charge via the process of electrostatic induction. A first version of it was invented in 1762 by Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke, but Italian scientist Alessandro Volta improved and popularized the device in 1775, and is sometimes erroneously credited with its invention. The word <b>electrophorus</b> was coined by Volta from the Greek ήλεκτρον ('elektron'), and ϕέρω ('phero'), meaning 'electricity bearer'.|$|E

50|$|The {{electric}} eel (<b>Electrophorus</b> electricus) is {{an electric}} fish, {{and the only}} species in its genus. Despite the name, {{it is not an}} eel, but rather a knifefish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>electrophorus</b> is thus {{actually}} a manually operated electrostatic generator, {{using the same}} principle of electrostatic induction as electrostatic machines such as the Wimshurst machine and the Van de Graaff generator.|$|E
5000|$|Electret (formed of elektr- from [...] "electricity" [...] and -et from [...] "magnet") is a {{dielectric}} material {{that has a}} quasi-permanent electric charge or dipole polarisation. An electret generates internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. Although Oliver Heaviside coined this term in 1885, materials with electret properties were already known to science and had been studied since the early 1700s. One particular example is the <b>electrophorus,</b> a device consisting of a slab with electret properties and a separate metal plate. The <b>electrophorus</b> was originally invented by Johan Carl Wilcke in Sweden and again by Alessandro Volta in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Because {{dielectric}}s {{resist the}} flow of electricity, {{the surface of a}} dielectric may retain stranded excess electrical charges. This may occur accidentally when the dielectric is rubbed (the triboelectric effect). This can be useful, as in a Van de Graaff generator or <b>electrophorus,</b> or it can be potentially destructive {{as in the case of}} electrostatic discharge.|$|E
50|$|The {{sole member}} of <b>Electrophorus</b> is the {{electric}} eel, which produces both strong (up to 600 volts) and weak (<1 V) electric discharges, {{for use in}} predation and communication/navigation, respectively. The electric eel is {{the largest of the}} gymnotiform fishes, growing up to more than 2 m length. Species of Gymnotus range from about 10-100 cm in total length.|$|E
5000|$|His {{two areas}} of {{significant}} research were electricity and caloric theory. In 1762 he invented an electrostatic generator {{that was a}} first version of the <b>electrophorus,</b> a device named and popularized in 1775 by Alessandro Volta.

50|$|Bennet {{described}} {{experiments with}} an <b>electrophorus</b> and {{the generation of}} electricity by evaporation. Bennet extended his thinking into various theories about electricity and weather, with electrical explanations of the aurora borealis and meteors. He interpreted lightning as the release of electrical charge from clouds, {{and went on to}} hypothesise that rain was caused by lightning and also that earthquakes had an electrical origin.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{examples}} of an <b>electrophorus</b> was built in 1777 by German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. It was 6 feet (2 m) in diameter, with the metal plate raised and lowered using a pulley system. It could reportedly produce 15 inch (38 cm) sparks. Lichtenberg used its discharges to create the strange treelike marks known as Lichtenberg figures.|$|E
50|$|Nachmansohn {{obtained}} {{very active}} solutions of acetylcholinesterase from the electric {{organ of the}} marbled electric ray (Torpedo marmorata). Nachmansohn moved to Yale University in 1939 and while there published studies confirming the presence of even higher concentration of acetylcholinesterase in the electric organ of electric eels (<b>Electrophorus</b> electricus). This work also demonstrated a strong connection between the release of acetylcholine and the electric discharge.|$|E
50|$|He {{attended}} Georg Christoph Lichtenberg's {{lectures on}} physics {{and on his}} persuasion, moved on from the watchmaking mechanics to the large <b>electrophorus,</b> which was evidently Klindworth's work by judging from Lichtenberg's letters. He then became his assistant at his experimental lectures until 1791 when he was substituted by Johann Hermann Seyde. He received many orders from abroad, including, among other things, the title of court mechanic from the Duke Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} {{electric}} eel (<b>Electrophorus</b> electricus), Gymnotiformes are slender fish with narrow bodies and tapering tails, hence the common name of [...] "knifefishes". They have neither pelvic fins nor dorsal fins, but do possess greatly elongated anal fins that stretch along {{almost the entire}} underside of their bodies. The fish swim by rippling this fin, keeping their bodies rigid. This means of propulsion allows them to move backwards as easily as they move forward.|$|E
50|$|In 1774, {{he became}} a {{professor}} of physics at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularised the <b>electrophorus,</b> a device that produced static electricity. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the Swedish experimenter Johan Wilcke. In 1777, he travelled through Switzerland. There he befriended H. B. de Saussure.|$|E
50|$|This {{model of}} an {{electrostatic}} induction generator, {{very much in}} vogue for electromedical purposes {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century, is based on the principles of <b>electrophorus</b> and duplicator function. It is derived from the mechanical improvements made between 1865 and 1880 by the physicist August Topler, the German physicist Wilhelm Holtz (1836-1913) and by J. Robert Voss, a mechanician from Berlin. Voss devised this self-excitation model in 1880, perfecting a machine presented by Topler the previous year.|$|E
50|$|The Gymnotiformes are a {{group of}} teleost bony fishes {{commonly}} known as the Neotropical or South American knifefish. They have long bodies and swim using undulations of their elongated anal fin. Found exclusively in fresh water, these mostly nocturnal fish are capable of producing electric fields for navigation, communication, and, {{in the case of the}} electric eel (<b>Electrophorus</b> electricus), attack and defense. A few species are familiar to the aquarium trade, such as the black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons), the glass knifefish (Eigenmannia virescens), and the banded knifefish (Gymnotus carapo).|$|E

50|$|As a physicist, {{today he}} is remembered for his {{investigations}} in electricity, for discovering branching discharge patterns on dielectrics, now called Lichtenberg figures. In 1777, he built a large <b>electrophorus</b> to generate static electricity through induction. One of the largest made, it was 2 m in diameter and could produce 38-cm sparks. With it, he discovered the basic principle of modern xerography copy machine technology. By discharging a high voltage point near an insulator, {{he was able to}} record strange, tree-like patterns in fixed dust. These Lichtenberg figures are considered today to be examples of fractals.|$|E
5000|$|Lichtenberg {{figures are}} {{named after the}} German {{physicist}} Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who originally discovered and studied them. When they were first discovered, {{it was thought that}} their characteristic shapes might help to reveal the nature of positive and negative electric [...] "fluids". In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large <b>electrophorus</b> to generate high voltage static electricity through induction. After discharging a high voltage point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns by sprinkling various powdered materials onto the surface. By then pressing blank sheets of paper onto these patterns, Lichtenberg was able to transfer and record these images, thereby discovering the basic principle of modern xerography.|$|E
50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The <b>electrophorus</b> simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the metal plate (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the metal plate). This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged metal plate away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the metal plate actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectic plate.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Chagas Filho's main {{scientific}} {{contribution was}} {{centered on the}} study of the eletroplaques of the [...] "poraquê" [...] or electric eel (<b>Electrophorus</b> electricus), actually a fresh water electric fish native to the Amazon. With his group, he made important and original advances in the elucidation of its anatomy and electrophysiology, cytochemistry, as well as its nervous control. He discovered the brain command structures which control electrical discharges. He discovered also that the electroplaques has two kinds of excitability, one which is direct, and another which is reflex via the nervous pathways. He studied also the effects of curare on the electroplaques, which are modified striated muscles and thus have synaptic transmission based on acetylcholine (curare is an antagonist of this neurotransmitter). Dr. Chagas Filho also isolated the ACh membrane receptor.|$|E

5000|$|Electrostatic induction, {{also known}} as [...] "electrostatic influence" [...] or simply [...] "influence" [...] in Europe and Latin America, is a {{redistribution}} of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges. [...] In {{the presence of a}} charged body, an insulated conductor develops a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end. [...] Induction was discovered by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762. [...] Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the <b>electrophorus,</b> use this principle. Due to induction, the electrostatic potential (voltage) is constant at any point throughout a conductor. Electrostatic Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light nonconductive objects, such as balloons, paper or styrofoam scraps, to static electric charges. Electrostatic induction laws apply in dynamic situations as far as the quasistatic approximation is valid. Electrostatic induction {{should not be confused with}} Electromagnetic induction.|$|E

Sodium channels are known for working in concert with potassium channels during the development of graded potentials and action potentials. Sodium channels allow an influx of Na+ ions into a neuron, resulting in a depolarization from the resting membrane potential of a neuron to lead to a graded potential or action potential, depending on the degree of depolarization.|$|E

5000|$|Hawkins {{made good}} use of his {{shipping}} contacts to further his scientific interests. While {{a member of the}} London Electrical Society, he was asked in 1839 by fellow member John Samo to take delivery of some “electric fish” which were to be sent in barrels of fresh water on The Matilda Larkie from Berbice, British Guiana to London. Detailed instructions were given to the master of the ship on the feeding of the fish and ensuring that the water should be kept free of salt. Captain Colin Munro wrote to Hawkins in January 1840 explaining that all five fish had died en route, probably from striking the cask {{as a result of the}} motion of the ship. A later specimen of the fish, named at the time at Gymnotus electricus, but now termed <b>Electrophorus</b> electricus, was obtained by Hawkins from Venezuela. It was dissected by Henry Letheby and a detailed description of the findings was presented in 1842. Hawkins also obtained from Uruguay what he thought was a wasp's nest (it turned out to be a bee's nest) which he presented to the national collection at the British Museum, accompanied by notes on where it was found, and its construction ...|$|E
5000|$|Although the eudiometer's {{invention}} {{is usually}} credited to Marsilio Landriani, {{it was truly}} pioneered by Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist who {{is well known for}} his contributions to the electric battery and electricity. Aside from its laboratory function, the eudiometer is also known for its part in the [...] "Volta pistol". Volta invented this instrument in 1777 for the purpose of testing the [...] "goodness" [...] of air, analyzing the flammability of gases, or to demonstrate the chemical effects of electricity. Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a eudiometer. Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of swamp gases in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with oxygen and another gas. The homogeneous mixture was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly catalyze a reaction by static electricity, using Volta's <b>electrophorus.</b> If the gases were flammable, they would explode, and increase the pressure within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the electrical unit, the volt, to be named after him.|$|E
