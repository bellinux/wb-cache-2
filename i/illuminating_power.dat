2500|$|The {{body of the}} Leviathan, {{especially}} his eyes, possesses great <b>illuminating</b> <b>power.</b> This was the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who, {{in the course of}} a voyage in company with Rabbi Joshua, explained to the latter, when frightened by the sudden appearance of a brilliant light, that it probably proceeded from the eyes of the Leviathan. He referred his companion to the words of Job xli. 18: [...] "By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning" [...] (B. B. l.c.). However, in spite of his supernatural strength, the leviathan is afraid of a small worm called [...] "kilbit", which clings to the gills of large fish and kills them (Shab. 77b).|$|E

"But 'sweetness and light' are {{precious}} and inspiring {{only so far}} as they express the essential sweetness of the disposition of the thinker, and the essential <b>illuminating</b> <b>power</b> of his intelligence. Emerson's greatness came from his character. Sweetness and light streamed from him {{because they were in}} him. In everything he thought, wrote, and did, we feel the presence of a personality as vigorous and brave as it was sweet, and the particular radical thought he at any time expressed derived its power to animate and illuminate other minds from the might of the manhood, which was felt to be within and behind it. To 'sweetness and light' he therefore added the prime quality of fearless manliness.|$|E

He felt a large drop of rain upon {{the back of his}} hand, and {{presently}} one came and entered one of the holes of the lantern, whereupon the candle sputtered and went out. Troy was weary and it being now not far from midnight, and the rain threatening to increase, he resolved to leave the finishing touches of his labour until the day should break. He groped along the wall and over the graves in the dark till he found himself round at the north side. Here he entered the porch, and, reclining upon the bench within, fell asleep.|$|E

60|$|It {{was only}} in company, as I have said, that all these many lights and colours {{could be seen in}} full play. He would begin no matter how--perhaps with a jest at some absurd {{adventure}} of his own, perhaps with the recitation, in his vibrating voice and full Scotch accent, of some snatch of poetry that was haunting him, perhaps with a rhapsody of analytic delight over some minute accident of beauty or expressiveness that had struck him in man, woman, child, or external nature. And forthwith the floodgates would be opened, and the talk would stream on in endless, never importunate, flood and variety. A hundred fictitious characters would be invented and launched on their imaginary careers; a hundred ingenious problems of conduct and cases of honour would be set and solved; romantic voyages would be planned and followed out in vision, with a thousand incidents; the possibilities of life and art would be illuminated with search-lights of bewildering range and penetration, sober argument and high poetic eloquence alternating with coruscations of insanely apposite slang--the earthiest jape anon shooting up into the empyrean and changing into the most ethereal fantasy--the stalest and most vulgarised forms of speech gaining brilliancy and <b>illuminating</b> <b>power</b> from some hitherto undreamt-of application--and all the while an atmosphere of goodwill diffusing itself from the speaker, a glow of eager benignity and affectionate laughter emanating from his presence, till every one about him seemed to catch something of his own gift and inspiration. This sympathetic power of inspiring others was the special and distinguishing note of Stevenson's conversation. He would keep a houseful or a single companion entertained all day, and day after day and half the nights, yet never seemed to monopolise the talk or absorb it; rather he helped every one about him to discover and to exercise unexpected powers of their own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not by reason, then, of 'externality,' for sure, nor yet of imitativeness, {{will this}} writer lose {{his hold on}} the {{attention}} and regard of his countrymen. The debate, before his place in literature is settled, must rather turn on other points: as whether the genial essayist and egoist or the romantic inventor and narrator was the stronger in him--whether the Montaigne and Pepys elements prevailed in his literary composition or the Scott and Dumas elements--a question indeed which among those who care for him most has always been at issue. Or again, what degree of true inspiring and <b>illuminating</b> <b>power</b> belongs to the gospel, or gospels, airily encouraging or gravely didactic, which are {{set forth in the}} essays with so captivating a grace? Or whether in romance and tale he had a power of inventing and constructing a whole fable comparable to his admitted power of conceiving and presenting single scenes and situations in a manner which stamps them indelibly on the reader's mind? And whether his figures are sustained continuously by the true spontaneous breath of creation, or are but transitorily animated at happy moments by flashes of spiritual and dramatic insight, aided by the conscious devices of his singularly adroit and spirited art? These are questions which no criticism but that of time can solve. To contend, as some do, that strong creative impulse and so keen an artistic self-consciousness as Stevenson's was cannot exist together, is quite idle. The truth, of course, is that the deep-seated energies of imaginative creation are found sometimes in combination, and sometimes not in combination, with an artistic intelligence thus keenly conscious of its own purpose and watchful of its own working.|$|E

40|$|Advertising {{has been}} found to be not only a {{reflection}} of society, but also the basis for living amongst a group of people. The images in advertisements especially provide ideas and standards for acceptable behavior, social norms and values specific to men and women. Studying advertisement visuals can <b>illuminate</b> <b>power</b> relations in culture. This approach to feminist theory takes a look at how women and others are used to sell products and how these depictions <b>illuminate</b> <b>power.</b> A framework using cultural, communication and feminist theories is constructed to build an approach for reviewing advertising messages. Focus is on visuals of people and their appearances and situations. A content analysis is the method of investigation. This study focuses on the automobile industry, a powerful dynamic in shaping both the economy and society. Ads from Time magazine, one of the longest running U. S. publications that grew along with the auto market are used from 1925 to 2005. The publication provides a consistent platform to look at messages. A sample of 277 advertisements featuring men and women from 99 issues, spanning 90 years and including 60 auto brands, was analyzed from Time magazine. Gender was reviewed in cultural contrasts: mind/body, cultural/natural, public/private and white male/others. Among the key findings: men and women’s roles reflect the period, women are strategically used based on marketing needs, such as for positioning, brand equity and segment opportunities, and gender roles have not changed as much as popular perception may lead one to believe. The study is important to show how advertising can be used as cultural artifacts to study society and review gender relations at a moment in time as well as throughout time. The representations have important implications for the learning of gender roles from exposure to advertising...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years of MGP operations, the goal of a utility gas works was to produce the {{greatest}} amount of illuminating gas. The <b>illuminating</b> <b>power</b> of a gas was related to amount of soot-forming hydrocarbons (“illuminants”) dissolved in it. These hydrocarbons gave the gas flame its characteristic bright yellow color. Gas works would typically use oily bituminous coals as feedstock. These coals would give off large amounts of volatile hydrocarbons into the coal gas, but would leave behind a crumbly, low-quality coke not suitable for metallurgical processes. Coal or coke oven gas typically had a calorific value between 10 and 20 MJ/m³ (250-550 Btu/ft3 (std)); with values around 20 MJ/m³ (550 Btu/ft3 (std)) being typical.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} takes a {{look back}} at the supply and demand model of selection and recruitment, developed by Joni Lovenduski and Pippa Norris in Political Recruitment: Gender, Race and Class in the British Parliament (1995). The core understanding of this model was that candidate selection was an interactive process in which both selectors and aspirants affected outcomes that were organized in several sets of institutions. The model <b>illuminates</b> <b>power</b> in particular institutions - British political parties - and was designed to examine the various effects of the selection process. This contribution reflects on the model and puts forward ideas and arguments about what might be done differently, taking into account the theoretical and methodological innovations of the succeeding generation of scholars who have used the model. It also identifies remaining challenges for research on candidate selection and suggests that the supply and demand model is sufficiently flexible that it can still travel across national, system and party boundaries...|$|R
