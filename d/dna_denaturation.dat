40|$|We {{used the}} Transfer-Integral method to compute, with an {{uncertainty}} smaller than 5 %, the six fundamental characteristic exponents of two dynamical models for <b>DNA</b> thermal <b>denaturation</b> and investigate {{the validity of}} the scaling laws. Doubts concerning this point arise because the investigated systems (i) have a divergent internal length, (ii) are described by a divergent order parameter, (iii) are of dimension 1. We found that the assumption that the free energy can be described by a single homogeneous function is robust, despite the divergence of the order parameter, so that Rushbrooke's and Widom's identities are valid relations. Josephson's identity is instead not satisfied. This is probably due to the divergence of the internal length, which invalidates the assumption that the correlation length is solely responsible for singular contributions to thermodynamic quantities. Fisher's identity is even wronger. We showed that {{this is due to the}} d= 1 dimensionality and obtained an alternative law, which is well satisfied at <b>DNA</b> thermal <b>denaturation.</b> Comment: accepted in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>denaturation</b> {{can also}} be used to detect {{sequence}} differences between two different DNA sequences. DNA is heated and denatured into single-stranded state, and the mixture is cooled to allow strands to rehybridize. Hybrid molecules are formed between similar sequences and any differences between those sequences will result in a disruption of the base-pairing. On a genomic scale, the method has been used by researchers to estimate the genetic distance between two species, a process known as DNA-DNA hybridization. In the context of a single isolated region of DNA, denaturing gradient gels and temperature gradient gels can be used to detect the presence of small mismatches between two sequences, [...] a process known as temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.|$|E

5000|$|René Thomas {{discovered}} that the UV absorption of native DNA is far lower than expected from a [...] "theoretical" [...] spectrum built from the extinction coefficients of its component nucleotides. This gap disappears after mild treatments such as lower or higher pH, higher temperature, or lower ionic strength, especially lower concentration of divalent cations. These preserve the inter-nucleotide bonds that maintain the DNA structure, implying that the nitrogenous bases, responsible for the UV absorbance, interact by weak bonds (Hydrogen bonds or Van de Waals forces), contributing a labile secondary structure to DNA. Melting this secondary structure was coined <b>DNA</b> <b>denaturation,</b> by analogy with the similar process long known for proteins.

For negative supercoiling, this regime lies between bubble-dominated and plectoneme-dominated phases, and explains the broad transition between the two observed in experiment. Tip bubbles cause localisation of plectonemes within thermodynamically weaker AT-rich sequences, and can greatly suppress plectoneme diffusion by a pinning mechanism. They occur for supercoiling densities and forces that are typically encountered for DNA in vivo, and may be exploited for biological control of genomic processes...|$|R

50|$|With {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) being {{among the most popular}} contexts in which <b>DNA</b> <b>denaturation</b> is desired, heating is the most frequent method of denaturation. Other than denaturation by heat, nucleic acids can undergo the denaturation process through various chemical agents such as formamide, guanidine, sodium salicylate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol, and urea. These chemical denaturing agents lower the melting temperature (Tm) by competing for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors with pre-existing nitrogenous base pairs. Some agents are even able to induce denaturation at room temperature. For example, alkaline agents (e.g. NaOH) have been shown to denature DNA by changing pH and removing hydrogen-bond contributing protons. These denaturants have been employed to make Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis gel (DGGE), which promotes denaturation of nucleic acids in order to eliminate the influence of nucleic acid shape on their electrophoretic mobility.|$|E

40|$|<b>DNA</b> thermal <b>denaturation</b> is the {{breaking}} of the base pairs, leading to a splitting of the two strands of the double helix. While it is easy to measure the fraction of open base pairs $(f) $ vs. temperature, determining the fraction $(p) $ of fully open molecules is much harder.

40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>denaturation</b> {{has long}} been a subject of intense study due to its {{relationship}} to DNA transcription and its fundamental importance as a nonlinear, structural transition. Many aspects of this phenomenon, however, remain poorly understood. Existing models fit quite well with experimental results on the fraction of unbound base pairs versus temperature. Yet, these same models give incorrect results for other essential quantities. For example, the predicted base pair fluctuation timescales - relevant to transcription - are orders of magnitude different from those observed experimentally. Here, we demonstrate that nanoscale thermal transport can serve as a sensitive probe of the underlying microscopic mechanisms responsible for the dynamics of <b>DNA</b> <b>denaturation.</b> Specifically, we show that the heat transport properties of DNA are altered significantly and abruptly as it denaturates, and this alteration encodes detailed information on the dynamics of thermal fluctuations and their interaction along the chain. This finding allows for the unambiguous discrimination between models of <b>DNA</b> <b>denaturation.</b> Measuring the thermal conductance will thus shed new light on the nature of this important molecule.
