5000|$|Instead {{of meeting}} the Blitzkrieg head-on, Boyd {{suggested}} {{what he called the}} [...] "counter-blitz", where small groups of equally mobile forces would pick away at the lines of thrust and then {{move on to the next}} in a series of hit-and-run attacks. There was no necessity to retain any sort of front line, and the attacks deliberately moved from point to point in order to avoid being bogged down or getting trapped. The idea was not to force the blitz to lose its ability to maneuver, but instead upset its ability to understand where it should be maneuvering to—the attacker would have no idea which of these counteroffensives represented a real threat, and would have to respond to all of them. The key idea was to [...] "Smash blitz offensive by inconspicuously using fast-tempo/fluidity-of-action and cohesion of counter-blitz combat teams as basis <b>for</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> forces and quick focus of air and ground effort to throttle momentum, shatter cohesion, and envelop blitz in order to destroy adversary's capacity to resist." [...] The battle was less about the weapons than it was about the ability to command them; it was believed that the US's devolved command structure would be able to react to changes on the battlefield more quickly than their Soviet counterparts, overwhelming the Soviets ability to maintain cohesion as their higher-echelon commanders became overwhelmed with reports from so many small actions.|$|E

Three experiments pursued one basis for similarity in musical keyboard performance: matches between sequential transitions in spatial targets for movements and the melodic contour of auditory feedback. Trained pianists and musically untrained persons produced simple tonal melodies on a keyboard while hearing feedback sequences that either matched the planned melody or were contour-preserving varia-tions of that melody. Sequence production was disrupted among pianists when feedback events were serially shifted by one event, similarly <b>for</b> <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> planned melodies and tonal variations but less so <b>for</b> <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> atonal variations.

The phase transition scheme has been investigated and analyzed by results obtained from the optical transmittance and the dielectric permittivity study with variation of temperature {{in the range of}} 30 to 100 °C. Both the samples clearly show the shifting of phase transition temperature with dye concentration, especially the SmC*-SmA phase transition temperature.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} supports that visual attention - the cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a salient or task-relevant subset of visual information - often works on object-based representation. Recent studies have postulated two possible accounts for the object-specific attentional advantage: attentional spreading and attentional prioritization, each of which modulates a bottom-up signal for sensory processing and a top-down signal for attentional allocation, respectively. It is still unclear which account can explain the object-specific attentional advantage. To address this issue, we examined the influence of object-specific advantage on two types of visual search: parallel search, invoked when a bottom-up signal is fully available at a target location, and serial search, invoked when a bottom-up signal {{is not enough to}} guide target selection and a top-down control <b>for</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> focused attention is required. Our results revealed that the object-specific advantage is given to the serial search but not to the parallel search, suggesting that object-based attention facilitates stimulus processing by affecting the priority of attentional shifts rather than by enhancing sensory signals. Thus, our findings support the notion that the object-specific attentional advantage can be explained by attentional prioritization but not attentional spreading...|$|E

The observed spectra in the 4000 - 400 cm(- 1) range {{have been fitted}} using the modified scaled quantum mechanical force field (SQMFF) calculation with the 6 - 311 G** basis. The advantage of using the modified SQMFF method is that it scales the force constants {{to find the best}} fit to the observed spectral lines by minimizing the fitting error. In this way we are able to assign all the observed fundamental bands in the spectra. With consecutive methyl substitutions two sets of bands are found to shift in a systematic way. The set of four aromatic C-H stretching vibrations around 3000 cm(- 1) shifts toward lower frequencies while the single most intense aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending mode around 750 cm(- 1) shifts toward higher frequencies. The reason <b>for</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> aromatic C-H stretching frequency toward lower wave numbers with gradual methyl substitution has been attributed to the lengthening of the C-H bonds due to the +I effect of the methyl groups to the ring current as revealed from the calculations. While the unexpected shifting of the aromatic C-H out-of-plane bend toward higher wave numbers with increasing methyl substitution is ascribed to the lowering of the number of adjacent aromatic C-H bonds on the plane of the benzene ring with gradual methyl substitutions.

Furthermore, ice slurries {{can be stored in}} tanks for later use, which allows for benefits of peak load reduction and also allows <b>for</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> cooling loads to the nighttime, when electricity tariffs are low and the primary cycle efficiency is high. Ice slurries may for example be utilized in air-conditioning, supermarket cooling and cooling in (food) industry. The objective of the research was to enhance secondary cooling system performance by using a fluidized bed ice slurry generator. The research was initiated because ice slurries, though efficient cold carriers, are not applied widely in secondary cooling systems yet, the main obstacle being the lack of an efficient ice slurry generator. In the research the heat and mass transfer processes in the fluidized bed ice slurry generator were studied in detail. An accurate heat transfer model was developed. Ice crystallization, ice adhesion and liquid/solid fluidization phenomena were investigated to determine the processes that are responsible for freeze-up of the ice slurry generator. Also the thermophysical properties of the ice slurries and their behavior in secondary cooling cycles were evaluated.

Influence of calcination temperature in Ar atmosphere on structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties on CZTS films has been investigated. Formation of CZTS has been confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) whereas formation of Kesterite-CZTS films has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. We found that the calcination process has a great influence on growth and nucleation of grains. XRD analysis revealed that the crystallinity and average grain size increases with increase in calcination temperature. Raman spectroscopy analysis show shifting of Raman peak shift towards lower wavenumber with increase in calcination temperature. The presence of internal compressive stress and shrinking of substrate during cooling may responsible <b>for</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> Raman peak towards lower wavenumber. However, shrinking of substrate while cooling has not been verified experimentally. Detail surface study (morphology and topology) reveal that CZTS thin films have densely packed and a highly interconnected network of grains with large area (4  cm 2). AFM show significant difference in surface topography of CZTS films with change in calcination temperature. Increase in calcination temperature show increase in rms and average surface roughness of the CZTS films. UV–Visible spectroscopy analysis revealed that the absorption coefficient of as-deposited and calcinated CZTS films {{are in the range}} 104 – 105  cm− 1 in the visible region. The bandgap show decreasing trend with increase in calcination temperature (1.91 – 1.59  eV). The bandgap of CZTS film annealed at 400  °C was found ~ 1.59  eV which is quite close to the optimum value for photovoltaic solar conversion in the visible region of solar spectrum. It is found that the photo response depends upon the grain size effect, whereas photo response increases with the increase of the grain size. Employment these films as an absorber layer in CZTS solar cells can improve the conversion efficiency by reducing recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers due to increased grain size.|$|E

The main focus is on the innovative behaviours exhibited by the primary school supervisors. Thus, the experiences of primary school teachers, provincial directors of education and primary school supervisors about these behaviours are identified. The views of these groups on some on-going supervisory activities in primary education in general and its supervision in particular are also identified and compared with each other. In addition, the views of these three groups of educationalists were sought on the barriers which could prevent the process of initiation and implementation of educational innovations and their recommendations for the improvement of the degree of implementing such innovations in primary schools. Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 190 teachers, 50 supervisors and 10 directors, drawn from representative regions throughout Turkey. For the teachers and supervisors, information obtained and their personal charecteristics made it possible to examine the relationship of their responses with, for example, sex, age, teaching experiences and region. The findings of the study revealed that the vast majority of the pre-defined would-be innovative behaviours of supervisors had not been adequately exhibited both in quantity and quality, according to the responses of the vast majority of the teachers.
