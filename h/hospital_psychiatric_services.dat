40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{prevalence}} of manual restraint to manage violent or challenging behaviour in <b>hospital</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> or the circumstances of its use. This review identified 45 empirical studies of manual restraint of adult psychiatric inpatients, mostly from the UK. On average, up to five episodes per month of manual restraint might be expected on an average 20 bed ward. Episodes last around ten minutes, with about half involving the restraint of patients on the floor, usually in the prone position. Manually restrained patients tend to be younger, male and detained under mental health legislation. Staff value restraint related training but its impact on nursing practice has not been evaluated. Research has tended to focus on official reports of violent incidents rather than manual restraint per se. Larger and more complex studies are needed to examine how manual restraint is used in response to different types of incident and in different service settings...|$|E

Background: The Identifying Depression as a Comorbid Condition (IDACC) study aimed to identify depressive symptoms in hospitalised cardiac patients and support management {{of depression in}} general practice. Objective: This post hoc analysis of the IDACC trial examines the effectiveness and practicality of different forms of communication between <b>hospital</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> and general practitioners. Methods: We randomised 669 cardiac inpatients with depressive symptoms, identified with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), to an intervention or usual care control group. Individual depression scores and depression management guidelines were sent to GPs of all intervention patients. Where possible, psychiatric advice was provided to the GP either by multidisciplinary enhanced primary care case conference or one-to-one telephone advice. Results: Multidisciplinary case conferences were implemented for only 24 % of intervention patients. General practitioners received individual telephone advice in 40 % of cases, and 36 % received written information only. The psychiatrist telephone advice resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} the proportion of patients with moderate to severe depression 12 months after cardiac hospitalisation (19 % vs. 35 %). Discussion: Screening, combined with psychiatrist telephone advice to GPs, was simple to organise and effective in reducing depression severity after cardiac admission.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess sentinel event analysis and relative factors in different mental healthcare settings. In addition, the occurrence of sentinel events in different hospital settings was compared and potential risk factors contributing to sentinel events identified. Methods A total of 75 consecutive adult subjects were enrolled from 2 psychiatric units, 1 within a general hospital and 1 at a psychiatric hospital in southern Taiwan. A retrospective chart review of the psychiatric inpatients was conducted for patients that met the criteria for a sentinel event between July 2004 and May 2011. A comparison of the hospital settings was made and differences between suicidal and non-suicidal sentinel events studied. Results Psychiatric patients that received general <b>hospital</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> (1) appeared to experience a sentinel event soon after admission, (2) the time between the sentinel event occurrence and patient death was shorter, (3) there was a higher probability of potential medical illness than among inpatients treated at a specialized psychiatric hospital, (4) the sentinel event subjects that committed suicide were younger, had a shorter hospital stay, shorter time to occurrence of the sentinel event followed by an unexpected death than the non-suicidal group, and (5) a younger age, higher education level, previous suicide attempt and family psychiatric history were important predictors of suicide among psychiatric inpatients. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that psychiatric inpatients treated at a general hospital require careful examination for potential physical illness and greater efforts to prevent suicide. A younger age, higher education level, history of a previous suicide attempt and family psychiatric history are additional risk factors for suicide among these patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Staff and {{patients}} of hospital psychiatry services are commonly {{confronted by the}} aggressive behaviour of patients. Such behaviour can result in numerous, and varied, adverse outcomes that ultimately reduce {{the quality of care}} that can be offered. Psychiatric services and mental health legislation place great emphasis on providing services within the least-restrictive environment; this means that prompt identification and treatment of patients at risk of aggression and violence is critical. Thus, elucidation of the personal features of patients that influence aggression is an important focus for empirical research. Moreover, it is essential that in explicating such features, the contextual nature of aggression occurring in hospital psychiatry services be considered. In this thesis, a number of personal features relevant to aggression in hospital psychiatry services are discussed. The main focus is on understanding interpersonal hostile-dominance (HD) and its relationship with aggression in hospital psychiatry services through the integration of two complementary theoretical models: the General Aggression Model (GAM) and Interpersonal Theory. The GAM is a comprehensive aggression theory, while Interpersonal Theory highlights the importance of relational functioning in understanding personality and interpersonal behaviour. Underpinning this dissertation are four distinct, yet related research aims: (1) To assess the influence of interpersonal and personality factors, GAM-specified cognitions and related affective states, and clinical factors on psychiatric inpatient aggression; (2) To delineate interpersonal HD in psychiatric inpatients; (3) To examine the stability of HD and its relationship with psychiatric symptoms and aggression over time; and (4) To explore whether HD mediates the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect and aggressive behaviour in psychiatric inpatients. For the empirical component of this research, 200 adult psychiatry inpatients were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory- 2 : Trait Anger scale (STAXI- 2 :TA), the Measures of Criminal Attitudes and Associates: Attitudes Towards Violence scale (MCAA:ATV), the Schedule of Imagined Violence (SIV), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Psychopathy Check List: Screening Version (PCL:SV), the Impact Message Inventory-Circumplex (IMI-C), and the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). Assessments took place within five days of their admission to the low-dependence environment. Forty-one participants were available at six months post-hospital discharge for follow-up assessment using the PANSS, IMI-C, and the Life History of Aggression Questionnaire: Aggression subscale (LHA:A). In relation to the first aim, results showed that HD, psychopathy, the tendency to rehearse aggressive scripts, positive attitudes towards violence, trait anger, and disorganised and excited symptoms predicted psychiatric inpatient aggression. However, only HD remained as a significant unique predictor in the hierarchical regression analysis, confirming the importance of HD in the prediction of psychiatric inpatient aggressive behaviour. In relation to the second aim, interpersonal, affective, and behavioural features of psychopathy, the tendency to rehearse aggressive scripts, and positive, negative, disorganised, and excited psychiatric symptoms remained as significant unique predictors of HD in a hierarchical regression model. This suggests that HD reflects a characteristic tendency towards interpersonal, affective, and behavioural problems marked by hostility and dominance, combined with a tendency toward frequent aggressive script rehearsal, and more severe psychopathology. In relation to the third aim, results showed that HD was stable over time, despite an overall reduction in psychiatric symptoms, and that HD was associated with greater symptom severity over time. Furthermore, it was found that elevated HD and greater severity of excited psychiatric symptoms in the community, along with more severe positive psychiatric symptoms in the hospital and in the community, were associated with aggressive behaviour occurring post-discharge. These findings implicate HD as a risk factor for more severe psychopathology, and highlight HD as a risk factor for post-discharge aggression. In relation to the final aim, childhood abuse and neglect experiences were commonly reported, with between 41 % and 50. 5 % of participants reporting having experienced at least moderate severity of the different forms of childhood maltreatment. More severe emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and physical neglect in childhood were associated with higher HD in adulthood. Higher levels of HD and all forms of childhood abuse and neglect were associated with aggression; HD mediated the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect, and aggression. These results indicate that childhood maltreatment contributes to interpersonal HD, which then influences aggressive behaviour. Together, these findings highlight the importance of HD and Interpersonal Theory to the problem of aggression in <b>hospital</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services.</b> These results are also important to the GAM and suggest interpersonal style and Interpersonal Theory should have an important role in models that seek to account for interpersonal aggression and violence. Additionally, this body of research enhances conceptualisations of HD and reinforces the importance of understanding the developmental impact of childhood abuse and neglect experiences from an interpersonal perspective. By assessing interpersonal style on admission, patients with elevated levels of HD can be identified. HD can then be considered in subsequent treatment plans and aggression prevention strategies. Post-discharge assessments of HD would also be useful. Reductions in HD, and therefore aggression, might be achieved through a broad intervention that covers interpersonal and affective characteristics, emotional and behavioural regulation, cognitions and psychiatric symptoms, in an interpersonally informed framework...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} geographical {{variations in}} use of acute <b>psychiatric</b> inpatient <b>services</b> within New York City {{and how these}} have changed from 1990 to 2000.

Geographical variations in hospital use were related to proximity to general <b>hospitals</b> with <b>psychiatric</b> beds and to socio-economic status of local populations (as recorded in the 1990 and 2000 population censuses). Areas close to <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> areas show high admission levels.

Hospital admissions within New Zealand {{for this population}} were extracted from electronic records. Relevant demographic information (gender, age and ethnicity) and clinical data (primary diagnosis at index admission and admission history) were included for each person. Descriptive analysis of inpatient data and negative binomial regression models were conducted. Results Of 924 patients, 38. 5 % had no readmissions anywhere in New Zealand in the 5 -years following index discharge. 41. 0 % were readmitted within 12 months and 61. 4 % were readmitted within 5 years of index discharge. Only 5. 6 % experienced an admission {{every year for the}} 5 -years post index admission. Readmission was least likely for those with index discharge diagnosis of depression. A history of admissions prior to index admission and Maori ethnicity were characteristics associated with higher numbers of readmission.
