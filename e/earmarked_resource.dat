5000|$|Regarding immigration, UPyD wish to {{transfer}} immigration policy to the European Union as an exclusive competence because {{it affects the}} whole of Europe. Therefore, the party asks the European Commission {{for the inclusion of}} Ceuta and Melilla in the European customs area as full-fledged territories and, hence, external borders of the European Union. UPyD states that controlled immigration is good and necessary for Europe because of its demographic ageing and advocates a common immigration policy with strict respect for international law and human rights that entails a European action protocol to contain illegal immigration. On the one hand, the magenta party supports greater immigration control by arguing that Ceuta's and Melilla's Spanish border fences must be protected. UPyD believes that the Civil Guard should stop illegal immigrants and legally repatriate them to their country of origin or return them to the country which they entered from without violating their human rights, thereby banning deterrents like firing rubber bullets and the use of razor wires. On the other hand, the party stands up for giving asylum and humanitarian protection to displaced people outside their countries because of armed conflicts, without discriminating against Muslim refugees. Likewise, UPyD is favourable to <b>earmark</b> financial <b>resources</b> for promoting democracy in countries where there is no democracy and even to intervene militarily if financial resources are insufficient [...] "to defend and protect human rights and thus no one has to leave those countries".|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Reviews {{of peer-reviewed}} health studies have {{highlighted}} {{problems with their}} methodological quality. As published health studies {{form the basis of}} many clinical decisions including evaluation and provisions of health services, this has scientific and ethical implications. The lack of involvement of methodologists (defined as statisticians or quantitative epidemiologists) has been suggested as one key reason for this problem and this has been linked to the lack of access to methodologists. This issue was highlighted several years ago and it was suggested that more investments were needed from health care organisations and Universities to alleviate this problem. Methods To assess the current level of methodological support available for health researchers in England, we surveyed the 25 National Health Services Trusts in England, that are the major recipients of the Department of Health's research and development (R&D) support funding. Results and discussion The survey shows that the <b>earmarking</b> of <b>resources</b> to provide appropriate methodological support to health researchers in these organisations is not widespread. Neither the level of R&D support funding received nor the volume of research undertaken by these organisations showed any association with the amount they spent in providing a central resource for methodological support for their researchers. Conclusion The promotion and delivery of high quality health research requires that organisations hosting health research and their academic partners put in place funding and systems to provide appropriate methodological support to ensure valid research findings. If resources are limited, health researchers may have to rely on short courses and/or a limited number of advisory sessions which may not always produce satisfactory results. </p...|$|R

40|$|Normally, {{in western}} democracies, governments {{concentrate}} the less popular recovery interventions {{in the first}} two years of their electoral mandate. This enables them to <b>earmark</b> the <b>resources</b> for expansion policies at the end of their mandate in order to start the following election campaign with a healthy economy and achieve, in this way, strong political consensus. A government which has been in office for two years and has inherited unbalanced public accounts is forced to take upon itself only the “dirty work” without benefiting from the advantages of the second part of the story. This does not pay from an electoral point of view also because voters find it rather difficult to understand the use of a reduced deficit and a public debt or a slowly growing GDP. Moreover, when prices go up, mortgages become increasingly expensive and consumption goes down. These are some of the reasons why the 2008 political election campaign was very peculiar. Long standing unsolved problems became entwined with more recent uncertainties: the great expectations of the weaker ones and the bitter disappointment of the more fortunate ones, the shattering of interests and the resistance of exclusive privileges. In this chapter, I will provide an overview of the economic context which directly or indirectly impacted voters’ decisions.

30|$|Given {{that many}} actors, those that {{activate}} citizenship {{from above and}} those that mobilize participation from below, shape how different immigrant groups integrate into the local social and political fabric, competing logics about immigrant inclusion may be at play (Greenwood et al., 2009; Jørgensen, 2012). Different rationales can clash or align to motivate the mobilization of resources towards—and advocacy of—urban undocumented residents. In cities with large immigrant populations such as New York and Paris, politicians’ pro-immigrant actions such as protection from deportation or <b>resources</b> <b>earmarked</b> for immigrant issues can influence immigrant voters or voters sympathetic to their concerns. Universalistic missions of government bureaucracies, especially schools, mobilize resources for undocumented residents (Marrow, 2009). Ethnic and non-ethnic community-based organizations advocate for marginalized immigrant residents; religious institutions welcome and sometimes organize undocumented parishioners; and labor unions can vouch for immigrant workers, regardless of legal status. The inclusive missions of these organizations may increase their numbers of immigrant members. Foundations may support the inclusive, democratic values that such organizations embody. Employers can also support certain rights for undocumented residents, especially to protect their workers from deportation; other rights, such as labor organizing and worker rights, receive more ambivalent support.|$|R

The effect of preschool education on student achievement is measured through the 15 -year-old pupils' scholastic performance in reading, mathematics and scientific literacy evaluated through PISA.

In the sample of female pupils, the positive effect of preschool attendance on school performance remains significant even after we control for the factors of socio-economic background.

Thomas (1980) suggests that student and parent time is a 2 ̆ 2 nonpurchased resource 2 ̆ 2 that school leaders interested in effective and efficient allocation should consider.

Inputs, he says, are the available human and material resources, whereas applications are the 2 ̆ 2 alternative ways resource inputs are mixed to achieve students 2 ̆ 7 educational goals 2 ̆ 2 (p. 174). Allocation is apportionment for a specific purpose or to particular persons or things. It also is an <b>earmarking</b> of <b>resources</b> for distribution. According to Guthrie et al.
