40|$|The Environmental Technology Centre (ETC) is a Centre of Excellence for Industry {{focussed}} Research & Development in Environmental Technology. The ETC is the Asia Pacific Partner Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme <b>International</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre.</b> The {{aim of the}} ETC is to research, {{develop and}} demonstrate environmental technologies, conduct education and training, provide consultancy services to industry, and raise community awareness of environmental technologies. Its facilities are open to industries wishing to test and monitor products within the university infrastructure. The ETC occupies a 1. 7 -hectare site on the Murdoch University campus at which over fifty environmental technologies have been combined to form an integrated operating demonstration system. The technologies used and researched at the site include climate-sensible buildings, renewable energy systems for power supply and water pumping, aquaculture systems, organic waste management, and permaculture. The integrated approach allows research {{to be carried out}} on the important interactions between different technologies, rather than just the effect of a single technology. This gives the ETC a considerable advantage over other research institutions that focus on single technologies in relative isolation. The ETC is able to offer holistic and flexible solutions to human needs. The ETC's focus is on small to medium-scale environmental technologies, which are low cost, robust, efficient, and easy to operate and maintain. The aim of this is to maximise the opportunities for user communities to "own" the technology, resulting in greater and more sustained uptake of the technology, higher levels of community awareness and involvement, and ultimately a more successful operation. This approach is highly applicable to communities in developing countries, as well as to urban communities worldwide, particularly when applied in collaboration with industry and government. The challenges facing adoption of such integrated approaches to technology transfer and implementation are varying in nature depending on the application {{but in the case of}} cities and urban planning it is often regulatory barriers, economic viability under existing financing frameworks, and the level of knowledge in government. Industry itself has enormous capacity to innovate and adapt to such changes.

Subsequently internet based knowledge management systems are under-developed in their ability to assist transfer of information relating to EST. This study focused initially on a review of EST in relation to Ecological Sustainability principles and the contrasting value systems of Environmental and Ecological Economics. Drawing on this context, the strategic programme of the principal protagonist for international EST transfer, the United Nations Environment Programme-International <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre</b> (UNEP-IETC), was evaluated. Central to the UNEP-IETC strategic programme is the transfer of EST related information through internet based databases and knowledge management systems. This study found that UNEP-IETC have the potential to deliver a dual strategy for EST transfer, including both "incremental" supply driven and "transformative" citizen demand driven strategies. The focus of UNEP-IETC continues to be based on servicing and expanding the role of the market in "incremental" EST transfer rather than servicing the involvement of citizens and community in defining appropriate technologies for their local to global context. The partnership of UNEP-IETC with the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre</b> (ETC) and the development of the Cities as Sustainable-Ecosystems (CASE) concept offer potential for an emerging "transformative" strategy.

40|$|A {{transition}} toward decentralised {{treatment of}} wastewater is currently occurring in Australia and globally, giving {{the opportunity for}} a more sustainable water cycle. Appropriate selection of decentralised treatment systems is complicated due to the number of technologies available, wide variance in capabilities of different technologies and lack of expertise of decision makers. A number of decision support tools have been developed to assist in determining appropriate technology for given situations. Previously, tools have focused on regulatory factors, however there is room for further development related to maintenance requirements, nutrient management and energy efficiency. This paper presents a recent development at the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre,</b> Murdoch University of an electronic decision support tool for appropriate decentralised wastewater selection, focusing on the nutrient management and energy efficiency of different treatment and technologies.

The design has been modified since this time by its original manufacturer but full commercialisation was not achieved. The current owner Solco Pty Ltd was keen to further improve the efficiency and lower the purchase cost of the unit and engaged the Murdoch ETC to undertake further testing. The Solarflow is a self-contained solar-powered unit capable of producing 400 L/day of high quality drinking water from brackish water via reverse osmosis and requires only 120 W of photovoltaic power. This is achievable due to its innovative energy recovery system. In order to assess the unit's efficiency more accurately the latest high-rate data logging technology from the ResLab laboratory at Murdoch University was employed.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the composition of various waste components at the Johannesburg FFVs market. The study was conducted during the summer in 2015 to evaluate the various components of fruit and vegetable wastes (FVWs) generated at the market. This was done in order to evaluate the amount of FVWs that are generated daily at the market as a starting point for waste to energy (WtE) proposition for the City of Johannesburg (CoJ).

40|$|The {{potential}} for constructed wetlands (CWs) in Western Australia is enormous {{as they can}} provide cost-effective wastewater treatment systems with an effluent quality suitable for reuse which are simple and inexpensive to operate and maintain when compared to conventional treatment systems. As a result they represent an appropriate and sustainable technology for wastewater treatment - properties which have been widely documented. The largest drawback is the area they require which can make their application to urban areas problematic; however they are particularly well suited to small towns and rural communities where sufficient land {{is more likely to}} be available. In addition regulatory bodies are currently preoccupied with the {{potential for}} mosquito habitat which can be avoided with correct design. Constructed wetlands can be considered to be of three principal types: horizontal subsurface flow (SSF), vertical flow (VF) and free water surface (FWS). The design of SSF and FWS wetlands historically has been based on data from numerous wetlands worldwide which has been used to derive empirical equations - the 'black box' approach. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre</b> is now beginning to monitor several different types of constructed wetlands in southwest Western Australia and data more relevant to the local climate is being compiled.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines {{a project}} {{aimed at improving}} Indonesian capacity in water and sanitation {{through a process of}} institutional strengthening. Funded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) this involved the partnering of Murdoch University’s <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre</b> (ETC), Australia and Merdeka University’s Institute for <b>Environmental</b> Management and <b>Technology</b> (IEMT), Indonesia. Through a series of collaborative activities, the project sought to develop the capacity of IEMT staff to be better able to provide services and training to local government, NGOs, industry and academia on water and sanitation. The project comprised of three phases designed to 1) understand IEMT’s existing capacity; 2) identify the needs and priorities of IEMT’s stakeholders; and, 3) to further develop IEMT’s capacity through the joint implementation of a training-of-trainers workshop. Each of the phases was delivered with some success. However, by means of participant observation, interviews with project members and stakeholders as well as subsequent qualitative analysis the activities were critiqued identifying a number of areas of concern. Foremost, it was concluded that the training-of-trainers model was not appropriate in this context due to inconsistencies with good practice guidelines for capacity building and learning theory. Further, it was established that while the needs were assessed {{the extent to which they}} informed decision making was limited. It is suggested that these challenges are not uncommon in capacity building projects of a similar nature. This is due to the fact that the approach employed is often strongly influenced by the experience and expectations of the project members. And, that there is a lack of appropriate training models for use in capacity development from which to draw experience. As such, the resulting training is often the replication of a familiar approach that may do little to develop the capacity of the target audience...|$|R

The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre</b> (ETC) at Murdoch University and St. John of God Hospital (SJOG) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) {{to install a}} vermiculture system in SJOG to treat some of the organic waste generated by the on site kitchen facility. This is an effort made by SJOG {{to reduce the amount}} of organic waste sent to landfill each year and to treat the waste on site as part of a recycling/reuse program. The study is aimed at scientifically monitoring vermicomposting process and to understand the optimum management requirements to improve the operation of an institutional scale worm farm. In addition, an experiment was conducted to investigate the suitability of bedding materials: horse manure, cow manure, peat coir, and natural bedding (vermicast). The species of earthworms used in this experiment were Red (Lumbricus rubellus), Tiger (Eisenia fetida), and Blue (Lumbricus excavatus). The pH, temperature, worm population and quality of castings were tested in different beds. Results indicated that vermicast was the best bedding for vermicomposting, and there were no significant difference between the performances of the other three beds. However, it can be concluded that the bedding material of horse manure, cow manure, and peat coir were successfully established well within the experimental period of eight weeks, and cow manure with the lowest C:N ratio produced the best quality bedding. As using vermicast for the initial bedding creates a very high capital cost these organic substrates provide cost-effective alternative. Therefore they would be quite appropriate to initiate an institutional scale worm farm...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of a major tourism {{development}} proposal being refused for the Coral Coast region of Western Australia there is again a focus on developing strategies for more sustainable facilities that support ‘low-impact nature-based tourism’. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Centre</b> at Murdoch University, together with the Faculty of Architecture, Landscape & Visual Arts at The University of Western Australia, completed a study for the Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre (STCRC) to develop the Best Practice Model for Sustainable Tourism Facilities in Remote Areas. There are currently numerous environmentally sustainable guidelines, accreditation schemes and assessment systems in operation throughout the world and in Australia. The majority of these relate to the niche eco-tourism market and include the Draft International Ecotourism Standard and NEAP (Nature and Ecotourism Accreditation Program). There is also a clear and generally accepted industry understanding of what constitutes the principles and standards of sustainable tourism. Yet there is industry concern about the difficulty and cost of compliance and gaining accreditation to be considered as sustainable. This project developed a holistic and independently verifiable ‘best practice’ assessment system that is both user friendly for operators and also sets an aspirational and creative cross-cultural bar across the full range of sustainability criteria for low-impact, nature-based facilities. The project involved visits to a number of low-impact facilities throughout Australia with the intention of assessing the implementation of guiding principles and to apply the assessment criteria to such facilities. The challenges that face implementation of such a model include economic viability for industry, acceptance by Local Government Authorities, and the appropriate mechanisms to assess and license such developments in nature conservation reserves by State Government agencies...|$|R

RADG {{has been involved in}} the research and development of appropriate water supply and treatment systems units suitable for remote areas for over ten years. Research carried out by the group while working in remote Aboriginal communities in the late 1980 ’s resulted in development of production prototype with industry partner Venco Products of the Solarflow – a solar-powered reverse osmosis desalination unit. The most recent work has seen the Solarflow become integrated with a locally designed and manufactured water pumping system which is also solar-powered. Most remote Aboriginal communities rely on groundwater for their potable water supplies, however, this is a source which is often highly mineralised and in excess of the recommended drinking water quality guidelines for long term human consumption. The proposed installation at a community in the central lands is able to demonstrate a self-contained, solar powered water supply system which provides 400 litres/day of high quality, desalinated drinking water, an amount of water sufficient for up to 40 people.
