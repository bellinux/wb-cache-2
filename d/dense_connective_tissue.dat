5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} {{is made of}} <b>dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> {{and this}} gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
25|$|The {{elephant}} is {{the only}} mammal known to have no pleural space. Rather, the parietal and visceral pleura are both composed of <b>dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> and joined to each other via loose connective tissue. This lack of a pleural space, along with an unusually thick diaphragm, {{are thought to be}} evolutionary adaptations allowing the elephant to remain underwater {{for long periods of time}} while breathing through its trunk which emerges as a snorkel.|$|E
25|$|Morphologically {{the breast}} is tear-shaped. The superﬁcial tissue layer (superficial fascia) is {{separated}} from the skin by 0.5–2.5cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The suspensory Cooper's ligaments are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple. The 2.0–4.5mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with <b>dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> that support the glands. Milk exits the breast through the nipple, which {{is surrounded by a}} pigmented area of skin called the areola. The size of the areola can vary widely among women. The areola contains modified sweat glands known as Montgomery's glands. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding. Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn's appetite.|$|E

500|$|The flukes (lobes of the tail) and {{dorsal fin}} are formed of <b>dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> {{and do not}} contain bone or muscle. The dorsal fin usually shows {{phenotypic}} variations that help discriminate among populations. The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The pectoral flippers (at {{the sides of the}} body) are for steering; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or [...] "hind legs", at the tail, {{about the size of a}} human's pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism.|$|E
500|$|The {{second type}} of {{vascular}} tissue is non-erectile. Although the clitoral body becomes engorged with blood upon sexual arousal, erecting the clitoral glans, some sources describe the clitoral glans and labia minora as composed of non-erectile tissue; this is especially {{the case for the}} glans. They state that the clitoral glans and labia minora have blood vessels that are dispersed within a fibrous matrix and have only a minimal amount of smooth muscle, or that the clitoral glans is [...] "a midline, densely neural, non-erectile structure". Other sources state that the glans is composed of erectile tissue and that erectile tissue is present within the labia minora; adipose tissue is absent in the labia minora, but the organ may be described as being made up of <b>dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue,</b> erectile tissue and elastic fibers.|$|E
2500|$|Bone {{tissue is}} a hard tissue, a type of <b>dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue.</b> [...] It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. [...] Bone tissue {{is made up of}} {{different}} types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.|$|E

5000|$|... "Ligament" [...] most {{commonly}} {{refers to a}} band of <b>dense</b> regular <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> bundles made of collagenous fibers, with bundles protected by <b>dense</b> irregular <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> sheaths. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form joints, while tendons connect bone to muscle. Some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations, or prevent certain movements altogether.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dense</b> <b>{{connective}}</b> <b>tissue,</b> {{also called}} dense fibrous tissue, {{is a type}} of connective tissue with fibers as its main matrix element. The fibers are mainly composed of type I collagen. Crowded between the collagen fibers are rows of fibroblasts, fiber-forming cells, that generate the fibers. <b>Dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> forms strong, rope-like structures such as tendons and ligaments. Tendons attach skeletal muscles to bones; ligaments connect bones to bones at joints. Ligaments are more stretchy and contain more elastic fibers than tendons. <b>Dense</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> also make up the lower layers of the skin (dermis), where it is arranged in sheets.|$|E
