40|$|International audienceCoupled to {{increasing}} consumer demand, food manufacturers have moved towards increased usage of approved natural colours. There {{is a legal}} requirement for governments to monitor the consumption of all food additives in the EU to ensure the ADIs are not exceeded, especially by young children. Validated analytical methods are needed to fulfil this requirement. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the available literature on methods of extraction for approved natural colours in food and drink. Available analytical methods for the determination of EU-permitted natural food colour additives in foods and beverages have been critically assessed for their fitness for purpose in terms of their the key extraction and analysis procedures, selectivity (range) and sensitivity, especially with regard to maximum permitted levels, and their applicability for use in surveillance and in an enforcement role. The advantages and disadvantages of available analytical methods for each of nine designated chemical classes (groups) of natural colours in different food and beverage matrices are given. Other important factors such as technical requirements, cost, transferability and applicability are given due consideration. Gaps in the knowledge and levels of validation are identified and recommendations made on further research to develop suitable methods. The nine designated natural colour classes covered are: 1. Curcumin (E 100), 2. Riboflavins (E 101 i-ii), 3. Cochineal (E 120), 4. Chlorophylls - including chlorophyllins and copper analogues (E 140 - 141), 5. Caramel Classes I - IV (E 150 a-d), 6.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect of stocking density on the biomass production, final weight, feed conversion and survival rate of Pseudoplatystoma spp. surubim reared in floating net cages under three initial stocking densities. Twelve floating net cages located in a 47 -ha reservoir were stocked with 35, 70 and 105 fish/m 3 averaging 50 g from April to August 1999. At the end of the experimental period (105 days), the final average weights of the treatments were 197. 4, 171. 15, and <b>161.</b> 45 <b>g,</b> respectively. The highest final mean weight was reached at the lowest initial density. No significant effects of initial stocking density were observed on survival (95. 97, 97. 80 and 96. 73 %, respectively) and feed conversion rates (1. 49; 1. 60 e 1. 56; respectively). The final biomass of 87. 93, 157. 67, and 220. 46 kg were affected by the initial stocking density. At higher storage densities, the individual weight gain decreased, but the final biomass increased significantly.

40|$|Background. - Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} the human cardiac sodium channel (SCN 5 A) {{have been associated}} with three distinct cardiac arrhythmia disorders: the long QT syndrome, the Brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease. Here we report the biophysical features of a novel sodium channel mutation, <b>E</b> <b>161</b> K, which we identified in individuals of two non-related families with symptoms of bradycardia. sinus node dysfunction, generalized conduction disease and Brugada syndrome, or combinations thereof. Methods and results. - Wild-type (WT) or <b>E</b> <b>161</b> K sodium channel alpha-subunit and beta-subunit were cotransfected into tsA 201 cells to study the functional consequences of mutant sodium channels. Characterization of whole-cell sodium current (IN.) using the whole cell patch-clamp technique revealed that the E 16 1 K mutation caused an almost threefold reduction in current density (P < 0. 001), and an 11. 9 mV positive shift of the voltage-dependence of activation (P < 0. 0001). The inactivation properties of mutant and WT sodium channels were similar. These results suggest an overall reduction of <b>E</b> <b>161</b> I-Na. Incorporation of the experimental findings into computational models demonstrate atrial and ventricular conduction slowing as well as a reduction in sinus rate by slowing of the diastolic depolarization rate and upstroke velocity of the sinus node action potential. This reduction in sinus rate was aggravated by application of acetylcholine, simulating the dominant vagal tone during night. Conclusion. - Our experimental and computational analysis of the <b>E</b> <b>161</b> K mutation suggests that a loss of sodium channel function is not only associated with Brugada syndrome and conduction disease, but may also cause sinus node dysfunction in carriers of this mutation.

40|$|The nuclear lamina is {{increasingly}} being appreciated for its epigenetic role in regulating gene expression. The nuclear lamina underlies the inner nuclear membrane and, in post mitotic cells, {{is composed of}} a latticework primarily formed by the intermediate filament protein, lamin A/C. Although not well defined, lamin-associated domains have been described, and these domains are determined by DNA sequence and chromatin conformation. Lamin-associated domains are positioned to mediate the interaction with the nuclear membrane, where they contribute to transcriptional regulation. Although lamin-associated domains are primarily considered to be repressive in nature, those nearer to nuclear pores may actually promote transcription. Mutations in LMNA, the gene encoding lamins A and C, are a relatively common cause of inherited cardiomyopathy. As substantial data supports a role for the lamina in its interaction with chromatin and gene regulation, we examined {{the role of a}} genetically disrupted lamina and the consequences thereof. A dominant LMNA mutation, <b>E</b> <b>161</b> K, that causes inherited cardiomyopathy was studied. Gene expression changes were profiled in a human cardiomyopathic <b>E</b> <b>161</b> K heart, and it was found that chromosome 13 had a high percentage of misexpressed genes.

These and other studies support a role for the nuclear membrane as an active regulator of gene expression and provide additional support that disrupting this regulation is a mechanism of human disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{identify}} molecular mechanisms underlying SCN 5 A-related sick sinus syndrome (SSS), a rare type of SSS, {{in parallel}} experiments we elucidated the electrophysiological properties and the cell surface localization of thirteen human Na v 1. 5 (hNa v 1. 5) mutant channels previously linked to this disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: Mutant hNav 1. 5 channels expressed by HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes were investigated by whole-cell patch clamp and two-microelectrode voltage clamp, respectively. HEK 293 cell surface biotinylation experiments quantified {{the fraction of}} correctly targeted channel proteins. Our data suggested three distinct mutant channel subtypes: Group 1 mutants (L 212 P, P 1298 L, DelF 1617, R 1632 H) gave peak current densities and cell surface targeting indistinguishable from wild-type hNav 1. 5. Loss-of-function of these mutants resulted from altered channel kinetics, including a negative shift of steady-state inactivation and a reduced voltage dependency of open-state inactivation. Group 2 mutants (<b>E</b> <b>161</b> K, T 220 I, D 1275 N) gave significantly reduced whole-cell currents due to impaired cell surface localization (D 1275 N), altered channel properties at unchanged cell surface localization (T 220 I), {{or a combination of}} both (<b>E</b> <b>161</b> K). Group 3 mutant channels were non-functional, due to an almost complete lack of protein at the plasma membrane (T 187 I, W 1421 X, K 1578 fs/ 52, R 1623 X) or a probable gating/permeation defect with normal surface localisation (R 878 C, G 1408 R) ...|$|R
40|$|The binding of {{phosphoenolpyruvate}} (PEP) to {{the single}} allosteric site on phosphofructokinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 11) from Bacillus stearothermophilus (BsPFK) diminishes {{the ability of the}} enzyme to bind the substrate fructose 6 -phosphate (Fru- 6 -P). Comparisons of crystal structures with either Fru- 6 -P or phosphoglycolate, an analog of PEP, bound have shown that Arg- 162 interacts with the negatively charged Fru- 6 -P. Upon the binding of phosphoglycolate, Arg- 162 is virtually replaced by Glu- 161, which introduces a potential coulombic repulsion between enzyme and substrate [Schirmer, T. & Evans, P. R. (1990) Nature (London) 343, 140 – 145]. It has previously been proposed that this structural transition explains the allosteric inhibition in BsPFK, and this explanation has appeared in textbooks to illustrate how an allosteric ligand can influence substrate binding at a distance. Site-directed mutagenesis has been employed to create three mutants of BsPFK that substitute an alanine residue for Glu- 161, Arg- 162, or both. The <b>E</b> <b>161</b> A mutation does not affect the inhibition of BsPFK by PEP at 25 °C, and while the R 162 A mutation decreases BsPFK's affinity for Fru- 6 -P by approximately 30 -fold, R 162 A diminishes the effectiveness of PEP inhibition by only 1 / 3. Combining <b>E</b> <b>161</b> A and R 162 A produces behavior comparable to R 162 A alone.

40|$|Biosynthesis of UDP-glucuronic acid by UDP-glucose 6 -dehydrogenase (UGDH) occurs {{through the}} four-electron {{oxidation}} of the UDP-glucose C 6 primary alcohol in two NAD(+) -dependent steps. The catalytic reaction of UGDH {{is thought to}} involve a Cys nucleophile that promotes formation of a thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate {{in the course of}} the first oxidation step. The thiohemiacetal undergoes further oxidation into a thioester, and hydrolysis of the thioester completes the catalytic cycle. Herein we present crystallographic and kinetic evidence for the human form of UGDH that clarifies participation of covalent catalysis in the enzymatic mechanism. Substitution of the putative catalytic base for water attack on the thioester (Glu(161)) by an incompetent analog (Gln(161)) gave a UGDH variant (<b>E</b> <b>161</b> Q) in which the hydrolysis step had become completely rate-limiting so that a thioester enzyme intermediate accumulated at steady state. By crystallizing <b>E</b> <b>161</b> Q in the presence of 5 mm UDP-glucose and 2 mm NAD(+), we succeeded in trapping a thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate and determined its structure at 2. 3 Å resolution. Cys(276) was covalently modified in the structure, establishing its role as catalytic nucleophile of the reaction. The thiohemiacetal reactive C 6 was in a position suitable to become further oxidized by hydride transfer to NAD(+). The proposed catalytic mechanism of human UGDH involves Lys(220) as general base for UDP-glucose alcohol oxidation and for oxyanion stabilization during formation and breakdown of the thiohemiacetal and thioester enzyme intermediates. Water coordinated to Asp(280) deprotonates Cys(276) to function as an aldehyde trap and also provides oxyanion stabilization.

Here we report the transformation of a nonaggregating Enterococcus faecalis strain with the SSP- 5 gene and show that the protein is expressed on the cell surface and confers an aggregation-positive phenotype. <b>E.</b> faecalis S <b>161</b> protoplasts were transformed with pAM 401 EB- 5, a shuttle vector containing the S. sanguis SSP- 5 gene, resulting in the isolation of <b>E.</b> faecalis S <b>161</b> EB- 5. Crude cell extracts from this transformant and from S. sanguis M 5 were analyzed by Western blotting. Extracts from S. sanguis M 5 possessed peptides of 190 and 205 kilodaltons that reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant SSP- 5 antigen. <b>E.</b> faecalis S <b>161</b> EB- 5 contained only the 190 -kilodalton immunoreactive protein, suggesting that the antigen may be processed differently in <b>E.</b> faecalis S <b>161</b> EB- 5.

We {{also point out that}} preliminary data on J/psi inclusive production taken by the PHENIX Collaboration in unpolarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC tends to favor the NRQCD factorization hypothesis, while it significantly overshoots the theoretical prediction of the color-singlet model at large values of transverse momentum.

For example, a terminal with only digits and a star and a square (see Recommendation <b>E.</b> <b>161)</b> may be able to achieve the same functions through lower-level procedures as a better equipped terminal with, for example, dedicated function buttons, in addition to its dial, where higher-level, more convenient procedures could be used. See Recommendation E. 184. Further study is required to determine whether or not a communication session which was put on hold becomes active as soon as the present communication session is ended by the user and, if so, whether this is the communication session which was put on hold first or last.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{reports the}} {{elaboration}} of water-resistant, antimicrobial, chitosan and paper-based materials as environmentally friendly food packaging materials. Two types of papers were coated with chitosan-palmitic acid emulsions or with a blend of chitosan and O,O'-dipalmitoylchitosan (DPCT). Micromorphology studies showed that inclusion of hydrophobic compounds into the chitosan matrix was enhanced by grafting them onto chitosan and that this led to their penetration of the paper's core. Compared to chitosan-coated papers, the coating of chitosan-palmitic emulsion kept vapor-barrier properties unchanged (239 and 170 g. m(- 2). d(- 1) versus 241 and <b>161</b> <b>g.</b> m(- 2). d(- 1)), while the coating of chitosan-DPCT emulsion dramatically deteriorated them (441 and 442 g. m(- 2). d(- 1)). However, contact angle measurements (110 - 120 degrees after 1 min) and penetration dynamics analysis showed that both strategies improved liquid-water resistance of the materials. Kit-test showed that all hydrophobized chitosan-coated papers kept good grease barrier properties (degree of resistance 6 - 8 / 12). Finally, all chitosan-coated materials exhibited over 98 % inhibition on Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes...|$|R
40|$|The {{attenuation}} {{potential of}} methane (CH(4)) and of selected {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) was compared in four types of compost materials using dynamic flow column experiments {{over a period of}} 255 d. Garden waste compost mixed with wood chips showed the highest steady-state CH(4) oxidation rate (<b>161</b> <b>g</b> m(- 2) d(- 1)), followed by a commercial compost product Supermuld (110 g m(- 2) d(- 1)). In the column containing the highest fraction of compost (compost/sand mixed in 1 : 1), CH(4) oxidation declined significantly during the period of operation, probably due to clogging by formation of exopolymeric substances. After 40 d of operation, CH(4) production was observed. All the VOCs tested were degraded. CFC- 11 (CCl(3) F) and HCFC- 21 (CCl(2) FH) were anaerobically degraded by reductive dechlorination, generating HCFC- 31 (CClFH(2)) and HFC- 41 (CFH(3)), which were both aerobically degraded in the oxic portion of the columns. Overall, the highest removal of VOCs was observed in the column containing the compost/wood chip mixture. This study demonstrates that biocovers consisting of compost materials have the potential to attenuate trace gas emissions from landfills...|$|R
50|$|The Xperia XZs' {{dimensions}} are also {{exactly the same}} as the previous flagship, 146 mm in height, with a width of 72 mm and a depth of 8.1 mm and still weighs approximately <b>161</b> <b>g</b> even with the new camera setup. The device sports a 5.2 in 1080p IPS LCD display with a pixel density of 424 ppi, featuring Sony's TRILUMINOS™ display and X-Reality for mobile technology. Unlike the Xperia XZ Premium, the Xperia XZs is powered by the same quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (MSM8996) chipset that came with the Xperia XZ, with 4 custom Kryo processors (2x 2.15 GHz and 2x 1.6 GHz), but is upgraded to 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM instead of the previous 3 GB and relies on the Adreno 530 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 32 GB for the single-SIM variant and 64 GB for the dual-SIM variant, both are LTE Cat. 9-enabled. It also has a microSD card expansion of up to 256 GB (in a hybrid slot for the dual-SIM variant).|$|R

40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} {{is the most}} frequent malignant tumor of the oral cavity and often arises from premalignant lesions. Traditional methods used by the pathologist are subjective and lack the sensitivity to predict accurately which precancers may progress with time. Therefore, {{it is important to}} search for markers that may identify progression of premalignant lesions. Microarray technology can be use with this aim. Here, we define the genetic expression profile of lingual dysplasia (DS) progression. By using cDNA microarray containing 19. 2 K clones and a baseline of 11 normal tissues, we compared 5 mild and 4 severe DS. We identified 270 genes differentially expressed in normal tissue vs. mild DS (i. <b>e.</b> <b>161</b> up- and 109 down-regulated) and 181 genes differentially expressed in mild vs. severe DS (i. e. 63 up- and 118 down-regulated). The described genes cover a broad range of functional activities: (a) anti-oxidative, (b) DNA-repair, (c) inflammatory response, (d) cell-adhesion/mobility, (e) extracellular matrix depolymerization, and (f) cell-cycle regulation. The data reported better define DS progression and can help in classifying premalignant lesions...|$|R
40|$|The alpha-decay chains {{originating}} from the pi s(1 / 2) and pi h(11 / 2) states in Au- 173 {{have been investigated}} following fusion-evaporation reactions. Four generations of alpha radioactivities have been correlated with Au- 173 (m) leading to a measurement of the alpha decay of Ta- 161 (m). It {{has been found that}} the known alpha decay of Ta- 161, which was previously associated with the decay of the ground state, is in fact the decay of an isomeric state. This work also reports on the first observation of prompt gamma rays feeding the ground state of Au- 173. This prompt gamma radiation was used to aid the study of the alpha-decay chain {{originating from}} the pi s(1 / 2) state in Au- 173. Three generations of alpha decays have been correlated with this state, leading to the observation of a previously unreported activity which is assigned as the decay of Re- 165 (g). This work also reports the excitation energy of an alpha-decaying isomer in Ta- 161 and the Q(alpha) value of the decay of Ta- <b>161</b> (<b>g).</b> DOI: 10. 1103 /PhysRevC. 86. 06431...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) is a {{group of}} behaviorally defined neuro developmental disabilities characterized by multiple genetic etiologies and a complex presentation. Several studies suggest the involvement of the serotonin system in the development of ASD, but only few have investigated serotonin receptors. We have performed a case-control and a family-based study with 9 polymorphisms mapped to two serotonin receptor genes (HTR 1 B and HTR 2 C) in 252 Brazilian male ASD patients of European ancestry. These analyses showed evidence of undertransmission of the HTR 1 B haplotypes containing alleles - <b>161</b> <b>G</b> and - 261 A at HTR 1 B gene to ASD (P= 0. 003), but no involvement of HTR 2 C to the predisposition to this disease. Considering the relatively low level of statistical significance and the power of our sample, further studies are required to confirm the association of these serotonin-related genes and ASD.
