40|$|The nuclear {{materials}} safeguards {{system of the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna consists of two parts: the verification of the material flow and inventory data reported by the operator of a nuclear plant; {{the establishment of a}} material balance {{at the end of an}} inventory period with the help of the operator's reported data, which means that the book inventory (initial physical inventory plus receipts minus shipments) is compared with the <b>ending</b> <b>physical</b> <b>inventory.</b> By definition it is necessary that the plant operator maintains a complete measurement system for all {{nuclear materials}} processed in the plant. In this paper, we consider an alternative inspection scheme which is based on material accountability too, but which does not make use of the data reported by the operator. Contrary to the IAEA safeguards system, the material balance in this system is closed only with the help of the data observed by the inspection team itself. Such a system could be important in situations where there is no reason for a plant operator to maintain a complicated measurement system, or where, for some reason, the records are not available. It is clear that if the inspection team cannot measure the data of all material batches processed in the plant under consideration (e. g. if the inspection budget or time is limited), then some prior information about the average material contents of the different batches as well as the batch-to-batch variation have to be used. Therefore, a Bayesian approach seems to be natural for the treatment of problems of this kind. On the other hand, this prior information will not be very detailed, and so we will use the principles of credibility theory where only the first two moments of the prior distribution have to be known. In this paper, we first consider only one class of material, and then R different classes (inputs, outputs, etc.) with the problem of material balance closure. Finally we discuss the problem of optimization of a given inspection effort. As the batch-to-batch variation of the true material contents within one class normally is much larger than the measurement variance, we will neglect the measurement errors here; they could easily be taken into account, if necessary...|$|E

In addition, it establishes a benchmark {{to prove that the}} inventory is accurately stated. The LANL's <b>Physical</b> <b>Inventory</b> Program for nuclear materials requires the performance of periodic <b>physical</b> <b>inventories</b> and special inventories of nuclear material. The Inventory Program also requires the reconciliation of inventory measurements with previously established nuclear material accountability values. This inventory program applies to all material balance areas (MBAs) and is designed in accordance with DOE order 474. 1, 'Nuclear Material Control and Accountability'. The program uses a graded approach for performing <b>physical</b> <b>inventories</b> with primary emphasis placed on Categories I and II quantities of special nuclear material. This paper describes the essential elements of the LANL <b>Physical</b> <b>Inventory</b> Program. In addition, the inter-dependency of the Inventory Program with respect to other LANL MC&A Programs is discussed.

40|$|Traditional {{materials}} accounting is focused {{exclusively on the}} material balance area (MBA), and involves periodically closing a material balance based on accountability measurements conducted during a <b>physical</b> <b>inventory.</b> In contrast, the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> for Los Alamos National Laboratory's near-real-time accounting system is established around processes and looks more like an item inventory. That is, the intent is not to measure material for accounting purposes, since materials have already been measured in {{the normal course of}} daily operations. A given unit process operates many times {{over the course of a}} material balance period. The product of a given unit process may move for processing within another unit process in the same MBA or may be transferred out of the MBA. Since few materials are unmeasured the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> for a near-real-time process area looks more like an item inventory. Thus, the intent of the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> is to locate the materials on the books and verify information about the materials contained in the books. Closing a materials balance for such an area is a matter of summing all the individual mass balances for the batches processed by all unit processes in the MBA. Additionally, performance parameters are established to measure the program's effectiveness. Program effectiveness for verifying the presence of nuclear material is required to be equal to or greater than a prescribed performance level, process measurements must be within established precision and accuracy values, <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> results meet or exceed performance requirements, and inventory differences are less than a target/goal quantity. This approach exceeds DOE established accounting and <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> program requirements. Hence, LANL is committed to this approach and to seeking opportunities for further improvement through integrated technologies.

40|$|Inventory record {{inaccuracy}} is {{a significant}} problem for retailers using automated inventory management systems. In this paper, we consider an intelligent inventory management tool that accounts for record inaccuracy using a Bayesian belief of the <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> level. We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> levels. We show that a probability distribution on <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate {{the use of this}} distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of "freezing," in which a <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular "zero balance walk" audit policy. retail execution, inventory control, record inaccuracy, inventory shrinkage, Bayes rule...|$|R

With high modularity (when components can be incorporated into products with almost no change) product development and production postponements are used, whereas with low modularity (when customization is required) - logistics and purchasing postponements.This is what exactly was lacking in the 20th century because you did not know whether <b>physical</b> <b>inventory,</b> semi-finished, or finished products would work best as it was uncertain due to fluctuating consumer demands.

50|$|From a {{financial}} accounting perspective, backflushing {{is a technique}} of the perpetual inventory system. Small businesses which have a rather modest variety of items in their inventory still use periodic inventory management. A periodic inventory system does not require day-to-day tracking of <b>physical</b> <b>inventory.</b> Purchases, cost of goods sold, and inventory on hand cannot be tracked {{until the end of}} the accounting time period when a <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> is performed and ending inventory is compared against the sum of beginning inventory and purchases. Cost of ending inventory can be calculated by using the LIFO or FIFO inventory accounting methods, or other less common methods. The end of the accounting period is considered usually the end of each month because otherwise some taxes like the VAT (value added tax) cannot be charged. The monthly stock-taking is the main disadvantage of the periodic inventory system. Another disadvantage is that it requires also monthly a reconciliation between the records of the management accounting and the financial accounting.|$|R
