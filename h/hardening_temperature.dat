This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of sucrose concentration, <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> and different cryopreservation methods on the survival rate of potato shoot tips after cryopreservation. Excised shoot tips of in vitro plantlets of potato cultivars, Atlantic and Superior were cryopreserved by vitrification, encapsulationvitrification and encapsulation-dehydration. Cryopreservation by vitrification method was used to determine the optimum concentration of sucrose and cold <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> during sub-culturing period to the donor plantlets. Nine-percent sucrose gave 46. 7 % survival in Atlantic and 40 % in Superior. The most optimum <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> for 50 % survival in Atlantic and 43. 3 % in Superior was 10 °C. In the case of comparative study of three different cryopreservation methods, the highest survival (52 %) as well as regeneration (46 %) were observed when the shoot tips were cryopreserved by encapsulation-vitrification method, and the lowest survival (36 %) and regeneration (28 %) from the vitrification.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the development of low-activation structural materials to be used in fusion reactors, martensitic Fe 9. 5 Cr alloys, called OPTIFER, have been conceived and meanwhile studied in further detail under a European long-term program. The alloy variants contain varying amounts of W, Ta, Ge and/or Ce as elements substituting the radiologically unfavorable alloying elements of Mo, Ni, Nb and Al. In three production series, thirteen different batches have been produced and analyzed so far. Up to now, the variant of 9. 5 Cr- 1 W+Mn, V, Ta has proved to be the most promising one. For radiological reasons, a W-free (+Ge) version is studied as an alternative. The behavior during transformation and heat treatment more or less corresponds to that of conventional martensitic 9 - 12 % Cr steels. Maximum hardness is achieved as of an austenitization temperature of 950 C. The mechanical properties are strongly dependent on the <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature.</b> Optimum tensile and creep strengths are reached at the reference <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> of 1075 C (+ 750 C annealed) with the notch impact toughness exceeding that of conventional steels.

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) is a corrosion phenomenon {{which continues to}} plague the power generating industry especially in low pressure (LP) steam turbine blades operating in the phase transition zone. An investigation has therefore been conducted to {{examine the effect of}} heat treatment condition on the microstructure, mechanical properties and SCC properties of one such LP turbine blade material, FV 520 B, used in the steam turbines of coal-fired power stations in South Africa. The three stage heat treatment cycle of the FV 520 B turbine blades consists of homogenisation at 1020 °C for 30 minutes, solution treatment at 790 °C for two hours and precipitation hardening at 545 °C for six hours. In this study, the precipitation <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied in the range 430 - 600 °C to investigate how this variation would affect the material and SCC properties. Hardness and tensile testing were performed to obtain mechanical properties while the investigative techniques used to characterise the microstructures were light microscopy, dilatometry, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Stress corrosion susceptibility for the different heat treatment conditions was quantified using U-bend specimens while crack growth rates and threshold stress intensities for SCC (KISCC) were measured using fatigue precracked wedge open loaded (WOL) specimens. Both SCC tests were conducted in a 3. 5 % NaCl environment maintained at 90 °C. XRD results revealed the presence of reverted austenite in the higher tempered specimens due to the precipitation <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> being close to the Ac 1 temperature for the material. The presence of reverted austenite was shown to adversely affect mechanical strength and hardness which decreased with increasing precipitation <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature.</b> Light and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) revealed the presence of Cr-rich precipitates along the prior austenite grain boundaries in all tested heat treatment conditions. The propensity, quantity and size of the Cr-rich precipitates increased as the specimen temper temperature increased. SCC susceptibility was shown to be dependent upon yield strength and decreased as precipitation <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> increased with specimens in the overaged condition showing no cracking after more than 5000 hours in the test environment. WOL testing only produced cracking in the three highest strength specimens after 2000 hours. Crack growth rates and threshold stress intensities were found to be dependent on yield strength and decreased with increasing precipitation <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature.</b> Analysis of fracture surfaces revealed crack propagation along prior austenite grain boundaries in all test heat treatment conditions indicating intergranular stress {{corrosion cracking}} (IGSCC) as the dominant cracking mechanism...|$|E

As in order to achieve a lower <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature</b> it is necessary to introduce an accelerator in the formulation, which in turn reduces the shelf-life. The accelerator is encapsulated in Zeolite and Nanosilica carriers. These encapsulations, named “NANOMODULES”, have a controlled release of accelerator in the Epoxy-Hardener matrix to increase the shelf life and a reduced <b>hardening</b> <b>temperature.</b> Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) is used to study the in-situ curing behavior of epoxy resins of DGEBA with a hardener of dicyandiamide (DICY), from the initial viscous state of the formulation to the solid state of cured polymer. Several isothermal measurements were done in the temperature range from 50 °C to 80 °C for the DGEBA-DICY benchmark system. PALS parameters seem to correlate very well with the curing mechanism in the samples. Gelation was observed as an increase in the intensity of ortho-positronium (o-Ps) and a sharp decrease in the lifetime. Change of (o-Ps) lifetime is used as a measure for the degree of curing. Applying the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov approach under reasonable assumptions, these experimentally observed changes could be characterized by determining the growth exponent ‘n’ and reaction constant ‘k’. It is possible to extrapolate the shelf life of one-component epoxy formulation at room temperature. Furthermore, for a selected series of formulations the effect of free accelerator on storage stability is studied in comparison to the accelerator encapsulated in micro and nano-sized Zeolite carrier. A temperature dependence of sub-nanometer level free volume studies on their cured composites indicate no real changes in the glass-transition temperature Tg. Similarly, PALS and JMAK analysis were performed on various one-component formulations, with varying concentrations of accelerator in micro and nano-sized Zeolite and Nanosilica based encapsulations.
