C. Tam), is a hemi-parasitic tree known for its fragrant wood. The essential oil is extracted from the root bark for the perfume industry and {{different parts of the}} tree have various medicinal uses. African sandalwood contains an array of phytochemicals such as dihydro-β-agarofuran polyesters, agarofuranases, polyesters, other sesquiterpenes and bisabolanes.

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>Sandalwood</b> plant (Osyris lanceolata) is a {{threatened}} shrub {{or a small}} hemi-parasitic tree endemic to East Africa and South African regions, which is being severely affected by uproot-ing for oil extraction, poor natural regeneration, phenological structures (dioecious), medicinal values, lack of sexual recruitment, habitat loss, anthropogenic and climate factors. It {{has been found that}} through application of in situ conservation of natural trees with respect to rapid human population growth, the available natural strands of valuable plants such as <b>African</b> <b>sandalwood</b> {{have not been able to}} meet the demands of the people in world specifically developing countries. However, advances in plant biotechnology provide new options for collection, multiplication and short- to long-term conservation of Osyris lanceolata species, using in vitro culture techniques. Different aspects of biotechnological applications can be extensively used to reduce the risk of ex-tinction of this valuable plant species and to improve the quality and quantity of essential oils produced by it. Therefore, tissue culture appears to be a promising approach for the propagatio...|$|R
