We measure the information leakage {{of the resulting}} timing side channel in schedulers serving a legitimate user and a malicious attacker, using a privacy metric defined as the Shannon equivocation of the user’s job density. We show that the commonly used first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduler provides no privacy as the attacker is able to to learn the user’s <b>job</b> <b>pattern</b> completely. Furthermore, we introduce an scheduling policy, accumulate-and-serve scheduler, which services jobs from the user and attacker in batches after buffering them.

In this paper we propose an entropy-based scheduling strategy for running the on-line parallel analysis as a service more reliable and efficient, and implement the proposed idea in Spark. Entropy, {{as a measure of}} the degree of disorder in a system, is an indicator of a system’s tendency to progress out of order and into a chaotic condition, and it can thus serve to measure a cloud resource’s reliability for jobs scheduling. The key idea of our Entropy Scheduler is to construct the new resource entropy metric and schedule tasks according to the resources ranking {{with the help of the}} new metric so as to provide QoS guarantees for on-line Spark analysis jobs.

Regional differentials in non-pecuniary assets slightly contribute to spatial sorting processes in Germany.

40|$|MapReduce is a {{parallel}} programming paradigm used for processing huge datasets on certain classes of distributable problems using a cluster. Budgetary constraints {{and the need}} for better usage of resources in a MapReduce cluster often make organizations rent or share hardware resources for their main data processing and analysis tasks.

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} {{female labour force}} participation rates in recent decades, the question arises {{as to whether the}} daughters of working mothers show different <b>job</b> <b>patterns</b> than the daughters of homemakers. Using data from a sample of 3, 169 adult women in the 2002 – 2004 wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study, we find that women who were raised by a working mother work about two more hours per week than those raised by a homemaking mother. The likelihood that women are currently in the labour market is not affected by their mother’s past labour force participation. Women’s own educational achievement and the presence of children younger than 12 are the strongest determinants of their participation and work hours. Our findings add to the growing evidence that parental behaviours during childhood have long-reaching consequences for children’s behaviours, also in the realm of paid work. This provides a useful explanation for the persisting gender gap in work hours across Europe, in addition to the conventional explanations of education, occupational history and family formation. ...|$|R

Despite the years of research that acknowledges the critical role social capital plays in determining job search outcomes, little to no research has been done to specifically understand the different ways in which graduates utilize their social capital (family, friends and acquaintances) to look for work. Human capital theory posits that education is the greatest determinant of employment in a labour market system that that awards educational credentials with occupational attainment.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, many grid {{applications}} are developed as job flows that {{are composed of}} multiple jobs. The execution of job flows requires {{the support of a}} job flow manager and a job scheduler. Due to the long running nature of job flows, the support for fault tolerance and recovery policies is especially important. This support is inherently complicated due to the sequencing and dependency of jobs within a flow, and the required coordination between workflow engines and job schedulers. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a job flow manager that supports fault tolerance. First, we identify and label <b>job</b> flow <b>patterns</b> within a <b>job</b> flow during deployment time. Next, at runtime, we introduce a proxy that intercepts and resolves faults using <b>job</b> flow <b>patterns</b> and their corresponding fault-recovery policies. Our design has the advantages of separation of the job flow and fault handling logic, requiring no manipulation at the modeling time, and providing flexibility with respect to fault resolution at runtime. We validate our design with a prototypical implementation based on the ActiveBPEL workflow engine and GridWay Metascheduler, and Montage application as the case study. ...|$|R
