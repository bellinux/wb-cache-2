50|$|An {{induction}} {{in a play}} is an <b>explanatory</b> scene, <b>summary</b> {{or other}} text that stands outside and apart from the main action {{with the intent to}} comment on it, moralize about it {{or in the case of}} dumb show to summarize the plot or underscore what is afoot. Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the Renaissance period, including those of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in Hamlet and the address to the audience by Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Another example, in The Spanish Tragedy by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} Brazilian political history, {{from the}} military-political coup in 1964 through Fernando Henrique Cardoso's second presidential term. Written {{in the form}} of an <b>explanatory</b> <b>summary,</b> three themes are joined in a narrative on the transition from a military dictatorship to a liberal democratic regime: the military, the political and the bureaucratic. We seek to establish causal inferences linking content, methods and the reasons for and meaning of political change beginning in 1974 with the quality of the democratic regime as it emerged during the 1990 s. Our explanation is premised on the need to analyze two different but interconnected spaces of the political: transformation in the institutional systems of the State apparatus and the evolution of the broader political scenario. We conclude that neo-liberal economic reforms not only dispensed with true political reform able to increase representation and with reform of the State in ways that would favor participation. Neo-liberal reforms also continued to be premised on authoritarian arrangements of governing processes inherited from the previous political period...|$|E

The 671 generated anchors were categorized as direct, indirect, symbolic, temporal, spatial, and challenging. According to our results, students with legislative thinking style tendencies created the largest number of anchors but rarely used them for subsequent search tasks; executive-style students tended to make symbolic and temporal spatial geographic references and regularly used the teacher-created anchors and the anchors created by judicial-style students were evenly distributed across all categories.

40|$|Executive <b>Summary</b> <b>Explanatory</b> Memoranda now {{accompany}} every government Bill {{introduced into}} the Parliament, but this {{has not always been}} the case. From 1901 to 1982, there was no easy way of knowing if an Explanatory Memorandum had been produced for a particular Bill. An online Index to Explanatory Memoranda (the Index), produced by the Parliamentary Library, now makes it possible for legislators and researchers to know if a Memorandum was produced. In {{the first half of the}} 20 th century, Memoranda more commonly took the form of Comparative Memoranda, that is, documents that set out the text of a principal Act as it would appear if the current Bill was passed and identified the additions or deletions made by the Bill to that Act. From the 1950 s, Explanatory Memoranda in the modern sense have been more common. These are documents that assist members of Parliament, officials and the public to understand the objectives and detailed operation of the clauses of a Bill. Explanatory Statements are similar to Explanatory Memoranda, but the term is used for documents that explain the purpose of Commonwealth Regulations rather than Bills. These have been supplied by government departments to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee since 1932. However, there is presently no easy way to obtain copies of Explanatory Statements that pre-date 1991.

This motivated the proposal {{of a new}} track at CLEF INEX lab of Tweet Contextualization. The objective of this task was to help a user to understand a tweet by providing him with a short <b>explanatory</b> <b>summary</b> (500 words). This summary should be built automatically using resources like Wikipedia and generated by extracting relevant passages and aggregating them into a coherent summary. Running for four years, {{results show that the}} best systems combine NLP techniques with more traditional methods. More precisely the best performing systems combine passage retrieval, sentence segmentation and scoring, named entity recognition, text part-of-speech (POS) analysis, anaphora detection, diversity content measure as well as sentence reordering. This paper provides a full summary report on the four-year long task. While yearly overviews focused on system results, in this paper we provide a detailed report on the approaches proposed by the participants and which can be considered as {{the state of the art}} for this task. As an important result from the 4 years competition, we also describe the open access resources that have been built and collected.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					There is a {{pressing}} need for {{greater attention to}} patient-centered health behavior and psychosocial issues in primary care, and for practical tools, study designs and results of clinical and policy relevance. Our goal is to design a scientifically rigorous and valid pragmatic trial to test whether primary care practices can systematically implement the collection of patient-reported information and provide patients needed advice, goal setting, and counseling in response. 				 				 					 						Methods 					This manuscript reports on the iterative design of the My Own Health Report (MOHR) study, a cluster randomized delayed intervention trial. Nine pairs of diverse primary care practices will be randomized to early or delayed intervention four months later. The intervention consists of fielding the MOHR assessment &# 8211; addresses 10 domains of health behaviors and psychosocial issues &# 8211; and subsequent provision of needed counseling and support for patients presenting for wellness or chronic care. As a pragmatic participatory trial, stakeholder groups including practice partners and patients have been engaged throughout the study design to account for local resources and characteristics. Participatory tasks include identifying MOHR assessment content, refining the study design, providing input on outcomes measures, and designing the implementation workflow. Study outcomes include the intervention reach (percent of patients offered and completing the MOHR assessment), effectiveness (patients reporting being asked about topics, setting change goals, and receiving assistance in early versus delayed intervention practices), contextual factors influencing outcomes, and intervention costs. 				 				 					 						Discussion 					The MOHR study shows how a participatory design {{can be used to}} promote the consistent collection and use of patient-reported health behavior and psychosocial assessments in a broad range of primary care settings. While pragmatic in nature, the study design will allow valid comparisons to answer the posed research question, and findings will be broadly generalizable to a range of primary care settings. Per the pragmatic <b>explanatory</b> continuum indicator <b>summary</b> (PRECIS) framework, the study design is substantially more pragmatic than other published trials. The methods and findings should be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers attempting to make healthcare more patient-centered and relevant.

40|$|Background:Â If {{you want}} to know which of two or more {{healthcare}} interventions is most effective, the randomised controlled trial is the design of choice. Randomisation, however, does not itself promote the applicability of the results to situations other than the one in which the trial was done. A tool published in 2009, PRECIS (PRagmatic <b>Explanatory</b> Continuum Indicator <b>Summaries)</b> aimed to help trialists design trials that produced results matched to the aim of the trial, be that supporting clinical decision-making, or increasing knowledge of how an intervention works. Though generally positive, groups evaluating the tool have also found weaknesses, mainly that its inter-rater reliability is not clear, that it needs a scoring system and that some new domains might be needed. The aim of the study is to: Produce an improved and validated version of the PRECIS tool. Use this tool to compare the internal validity of, and effect estimates from, a set of explanatory and pragmatic trials matched by intervention. Â  Methods: The study has four phases. Phase 1 involves brainstorming and a two-round Delphi survey of authors who cited PRECIS. In Phase 2, the Delphi results will then be discussed and alternative versions of PRECIS- 2 developed and user-tested by experienced trialists. Phase 3 will evaluate the validity and reliability of the most promising PRECIS- 2 candidate using a sample of 15 to 20 trials rated by 15 international trialists. We will assess inter-rater reliability, and ratersâ€™ subjective global ratings of pragmatism compared to PRECIS- 2 to assess convergent and face validity. Phase 4, to determine if pragmatic trials sacrifice internal validity in order to achieve applicability, will compare the internal validity and effect estimates of matched explanatory and pragmatic trials of the same intervention, condition and participants. Effect sizes for the trials will then be compared in a meta-regression. The Cochrane Risk of Bias scores will be compared with the PRECIS- 2 scores of pragmatism. Â  Discussion: We have concrete suggestions for improving PRECIS and a growing list of enthusiastic individuals interested in contributing to this work. By early 2014 we expect to have a validated PRECIS- 2...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Increased {{variability}} of rainfall and flow from climate change {{has the potential}} to stress existing transboundary water sharing agreements and make meeting the needs of all riparians difficult. Water treaties have been theorized as valuable tools for mitigating conflict in times of climate stress, but the relationship between the design of treaties and their impact has not been explored in depth. In this study, a literature review extracts core concepts commonly used to explain the success of treaties in managing hydrologic stress. These are summarized as seven treaty mechanisms categories (specificity, uncertainty management, enforcement, communications, flexibility, integrativeness, and scale) and are hypothesized as important for shaping the institutional resiliency of a treaty. While recognizing that there is significant variability within basins and treaties, this project uses a comprehensive, quantitative approach with multiple basins (n= 52) and treaties (n= 146), to empirically examine the effectiveness of the seven treaty mechanisms for deterring conflict and complaints that occur due to hydrologic stress. Contrary to expectations, the most robust treaties with more mechanisms have a higher instance of both climate and general conflict. Coefficients obtained from regression analysis indicate that an increase in flexibility, scale, and enforcement within a treaty are an indicator of less conflict or complaints and the negative coefficients for communications, specificity, and integrativeness tend to indicate more conflict. The general mechanism results are used to evaluate specific treaties and their capability to manage projected changes in climate in five case study basins: the Nile, Jordan, Tigris/Euphrates, Indus, and Helmand. The case studies illustrate the difficulties in pinpointing the importance and impact of each mechanism, and the overall treaty design, on water relations. Treaty mechanisms certainly {{play an important role in}} de-escalating tensions when stresses occurred within each basin. However, conflict de-escalation is not a direct cause and effect relationship between the capabilities of the water institutions and the amount of stress to the system. Instead, there is a complex relationship between change to the system and management efforts that involves a series of feedback loops and influence from non-water related sectors. Analysis of the seven mechanisms and the five case studies provides several <b>summary</b> <b>explanatory</b> concepts that include: treaty design and mechanisms exert an influence not just on the management capability (institutional resilience) aspect of relations, but also help to shape the political context of the problem; complaints are not necessarily an indicator of decreased institutional resiliency, weak, or ill-designed treaties, but in some cases illustrate that a treaty is functioning properly; and ambient poor relations are important for shaping many complaints. What is better understood through this research is how treaty design has a relevant and important role in shaping basin management so that nations may better achieve their goals in a changing climate...|$|R
