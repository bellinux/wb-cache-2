5|$|Several radars {{were added}} during the war. A Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted {{on top of}} the HACS {{director}} and a Type 271/73 surface search radar was installed abaft the two-pounder guns on the <b>forecastle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the <b>forecastle</b> deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the <b>forecastle.</b>|$|E

In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the <b>forecastle</b> deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the <b>forecastle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{class was}} {{designed}} to be 16-gun ship sloops with quarterdecks and <b>forecastles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Spanish built Vencejo as a quarterdecked and <b>forecastled</b> brig, {{possibly}} around 1797, {{and probably}} in Port Mahon.|$|R
60|$|The <b>forecastles</b> and cabin {{were first}} searched closely. Several of the sailors then descended into the hold. Two {{lanterns}} were handed down to them.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the <b>forecastle</b> and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the <b>forecastle</b> and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining <b>forecastle</b> guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Z38 {{was fitted}} with a FuMO 21 radar on her bridge, and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials were placed around the {{searchlight}} platform on her foremast. She had a degaussing coil around her <b>forecastle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Calypso {{was built}} to the same {{technical}} drawings as the five other Echo-class ships: , , , , and [...] The class {{was designed to be}} 16-gun ship sloops with quarterdecks and <b>forecastles.</b>|$|R
60|$|Wooden whales, or whales cut {{in profile}} {{out of the}} small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood, are {{frequently}} met with in the <b>forecastles</b> of American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The Khasan {{class had}} small <b>forecastles</b> {{allowing}} for limited high seas capabilities along the Strait of Tartary and the Amur River Basin. The flat bottom hull and bows {{of the ships}} were stiffened, giving the monitors icebreaking capabilities.|$|R
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865. Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the <b>forecastle</b> to the poop, above the tops of the turrets, and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore-and-aft rig. The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet. She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship. In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and <b>forecastle,</b> masts and deck fitting to convert her to a harbour defence monitor with all-around fire, but this was deemed too expensive and the project was abandoned in 1878. At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts. The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick-firing guns in 1890. Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for £736. She sank while under tow to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|During her Royal Navy {{service as}} HMS President, she was {{initially}} rated at 50 guns, {{although she was}} at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the <b>forecastle.</b> In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{was one of}} {{two large}} {{carriers}} approved for construction under the 1931–32 Supplementary Program. Originally designed as the sister ship of Sōryū, her design was enlarged and modified in light of the Tomozuru and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934–35 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and structurally weak. Her <b>forecastle</b> was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.|$|E
60|$|The {{cause of}} this accident, which came near being the death of all on board, was nothing but the {{drowsiness}} of the look-out men on the <b>forecastles</b> of both ships. The sailor who had the look-out on our vessel was terribly reprimanded by the mate.|$|R
60|$|Ned {{went first}} {{on to the}} stern, {{and then to the}} bow. He could hear the voices of men talking and singing in the <b>forecastles,</b> but could hear no {{movement}} on the deck of either ship. He went down and reported to his father.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} 5"/38cal type installed. It {{was put on the}} s in 1934. Some of these mounts placed on ship's <b>forecastles</b> were {{partially}} enclosed to protect the crew against bow spray, but they were still considered an open mount. Since these mounts did not have Upper Handling Rooms, they could be installed on ships without extensive reconstruction. For that reason, they were frequently used on armed merchant ships.|$|R
5|$|President and Endymion {{continued}} to England, arriving at Spithead on 28March. President was commissioned into the Royal Navy {{under the name}} HMS President. Her initial rating was set at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder guns on the <b>forecastle.</b> In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern. Two hangars were built into the after end of the <b>forecastle</b> deck to house {{two of them and}} cranes were provided at the forward end of the quarterdeck to hoist them out of the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{boat was}} {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division (escadrille) of the Light Squadron of submarines on 16 January and she joined them at Calais on 11 February. Mariotte visited Brest on 20 February and was inspected by Rear Admiral Charles Eugène Favereau. During the inspection the oil-fired galley stove in the <b>forecastle</b> exploded, lightly burning two sailors. The boat was in Calais for the visit of King Christian X of Denmark later in the year.|$|E
5000|$|Three Type 072 class landing {{ships were}} {{converted}} by Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding to ammunition ships which entered service in 1992, and received NATO reporting name as the Yantai class. In {{comparison to the}} original Type 072 class landing ship, these Yantai class ammunition ships have shorter <b>forecastles</b> and, blunter bow-form, but lack bow-doors. Cranes are installed fore and aft, tending two holds forward of the bridge superstructure and one aft. Specification: ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{this respect}} the captain was mistaken. The Spaniards were both fast vessels; and {{although}} the Swan kept her distance, those on board presently saw that she gained nothing. The shot continued to fall around them, but the Spaniards worked their guns slowly. The pieces on their <b>forecastles</b> were light ones, and though two or three shot passed through the sails of the Swan, they did but little damage.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{displacing}} around 2000 {{tons and}} carrying a crew of 750, the second rates by {{the second half of}} the 18th century carried 32-pounder guns on the gun deck, with 18-pounders instead of 24-pounders on the middle deck, and 12-pounders on the upper deck (rather than 18- or 24-pounders on first rates), although there were exceptions to this. Both first and second rates carried lighter guns (and, after 1780, carronades) on their <b>forecastles</b> and quarterdecks.|$|R
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the <b>forecastle</b> with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the <b>forecastle.</b> Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him to the deck. Before the sailor could finish Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the <b>forecastle,</b> killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was bound up by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeakes, but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon, and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so.|$|E
5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the <b>forecastle,</b> being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
60|$|Presently tall {{columns of}} steam {{burst from the}} 'scape-pipes of both steamers, two guns boom a good-bye, two red-shirted heroes mounted on {{capstans}} wave their small flags above the massed crews on the <b>forecastles,</b> two plaintive solos linger on the air a few waiting seconds, two mighty choruses burst forth--and here they come! Brass bands bray Hail Columbia, huzza after huzza thunders from the shores, and the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind.|$|R
5000|$|Both British and American frigates could (and usually did) {{additionally}} carry smaller carriage-mounted guns {{on their}} quarter decks and <b>forecastles</b> (the superstructures above the upper deck). Technically, rated ships {{with fewer than}} 28 guns could not be classed as frigates but as [...] "post ships"; however, in common parlance most post ships were often described as [...] "frigates", the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked ships that were too small {{to stand in the}} line of battle.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the rated number of carriage-mounted guns (which included the heaviest calibre available mounted on their lower decks, with smaller guns on the decks above), first rates also carried a number of anti-personnel guns, initially swivel-mounted weapons. From {{the invention of the}} slide-mounted carronade in the later 1770s, first rates (like other warships), could mount a number of these weapons on their quarterdecks and <b>forecastles</b> to augment their short-range firepower, but they {{were not included in the}} ship's rating until 1817 except where they replaced carriage-mounted guns.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the <b>forecastle</b> for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length <b>forecastle</b> deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, Maryland {{patrolled the}} {{southern}} approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a kamikaze aircraft surprised and struck Maryland. The aircraft crashed into Maryland between Turrets No. 1 and 2, piercing the <b>forecastle,</b> main, and armored decks and blowing {{a hole in}} the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the centuries}} the castle has {{received}} extensive rebuilding and expansion three times. The different architectural styles {{from the different}} centuries (14th, 17th and 18th) are easy to separate from each other. The complex {{is surrounded by a}} moat and has four wings situated around a rectangular courtyard. The main building is reachable over a bridge. The main building has two identical square towers with union-tops, flanking the entrance, and two taller half-separate corner towers of irregular shape at the backside. The <b>forecastles</b> are both U-formed and enclose two large inner courts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} it was so early. I first {{got in the way of}} it playing for tobacco--in <b>forecastles</b> of ships, you know--common sailor games. We used to spend whole watches below at it, round a chest, under a slush lamp. We would hardly spare the time to get a bite of salt horse--neither eat nor sleep. We could hardly stand when the watches were mustered on deck. Talk of gambling!" [...] He dropped the {{reminiscent}} tone to add the information, [...] "I was bred to the sea from a boy, you know." ...|$|R
50|$|On the 34th day, Moshulu {{crosses the}} Equator and, {{along with a}} bottle of Akvavit from the captain, the new crewmen undergo the {{initiation}} ceremony - their heads are covered in tar and red lead. It is at this stage that Newby almost kills himself by not attaching his bosun's chair correctly. He also has to undertake horrific jobs like cleaning the heads (the lavatories) and doing backstern—washing up for the 20 occupants of the three <b>forecastles.</b> Tension rises as weather conditions worsen, and Newby finally fights Hermansonn, whom Newby is able to smash after ten minutes.|$|R
