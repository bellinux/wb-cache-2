The {{initiative}} became known for its Stamp Plan, a philatelic programme that raised funds through United Nations member countries, as well as the support of the Universal Postal Union. At the time, the UNHCR's resources were primarily focused on supporting refugees crossing from Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{powerful}} lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged CharlesII of Naples {{to send his}} grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary {{in order to become}} king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the need}} to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could not afford to use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Nasib hosted Faisal at his Ghouta {{country house}} and invited him join al-Fatat, which he {{reportedly}} agreed to. At the same time, al-Bakri organized {{a meeting between}} him, some members of al-Fatat, and the Druze chiefs of the Hauran, Hussein and Sultan al-Atrash {{with the intention of}} gaining Druze support for the planned Arab rebellion against the Ottomans (the Druze had launched several uprisings against the Ottomans prior). The meeting concluded with the Druze offering Faisal and the nationalists their backing, though short of any military support. The meeting was {{the first of its kind}} between the Hashemites and the Druze, and afterward Faisal appointed al-Bakri to be his personal secretary and his <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Druze, a post he would serve until 1920.|$|E
5|$|Isa's {{early life}} is obscure. He {{was a member}} of the Shayban tribe from the Jazira, but {{otherwise}} not even the exact name of his father is known, it being variously given as al-Shaykh, Ahmad or Abd al-Razzak. Isa first appears in 848, in the ranks of the Abbasid army under Bugha al-Sharabi that was sent against the rebel Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith in his stronghold of Marand. Muhammad and most of his followers belonged to the Rabi'a tribal group, the same that the Shayban were part of. Consequently Bugha employed Isa as an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rebels, and Isa managed to convince several among them to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth's special friends by PhilipII's <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English court a {{week before}} Queen Mary's death. On 18November 1558, the morning after Elizabeth's accession, Dudley {{witnessed}} the surrender of the Great Seal to her at Hatfield. He became Master of the Horse on the same day. This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign. It suited him, as he was an excellent horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation, horse breeding, and the supply of horses for all occasions. Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing {{a large part of}} the Queen's coronation festivities.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be the reason was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E
5|$|By 1919, {{the ship}} had had all of her 7-inch guns and eight of the 3-inch guns removed, {{and a pair of}} 3-inch {{anti-aircraft}} guns had been installed. On 22 June 1919, the ship went into drydock in Philadelphia for an overhaul. A year later, on 5 June 1920, she began a training cruise for midshipmen to the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal. The cruise took the ship to Hawaii and several cities on the western coast of the United States. She was back in Philadelphia by 11 September. From 18 October to 12 January 1921, New Hampshire served as the flagship for a mission to Haiti. On 25 January she crossed the Atlantic to Europe for the final time to carry the remains of August Ekengren, the Swedish <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. She arrived in Stockholm on 14 February; on the return voyage, she also stopped in Kiel, Germany, and Gravesend, United Kingdom. The ship reached Philadelphia on 24 March, where she was decommissioned on 21 May. According to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, New Hampshire was sold on 1 November 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Calvinism gained many {{followers}} {{in the mid}} 16th century {{among both}} the szlachta and the magnates, especially in Lesser Poland and Lithuania. The Calvinists, who led by Jan Łaski were working on unification of the Protestant churches, proposed {{the establishment of a}} Polish national church, under which all Christian denominations, including Eastern Orthodox (very numerous in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ukraine), would be united. After 1555 Sigismund II, who accepted their ideas, sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pope, but the papacy rejected the various Calvinist postulates. Łaski and several other Calvinist scholars published in 1563 the Bible of Brest, a complete Polish Bible translation from the original languages, an undertaking financed by Mikołaj Radziwiłł the Black. After 1563–1565 (the abolishment of state enforcement of the Church jurisdiction), full religious tolerance became the norm. The Polish Catholic Church emerged from this critical period weakened but not badly damaged (the bulk of the Church property was preserved), which facilitated the later success of Counter-Reformation.|$|E

5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{was born}} on September 2, 1838, in Honolulu, {{on the island of}} Oʻahu. While her natural parents were Analea Keohokālole and Caesar Kapaʻakea, she was hānai (informally adopted) at birth by Abner Pākī and Laura Kōnia and raised with their {{daughter}} Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Baptized as a Christian and educated at the Royal School, she and her siblings and cousins were proclaimed eligible for the throne by King Kamehameha III. She was married to American-born John Owen Dominis, who later became the Governor of Oʻahu. The couple had no biological children but adopted several. After the accession of her brother David Kalākaua to the throne in 1874, she and her siblings were given Western style titles of Prince and Princess. In 1877, after her younger brother Leleiohoku II's death, she was proclaimed as heir apparent to the throne. During the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, she represented her brother as an official <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{of the two}} men {{was particularly}} threatening to the emperor, as it took control over Cappadocia and threatened to cut off his rear and leave him stranded between two enemies. Indeed, the conspirators are said to have been in contact with George I for that purpose. Basil first withdrew to the safety of the fortress of Mazdat, and according to John Skylitzes sent an <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rebel leaders aiming to sow distrust between them, while according to Yahya the emperor appointed as the new governor of the Anatolic Theme Theophylact Dalassenos and sent him to suppress the revolt. Whether the envoy accomplished his task is unknown, but on 15 August 1022, Xiphias arranged a meeting with Phokas, where the latter was murdered by one of Xiphias' servants. Armenian sources however report, rather dubiously, that Phokas was killed by the former king of Vaspurakan, Senekerim-Hovhannes, or his son David, or one of their followers. The severed head was sent to Basil, who mounted it on a stake and put it on public display at Mazdat.|$|E
5|$|Always in {{the thick}} of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E

5|$|Taizu also {{displayed}} {{a strong interest}} in science and technology. He employed the Imperial Workshop to support such projects as Zhang Sixun's hydraulic-powered armillary sphere (for astronomical observation and time-keeping) that used liquid mercury instead of water (because liquid mercury would not freeze during winter). Emperor Taizu was also quite open-minded in his affairs, especially with those perceived as foreigners: he appointed the Arab Muslim Ma Yize (910–1005) as the chief astronomer of the Song court. For receiving envoys from the Korean kingdom of Goryeo alone, the Song court had roughly 1,500 volumes written about the nuanced rules, regulations, and guidelines for their reception. The Song also sent envoys abroad, such as Wang Yande (939–1006), who was sent as an official <b>envoy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Uyghur-Turkic city of Gaochang in 981, then under Kara-Khanid control. From the 2nd century onwards, ancient Chinese histories even record that embassies of the Roman Empire ("Daqin") and Byzantine Empire ("Fu lin") arrived in China. As recorded in the History of Song and Wenxian Tongkao, the last known arrival of Byzantine envoys came in 1081, apparently sent by Michael VII Doukas to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song. However, the History of Yuan records that a Byzantine man served as an astronomer and physician at the court of Kublai Khan during the subsequent Yuan dynasty, and in 1371 the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty sent an alleged Byzantine merchant (who was likely Nicolaus de Bentra, Archbishop of Khanbaliq) to inform the Byzantine ruler of the founding of the new dynasty.|$|E
