One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E

25|$|While {{bringing}} {{wealth to}} a few select French traders and the French regime, the fur trade also brought profound changes to the indigenous groups living along the St. Lawrence. European wares, such as iron axe heads, brass kettles, cloth, and firearms were bought with beaver pelts and other furs. The widespread practice of trading furs for rum and whiskey led to problems associated with <b>inebriation</b> and alcohol abuse. The subsequent destruction of beaver populations along the St. Lawrence heightened the fierce competition between the Iroquois and Huron {{for access to the}} rich fur-bearing lands of the Canadian Shield. The competition for hunting is believed to have contributed to the earlier destruction of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the valley by 1600, likely by the Iroquois Mohawk tribe, who were located closest to them, were more powerful than the Huron, and had the most to gain by controlling this part of the valley.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, Almodovar included the track on his list of 10 Songs to Ease You Into EDM and said that the [...] "soft bass and beautiful lyrics make it an appropriate introduction to the genre". Additionally, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy ranked it at number 14 on his list of the best singles of 2014, and Reed Fischer of Rolling Stone described it as a [...] "sadness vs. <b>inebriation</b> tug-of-war".

500|$|The {{standard}} of Rutherford's accommodation {{and his personal}} conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of [...] "luxurious" [...] and [...] "expensive" [...] residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), {{as well as two}} Cadillacs and alleged that {{on more than one occasion}} he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from [...] "drink to drink"'. In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing [...] "the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren." [...] Moyle also accused Rutherford of [...] "unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language" [...] and condemned his allowing the [...] "glorification of alcohol" [...] at Bethel. Penton notes that Moyle was a [...] "teetotaller" [...] and [...] "puritanical", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were [...] "notorious" [...] and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to <b>inebriation.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1943, after {{a memorable}} {{role as a}} nightclub hatcheck {{attendant}} who becomes King Louis XV of France in a dream opposite Lucille Ball and Gene Kelly in Roy Del Ruth's Du Barry Was a Lady, Skelton starred as Joseph Rivington Reynolds, a hotel valet besotted with Broadway starlet Constance Shaw (Powell) in Vincente Minnelli's romantic musical comedy, I Dood It. The film was largely a remake of Buster Keaton's Spite Marriage; Keaton, who had become a comedy consultant to MGM after his film career had diminished, began coaching Skelton on set during the filming. Keaton worked in this capacity on several of Skelton's films, and his 1926 film The General was also later rewritten to become Skelton's A Southern Yankee (1948), under directors S. Sylvan Simon and Edward Sedgwick. Keaton was convinced enough of Skelton's comedic talent that he approached MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer with a request to create a small company within MGM for himself and Skelton, where the two could work on film projects. [...] Keaton offered to forgo his salary if the films made by the company were not box office hits; Mayer chose to decline the request. In 1944, Skelton starred opposite Esther Williams in George Sidney's musical comedy Bathing Beauty, playing a songwriter with romantic difficulties. He next had a relatively minor role as a [...] "TV announcer who, {{in the course of}} demonstrating a brand of gin, progresses from mild <b>inebriation</b> through messy drunkenness to full-blown stupor" [...] in the [...] "When Television Comes" [...] segment of Ziegfeld Follies, which featured William Powell and Judy Garland in the main roles.

2500|$|An {{elementary}} {{concept of}} [...] "sin" [...] regards such acts and elements of Earthly living that one cannot take with them into transcendental living.

2500|$|One {{biography}} of Orwell {{accused him of}} having had an authoritarian streak. In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while [...] "fooling around" [...] with his friends, had [...] "accidentally bumped into him" [...] at a station, resulting in Orwell falling [...] "heavily" [...] down some stairs.

Vianu's generation colleague George Călinescu defined Pantazi Ghica as [...] "untalented" [...] (although he acknowledged his [...] "vast literary culture"), while Ştefan Cazimir likened his writings for the stage to what he believed was Ion Luca Caragiale's worst play, the melodrama O soacră. Călinescu referred to Marele vistier Cândescu as featuring [...] "annoying neologisms" [...] and [...] "the lack of any intuition, no matter how modest, for historical color." [...] Two exceptions among commentators were Gheorghe Adamescu, who valued several of Ghica's works (including his 1850 piece about Vasile Cârlova), and Ştefan Sihleanu, who credited Ghica with having single-handedly introduced Alessandro Manzoni's type of historical novels to local literature, in their adapted novella form.|$|E
2500|$|When {{war broke}} out, Manning was keen to enlist, {{possibly}} {{to escape from}} a stifling environment and to widen his horizons. [...] A man with his fragile constitution and unhealthy lifestyle {{was not going to}} be an attractive proposition for the military authorities, but in October 1915 after several attempts, his persistence paid off and he enrolled in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. [...] He was a private with the service number 19022. [...] He was selected for officer training, but failed the course. [...] Sent to France in 1916, Manning experienced action with the 7th Battalion at the Battle of the Somme, was promoted to lance-corporal and experienced life in the trenches. [...] He was recalled for further training and posted to Ireland in May 1917 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment. The life of an officer did not agree with him; he seems not to have integrated particularly well and he drank excessively, getting into trouble with his superiors. [...] His <b>inebriation</b> was put down to neurasthenia, but Manning resigned his commission on 28 February 1918.|$|E
2500|$|In 1894, Rosetti also debuted as an epigrammatist in Graiul magazine, {{which was}} edited by Ilarie Chendi. A volume of such works {{came out that}} year, as Epigrame, and other volumes of verse {{followed}} in quick succession: Din inimă ("From the Heart", 1895), Sincere ("Sincere Ones", 1897), Duioase ("Soothing Ones", 1897). For a while, with Ludovic Dauș, he put out the literary magazine Doina—named after the folk singing style. To 1898, Rosetti {{was one of the}} regulars at literary gatherings in Fialcovsky Coffeehouse (also attended by his father), where he met Alexandru Macedonski, Mircea Demetriade, and actor Ion Livescu. The latter recalled that Rosetti was [...] "as gentle and soft as his poetry, as thin and as supple as a reed, with long blond hair and dreamy eyes". Macedonski also co-opted him to write for Literatorul. While not connected to the Symbolist movement, he was an early and episodic influence on young Symbolists such as Eftimiu and Ion Minulescu. This did not refer just to his poetic standard, but also to his lifestyle: as Eftimiu recalls, they were envious of his physical beauty and sentimental adventures. Although Eftimiu believes that Rosetti was wholly indifferent to Baudelaire and Verlaine, he in fact revered the latter. In 1935 he recalled that he chanced upon aging and [...] "stiff drunk" [...] Verlaine while walking around Paris: [...] "It seemed to me that even his <b>inebriation</b> was something grand and beautiful".|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 1974, García {{was visiting}} {{with some friends}} in her apartment. Medrano also had a guest, with whom he was smoking marijuana.

They began harassing García and her friends, who left García and the others at the apartment. Soon an argument arose between Medrano and Castillo, who was envious of Medrano's status as the primary drug connection in Soledad and was resentful that an [...] "outsider" [...] had become so successful. The argument became physical, and Medrano was winning the fight (Castillo was a wiry seventeen-year-old) until the 300-pound Jimenez intervened, beating Medrano and threatening him with a knife. Jimenez and Castillo took García to an alley behind the building where Jimenez restrained and Castillo raped her, according to García's testimony, [...] "to show me what a hometown boy was." [...] The two men left the scene for a neighbor's house. Shortly after arriving, they (or someone else) called the García-Medrano residence, laughing, taunting, and threatening García's life if she did not leave town. García armed herself with her son's [...]22 rifle and she and Medrano drove the six blocks to the residence where Castillo and Jimenez were located. Accounts vary as to precisely what occurred next, but by most of them, Jimenez again brandished his knife and García shot him. Castillo, meanwhile, escaped into a nearby park. Medrano and García continued to the home of the two friends that had visited her earlier, and when police arrived, she surrendered to them without incident.|$|E
2500|$|The Count and Countess return. The Countess, {{thinking}} herself trapped, desperately {{admits that}} Cherubino is {{hidden in the}} closet. The enraged Count draws his sword, promising to kill Cherubino on the spot, but when the door is opened, they both find to their astonishment only Susanna (Finale: Esci omai, garzon malnato – [...] "Come out of there, you ill-born boy!"). The Count demands an explanation; the Countess tells him it is a practical joke, to test his trust in her. Shamed by his jealousy, the Count begs for forgiveness. When the Count presses about the anonymous letter, Susanna and the Countess reveal that {{the letter was written}} by Figaro, and then delivered by Basilio. Figaro then arrives and tries to start the wedding festivities, but the Count berates him with questions about the anonymous note. Just as the Count is starting to run out of questions, Antonio the gardener arrives, complaining that a man has jumped out of the window and broken his flowerpots. The Count immediately realizes that the jumping fugitive was Cherubino, but Figaro claims it was he himself who jumped out of the window, and claims to have injured his foot while landing. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess attempt to discredit Antonio as a chronic drunkard whose constant <b>inebriation</b> makes him unreliable and prone to fantasy, but Antonio brings forward a paper which, he says, was dropped by the escaping man. The Count orders Figaro to prove he was the jumper by identifying the paper (which is, in fact, Cherubino's appointment to the army). Figaro is at a loss, but Susanna and the Countess manage to signal the correct answers, and Figaro identifies the document. His victory is, however, short-lived: Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio enter, bringing charges against Figaro and demanding that he honor his contract to marry Marcellina. The Count happily postpones the wedding in order to investigate the charge.|$|E

But with familiarity his caution vanished, and poor Cos lamentably disgraced himself at Sir Charles Mirabel's table, by premature <b>inebriation.</b> A carriage was called for him: the hospitable door was shut upon him. Often and sadly did he speak to his friends at the Kitchen of his resemblance to King Lear in the plee--of his having a thankless choild, bedad--of his being a pore worn-out lonely old man, dthriven to dthrinking by ingratitude, and seeking to dthrown his sorrows in punch.|$|E

Godfrey was annoyed when he heard it; [...] "but," [...] as his host said, [...] "after being eighteen months, and, for aught I know, eighteen months before that, without touching liquor, very little would be likely to produce an effect upon him.

The owner following came upon the hide, and Musquash, seeing {{it was too late to}} remove the brand from it, expressed his contrition, and pleaded in extenuation that he was rather worthy of sympathy than blame, because he would never have laid hands on what was not his had not a white man sold him deleterious liquor. As no white man is allowed to supply an Indian with alcohol in any form, the wardens of the prairie took a somewhat similar view of the case, and Stimson was, from motives which he did not mention, especially anxious to get his grip upon the other offender.|$|E
60|$|From Grady's kitchen {{casement}} {{often came}} odours still more fragrant. The three old soldiers who formed the garrison of No. 3 were all skilled in the culinary art. Grady was great at an Irish stew; the Colonel {{was famous for}} pillaus and curries; and as for Strong he could cook anything. He made French dishes and Spanish dishes, stews, fricassees, and omelettes, to perfection; nor was there any man in England more hospitable than he when his purse was full or his credit was good. At those happy periods, he could give a friend, as he said, a good dinner, a good glass of wine, and a good song afterwards; and poor Cos often heard with envy the roar of Strong's choruses, and the musical clinking of the glasses, as he sate in his own room, so far removed and yet so near to those festivities. It was not expedient to invite Mr. Costigan always: his practice of <b>inebriation</b> was lamentable; and he bored Strong's guests with his stories when sober, and with his maudlin tears when drunk.|$|E

The sky was very clear above, but all round the horizon a low haze lay upon the water.

Every now and then a rumbling noise ending in a thud down below showed that the swing of the ship had caused something to come down with a run. Underlying all other sounds, however, was a muffled clank, clank, which might almost make one forget that this was a sailing ship, it sounded so like the chipping of a propeller.|$|E
60|$|Here we give Mr. Moore {{full credit}} {{for all his}} abatements in regard to Lord Byron's excesses in his early days. Moore makes the point very {{strongly}} that he was not, de facto, even so bad as many of his associates; and we agree with him. Byron's physical organisation was originally as fine and sensitive {{as that of the}} most delicate woman. He possessed the faculty of moral ideality in a high degree; and he had not, in the earlier part of his life, an attraction towards mere brutal vice. His physical sensitiveness was so remarkable that he says of himself, 'A dose of salts has the effect of a temporary <b>inebriation,</b> like light champagne, upon me.' Yet this exceptionally delicately-organised boy and youth was in a circle where not to conform to the coarse drinking-customs of his day was to incur censure and ridicule. That he early acquired the power of bearing large quantities of liquor is manifested by the record in his Journal, that, on the day when he read the severe 'Edinburgh' article upon his schoolboy poems, he drank three bottles of claret at a sitting.|$|E

The boundary between his dominions {{and those of}} the queen was at the River Araxes, a stream flowing from west to east, through the central parts of Asia, toward the Caspian Sea. As Cyrus advanced, he found the country growing more and more wild and desolate. It was inhabited by savage tribes, who lived on roots and herbs, and who were elevated very little, in any respect, above the wild beasts that roamed in the forests around them. They had one very singular custom, according to Herodotus. It seems that there was a plant which grew among them, that bore a fruit, whose fumes, when it was roasting on a fire, had an exhilarating effect, like that produced by wine. These savages, therefore, Herodotus says, were accustomed to assemble around a fire, in their convivial festivities, and to throw some of this fruit in the midst of it. The fumes emitted by the fruit would soon begin to intoxicate the whole circle, when they would throw on more fruit, and become more and more excited, until, at length, they would jump up, and dance about, and sing, in a state of complete <b>inebriation.</b>|$|E

But the disturbance was only temporary. The families retired to their suppers or beds, the tipplers returned to their tipple, the belated speculators to their dreams, {{and in a few}} minutes (no doubt) forgot what they had seen, and forgot; perchance, that they had any personal interest in fire raising, or fire extinction, or fire prevention, or fire in any dangerous shape or form whatever, or indulged in the comforting belief, mayhap, that whatever disasters might attend the rest of the London community, they and their houses being endued with the properties of the salamander, nothing in the shape of fire might, could, would, or should kindle upon them.

60|$|The {{landscape}} {{in the vicinity}} was unimproved, but not rural. The adjacent lots had apparently just given up bearing scrub-oaks, but had not seriously taken to bricks and mortar. In one direction the vista was closed by the Home of the Inebriates, not in itself a cheerful-looking building, and, as the apparent terminus of a ramble in a certain direction, having all {{the effect of a}} moral lesson. To a certain extent, however, this building was an imposition. The enthusiastic members of my family, who confidently expected to see its inmates hilariously disporting themselves at its windows in the different stages of <b>inebriation</b> portrayed by the late W. E. Burton, were much disappointed. The Home was reticent of its secrets. The County Hospital, also in range of the bay-window, showed much more animation. At certain hours of the day convalescents passed in review before the window on their way to an airing. This spectacle was the still more depressing from a singular lack of sociability that appeared to prevail among them. Each man was encompassed by the impenetrable atmosphere of his own peculiar suffering. They did not talk or walk together. From the window I have seen half a dozen sunning themselves against a wall within a few feet of each other, to all appearance utterly oblivious of the fact. Had they but quarrelled or fought,--anything would have been better than this horrible apathy.|$|E
