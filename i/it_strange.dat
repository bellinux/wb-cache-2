5|$|Gamal Abdel Nasser {{wrote in}} his memoirs that already by May 25, the Egyptian forces were spread so thin {{that they had no}} mobile {{reserves}} to assault a Jewish force, and considered <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that they would be ordered to allocate a major contingent to fight in an unfamiliar area. Following-up his victory in the Battle of Yad Mordechai on May 23–24, al-Mwawi pushed north along the coast, bypassing the relatively well-defended Israeli village of Nitzanim. His column was reinforced by sea near Majdal, where he sent part of his force to the Majdal–Hebron road, hoping it would be able to link with another column, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Aziz, south of Jerusalem. Reduced to about 2,500 men, al-Mwawi resumed his march northwards. Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib was put in charge of the column by al-Mwawi, because the original commander was on vacation in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E

In addition, Ruetten discovered that the BMW he had bought for Rasmussen as an engagement gift was missing.

The house's answering machine had not been activated, despite both of them usually activating it when leaving the house unoccupied.|$|E

25|$|Many {{specific}} {{points by}} Ehrman {{concentrate on what}} may {{be regarded as the}} 'embarrassments' and 'failures' of the various depictions of Jesus Christ found in the gospels and the works of Paul which point to an account based on a real person that got embellished rather than a completely made up figure. He notes that Jews in the first century AD expected their Messiah to come from Bethlehem while Jesus is described as growing up in Nazareth, a dilemma that is simply not addressed in the Gospel of Mark (which has no nativity account) even though it is regarded as the earliest gospel. The betrayal of Jesus by Judas is another example, as critics of early Christianity found <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that the Messiah would display the lack of personal awareness and foresight even to keep his close followers in line. Ehrman states that such things would make sense for a historical Jesus whom multiple people believed grew up, lived, and died in a certain time and place versus a purely mythological figure with malleable personal details.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{helicopters}} {{had begun to}} replace fixed–wing aircraft and supplement the marine craft in the search and rescue role, {{with the introduction of}} the Westland Wessex and later the Westland Sea King, it was now possible to consider the replacement of marine craft in all sea and weather conditions. However, even into the 1970s helicopters had not completely replaced RAF marine craft, however by this time the Marine Branch craft were becoming increasingly elderly and service in the Branch increasingly unattractive. Physically isolated from the majority of RAF bases and personnel, with the withdrawal of the flying boats and the absorption of Coastal Command into Strike Command, the majority of RAF bases were now inland; the Marine Branch became largely forgotten and neglected {{by the rest of the}} Royal Air Force. The only interaction between the Marine Branch and the rest of the RAF was when the Branch had to draw supplies from another base, or when aircrew arrived at Mount Batten for safety and survival training. Associating the RAF with the conducting of flight operations, other members of the RAF, like the public at large, were often unaware that the RAF had its own marine craft or why they were needed, and when they did become aware of the fact, found <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> and surprising.|$|E
500|$|Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline, writing: [...] "Forget Lynette's career stress, Gabrielle's baby daddy drama, {{and even}} Bree's new widowhood: This story has legs, and {{apparently}} arms." [...] She found <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion {{in regards to}} Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and (you guessed it) lots of tears and shouting." [...] The Futon Critic selected [...] "Next" [...] as the 42nd best television episode of 2005, writing, [...] "Say what you will about the show's rocky sophomore season but one can't deny how strongly it started," [...] and citing the tie-changing scene as the episode's most memorable moment.|$|E

500|$|Mike Strange {{recorded}} and mixed Eminem's vocals at Effigy Studios in Ferndale, Michigan. The sessions took two days. Strange edited the vocals with D-Verb—a reverberation software—and an Extra Long Delay plug-in. He preferred to make few changes; for [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] he almost exclusively used board compression and console equalization. Strange used the Bricasti and Eventide Reverb 2016 mixing tools for [...] "brighter" [...] reverberation. Detroit musician Luis Resto {{has contributed to}} the arrangement on many of Eminem's songs, but did not do so for [...] "Love the Way You Lie". According to Strange, [...] "Everything we needed was already in the track, apart from the vocals." [...] Two to threeweeks after the sessions, Alex da Kid arrived to help mix and master the track. He wanted to replace the acoustic guitar on the demo, but Eminem chose to keep <b>it.</b> <b>Strange</b> said, [...] "It was simply a matter of trying to match and then to improve on the demo 'd sent us." [...] Strange's brother Joe engineered the track.|$|E
500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E
500|$|When the single's {{cover was}} revealed, it divided opinions. Becky Bain of Idolator liked [...] "simplicity {{of the black}} and white cover," [...] though she felt <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that the image [...] "didn't have color or glasses." [...] Rap-Up {{magazine}} thought the opposite to Bain, saying that [...] "Rowland's eyes do the talking with the black-and-white artwork." [...] On June 28, 2010, the single was released as a digital download in Belgium, Norway, and Sweden. A day later, it was sent to American pop and rhythmic radio, as well as released for digital download. On July 23, 2010, it was also released in other parts of Europe, including Italy and the Netherlands. Media Base's seven-day airplay report showed that in the last week of August, [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] managed to peak at number thirty-nine on the US Top 40 Airplay chart, a component of the Mainstream Top 40 chart published by Billboard. However, by the week ending September 11, 2010, it had received no adds to official playlists, despite being played 585times across thirty-four stations. The only other territory where the song charted was Slovakia. It debuted on the Slovakian Airplay Chart at number sixty-eight before peaking at number twenty-five three weeks later.|$|E

500|$|Concerning {{the anniversary}} edition, Yudell and Desalle thought <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> that nothing worth adding had {{happened}} in 25 years: the book remained a primary text, and Wilson's failure to develop it weakened the edition's impact. The early chapters still seemed a [...] "lucid and engaging" [...] introduction to population biology, {{but much of the}} rest seemed after 25 years to lack [...] "methodological breadth", given that it did not cover the new fields that had emerged; while barely mentioning the growing importance of phylogenetic systematics seemed [...] "curious". They pointed out that comparing human and [...] "animal" [...] social evolution [...] "is tantamount to making homology" [...] claims, but Wilson had said nothing about the need for a methodology to test behavioural homology. The reviewers were also troubled by Wilson's attitude to the debate, remaining [...] "contemptuous of his anti-sociobiological opposition" [...] and [...] "opprobrium towards Marxism" [...] (especially Gould and Lewontin). Yudell and Desalle noted the irony that Wilson despised Marxism but advocated an [...] "aggressive paradigm ... seeking to blaze an historical path towards the future" [...] (as Marxism did). They argued that by demonising his opponents in this way, Wilson created support for Sociobiology [...] "not necessarily sustainable by his data and methodologies." [...] He was still doing that 25 years on, stated the reviewers.|$|E
500|$|Corriea {{was mixed}} about the game's HD upgrade, stating {{that while the}} {{background}} were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and the main characters moved fluidly and expressed emotion properly, NPCs or characters unimportant to the stories did not receive the same attention as the main cast. Schilling was disappointed with the result, frequently citing scenery and character behavior that looked out of place on the big screen. Miller said that the game's visuals were [...] "dominated by muddy textures and frequent loading.", while he negatively noted {{the removal of the}} original's multiplayer. Damiani praised the upgrades for the main characters, but noted multiple inconsistencies in both the environments and cutscenes. Famitsu found the graphics [...] "dramatically beautiful", but found <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> seeing the original environments on a large screen. Meyerink said that, while not hard on the eyes, the upgrades were well below what he expected. Sullivan praised the lighting and shading effects, but shared Corriea's criticism of NPCs and noted low-quality environmental textures, saying she was [...] "so bored by most environments that [...] stopped caring about them halfway through the story." [...] The localized dialogue also received mixed to negative reactions, with multiple reviewers faulting the English voice actors' performances. Opinions on the PC port were mixed: Meyerink marked it as an improvement of the ports of the XIII games while acknowledging issues with the graphics and controls, while Roberts was not impressed by its performance.|$|E
500|$|Across her {{speaking}} appearances, Lightning is {{voiced by}} Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto {{was impressed by}} Lightning, whom she called [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "strong". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> to voice Lightning, as {{she was used to}} gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little [...] "overwhelming" [...] when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. She tried to help the staff of the XIII games portray Lightning as a real person: [...] "I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!" [...] Over the course of the XIII trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes [...] "a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... into a real warrior".|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Bart the General" [...] finished 31st {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of January 29 - February 4, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 14.3. It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "Some good lines and setpieces aside - we love Bart's fantasy of death at Nelson's hands - this episode nevertheless feels a bit unsure of itself, particularly towards the end." [...] In a DVD review of the first season David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5 and adds [...] "Another episode that helped to propel Bart's popularity into the stratosphere ...". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode [...] "remains a primitive example of The Simpsons, but it’s a reasonably amusing and entertaining experience." [...] and added that the episode [...] "lacks the subtlety and cleverness found on later episodes, but it was onto something." [...] Matt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds <b>it</b> <b>strange</b> how controversial this episode seemed {{at the time of}} its release. Today, they would go a lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless. The episode's reference to Full Metal Jacket was named the eleventh greatest film reference in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of Total Film.|$|E

It asked fans {{to record a}} video of themselves performing [...] "Starships" [...] by singing, dancing or with a musical instrument. Minaj will then select 5 winners.
