By a further Act of Parliament, the City of London School Act 1879, it was empowered to move to a new site at Blackfriars on the Victoria Embankment overlooking the Thames (still in the City of London). The school moved in 1883 and the new building was opened by the Prince of Wales, (the future King Edward VII).|$|E
5|$|The male lead of Rockstar {{is played}} by Ranbir Kapoor, with whom Eros International worked {{previously}} on Anjaana Anjaani. His role of Jordan is loosely based on Imtiaz Ali's Jat friend, {{who lived in a}} small settlement in Pitam Pura. He had seen Kareena Kapoor's performance in his Jab We Met and wanted to cast her in the film. However, the script required some romantic scenes between the leads. As Ranbir and Kareena happened to be cousins, this was touted as a problem. Moreover, the filmmakers did not want to replace Ranbir with any other actor as the character he portrayed was reportedly suitable only for him. They then made a <b>joint</b> <b>decision</b> to replace Kapoor with Nargis Fakhri, after initially approaching Sonam Kapoor and Diana Penty for the replacement. Voice actor Mona Ghosh Shetty dubbed for Fakhri. The film marked Shammi Kapoor's last appearance in a feature film; he died on 14 August 2011.|$|E

40|$|Joint {{practical}} deliberation is {{the activity}} of deciding together what to do. 1 When two colleagues discuss where to meet for coffee, when two partners have a conversation about whether {{to have a second}} child, when friends on a road trip argue about whether to take the scenic route or the freeway, they are engaged in joint practical deliberation. They are trying to arrive at a single plan of action that expresses and governs both of their wills. This paper begins from two basic observations about this activity. First, we can make <b>joint</b> <b>decisions</b> regarding not just what we will do, but also what you will do or what I will do. For example: if we are deliberating together about how to write a coauthored paper, we might jointly decide that I will write the introduction, leaving it quite open what you will do. Second, if we do in fact deliberate together, we must have some speech acts by means of which we propose potential <b>joint</b> <b>decisions,</b> putting them forward for joint consideration. Combining these two ideas, we can infer that there are speech acts the force of which is to propose <b>joint</b> <b>decisions</b> regarding what you will do or what I will do. If we investigate what such speech acts would look like, they are surprisingly similar to speech acts we already have: requests, demands, offers, and promises. This suggests a hypothesis: these speech acts just are proposals within joint practical deliberation. Requests and demands are two ways of proposing <b>joint</b> <b>decisions</b> about what you will do; offers and promises are two ways of proposing <b>joint</b> <b>decisions</b> about what I will do. In this paper, I defend one part of this hypothesis: the claim that promises are proposals to make <b>joint</b> <b>decisions</b> about what the speaker will do. ...|$|R

Following the {{development}} of heavy industry in the northern parts of the country, particularly around Norilsk, a reliable transportation method was needed to guarantee year-round shipments of cargo and supplies {{to and from the}} northern communities. Experiences from the nuclear icebreakers operating on the Northern Sea Route since the mid-1950s had shown the advantages of nuclear marine propulsion in the ice-infested waters of the Russian Arctic. Thus a decision was made to construct a new icebreaking LASH carrier, capable of serving high-volume shallow ports, that was powered by a nuclear reactor. The ship was designed by the Baltsudoproect Central Design Bureau.|$|E

60|$|Other and {{numerous}} sources of discord {{are inherent in}} the necessity which the Communist principle involves, of deciding by the general voice questions {{of the utmost importance}} to every one, which on the present system can be and are left to individuals to decide, each for his own case. As an example, take the subject of education. All Socialists are strongly impressed with the all-importance of the training given to the young, not only for the reasons which apply universally, but because their demands being much greater than those of any other system upon the intelligence and morality of the individual citizen, they have even more at stake than any other societies on the excellence of their educational arrangements. Now under Communism these arrangements would have to be made for every citizen by the collective body, since individual parents, supposing them to prefer some other mode of educating their children, would have no private means of paying for it, and would be limited to what they could do by their own personal teaching and influence. But every adult member of the body would have an equal voice in determining the collective system designed for the benefit of all. Here, then, is a most fruitful source of discord in every association. All who had any opinion or preference as to the education they would desire for their own children, would have to rely for their chance of obtaining it upon the influence they could exercise in the <b>joint</b> <b>decision</b> of the community.|$|E
