25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space <b>input</b> <b>state.</b> In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E

For example, if inputs A and B exist in a “binary 0” state and input C exists in a “binary 1” state, the output will exist in a “binary 0” state since the combined electrical field effect of inputs A and B together is greater than that of input C alone.|$|E

5000|$|The unique {{feature of}} the Dolinar {{receiver}} is the feedback from the detector and the displacement mechanism in between arrivals of the <b>input</b> <b>state</b> copies. Counting either zero photons or one or more photons with the SPD does not give complete information about the <b>input</b> <b>state.</b> Rather, {{whether or not a}} photon was counted gives some information about the state, and a hypothesis can be proposed based on the information from the SPD. With the Kennedy receiver, the displacement is fixed at either [...] or , and depending on which displacement is used and if a photon is counted or not, a best hypothesis as {{to the nature of the}} <b>input</b> <b>state</b> can be put forth. For example, if the displacement of the Kennedy receiver is set to be , then it can be said the Kennedy receiver is testing the hypothesis that the <b>input</b> <b>state</b> was [...] If no photons are counted, it is most likely that the hypothesis was correct and that the <b>input</b> <b>state</b> was displaced to vacuum.

Further, the Dolinar receiver shows more robustness against dark counts, a real-life phenomenon where SPDs can count a photon even if there is nothing, i.e. vacuum, to detect. If the detector counts a photon even when the hypothesis is correct and the <b>input</b> <b>state</b> copy was displaced to vacuum, the displacement will switch and there is a likely chance another photon will be detected on the next pass, switching the displacement back, where there will be a less likely chance to detect photons for future detection. As long as the rate of dark counts is not too high, the overall history of detection results can give a likely picture as {{to the nature of the}} original <b>input</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
