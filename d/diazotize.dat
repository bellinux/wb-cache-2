40|$|A simple, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for the indirect determination of trace amounts of chromium(VI) is described. The nitrite {{generated by the}} oxidation of hydroxylamine with chromium(VI) is used to <b>diazotize</b> p-aminophenol (PMP). The diazonium salt formed is coupled with isatin (IS) or isonipecotamide (ISO) or frusemide (FRU) in an alkaline medium to form azo dye showing absorption maxima at 524 or 533 or 558 nm respectively. Chromium(III) is determined after it is oxidized to Cr(VI) by bromine water. The range of linearity for PMP – IS, PMP-ISO and PMP-FRU couples are 0. 02 - 0. 6 μg mL- 1, 0. 04 - 2. 0 μg mL- 1 and 0. 4 - 2. 0 μg mL- 1 of chromium respectively. The molar absorptivity, Sandell sensitivity for each system were calculated.

The titers of antibody directed to the 4 -azoquinoline 1 -oxide group were followed {{during the course of}} immunization by passive hemagglutination. 2 -Mercaptoethanol(2 ME) -sensitive antibody to the haptenic group was produced earlier and 2 ME-resistant one appeared later. Higher anti-hapten antibody titers were obtained by immunization with DRSP than with DBSA or DBaA. Therefore, rabbit and mouse anti-DRSP antibodies were employed for immunochemical studies. Anti-bodies to DRSP formed specific precipitates with DBSA. This precipitation reaction was inhibited by carcinogenic 4 -hydroxyaminoquinoline 1 -oxide (4 HAQO), 4 -nitro-quinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO), non-carcinogenic 4 -aminoquinoline 1 -oxide (4 AQ 0), and 4 -aminoquinoline (4 AQ).

40|$|Protease {{activities}} in human ileal effluent and feces were compared {{by using a}} variety of native and <b>diazotized</b> protein substrates. In many cases the <b>diazotized</b> proteins had altered susceptibilities to hydrolysis compared with the native proteins. Proteolytic activity was significantly greater than (P less than 0. 001) in small intestinal effluent than in feces (319 +/- 45 and 11 +/- 6 mg of azocasein hydrolyzed per h per g, respectively). Moreover, fecal proteolysis was qualitatively different in that ileal effluent did not hydrolyze the highly globular protein bovine serum albumin, whereas all fecal samples tested degraded this substrate. Inhibition experiments provided further evidence that fecal protease activity differed from that in the small intestine. Physical disruption of fecal bacteria released large quantities of proteases, indicating that the lysis of bacteria in the colon may contribute to the extracellular proteolytic activity in feces. Protease inhibition studies with washed fecal bacteria showed that they produced serine, cystine, and metalloproteases, and experiments with synthetic p-nitroanilide substrates indicated that low levels of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities were associated with whole cells.
