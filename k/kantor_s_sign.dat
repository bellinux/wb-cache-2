40|$|This article {{deals with}} the history of {{membranous}} superficial fascia (Antonio Scarpa, Abraham Colles), the history of clinical signs that use discoloration of the torso (Cullen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign,</b> Grey Turner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign,</b> Fox 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign,</b> Bryant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign)</b> and then describes anatomical dissection studies to link the two. INTRODUCTION: The membranous superficial fascia (MSF) was described early in the 19 th century, as was its role in the clinical sign of urethral disruption. Clinical signs of haemorrhage or leakage of pancreatic and biliary fluid into the retroperitoneum, which were described throughout the 20 th century, all relied on circumscribed discolouration of the skin of the torso. The objective {{of this study was to}} relate the anatomy of the MSF to clinical signs of retroperitoneal catastrophe. METHODS: The MSF was dissected in the torso of seven embalmed cadavers to note its extent and its attachments. The attachments of the MSF were mapped to the areas of skin discolouration that are described in the clinical signs. RESULTS: The well known extent of the MSF in the inguinal region, its continuation into the perineum and its attachment to the fascia lata of the thigh were confirmed with our method of dissection. Dissection was continued superiorly, demonstrating continuation of the MSF over the entire torso with loose fibrous attachment of the MSF to the deep fascia. The MSF is firmly adherent to the midline of the abdomen except for the umbilicus, to a horizontal line below the clavicles and laterally in the abdomen to form pockets. The lines of firm adhesion correspond with the borders of the discoloured areas described in the clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Circumscription of discolouration seen in the eponymous clinical signs of retroperitoneal catastrophe is explained by confinement of coloured retroperitoneal fluid by the MSF and its deep attachments...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Sign-out (SO) is a {{challenge}} to the emergency physician. Some training programs have instituted overlapping 9 -hour shifts. The residents see patients for eight hours, and have one hour of wrap-up time. This hour helps them complete patient care, leaving fewer patients to sign-out. We examined whether this strategy impacts SO burden. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients evaluated by emergency medicine (EM) residents working 9 -hour (eight hours of patient care, one hour wrap-up time) and 12 -hour shifts (12 hours patient care, no reserved time for wrap-up). Data were collected by reviewing the clinical tracker. A patient was assigned to the resident who initiated care and dictated the chart. SO was defined as any patient in the ED without disposition at change of shift. Patient turn-around-time (TAT) was also recorded. Results: One-hundred sixty-one postgraduate-year-one resident (PGY 1), 264 postgraduate-yeartwo resident (PGY 2), and 193 postgraduate-year-three resident (PGY 3) shifts were included. PGY 1 <b>s</b> <b>signed</b> out 1. 9 patients per 12 -hour shift. PGY 2 <b>s</b> <b>signed</b> out 2. 3 patients on 12 -hour shifts and 1. 8 patients on 9 -hour shifts.

40|$|While the {{aetiology}} of eponymous surface {{signs of}} retroperitoneal haemorrhage and bile leakage is known, {{it is unclear}} what causes their appearance. The location of Scarpa 2 ̆ 7 s fascia makes it a potential candidate in understanding the pattern of these signs. In this study, dissections were performed on seven embalmed cadavers and the Visible Human Project was examined to determine Scarpa’s fasica’s role in these clinical signs. Scarpa 2 ̆ 7 s fascia attaches where the umbilicus emerges from the external oblique aponeurosis providing a deficiency that may cause the bruising in Cullen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign.</b> As the membranous layer continues into the flanks, it creates a pocket which may account for Turner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign.</b> The continuation of the membranous layer into the axilla and chest forms another pocket where bile may accumulate in Icterus Marginatus.

40|$|Tutkimus käsittelee esiintyjän ja esineen keskinäisiä vuorovaikutussuhteita teatteriesityksissä, kantavana tutkimuskysymyksenään, miten ja millaisia merkityksiä tämä jo sinällään toiminnan ja havainnon tasoilla kantaa ja tuottaa. Teoreettisesti työ edustaa humanististen tieteiden kognitiivista käännettä, mutta pyrkii aihepiirinsä mukaisesti käsittämään mielen ja kognition myös olennaisesti ekologisena ilmiönä, päätä ja aivoja laajempana, toiminnan ja havainnon prosesseihin liudentuvana. Tutkimuksen keskeiset käsitteet (metafora, kuvaskeemat ja tarjoumat eli affordanssit) perustuvat kognitiiviseen kielitieteeseen ja ekologiseen psykologiaan, tärkeimpinä vaikuttajina Mark Johnson, James J. Gibson ja Tim Ingold. Keskeiset tapaustutkimukset pureutuvat Jerzy Grotowskin, Tadeusz Kantorin ja Vsevolod Meyerholdin valittuihin ohjauksiin. Ensimmäisessä luvussa havainnon, toiminnan ja kognition prosesseja havainnollistetaan temaattisesti keskeisillä toimijuuden ja esineyden käsitteillä. Näkökulma horjuttaa teatteriesineistön perinteistä jakoa lavastukseen, tarpeistoon ja puvustukseen. Filosofisemmalla tasolla luku kyseenalaistaa metaforan olemisen suuresta ketjusta, jossa mieli asettuu aineen ja subjekti objektin yläpuolelle. Sen teoreettiseksi vaihtoehdoksi kehitellään kognition ekologista perustaa ruumiillisena, paikallisena, toiminnallisena ja ympäristöön hajautuvana (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended). Metodologia tarkentuu toisen luvun ekologisessa esitysanalyysissä Meyerholdin Jalomielisestä aisankannattajasta (1922). Paitsi tämän lavastusta ja näyttelijäntyötä konstruktivismia ja biomekaniikkaa luvussa tarkastellaan varhaisen Neuvosto-Venäjän kulttuuriekologiaa sekä analysoitavasta esityksestä näiden kaikkien vuorovaikutuksessa tarjoutuneita tulkintoja. Kolmannessa luvussa Grotowskin ja Kantorin ajatuksia köyhästä teatterista suhteutetaan näiden puolestaan heijastamaan kommunistisen Puolan kulttuuriekologiaan: samojen perustavien skeemojen esitetään metaforisesti määrittävän molempien ohjaajien ajattelua ja toimintaa, usein tosin vastakkaisilla tavoilla. Seuraavien lukujen yksityiskohtaiset analyysit Grotowskin Akropoliksesta (1962 - 69) ja Kantorin ohjauksesta Kuolkoot taiteilijat! (1985) purkavat paitsi kyseisten esitysten esinedramaturgioita, myös ohjaajien pidemmän aikavälin painotuksia ja heidän perinteistä profiloitumistaan näyttelijöiden ja esineteatteriin. Lyhyessä epilogissa tarkastellaan yleisempiä jännitteitä ja jatkumoita suhteessa tämän hetken länsimaista kulttuuri- ja esitysekologiaa enenevästi määrittävään medioitumiseen ja teknologisoitumiseen. The general {{theme of}} the thesis is performer-object interaction, as enacted and {{perceived}} in the theatre its overarching research question, how varieties of meaning may already be enacted and perceived, thereby. In theorizing this, the work generally subscribes to the cognitive turn of the humanities, but also aspires to nudge it toward an ecological ontology, more congenial to the theme: of mind or cognition beyond the brain, out of our heads, inseparable from action and perception. The key concepts of the study (metaphor, image schemas, affordances) originate from cognitive linguistics and ecological psychology; the central case studies concern three specific productions directed by Jerzy Grotowski, Tadeusz Kantor, and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Chapter 1 isolates the key notions of agent and object, to theorize general processes of perception, action, and cognition: progressively blurring such traditional terms for stage objects as set, props, or costume, it proceeds from domain-specific abstractions through basic-level categories and ecological affordances, to the domain-general work of conceptual blending and metaphor. In its more philosophical framing, the chapter addresses metaphors of the Great Chain of Being instrumental to the artificial division of mind over matter and subjects over objects and instead, makes a theoretical case for the ecological grounding of all cognition, modified by the four influential e s: mind as embodied, embedded, extended, enacted. In Chapter 2, this theoretical framework is further elaborated in {{a detailed analysis of}} Meyerhold s 1922 staging of The Magnanimous Cuckold from the affordances of its constructivist setting to an extended discussion of its biomechanical acting (the then metaphors of reflexology and Taylorism, contrasted with distributed and enactive notions of cognition and skill) and from the cultural ecology of early Soviet Russia to the variety of interpretations the interplay of all these have historically afforded. Toward the end, the general theory is developed into something of a tentative method, as concerns how the notions of image schemas and affordances may intertwine to serve the ecological validity of performance analysis. With Chapter 3, the conceptual focus shifts to <b>Kantor</b> <b>s</b> and Grotowski s notions of poor theatre, reflecting as they seem, a cultural ecology very different from that of Meyerhold s Russia that of real socialism in Communist Poland. Key metaphors of the general mindset thus identified, Chapters 4 and 5 present detailed analyses of Akropolis, as staged by Grotowski and Józef Szajna first in 1962, and of <b>Kantor</b> <b>s</b> 1985 production of Let the Artists Die! the former, ranging from plot points of performer-object interaction to the ecological and enactive emphases of Grotowski s later work; the latter, from some of <b>Kantor</b> <b>s</b> overarching objects and metaphors, throughout his career, to distributed notions of memory and selfhood. To conclude, a brief Epilogue will address not only the metonymical and metaphorical afterlives of Grotowski and Kantor, respectively, but some of the tensions and continuities that go with performing humanity in the ever more mediatized ecologies of new technology that we currently inhabit. While only emerging with these new ecologies, on the notions of extended and distributed cognition such ostensibly contemporary metaphors as the cyborg or the posthuman only go to define what we ve always been already if by the human post we mean a self-contained Cartesian individual, somehow disentangled from its ecological embedding...|$|R
