He later {{entrusted}} Paul Yü Pin, Archbishop of Nanking, to reestablish the Fu Jen Catholic University. He arrived in Japan for a two week long visit in May 1959, which included a meeting with Emperor Hirohito. On December 10, 1959 he presided over the First Far East Conference of Bishops at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines with attendance of 100 prelates, 10 papal representatives, 16 archbishops, 79 bishops from almost <b>every</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Far East. His visit to the Republic of Ireland in June 1961 was {{the highlight of the}} Patrician Year. Agagianian received a great popular welcome there. Conservative President of Ireland Éamon de Valera was famously pictured kissing Agagianian's ring. In September 1963 he visited South Vietnam and met with Madame Nhu, the Catholic first lady. On October 18, 1964 when the Uganda Martyrs where canonized by Pope Paul VI, Agagianian presided over the Holy Mass at Namugongo.

By 1955 Dunlop had {{almost half of}} the UK tyre market. A report by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission in that year found that Dunlop and the four other main sellers in the UK market (Goodyear, Avon, Firestone and Michelin) companies had arrangements which resulted in fixed prices. These arrangements were forced to change, and Dunlop's market share decreased.|$|E

Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 135 countries.|$|E

The {{production}} officially opened on 3 June and ran through 22 August 2009. A further production of the play ran at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25–30 August 2009. The Jude Law Hamlet then moved to Broadway, and ran for twelve weeks at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York. Previews began on 12 September and the official opening was 6 October 2009. Most of the original cast moved with the production to New York. There were some changes, already incorporated in Elsinore: new were Ross Armstrong, Geraldine James and Michael Hadley. The Broadway cast with Law also includes Harry Attwell, Ian Drysdale, Jenny Funnell, Colin Haigh, James Le Feuvre, Henry Pettigrew, Matt Ryan, Alan Turkington and Faye Winter.

25|$|Haig {{has been}} criticised {{for the high}} {{casualties}} in British offensives, {{but it has been}} argued by historians like John Terraine that this was largely a function {{of the size of the}} battles, as British forces engaged the main body of the German Army on the Western Front after 1916. Although total deaths in the Second World War were far higher than in the First, British deaths were lower, because Britain fought mainly peripheral campaigns in the Mediterranean, for much of the Second World War, involving relatively few British troops, whilst most of the land fighting took place between Germany and the USSR (the Soviets suffered roughly as many dead in the Second World War, not including civilians, as <b>every</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First World War combined). When British forces engaged in Normandy in 1944, total losses were fewer than on the Somme in 1916, as Normandy was around half the length and less than half the size but casualties per unit per week were broadly similar. David French wrote that British daily loss rates at Normandy, in which divisions lost up to three quarters of their infantry, were similar to those of Passchendaele in 1917, while average battalion casualty rates in 1944–45 (100 men per week) were similar to those of the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} to fight global warming found more {{success at the}} international level than in Congress. Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the non-binding Copenhagen Accord as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut its emissions by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming agreement among the world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly <b>every</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor its emissions, and required each country to create a plan to reduce its emissions. Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's emission limits helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|E
