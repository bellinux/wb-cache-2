5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, {{and formed a}} bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E

Filming was also done at the City Hall of Long Beach, California; the San Rafael Swell in Utah; and the California State University, Northridge in Los Angeles (which was used for establishing shots of students at Starfleet Academy). A parking lot outside Dodger Stadium {{was used for the}} ice planet of Delta Vega and the Romulan <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> on Vulcan. The filmmakers expressed an interest in Iceland for scenes on Delta Vega, but decided against it: Chambliss enjoyed the challenge of filming scenes with snow in southern California. Other Vulcan exteriors were shot at Vasquez Rocks, a location that was used in various episodes of the original series. A Budweiser plant in Van Nuys was used for Enterprises engine room, while a Long Beach power plant was used for Kelvins engine room.|$|E

25|$|After {{working out}} various {{logistical}} and engineering {{problems related to}} the development of a more sophisticated <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> drilling to bedrock at Dye 3 began in the summer of 1979 using a new Danish electro-mechanical ice drill yielding a 10.2cm diameter core. From July to August 1979 using ISTUK, 273 m of core was removed. At the end of the 1980 field season ISTUK had gnawed down to 901 m. In 1981 at a depth of 1785 m dust and conductivity measurements indicated the beginning of ice from the last glaciation. Coring continued and on August 10, 1981, bedrock was reached at a depth of 2038 m. The depth range for the Danish drill was 80–2038 m.|$|E

50|$|In early oil exploration, <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> were semi-permanent {{in nature}} and the {{derricks}} were often built on site and left in place {{after the completion of}} the well. In more recent times <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> are expensive custom-built machines that can be moved from well to well. Some light duty <b>drilling</b> <b>rigs</b> are like a mobile crane and are more usually used to drill water wells.

25|$|Used an Australian built Strata 950 model {{raise borer}} type <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> {{often used to}} create {{circular}} shafts between two levels of a mine without using explosives. Provided by South African mining company Murray & Roberts, the drill had recently finished creating a shaft for Codelco's Andina copper mine in Chile and was immediately transferred to the San José Mine. Since it weighed , the drill had to be shipped in pieces on a large truck convoy. The Strata 950 {{was the first of}} the three drills to begin boring an escape shaft. If the pilot hole had been completed, further drilling would have caused rock debris to fall down the hole, requiring the miners to remove several tons of debris.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill at an offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> in the Gulf of Mexico threatening the coast of Louisiana, Vitter introduced legislation along with Jeff Sessions of Alabama to increase the liability cap of an oil company from $75 million to its most recent annual profits (or $150 million if greater). In the case of BP, {{the owner of the}} oil lease, its liability would be $20 billion. Vitter later introduced an amendment that would remove the cap entirely for this particular spill. Competing Democratic proposals would have raised the liability to $10 billion regardless of profits or removed the cap altogether. Sessions argued that large caps unrelated to company profits would harm smaller companies.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod {{was most}} often {{featured}} in the media in relation to its search-and-rescue role, {{such as in the}} reporting of major rescue incidents. In August 1979, several Nimrods were involved in locating yachting competitors during the disaster-stricken 1979 Fastnet race and coordinated with helicopters in searches for survivors from lost vessels. In March 1980, the Alexander L. Kielland, a Norwegian semi-submersible <b>drilling</b> <b>rig,</b> capsized whilst working in the Ekofisk oil field killing 123 people; six different Nimrods searched for survivors and took turns to provide rescue co-ordination, involving the control of 80 surface ships and 20 British and Norwegian helicopters. In an example of the search capabilities, in September 1977 when an attempted crossing of the North Atlantic in a Zodiac inflatable dinghy went wrong, a Nimrod found the collapsed dinghy and directed a ship to it.|$|E

It was developed at the MARUM Research Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at Bremen University. The complete system – comprising the <b>drill</b> <b>rig,</b> winch, control station, and the launch and recovery system – is transported in six containers and can be deployed worldwide from German and international research ships. It was the first remote-controlled deep sea <b>drill</b> <b>rig</b> to use a wireline coring technique.

25|$|In 1972, {{during the}} cold war era, Hughes was {{approached}} by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. However, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters during a burglary in June 1974. Though he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean Inc. (an offshore oil and gas <b>drilling</b> <b>rig</b> company) and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.|$|E
