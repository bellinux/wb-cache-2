5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{traditional}} gender associations, some scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the poem provides “both a language and models for critiquing sexual mores and social institutions” and encourages women {{to engage in}} scientific pursuits.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Birrell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{immigration}} is creating social divisions and risks long-term national unity. Anthropologist and ethologist Frank Salter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{immigration is}} creating [...] "ethnic stratification" [...] in Australian society.|$|R
50|$|Wendy Davies <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the later}} medieval Welsh {{approach}} to property and estates was a Roman legacy, but {{this issue and}} others related to legacy are not yet resolved. For example, Leslie Alcock <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> that the approach to property and estates cannot pre-date the 6th century and is thus post-Roman.|$|R
50|$|Lax <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Finland {{would be}} better off if it sought {{membership}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the time is now, and the option would not be available if the current peaceful situation changed.|$|R
5|$|Later scholars, however, <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Sycorax {{was saved}} from {{execution}} {{because she was}} pregnant. This was not uncommon, as many female criminals in Shakespeare's day got pregnant to avoid execution.|$|E
5|$|Lyn Wadley et al. <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{complexity}} of the skill needed to process the heat-treated compound glue (gum and red ochre) used to haft spears would seem to argue for continuity between modern human cognition and that of humans 70,000 BP at Sibudu Cave.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's home matches are {{presently}} {{covered by the}} pay-TV broadcaster Sky Sports. Television rights to away games vary; Sky Sports currently hold the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the Scottish Government, who <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> qualifying matches {{should be included in}} the list of sporting events which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> limiting the rights to free-to-air broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson deferred a decision until the completion of the digital switchover.|$|E
50|$|The detainees defense <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not}} be used in Kuwaiti courts, because the detainees and interrogators had not signed them. Furthermore, they <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the allegations the USA had directed at them were not violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
5000|$|Schluter has founded two organisations which {{research}} relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. Schluter {{has also}} written several books on the subject. Schluter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> modern society takes very little account of relationships and <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the prevailing understanding of Capitalism in the West has [...] "built within it a framework of thinking that says {{the growth of the}} capital is more important than relationships." [...] He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> instead,society should focus on the importance of relationships whether that is in education or in companies.|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of this battle is not known. Whiteway <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{this place is}} identical with Amba Geshen, located far {{to the south of}} the Portuguese camp. More recently, however, C.F. Beckingham <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the battle took place in the eastern Semien Mountains near the left bank of the Tekezé River.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Buddhaghosa's writing evinces {{a strong}} but unacknowledged Yogācāra Buddhist influence, which subsequently came to characterize Theravada {{thought in the}} wake of his profound influence on the Theravada tradition.|$|E
5|$|Although {{at various}} times the Byzantines made {{magnificent}} achievements {{in the application of}} the sciences, and are responsible for preserving much of ancient knowledge, some authors <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas of classical authors.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime, or <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> there are serious problems with the official case.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid {{spent the}} three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon. He {{occasionally}} performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river Humber. The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid {{may not have been}} allowed to return to Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court, but most historians <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Wilfrid was at Ripon.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E

5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, {{was put on}} the throne. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav's deposition after the death of Asen. If he had been alive, Asen might have prevented the coup.|$|E
5|$|Many {{projects}} aim {{to prevent}} or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities.

5|$|Other {{economists and}} analysts <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{underground}} economy {{would continue to}} bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.|$|E
5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. But others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E
5|$|Regarding salvation, Maximus {{has been}} {{described}} as a proponent of apocatastasis or universal reconciliation, the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed, like Origen and St. Gregory of Nyssa.
