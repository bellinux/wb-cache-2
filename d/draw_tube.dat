A while later he {{was impressed by the}} multiplied reflection of a bit of cement that was pressed through {{at the end of a}} triangular glass trough, which appeared more regular and almost perfectly symmetrical in comparison to the reflected objects that had been situated further away from the reflecting plates in earlier experiments. This triggered more experiments to find the conditions for the most beautiful and symmetrically perfect conditions. An early version had pieces of colored glass and other irregular objects fixed permanently and was admired by some Members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, including Sir George Mackenzie who predicted its popularity. A version followed in which some of the objects and pieces of glass could move when the tube was rotated. The last step, regarded as most important by Brewster, was to place the reflecting panes in a <b>draw</b> <b>tube</b> with a concave lens to distinctly introduce surrounding objects into the reflected pattern.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The term cold-drawing of tubes {{refers to}} forming {{when the final}} {{material}} (a tube) is formed in a pipe bell and its vertical cross-section is smaller, the tube wall is thinner or thicker and its length is greater.

Cold bending of metal tubes is very important production method considering that metal tubes are widely used in {{a great variety of}} engineering products, such as automobile, aircraft, air conditioner, air compressor, exhaust systems, fluid lines. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{fuel costs}} and the current drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption, a need to reduce vehicle weight is apparent. Weight reduction {{can be achieved by}} replacing conventionally stamped structural members with hydroformed parts. The weight reduction can be further enhanced by reducing the thickness of the hydroformed members through the use of advanced high strength steel (AHSS). A primary limitation in hydroforming AHSS, is the limited ductility or formability of these materials. This limitation becomes acute in multi-stage forming operations in which strain path changes become large making it difficult to predict formability. Thus, the focus of the current work is to study the effects of pre-bending on the subsequent hydroformability of Dual-Phase DP 600 steel tubes. As part of this effort, the effect of key bending and hydroforming process parameters, bending boost and hydroforming end-feed, have been studied in a parametric fashion. Multi-step pre-bending and hydroforming experiments were performed on 76. 2 mm (3. 0 ") OD tubes with a wall-thickness of 1. 85 mm (DP 600). Experiments were also performed on 1. 74 mm Interstitial Free (IF) steel tube, which provided a low strength, high formability baseline material for comparison purposes. A fully instrumented servo-hydraulic mandrel-rotary <b>draw</b> <b>tube</b> bender was used in the pre-bending experiments in which various levels of boost were applied. The results showed that increased boost reduced the major (tensile) strain and thinning at the outside of the bend. At the inside of the bend, the compressive minor strain became larger and thickening increased. Hydroforming of the straight and pre-bent tubes was conducted using various levels of load-control end-feed (EF). For both straight and pre-bend tube hydroforming, an increase in hydroforming EF resulted in increased burst pressure and corner-fill expansion (CFE). The effect of bending boost on CFE was also measured. For a given hydroforming EF case, a tube bent with greater boost achieved a higher burst pressure and consequently a greater CFE which increased the hydroformability of the material. Pre-bending was shown to consume a considerable amount of the formability of the tube in the hydroforming experiments. For the same EF case, the pre-bent tubes could only achieve a fraction of the straight tube CFE at burst. The pre-bending and hydroforming experiments were complimented by finite element simulation in the hope of providing additional insight into these processes. The finite element (FE) models were able to accurately predict the strain and thickness changes imposed during pre-bending. The models were able to accurately predict the CFE, EF displacement, and strain and thickness distributions after hydroforming. The extended stress-based forming limit curve (XSFLC) failure criterion was applied to predict failure (onset of necking) during hydroforming, which was measured as the burst pressure in the experiments. For straight tube hydroforming, the XSFLC predicted the correct failure pressure versus hydroforming EF load trend, but over predicted the failure pressures. In pre-bend hydroforming, the models were able to capture the effect of bending boost and hydroforming EF on the hydroformability of the tubes. The XSFLC was able to capture the drop in formability for bending versus straight tube hydroforming, but was unable to capture the failure pressure versus hydroforming EF load trend or magnitude. Further work is required to make the XSFLC applicable to straight and pre-bend hydroforming...|$|E

In this study, experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of cross section reduction on the microstructure and mechanical properties of variable thickness aluminium <b>tubes</b> <b>drawn</b> using two different position controlled mandrel techniques. Various tubes with three different outer diameters were subjected to cold drawing at room temperature from 11 percent to 41 percent cross section reduction. The local mechanical properties were determined from tensile tests carried out on specimens cut from different positions in the tubes parallel to their axes. The distributions of the Vickers hardness over the surfaces at 0 deg and 90 deg to the drawing direction were examined. It was found that the microhardness, yield strength, and ultimate tensile of the deformed samples increase and the corresponding elongation decreases with the increase of cross section reduction. Also, the anisotropy in microstructure and mechanical properties is more significant with increasing of cross section reduction. The evolution of mechanical properties of <b>drawn</b> <b>tubes</b> versus cross section reduction depends on the mandrel shapes and initial tube outer diameter.

40|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>drawing</b> is a {{well known}} process {{involving}} at room temperature the reduction of diameter and wall thickness to obtain specified values. The initial <b>tube</b> is <b>drawn</b> into a die of a smaller opening and its thickness achieved by use of a mandrel. Usually, the mandrel has a land area which diameter defines by sizing the inside diameter of the final tube. Some structural components found in cars, aircrafts and other vehicles require bent or hydroformed tubes of lower weight. It is of interest to have tubes of varying axial or circumferential thickness so that to reduce overweight in low stressed areas and reinforce it otherwise. However, the production of tubes of varying thickness is more difficult in reason notably of higher metal flow stresses in the deformation zone {{and the need to}} control precisely the mandrel position during drawing. Axial thickness variation is obtained using a mandrel with stepped lands or with a slight taper while circumferential variation is achieved with a mandrel of desired internal or external shape (e. g. oval). In this paper, two techniques for axial tube wall thickness variation and one technique for circumferential variations are introduced and tested. First, the techniques to produce <b>drawn</b> <b>tubes</b> with thickness variations are presented. For testing, a small (335 kN) instrumented <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> machine is used. Details on this machine, process lubrication, monitored data and on the tooling implemented are also presented. Initial tubes are mainly AA 6063 extrusions of 63. 5 mm O. D. and 2. 6 mm thick and the final outside diameter, i. e. the inside diameter of the die, is about 47. 5 mm. AA 6061 <b>tubes</b> are also <b>drawn.</b> Starting with drawing tests without mandrel, the natural flow of the <b>tube</b> and the <b>drawing</b> force involved are measured. Secondly, tubes of 4 different thicknesses are produced with a stepped mandrel and the strain hardening effect on mechanical properties established. Using a tapered mandrel, tubes of continuously varying wall thickness are tested. Higher local pressure in the die corner radius restricts proper lubrication in certain conditions but results are promising in most cases. We also study the effect of thickness rate of change along the tube. Finally, tests with a stepped oval mandrel provided good results for circumferential thickness variations. The dimensional quality is measured using a coordinate measuring machine and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests in both initial and <b>drawn</b> <b>tubes.</b> Finally, despite some minor problems, the techniques proposed can efficiently produce tubes with thickness variations and have a very strong potential for industrial use.
