5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
5|$|The first Space Shuttle {{flight to}} Mir was a {{rendezvous}} mission without docking on STS-63. This was followed {{during the course}} of the project by a total of 9 Shuttle-Mir docking missions, from STS-71 to STS-91. The Shuttle rotated crews and delivered supplies, and one mission, STS-74, carried a docking module and a pair of solar arrays to Mir. Various scientific experiments were also conducted, both on shuttle flights and long-term aboard the station. The project also saw the launch of two new modules, Spektr and Priroda, to Mir, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed NASA and the Roskosmos to learn a great deal about how best to work with international partners in space and how to minimize the risks associated with assembling a large space station in orbit, as would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with the ISS.|$|E
5|$|At Calakmul's {{peak in the}} 7th century, {{the polity}} was known as Kan. Interesting {{to know is that}} the title Kan was used at another place before Calakmul became a {{regional}} powerhouse. The Preclassic political state in the Mirador Basin also used the title Kan. There is the idea that, {{after the collapse of the}} Mirador state, its refugees migrated north towards Calakmul, where they founded a new Kan polity. However, epigraphical studies of the monuments at Calakmul show that prior to the 7th century AD the emblem glyph of Calakmul had nothing to do with a snake, but with a bat. It seems that a different polity ruled there. The Kan emblem glyph, before being associated with Calakmul, is found (once) at Dzibanché, a site more towards the east. Perhaps during the late 6th/early 7th century, the polity at Dzibanché moved to Calakmul in order to establish a more strategically placed capital. After Calakmul's power dwindled in the 8th century, after the rule of Yuknoom Took K'awiil, it appears that the bat emblem glyph made its resurgence. Still, many uncertainties remain and new epigraphical studies <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to fill the gaps.|$|E

Suggestions from adding toll lanes to general expansion to six lanes from the two lane bottleneck at SH 66 to SH 14 and adding multi-modal transportation options have been discussed.

25|$|Setting up an army {{after the}} war proved more {{difficult}} than predicted. To a certain extent, the authorities could rely on escaped German conscripts and Luxembourgers who had joined Allied armies; however, they {{had to find a}} way to train officers. Initially, British military advisers came to Luxembourg, where training was carried out by British officers and NCOs. But officer training, in the long term, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in military schools abroad. Belgium and France were both interested in helping and offered solutions. In the end, the government opted for a compromise solution, by sending some officer cadets to the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France and others to the Royal Military Academy in Belgium. This eventually led to disunity within the Luxembourg officer corps due to differences in training and promotion.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, the Canadian House of Commons debated {{changing}} {{the name of}} the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the Canadian Charter of Rights, Freedoms and Responsibilities.

[...] MacLellan replied that [...] "The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic society." [...] MacLellan added that section 1 implied a need for responsibilities, so [...] "It is not necessary to change the title of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between the individual's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of society." ...|$|E

[...] Modulation did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> at the output but {{could be applied to}} the signal before the final amplifier tube, so the microphone or other audio source didn't have to handle high power.
