5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that reports of terrorism should be sparse in dictator-ships, both because such violence {{is unlikely to}} result in policy change (Eubank and Weinberg, 1994; Pape, 2003; Kydd and Walter, 2006 a) {{and because it is}} difficult to get reliable information on attacks (Eubank and Weinberg, 1994; Drakos and Gofas, 2006 a,b; Abrahms, 2007). Yet, there is variance in the number of terrorist attacks reported in autocracies. Why? We argue that differences in the audience costs pro-duced by <b>dictatorships</b> explain why some non-democracies experience more terrorism than others. Terrorists are more likely to expect “success ” in <b>dictatorships</b> that gen-erate high domestic audience costs. Using data from multiple terrorism databases, we find empirical evidence that <b>dictatorships</b> generating higher audience costs—military <b>dictatorships,</b> single-party <b>dictatorships,</b> and dynastic monarchies—experience as much terrorism as democracies, while autocracies generating lower audience costs—personalist <b>dictatorships</b> and non-dynastic monarchies—face fewer attacks than their democratic counterparts...|$|R
40|$|What {{explains}} {{the variance in}} how authoritarian regimes treat labor? We advance a theory of why and how some <b>dictatorships</b> coopt workers using nominally democratic institutions, such as legislatures and political parties. When <b>dictatorships</b> need cooperation from society and face a potentially strong opposition, they attempt to coopt workers to reinforce their bases of support. As instruments of cooptation, legislatures and parties are useful in facilitating a political exchange between regimes and labor: <b>dictatorships</b> provide material benefits to workers in exchange for labor's quiescence. As a result, institutionalized <b>dictatorships</b> provide more benefits to workers and experience lower levels of labor protest than their noninstitutionalized counterparts. We find empirical support for these hypotheses from a sample of all <b>dictatorships</b> from the 1946 - 96 period...|$|R
5|$|Illia was deposed {{by a new}} {{military}} coup in June 1966, the Argentine Revolution. Alfonsín was detained while trying to hold a political rally in La Plata, and a second time {{when he tried to}} re-open the UCRP committee. He was forced to resign as deputy in November 1966. He was detained a third time in 1968 after a political rally in La Plata. He also wrote opinion articles in newspapers, under the pseudonyms Alfonso Carrido Lura and Serafín Feijó. The Dirty War began during this time, as many guerrilla groups rejected both the right-wing military <b>dictatorship</b> and the civil governments, preferring instead a left-wing <b>dictatorship</b> aligned with the Soviet Union, as in the Cuban Revolution. Alfonsín clarified in his articles that he rejected both the military <b>dictatorship</b> and the guerrillas, asking instead for free elections. The UCRP became the UCR once more; and the UCRI was turned into the Intransigent Party. Alfonsín created the Movement for Renewal and Change within the UCR, to challenge Balbín's leadership of the party. The military <b>dictatorship</b> finally called for free elections, allowing Peronism (which had been banned since 1955) to take part in them. Balbín defeated Alfonsín in the primary elections, but lost in the main ones. Alfonsín was elected deputy once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{a debate}} on the {{national}} question in Europe opened up between {{the majority of the}} SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, Albert Goldman and Felix Morrow.

In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions. The SWP's central committee argued that democratic capitalism could not revive, resulting in either military <b>dictatorship</b> by the capitalists or a workers' revolution. It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.|$|E

40|$|Nominally {{democratic}} {{institutions such as}} political parties and legislatures are common in <b>dictatorships,</b> which rely on them to maintain control of the state. Parties and legislatures provide a means through which <b>dictatorships</b> co-opt potential opponents, distribute rents to supporters and mitigate elite conflicts. Indeed, regimes with these institutions have longer tenures than those without them. Using evidence from postwar <b>dictatorships,</b> this study demonstrates that parties and legislatures also enhance the ability of authoritarian regimes to withstand leadership transitions. Transfers of power are inherently destabilizing. Yet we find that <b>dictatorships</b> with parties and legislatures are {{far less likely to}} be associated with instability because these institutions insulate regimes from the disruptive effects of unconstitutional leadership transfers...|$|R

40|$|Why do some <b>dictatorships</b> {{establish}} {{institutions that}} are typically associated with democracy, such as legislatures or political parties? We propose a new theoretical model of institutions and power-sharing in <b>dictatorships.</b> We argue that by facilitating power-sharing, political institutions promote the survival of <b>dictatorships.</b> However, authoritarian power-sharing through institutions is feasible only when it is backed by the crude but credible threat of a rebellion by the dictator's allies. Whereas the allies' political opportunities determine {{the credibility of the}} threat of a rebellion, institutions alleviate the commitment and monitoring problems that stem from the secrecy in authoritarian governance. We use both historical and large-N data to assess these new predictions about the relationship between political institutions, dictator tenure, and the concentration of power in <b>dictatorships.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{offer an}} answer {{to one of the}} most {{important}} questions about authoritarian politics today: why do <b>dictatorships</b> hold elections? In order to answer this broad question, I study the causes and consequences of elections as well as the role of elections in nondemocratic settings. First, I develop a theory about the causes of elections in <b>dictatorships,</b> which is based on the different threats that <b>dictatorships</b> face and the different goals that they have in order to lessen or avoid these threats. I argue that <b>dictatorships</b> opt for elections for the effective executive if they need to avoid violent removal. In contrast, <b>dictatorships</b> begin elections for a national legislature if they seek to maintain the unity and cohesion of elites in the ruling circle and/or to coopt elites from outside of the regime. Second, I present a theory about the consequences of elections in <b>dictatorships.</b> I contend that two seemingly competing effects of elections are mutually complementary. Individual elections can create a momentum for regime change, leading to the collapse of <b>dictatorships</b> and democratic transitions. At the same time, once <b>dictatorships</b> survive elections, election results convey useful information for the purpose of cooptation and send a signal that deters future challenges to the regime. Tests of my theory on a sample of <b>dictatorships</b> after World War II show robust support for my theory about the causes and consequences of elections. Finally, I revisit the information collection role of elections in nondemocratic settings. I theorize that elections can be either informative or less informative depending on the strategic decisions that major opposition parties make. I develop a formal theory to describe this causal mechanism. An important implication of my theory is that informative elections are associated with post-electoral redistribution of goods and patronage while less informative elections in which major opposition parties boycott elections are not. I test this implication by using original data collected from Serbia in 1990 s and present results that are consistent with my theory...|$|R

Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the <b>dictatorship</b> {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep them up to the inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the <b>dictatorship,</b> which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E

5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification.
