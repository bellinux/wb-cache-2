40|$|The term “good seamanship” {{is often}} used to {{describe}} the behaviour of <b>deck</b> <b>officers</b> who navigate according to a commonly accepted set of norms.

For training and evaluation of <b>deck</b> <b>officers</b> an objective assessment of performance is also of great advantage. The scope of the paper is to analyse how different measures can be used to describe navigation performance, and the relationship between these in different collision situations. During an extended simulator study with 50 <b>deck</b> <b>officers,</b> navigation performance was assessed while participants spent one complete week in navigation simulators.
