5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water,</b> and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{maximize}} the potential which lies <b>in</b> domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> heaters. Today the temperature function <b>in</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> tank is constant throughout the day and the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand is met by an electrical heater. Implementing a temperature which has the freedom to change in the tank, the energy demand can be met by both the energy stored <b>in</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> and the electrical heater. This means that if the electricity is expensive and the load on the mains are high, the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> heater can shift load the electrical consumption from this time period to another by benefiting from the energy storage. This should result in a cost reduction since the consumption of electricity is moved to a time period with cheaper electricity. In addition, the consumption from the consumers can be altered if the electrical storage is properly used. The main challenges with <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> tanks are the unpredictability of future demands and time varying electricity prices. The consumer is free to benefit from desired amounts of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> at any time of day. In addition, the future electricity prices are unknown. Despite these uncertainties the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> tank should always be able to deliver sufficient and <b>hot</b> enough <b>water.</b> To optimize the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> heater <b>in</b> a proposed optimal strategy was implemented for minimizing the electrical cost of heating water. The optimal operation was compared to other simple policies to see if they were better, worse or equally good strategies. From the result in the report the proposed strategy reduced the cost compared to all suggested policies. The highest savings were compared to having a constant temperature <b>in</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> tank. The electrical consumption was also proven to change if the policies were provided with the opportunity of benefiting from the energy stored in the water compared to only having electrical heating. This implies that one solution to shave the peak demands in the electricity is by utilising the energy stored <b>in</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R
