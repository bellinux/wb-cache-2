To evaluate the effect of e-beam and ethylene oxide sterilization on degradation and strength. e-beam-sterilized PLDLLA cages were shown to maintain mechanical strength for at least 6 months during degradation studies in vitro. Yet failure of the cages was observed after only 3 months in vivo. We hypothesized that degradation characteristics and mechanical strength could be improved by sterilizing the cages through ethylene oxide (EtO) instead of e-beam. PLDLLA cages were sterilized either by e-beam or EtO, and degraded in phosphate-buffered saline. Each month, cages were compressed until failure. <b>Inherent</b> <b>viscosity</b> was determined as a measure of degradation. For the in vivo evaluation, e-beam- or EtO-sterilized cages were implanted at L 3 -L 4 in a standardized goat model. After 3 or 6 months, retrieved segments were scanned by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Also, <b>inherent</b> <b>viscosity</b> of the polymer was measured. e-beam sterilization strongly decreased <b>inherent</b> <b>viscosity</b> of PLDLLA compared with EtO sterilization, but initial strength was only affected marginally.

Polymerization was performed via interfacial polymerization. The polymers {{were characterized by}} FTIR, 1 H NMR, TG and viscosity measurement. According to the thermo-analytical, the thermal degradations of polyamides were increased by introduction of bromine moieties into polymer backbone. These aliphatic polyamides have <b>inherent</b> <b>viscosities</b> {{in the range of}} 0. 19 - 0. 65 dL/g in H 2 SO 4 at 25 ºC. Solubility of these polymers also discussed. It is observed that polyamides with bromine increased flame-retardation and also these polymers may find use in a variety of click chemistry strategy because of azide functionality...|$|R
40|$|Yarns of {{different}} <b>inherent</b> <b>viscosities,</b> {{in the range}} 0. 6 - 1. 1 dL/g, spun in industrial plants, and drawn at room temperature to obtain mesomorphic samples, have been characterized. The evolution from the mesomorphic form toward the triclinic crystalline form has also been studied by combined differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA), and accurate wide angle X-ray diffraction experiments. The DMA analysis of the mesomorphic samples allows better resolution of the glass transition and crystallization phenomena, which are superimposed in the DSC scans. The degree of molecular orientation in the mesomorphic samples, and the temperature of crystallization from the mesomorphic form (60 - 80 -degrees-C), are essentially independent of the polymer molar mass.
