5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were <b>fixed</b> <b>and</b> provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage.

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. <b>Fixed</b> <b>and</b> drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E

5|$|In the story, Booster Gold {{is charged}} by Rip Hunter {{to go back}} in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the {{carnival}} shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the Joker torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to Booster that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are <b>fixed</b> <b>and</b> cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E
5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks {{about how much he}} will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now <b>fixed)</b> <b>and</b> Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{applications}} of 2-satisfiability {{have been made}} for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are <b>fixed</b> <b>and</b> each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge {{in order to avoid}} crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not <b>fixed,</b> <b>and</b> leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether {{it was a good idea}} to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E
5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is <b>fixed</b> <b>and</b> the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E
