50|$|The planned {{provocation}} {{took place}} e.g. {{in the presence}} of Leo Jud, Klaus Hottinger and Lorenz Hochrütiner, which all gained notoriety for Swiss reformation later. Froschauer himself published from 1525 on the Zürich Bible.The meal involved Swiss Fasnachtskiechli and some slices of sharp smoked <b>hard</b> <b>sausage,</b> which had been stored for more than a year. Though he himself did not eat the sausages, Zwingli was quick to defend Froschauer from allegations of heresy. In a sermon titled Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods), Zwingli argued that fasting should be entirely voluntary, not mandatory.According to Michael Reeves, Zwingli was advancing the Reformation position that Lent was subject to individual rule, rather than the discipline which was upheld at the time by the Catholic Church.|$|E

40|$|WO 200145917 A UPAB: 20010927 NOVELTY - Oriented tubular {{films are}} {{manufactured}} {{by using a}} spinning solution comprising a homogeneous solution of a mixture of cellulose and protein(s) in an n-methylmorpholine-n-oxide (NMMO) -water system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Manufacture of oriented tubular films includes extrusion of a spinning solution using a ring nozzle over an external air gap into a precipitation bath. The spinning solution includes a homogeneous solution of a mixture of cellulose and protein(s) in NMMO-water system. The homogeneous solution is produced by withdrawing {{the water of the}} solution until both the cellulose and protein are dissolved completely. USE - The invention is used to manufacture oriented tubular films used as biodegradable and compostable packaging materials (claimed). Particularly, the films are used as <b>sausage</b> skins for <b>hard</b> <b>sausages,</b> and as peelable skins (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The invention provides strong and flexible tubular films, which make expensive after treatment or surface treatment unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|The nutritive, textural, and sensory {{properties}} of commercial fresh rabbit sausages and their interactions were evaluated. The mean contents of moisture, protein, fat, ash, and carbohydrate were 43. 89 ± 1. 66 %, 9. 82 ± 2. 71 %, 22. 37 ± 1. 7 %, 2. 99 ± 0. 10 %, and 20. 94 ± 3. 05 %, respectively. Conversely, the mean values of hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness were 103. 36 ± 3. 48 [*]N, − 4. 54 ± 1. 58 [*]N[*]s, 3. 38 ± 0. 67 [*]mm, 0. 15 ± 0. 03, 16. 07 ± 3. 20 [*]N, and 55. 73 ± 20. 44 [*]N[*]mm, respectively. The moisture and protein contents showed significant negative correlation while three remaining nutritive properties showed significant positive correlation with textural properties (P< 0. 05 for all parameters). The score for nonparametric ranking of sensory properties like appearance/colour, flavour, juiciness, and tenderness ranged from 28. 28 to 38. 78, 29. 41 to 35. 91, 30. 06 to 37. 38, 26. 75 to 40. 69, and 29. 03 to 36. 75, respectively. In conclusion, rabbit sausages formulated with low quantities of moisture and protein result in <b>hard</b> <b>sausages</b> with low acceptability by sensory panellist. To improve the sausages, {{it is recommended}} that processors develop an optimal formulation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, Dr. Ancel Keys (a University of Minnesota physiologist) was {{assigned}} by the U.S. War Department to design a non-perishable, ready-to-eat meal that could fit in a soldier's pocket as a short-duration, individual ration. Keys went to a local supermarket to choose foods that would be inexpensive, but still be enough to provide energy. He purchased <b>hard</b> biscuits, dry <b>sausages,</b> <b>hard</b> candy, and chocolate bars. He then tested his 28-ounce, 3,200 calorie (871 gram, 13,400 kJ) meals on six soldiers in a nearby army base. The meals only gained [...] "palatable" [...] and [...] "better than nothing" [...] ratings from the soldiers, but were successful in relieving hunger and providing sufficient energy. The new rations were initially intended as individual rations suitable for short durations only, {{to be used for}} a maximum of fifteen meals before supplementation or replacement with 'A-ration' or 'B-ration' field rations. [...] They were soon called the [...] "paratrooper ration", since paratroopers were the first to be issued the ration on an experimental basis.|$|R

40|$|Fresh {{meat and}} fresh meat {{products}} {{available at the}} self-service counter at the supermarket are often packaged under a protective atmosphere with high oxygen content. These are la-belled “packaged in a protective atmosphere”. This kind of packaging is meant to warrant extended durability of the sensitive meat. If meat, which naturally contains cholesterol, comes into contact with oxygen, so-called cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) can be formed. A finalised assessment of {{the health effects of}} these on humans has not been com-pleted. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has been asked to assess the health risk of fresh meat packaged under a protective atmosphere with high oxygen content. The Institute has concluded that, according to the present state of knowledge, it is highly likely that consumers take in only small amounts of additional cholesterol oxidation products through these products. Meat packaged under a protective atmosphere thus poses no identi-fiable health risk. Cholesterol oxidation products can occur naturally in a variety of foods if the cholesterol con-tained in these reacts with the oxygen in the air. These include <b>hard</b> smoked <b>sausages</b> such as salami or raw ham as well as cooked meat which is stored for longer periods of time. It is known that COPs can develop when matured meat is produced traditionally. If this ubiquitous exposure of consumers to cholesterol oxidation products is taken into account, the additional intake through meat packaged in a protective oxygen atmosphere becomes insignificant...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, some {{fast food}} chains offer a counter in {{convenience}} stores. Instead of cooking {{food in the}} store, these counters offer a limited menu of items delivered {{several times a day}} from a local branch of the restaurant. Convenience stores may be combined with other services, such as general stores and pawn shops, a train station ticket counter, a post office counter, or gasoline pumps. In Asian countries, like Japan or Taiwan, convenience stores are more common because of the higher population density. They are found with gasoline and train stations, but also can be stand-alone stores. Here, items like soft drinks or snacks are sold. Hot dogs, <b>sausages,</b> <b>hard</b> boiled tea eggs, and fish cakes can be found in stores. Delicatessens are absent, instead pre-made sandwiches can be bought. Non-food products like magazines are also sold, but at a lesser extent. Many convenience stores also have a fountain that offers a variety of beverages such as coffee, soft drinks and frozen beverages.|$|R
40|$|The {{locus of}} {{innovation}} {{is not the}} individual firm anymore but increasingly the network in which the firm is embedded. Hence, in this paper innovation is investigated in the broader context of networks and applied to the traditional food sector. Networking refers to a process of identifying and acting on complementary interests with or without formal means of cooperation and {{plays an important role}} for the diffusion and adoption of innovations, because they increase the flow of information. Two main types of networks exist. Vertical networks relate to cooperation of partners belonging to the same chain. Meanwhile, horizontal networks refer to coopereation among firms which are primarily competitors. Data were collected during focus groups and in-depths interviews in three European contries: Belgium, Hungary, and Italy. In each country, data are collected from retailers/wholesalers, food manufacturers and suppliers in the beer, hard and half <b>hard</b> cheese, ham, <b>sausage,</b> or white paprika chain. In the investigated countries both vertical and horizontal networks exist. However, the intensity of using the network differs. On the one hand vertical networks are well developed based on quality assurance schemes and traceability, though these networks often face difficulties due to high lack of trust. On the other hand, horizontal networks are well developed when a producer consortium is involved. However, these networks can be inhibited through strong competition. The partners in traditional food networks focus mainly on innovation related to product characteristics such as new size, form and packaging without changing the traditional character of the product. The main barriers for innovation in the traditional food networks are the lack of understanding the benefits of networking activities for innovation, the lack of trust, the lack of knowledge of appropriate methods and skills, and the lack of financial and physical resources. Our study points out that successful SMEs use their networks to overcome lacks of knowledge and information and to create possibilities of joint use of resources. </span...|$|R
