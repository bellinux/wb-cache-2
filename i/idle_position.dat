5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E

50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the throttle plate rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold.

40|$|Since the {{workload}} of a manufacturing system changes over time, the {{material handling equipment}} used in the facility will be idle at certain time intervals to avoid system overload.

50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in <b>idle</b> throttle <b>position</b> also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|R

With the lever no longer restrained by the safety system, the copilot continued to hold the right throttle fully open. The combination of the right engine at full thrust in reverse and the left engine still at normal forward take-off thrust caused the aircraft to roll violently to the right and descend into the ground.|$|E

Nagano eventually got himself free, and even grasped the Pipe Slider with one hand, but he couldn't hold on. When he let go, the orange pipe slid a short ways down the track. With no choice but to generate as much momentum as he could, Nagano fell short of the pipe on his jump and plunged into the water.|$|E

30|$|To {{compute the}} {{efficiency}} (the value 1 corresponds to no idle time), the MTM value t_MTM for the handling time {{was taken as}} the optimal handling time. The reduced value for t_MTM had to be applied, because a modified experimental design of the workplace simplified the processing procedure. While for the standard conveyer belt system the idle time steadily increases, it decreases steadily for the divided conveyer belt with fixed input and almost vanishes completely if input is variable. The very high idle time at input position 2 is significant for a “fixed” input position. The {{reason for this is}} based on the origin of the vacant space, which is relatively narrow at this point in time. This makes further general cargo input difficult. The approach to realizing a bigger speed step at this point must be rejected on account of the subsequent speed steps. Although this table shows some relict of <b>idle</b> time at <b>position</b> 2 —there is still a minimal amount of mutual impediment—the system performance does almost entirely depend on the handling time only.|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} a robust two-state filter for infrared gas measurement, where the filter transmittance alternates between a single bandpass function, and a double-band offset reference.

Thus, no accurate electrical control is needed to operate the filter. The first test components operate at 2 mum wavelength using a displacement of 500 nm and an actuation voltage of 5 V. No sticking or change in filter characteristics have been observed after repeated pull-in operations. The simplicity of fabrication and operation is likely to make the two-state filter an attractive component for sensors such as non-dispersive infrared gas detector...|$|R
