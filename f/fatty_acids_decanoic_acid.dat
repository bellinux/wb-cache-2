40|$|The {{challenge}} in synthesising lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (NPs) is the shielding of lanthanide luminescence from the quenching ions around the NPs. In this work, {{the effects of}} chain length and surface grafting coefficient (average number of molecules per nm(2) (xi)) of functionalising fatty acids on the luminescence intensity of LaF 3 :Nd 3 + NPs were investigated. Nearly 14 -fold enhancements in luminescence intensity were observed as the oleic acid surface grafting coefficient increased from 0 to 5. 7. This increase in luminescence intensity is attributed to the shielding of the NP surfaces from surrounding quenching ions such as OH-, by the fatty acid molecules. In view of the changing ligand length, different <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> hexanoic acid, oleic acid, octanoic acid, and tetradecanoic acid) were used to functionalise the NPs. A 1 nm increase in fatty acid chain length resulted in a threefold increase in luminescence intensity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} yeast hulls (yeast ghosts) on {{sluggish}} or stuck white wine fermentations was studied. The enhancing effect on yeast growth and fermentation rate displayed by the hulls {{was shown to}} be similar to the effect provided by lipid extract from the same hulls. Unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and sterols were incorporated into the yeast from lipid extracts during fermentation carried out under oxygen-limited conditions. Adsorption of toxic medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>decanoic</b> <b>acid)</b> onto the yeast hulls took place through a dialysis membrane. However, when the hulls were placed inside a dialysis bag, the increase in yeast growth and fermentation rate seen when freely suspended hulls were used did not occur. Accordingly, the effect of yeast hulls in preventing stuck fermentations cannot be attributed only to the adsorption and consequent removal of medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from the juice...|$|R

40|$|Volatile compounds, {{affecting}} flavour {{of traditional}} and probiotic fresh cheese, were determined. Functional dairy product-fresh cheese was produced from milk of 2. 5 % fat content and milk of 4. 2 % fat content, under the semi-industrial conditions. The traditional starter culture Flora Danica (FD) and {{a combination of}} probiotic starter ABT- 1 and FD (ABT- 1 :FD= 1 : 1) were applied as starters. The volatile fractions were isolated by employing the combined simultaneous distillation-extraction technique (SDE). The compounds were identified by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified by using standard procedure. Following 19 compounds have been identified: 8 hydrocarbons (decane, undecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, octadecane and 2, 6, 10, 14 -tetramethyl hexadecane); 6 ketones (2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 - undecanone, 2 -pentadecanone, 2 -heptadecanone and 2 -tridecanone); 3 aldehydes (nonanal, tetradecanal and hexadecanal); 1 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>decanoic</b> <b>acid)</b> and disulfide, bis (1 -methylethyl). The highest levels were associated with hexadecanal, 2 -pentadecanone, 2 -tridecanone, and 2 -undecanone in all examined samples, regardless to the starter culture and type of milk used.

Vesicles of one such <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> are often used to model early membranes, but the mechanism by which <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> forms vesicles is not clear. Monolayer studies of the stability of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> on water surfaces may help illuminate the key molecular interactions that result in vesicle formation. To this end, consistent amounts of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> were deposited {{on the surface of}} aqueous salt and buffer solutions, and a variety of isotherms were collected with a Langmuir trough and Wilhelmy balance. Time versus surface pressure isotherms were analyzed and it was found that there was no statistical difference in the isotherms collected on 50 mM and 500 mM NaCl, indicating that the effects of salt on the phase behavior of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> might plateau at a lower concentration. However, the isotherms run on a Tris buffer substrate were statistically different from the isotherms at both salt concentrations.

40|$|Small {{intestinal}} movements {{depend on}} {{the composition of the}} chyme with mixing predominating at high nutrient levels and propulsion being prevalent at low nutrient levels. The mechanisms coupling nutrients to motility are unknown. We used computer analysis of video recordings of isolated guinea-pig duodenum, jejunum and ileum to examine movements induced by a <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Increasing intraluminal pressure past a threshold using control saline consistently evoked propulsive reflexes: lumen-occluding constrictions appeared at the oral end propagating at 20. 4 ± 2. 4 mm s− 1 (mean ±s. d., jejunum) to the anal end before being repeated until the intraluminal pressure was returned to control. Subthreshold pressure increases sometimes evoked a transient series of constrictions appearing at the oral end and propagating anally at 18. 4 ± 4. 7 mm s− 1 (jejunum). At basal pressures, <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> dose-dependently induced motor activity consisting of 40 – 60 s episodes of constrictions separated by 40 – 200 s periods of quiescence and lasting up to 2 h. Five contraction patterns were identified within episodes including localized stationary constrictions; constrictions that propagated slowly (5 – 8 mm s− 1) for short distances orally or anally; and constrictions that propagated orally or anally for the length of the preparation at 14 – 20 mm s− 1. <b>Decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> induced motor activity was reversibly abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 μm), hyoscine (1 μm) and hexamethonium (100 μm), but was insensitive to blockade of P 2 purinoceptors by PPADS (60 μm).

40|$|Cental Otago Pinot noir grapes from 2009 vintage were {{fermented}} as 18 kg microvinifications, using Saccaromyces cerevisiae var. bayanus yeast EC 118. The two treatments employed were {{nitrogen addition}} to supplement yeast requirements and aging artificially {{to assess whether}} any changes caused by the DAP additions were impacted by long-term storage. The resulting three levels of nitrogen were: Control 450 mg/L YAN, 600 mg/L YAN and 700 mg/L YAN. Half the wines were subjected to a short-term artificial ageing (6 weeks at 30 ° C) and then aged at 8 ° C for 8. 5 months. The remainder were naturally aged for 10 months at 8 ° C. The chemical composition of the treatment wines was investigated. Standard wine composition parameters were determined (e. g. alcohol, titratable acidity, residual sugar). HS-SPME-GC-MS methods were used to measure specific volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> esters and sulphides. A sensory panel of wine professionals {{was used to determine}} if there were sensory differences between the wine treatments. Statistical analysis on the chemical data using MANOVA, principal component analysis, and canonical variate analysis showed the following results: a) esters concentrations tended to decrease with nitrogen addition with the exception of ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, hexyl acetate and ethyl 2 methyl butanoate. Conversely, artificially aging the wines significantly increased the concentration of four esters and decreased hexyl acetate; b) <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations decreased with nitrogen addition with the exception of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which significantly increased. Artificial aging of the wines caused a significant increase in <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration; c) dimethyl sulphide (DMS) decreased across the DAP amendments, however DMS and methanethiol both increased with artificial aging. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the sensory data showed the participants could differentiate that the wines had age related differences. Any sensory effects from variations in DAP addition were not able to be perceived either because the variation was to subtle or overwhelmed by the more obvious differences caused by the artificial aging. The aged wines were described as more “mature”, “reduced”, “jammy” with less “floral, fruity” on the nose. Significant increases in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> with aging seems to be partially responsible for the maturity characteristics. PLSR results correlated it to the “spicy” characteristics. Ethyl octanoate and 2 methyl ethyl butanoate were related to “maturity” and ethyl decanoate and ethyl isobutyrate to “jammy”...|$|R
30|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is considered to}} be a major limitation in the biological production of sebacic <b>acid.</b> Notably, medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> including <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> were reported to be cytotoxic (Viegas et al. 1989; Stevens and Hofmeyr 1993; Green et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2013); these compounds can either kill microorganisms or inhibit their growth (Desbois and Smith 2010). Moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> is very low. For instance, the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was inhibited by 0.25  mM <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (Stratford and Anslow 1996) and even 12  μM <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> exhibited 17 % inhibition of growth in S. cerevisiae (Alexandre et al. 1996). Thus, the accumulation of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> inactivates the cells and ceases the production of sebacic <b>acid.</b> Furthermore, <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> remaining in the fermenter broth could cause foaming. Similar to the production of DCAs, the presence of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> in the fermenter can decrease the pH, and alkaline solution added to restore the pH in the fermenter (Hill et al. 1986) can react with the remaining <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> compounds to produce soap. This phenomenon is undesirable because it drastically increases the level of broth, even to the point of overflowing from the fermenter. It is, therefore, critical to maintain decanoic acid-free conditions during the biological production of sebacic acid.|$|R

This medium chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> is used in {{the production}} of creams and lotions in the personal care industry (Zielinska and Nowak 2014), as well as in {{the production of}} artificial flavors and aromas in the food and beverage industry (Saerens et al. 2008). In the pharmaceutical industry it is used as an antiviral and antimicrobial agent and also as a vasodilator (German and Dillard 2014). Additionally, it is applied in the textile industry and dyes production and is also useful in the production of synthetic rubber. It can be used as a plasticizer in the manufacture of a wide range of plastics and lubricating grease. In nature, capric acid can only be found in coconut oil, palm kernel oil and in goat, cow and human milks. Growing demand for those products around the world will require an increasing demand for capric acid in the next years, according to Global Capric Acid Market for Artificial Fruit Flavors and Perfumes, Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Syntheses (Lubricants, Greases, Rubber, Dyes, Plastics, etc.) 2014 — 2020 report (2016).

This {{study investigated the}} influence of a saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> capric <b>acid</b> (<b>decanoic</b> <b>acid),</b> on the formation of different lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in monoolein-based systems. The nanoparticles were characterized by synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential measurements. The addition of capric acid to monoolein triggered concentration dependent phase changes with the sequence evolving from an inverse primitive cubic phase to inverse double-diamond cubic, inverse hexagonal (HII), and emulsified microemulsions. SAXS and cryo-TEM revealed the formation of both single phase and mixed phases within a nanoparticle. To understand the cytotoxicity effects of the different nanoparticles, cellular cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays were performed. Nanoparticles in emulsion and hexagonal phases were found to be less toxic than cubic phase nanoparticles. The hemolysis assays followed the same trend with cubic phase dispersions causing the highest level of hemoglobin release. In summary, this study showed that the internal lyotropic liquid crystal mesophase structure of self-assembled nanoparticles needs careful consideration in the design of drug delivery vehicles...|$|R

These xylo esters {{were used as}} emulsifiers to formulate oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions by microchannel emulsification (MCE). Grooved and straight-through MCE was used to investigate the droplet generation and/or emulsion stability. Xylo ester-stabilized oil droplets were generated smoothly from microchannels arranged linearly or two dimensionally, while xylo ester-stabilized emulsions were less monodispersed owing to low surface activity of the xylo esters. The combined use of xylo esters (2. 5 % (w/w)) and Tween series (0. 1 % (w/w)) in the continuous phase can improve the monodispersity of the resultant oil. Successful droplet generation was achieved with the straight-through MCE using 2. 5 % (w/w) xylo laurate and 0. 1 % (w/w) Tween 20. The optimized combination of xylo laurate and Tween 20 inhibited coalescence and oiling off more efficiently than the droplets solely stabilized by Tween 20 during 30  days of storage...|$|R
40|$|Medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (octanoic and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> {{are well}} known as {{fermentation}} inhibitors. During must fermentation, the toxicity of these <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is enhanced by ethanol and low pH, which favors their entrance in the cell, resulting in a decrease of internal pH. We present here the characterization of the mechanisms involved {{in the establishment of}} the resistance to these <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The analysis of the transcriptome response to the exposure to octanoic and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids</b> revealed that two partially overlapping mechanisms are activated; both responses share many genes with an oxidative stress response, but some key genes were activated differentially. The transcriptome response to octanoic acid stress can be described mainly as a weak acid response, and it involves Pdr 12 p as the main transporter. The phenotypic analysis of knocked-out strains confirmed the role of the Pdr 12 p transporter under the control of WAR 1 but also revealed the involvement of the Tpo 1 p major facilitator superfamily proteins (MFS) transporter in octanoic acid expulsion. In contrast, the resistance to <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> is composite. It also involves the transporter Tpo 1 p and includes the activation of several genes of the beta-oxidation pathway and ethyl ester synthesis. Indeed, the induction of FAA 1 and EEB 1, coding for a long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A synthetase and an alcohol acyltransferase, respectively, suggests a detoxification pathway through the production of decanoate ethyl ester. These results are confirmed by the sensitivity of strains bearing deletions for the transcription factors encoded by PDR 1, STB 5, OAF 1, and PIP 2 genes...|$|R

Here we apply comprehensive metabolic profiling of serum samples from TBI patients and controls in two independent cohorts. The discovery study included 144 TBI patients, with the samples taken at the time of hospitalization. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; n= 22), moderate (moTBI; n= 14) or mild TBI (mTBI; n= 108) according to Glasgow Coma Scale. The control group (n= 28) comprised of acute orthopedic non-brain injuries. The validation study included sTBI (n= 23), moTBI (n= 7), mTBI (n= 37) patients and controls (n= 27). We show that two medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>decanoic</b> and octanoic <b>acids)</b> and sugar derivatives including 2, 3 -bisphosphoglyceric acid are strongly associated with severity of TBI, and most of them are also detected at high concentrations in brain microdialysates of TBI patients. Based on metabolite concentrations from TBI patients at the time of hospitalization, an algorithm was developed that accurately predicted the patient outcomes (AUC= 0. 84 in validation cohort). Addition of the metabolites to the established clinical model (CRASH), comprising clinical and computed tomography data, significantly improved prediction of patient outcomes. The identified ‘TBI metabotype’ in serum, that may be indicative of disrupted blood-brain barrier, of protective physiological response and altered metabolism due to head trauma, offers a new avenue for the development of diagnostic and prognostic markers of broad spectrum of TBIs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFirefly {{luciferase}} emits a {{burst of}} light when mixed with ATP and luciferin (L) {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This study compared the effects of long-chain n-alcohols (1 -decanol to 1 -octadecanol) and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>decanoic</b> to octadecanoic <b>acids)</b> on firefly luciferase. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were stronger inhibitors of firefly luciferase than n-alcohols. Myristyl alcohol inhibited the light intensity by 50 % (IC 50) at 13. 6 μM, whereas the IC 50 of myristic acid was 0. 68 μM. According to the Meyer-Overton rule, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are ∼ 12, 000 -fold stronger inhibitors than corresponding alcohols. The Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that myristic acid inhibited firefly luciferase in competition with luciferin, whereas myristyl alcohol inhibited it noncompetitively. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that an irreversible thermal transition occurred at ∼ 39 °C with a transition ΔHcal of 1. 57 cal g− 1. The ligand effects on the transition were evaluated by the temperature where the irreversible change is half completed. Alcohols decreased whereas <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> increased the thermal transition temperature of firefly luciferase. Koshland's transition-state theory (Science. 1963. 142 : 1533 – 1541) states that ligands that bind to the substrate-recognition sites induce the enzyme at a transition state, which is more stabilized than the native state against thermal perturbation. The long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> bound to the luciferin recognition site and stabilized the protein conformation at the transition state, which resisted thermal denaturation. Eyring's unfolding theory (Science. 1966. 154 : 1609 – 1613) postulates that anesthetics and alcohols bind nonspecifically to interfacial areas of proteins and reversibly unfold the conformation. The present results showed that alcohols do not compete with luciferin and inhibit firefly luciferase nonspecifically by unfolding the protein. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are receptor binders and stabilize the protein conformation at the transition state...|$|R

These seed oils, {{which are}} among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from {{specialized}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the sn- 2 and sn- 3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT 1 -type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT 1, from the transcriptome of C. avigera var pulcherrima developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (Camelina sativa) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT 1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10 : 0 -CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4 -fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT 1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT 1 with a C. viscosissima FatB thioesterase (CvFatB 1) that generates 10 : 0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10 : 0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT 1 and CvFatB 1 with the previously described CvLPAT 2, a 10 : 0 -CoA-specific Cuphea LPAT, increased 10 : 0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10 : 0 in the sn- 2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB 1 and CvLPAT 2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10 : 0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10 : 0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10 : 0 -rich seed oils...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a complex}} disease with a {{multifaceted}} pathophysiology. Impairment of energy metabolism is {{a key component of}} secondary insults. This phenomenon is a consequence of multiple potential mechanisms including diffusion hypoxia, mitochondrial failure, and increased energy needs due to systemic trauma responses, seizures, or spreading depolarization. The degree of disturbance in brain metabolism is affected by treatment interventions and reflected in clinical patient outcome. Hence, monitoring of these secondary events in peripheral blood will provide a window into the pathophysiological course of severe TBI. New methods for assessing perturbation of brain metabolism are needed in order to monitor on-going pathophysiological processes and thus facilitate targeted interventions and predict outcome. Circulating metabolites in peripheral blood may serve as sensitive markers of pathological processes in TBI. The levels of these small molecules in blood are less dependent on the integrity of the blood–brain barrier as compared to protein biomarkers. We have recently characterized a specific metabolic profile in serum that is associated with both initial severity and patient outcome of TBI. We found that two medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> octanoic and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> as well as several sugar derivatives are significantly associated with the severity of TBI. The top ranking peripheral blood metabolites were also highly correlated with their levels in cerebral microdialyzates.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that using petroleum-based fuels and chemicals is unsustainable, {{both in terms}} of their limited supply and hazardous greenhouse gas emissions. One alternative is to replace petroleum-derived liquid fuels such as gasoline with biofuels. Biofuels are energy-dense compounds such as medium-chain alcohols or <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> produced by microbes from plant-based feedstocks. Replacing fossil fuels with biofuels will have multiple beneficial impacts on the environment and economy, including carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas reduction, and generation of a renewable industry. Here, we engineer the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enhance its potential for biofuel production. Yeast are promising host organisms for many reasons. A sophisticated genetic toolkit is available, which allows for simple manipulation of metabolic pathways and strain characteristics. Industrial fermentations are well- established: S. cerevisiae are currently used to produce a variety of compounds, including bioethanol, amino acids, and therapeutics. In order for yeasts to become commercially viable production organisms for a range of biofuels, some challenges, need to be overcome, from limited production to product toxicity. Here, we used protein engineering methods to address some of these challenges and improve S. cerevisiae as a production organism. It is important to consider transport at the commodity scales relevant to fuel production. Biofuel efflux is particularly important because it drives production forward, reduces cellular toxicity, and is necessary for continuous process schemes. We therefore set out to understand how medium chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> exit the cell. We characterized the transporter Tpo 1 for activity on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> octanoic and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and identified two <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> substrate binding residues. Moreover, we showed that the native promoter gives the optimal expression level for <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> efflux. We also found that localization to the plasma membrane is sufficient for <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance and vacuolar localization is not necessary. We anticipate that this transporter will make an excellent target for increasing efflux of desired non-native substrates such as butanol. We also investigated the use of transporters to improve cytoplasmic acetyl- Coenzyme A A(AcCoA) levels. As many heterologous bioproducts are constructed from AcCoA by cytosolic enzymes, increasing cytoplasmic AcCoA concentrations should improve product titers. Our long-term goal is to use the AcCoA transporters AT- 1 and YBR 220 C to transport AcCoA directly from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. To this end, we found that the AT- 1 transporter is active in yeast and draws AcCoA into the endoplasmic reticulum. We have designed a suite of mitochondrial targeting tags to direct the transporters to the mitochondria, and are currently testing their effectiveness. We anticipate that the mitochondrially-located transporters will raise cytoplasmic AcCoA levels, and concomitantly improve product titers. Finally, to address potential issues from product toxicity, we explored the cellular effects of medium-chain alcohols on S. cerevisiae, and used protein engineering to reduce a toxicity response. Specifically, we found that medium chain alcohols, including n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and n-heptanol, inhibit translation initiation. Two mutations in translation initiation factors, Gcd 1 D 85 E and Sui 2 D 77 Y, both reduce inhibition of translation initiation, producing a stable, dominant medium chain alcohol tolerance phenotype. Interestingly, a range of mutations at positions 85 in Gcd 1 and 77 in Sui 2 improve medium chain alcohol tolerance.

The data were measured for acid mass fractions wacid = (0. 0149 to 0. 652) in the temperature range T = (375 to 412) K, and the phase transition occurred at pressures in the range p = (3. 7 to 11. 2) MPa. The data showed no temperature inversions yet does hint toward possible three-phase regions at low temperatures for acids with 10 or more carbon atoms. The data shows a linear relationship between the phase transition pressure and the temperature at constant composition. Additionally, for acids with 10 or more carbon atoms, at constant temperature and mass fraction, a linear relationship exists between the phase transition pressure {{and the number of}} carbon atoms. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

40|$|The coastal marine {{cyanobacterium}} Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 produces three amphiphilic siderophores, sy-nechobactins A-C, under iron-limiting growth conditions. The synechobactins {{are comprised}} of a citric acid back-bone linked to two 1, 3 -diaminopropane units. The terminal amine of one diaminopropane is acetylated and hy-droxylated forming one hydroxamate group. The terminal amine {{of the other}} diaminopropane is appended to {{one of a series}} of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and N-hydroxylated on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amide forming the second hydroxamate linkage. Synechobactins A-C differ among themselves in the identity of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> residue as dodecanoic <b>acid,</b> <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> or octanoic acid, respectively. They are the first structurally elucidated siderophores from marine cyanobacteria and are related to schizokinen, a previously identified siderophore that lacks amphiphilic character, isolated from other bacteria including freshwater cyanobacteria. Iron is an important limiting nutrient for many marine microorganisms. Although recent reports demonstrate that growth of marine autotrophic and heterotrophic microorgan-isms are limited by the low iron concentration (0. 02 – 1 nmol L 21) in much of the world’s surface ocean waters, the dom...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} ghrelin from the stomach of rainbow trout. Four isoforms of ghrelin peptide were isolated: the C-terminal amidated type of rainbow trout ghrelin (rt ghrelin) composed of 24 amino acids (GSSFLSPSQKPQVRQGKGKPPRV-amide) {{is a basic}} form; des-VRQ-rt ghrelin, which deleted three amino acids (V 13 R 14 Q 15) from rt ghrelin; and further two types of rt ghrelin that retained the glycine residue at the C terminus, rt ghrelin-Gly, and des-VRQ-rt ghrelin-Gly. The third serine residue was modified by octanoic <b>acid,</b> <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> or the unsaturated form of those <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> In agreement with the isolated peptides, two cDNAs of different lengths were isolated.

40|$|Abscisic <b>acid</b> (ABA) and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{inhibited}} shoot elongation and floral {{development of}} Dutch iris (Iris hollandica Hoog. cv Ideal) meristems cultured in vitro. No synergism {{with respect to}} inhibition of leaf growth between ABA and <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was observed. With monthly harvest dates, from July 10, 1981 to October 10, 1981, there was a progressive decrease in endogenous level of free ABA in `Ideal' iris bulbs. Bulbs subjected to {{a full set of}} the usual preplanting storage conditions flowered, on average, 46 days after planting versus 194 days after planting for bulbs planted directly after harvest. ABA levels at harvest were 4 - to 5 -fold those after the preplanting storage treatment. In general, ABA levels did not correlate well with the length of time from planting until flowering of iris bulbs. Endogenous <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> levels did not follow any pattern with respect to harvest date or postharvest treatment. After the postharvest high temperature treatment, there was about a 3 -fold increase in nonscale <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. <b>Decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> levels, in nonscale tissue, remained high after each of the other postharvest treatments.

30|$|In addition, low {{solubility}} of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> in water {{could become a}} critical issue during this biotransformation process. In fermenter broth, methyl decanoate can be hydrolyzed to <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and methanol using lipases and esterase of C. tropicalis (Galán-Ladero et al. 2010). Practically, maintaining pH of 7.5 could ensure the solubility of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Because the pKa value of <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was lower than 7.5, it existed in a dissociated form in the fermenter broth and reacted with NaOH.

The enzyme has a pI of 7. 39 +/- 0. 02 {{and consists of}} two non-identical subunits having apparent Mr values of 22, 000 and 24, 000. The enzyme is uniformly distributed in brain, and kinetic data at pH 6. 5 with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate suggest a random rapid-equilibrium mechanism. The kinetics of inhibition by product, by GSH analogues and by NADH {{are consistent with the}} suggested mechanism and require inhibitor binding to several different enzyme forms. Long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are excellent inhibitors of the enzyme, and values of 1 nKi for hexanoic <b>acid,</b> octanoic <b>acid,</b> <b>decanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and lauric acid form a linear series when plotted as a function of alkyl chain length. A free-energy change of - 1900 J/mol (- 455 cal/mol) per CH 2 unit is calculated for the contribution of hydrophobic binding energy to the inhibition constants. The turnover number of the purified enzyme dimer is approx. 3400 /min. When compared with the second-order rate constant for the reaction between CDNB and GSH, the enzyme is providing a rate acceleration of about 1000 -fold.
