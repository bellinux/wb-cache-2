40|$|The {{application}} of program transformations and refactorings involves {{the risk of}} capturing variables, which may break the intended semantics of the transformed code. One way to resolve variable capture is by renaming of the involved identifiers. However, in a modular context, the renaming of exported declarations is undesirable (affecting a module’s clients), and the renaming of <b>imported</b> <b>declarations</b> is impos-sible (requiring changes to third-party modules). We present an algorithm name-fix that detects and elimi-nates variable capture modularly. We extend a previous non-modular version of name-fix in order to (i) minimize re-namings of exported declarations, (ii) propagate necessary renamings of exported declarations to clients, and (iii) avoid renamings of <b>imported</b> <b>declarations</b> altogether. Together with support for transitive name bindings and conflicting declara-tions, our extensions to name-fix enable the application to real-world languages that feature separate compilation. To demonstrate the applicability of name-fix, we use it to mod-ularly resolve variable capture for optimizations, refactorings, and desugarings of Lightweight Java...|$|R

50|$|The {{requirements}} {{under the}} new Amendments are two-fold. First, the Lacey Act now makes it illegal to import into the United States plants that have been harvested contrary to any applicable Federal Law, State Law, Indian Tribal Law, or Foreign Law. If a plant is found to have been harvested {{in violation of the}} laws of the country where it was harvested, that plant would be subject to seizure and forfeiture if imported into the U.S. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful, beginning December 15, 2008, to import certain plants and plant products without a Plant and Plant Product <b>import</b> <b>declaration.</b>|$|R
50|$|The World Resources Institute, in {{partnership}} with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate <b>import</b> <b>declaration</b> information to U.S. government agencies.|$|R

40|$|Deficient {{visibility}} {{in global}} supply chains causes significant risks for the customs brokerage practices of freight forwarders. One {{of the risks}} that freight forwarders face is that shipping documentation might contain document fraud and is used to declare a shipment. Traditional risk controls are ineffective in this regard since the creation of shipping documentation is uncontrollable by freight forwarders. In this paper, we propose a data mining approach that freight forwarders can use to detect document fraud from supply chain data. More specifically, we learn models that predict the presence of goods on an <b>import</b> <b>declaration</b> based on other declared goods and the trajectory of the shipment. Decision rules are used to produce miscoding alerts and smuggling alerts. Experimental tests show that our approach outperforms the traditional audit strategy in which random declarations are selected for further investigation...|$|R
5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an <b>import</b> <b>declaration</b> form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} some factors that reduce evasion of customs duties in developing countries. Following the recent literature on customs evasion, we proxy customs fraud by discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Estimates first {{show that the}} more frequently a product is imported, the more customs fraud reduces. We argue that this result {{is indicative of the}} fact that customs officers use what they have learned from similar <b>import</b> <b>declarations</b> - use customs' internal information - to better assess the compliance of declarations. Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a pre-shipment inspection company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that pre-shipment inspections significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying. Results are robust to various robustness checks...|$|R
