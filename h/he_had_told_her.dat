500|$|Agent Tate (a Dane sent to England in 1941 {{and turned}} double shortly after) opened the operation, on 23 May, in {{a message to}} his German {{handlers}} stating that a friend from the US had identified an expeditionary force, consisting of six divisions, preparing to sail. On 29 May, Bronx sent a telegram identifying an invasion targeted at the Bordeaux region within a month, using the code [...] "dentist" [...] {{to say she was}} certain of the information. She also sent a follow-up letter explaining that the information came from a drunken British officer in the Four Hundred Club who had later sworn her to secrecy. According to Bronx, the officer had boasted about an airborne assault in the Bordeaux region that would be in the papers the following morning. The next day <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the operation had been delayed by a month.|$|E
500|$|Martello never {{produced}} any {{proof to}} support his claims, {{and there is no}} independent evidence that corroborate them. An anonymous woman who had known Martello informed the researcher Michael G. Lloyd that during the 1980s, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that he had never been initiated into a tradition of Witchcraft, and that he had simply embraced occultism in the 1960s in order to earn a living. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed criticism of Martello's claims, noting that it was [...] "extremely doubtful" [...] that a tradition of Wicca could have been passed down through Martello's Sicilian family. Instead, he suggested that Martello might have been instructed in a tradition of folk magic that he later embellished into a form of Wicca, that the cousins themselves had constructed a form of Wicca that they passed on to Martello, or that the entire scenario had been a fabrication of Martello's.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Catherine Deneuve has {{provided}} another anecdote illustrating {{this aspect of}} Buñuel's style: while shooting Tristana, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> frequently of the distaste he felt for the [...] "touristy" [...] side of Toledo, where the film was made, so she teased him about one crane shot that brought out {{the beauty of the}} surrounding landscape, to which Buñuel responded by re-shooting the entire scene from a dolly with no background whatsoever, all the while inveighing against the [...] "obviously" [...] beautiful.|$|E

60|$|His {{emphasis}} of the pronoun was very eloquent. Not in all {{the words of the}} French language could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> better how high he placed her in his thoughts, how utterly she must fall, how unutterably be soiled by an alliance with Tressan.|$|R
2500|$|In 1993, Phelps {{appeared}} on a first-season episode of the talk show Ricki Lake, alleging that homosexuals and [...] "anyone who carries the AIDS virus" [...] deserved to die. When Phelps and his son became increasingly belligerent, Lake ordered the Phelps family to leave the studio. During a commercial break, the two were forced off the set and escorted {{out of the building}} by security. After Phelps died, Lake tweeted that when he had been on the show, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that she worshipped her own rectum — a remark that led her to take action off-stage to have Phelps removed from the set.|$|E
2500|$|Sutton {{committed}} suicide by {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} on March 16, 2009, apparently to avoid a federal prison term due to begin a few days later. His wife Pam, whom he had married about two years before his death, returned home from running errands and discovered her husband in his green Ford Fairmont (which was still running) {{at the rear of}} their property in Parrottsville, Tennessee. Mrs. Sutton said, [...] "He called it his three-jug car because he gave three jugs of liquor for it." [...] His daughter said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> in advance that he would commit suicide rather than go to jail.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Parasite", Bennet is {{questioned}} by Thompson; {{he claims that}} {{the last thing he}} remembers is driving home Sandra from the hospital. Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as he told her to do; and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> everything about what he really did, who he works for, and what happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to [...] "clean up" [...] Isaac's mess. Upon his return home, Bennet tells Sandra that they both have to pretend that they have no idea what has happened, and that Primatech has to be stopped for good to ensure Claire's safety. [...] "Sandra" [...] then transforms back into Candice, {{and other members of the}} Company, including Thompson, enter the room behind her.|$|E

5000|$|The song is an up-tempo track, sung {{from the}} {{perspective}} of a man telling a girl that her lover is no good for her. He reminds <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> this before and that she should [...] "give it current relationship up" [...] in favour of one with him. Clouseau also recorded the song in an English-language version, as [...] "Give It Up", featured on their first international album Close Encounters.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sedation}} concerned {{people in}} Russia {{as well as}} the West that the former Soviet Union was returning to its Cold War-era methods of silencing dissent. Tylik said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> six days before the disaster that the submarine had [...] " [...] 'death onboard,' but he didn't explain what he meant." [...] "I am sure that the commanders of the Northern Fleet knew that the torpedoes were not in order. Those who are guilty must be punished. Navy officials in Vidyayevo later confirmed to The Times and to The St. Petersburg Times that she was given a sedative. [...] "We've been giving sedatives to relatives since this began, and it is not such a big deal as you make it out to be in the West," [...] said an officer who would not identify himself. [...] "We are simply protecting the relatives from undue pain – it was for her own protection." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miranda was retried in 1967 {{after the}} {{original}} case against him was thrown out. This time the prosecution, instead of using the confession, introduced other evidence and called witnesses. One witness was Twila Hoffman, a woman with whom Miranda was living {{at the time of}} the offense; she testified that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of committing the crime. Miranda was convicted in 1967 and sentenced to serve 20 to 30 years. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed, and the United States Supreme Court denied review. Miranda was paroled in 1972. After his release, he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers' [...] "Miranda cards" [...] which contained the text of the warning, for reading to arrestees. He was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar on January 31, 1976. A suspect was arrested, but he, unlike Miranda, exercised his right to remain silent. With no evidence against him, he was released.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 23, 1855, after {{the rest of his}} family had gone to bed, Robert Newsom came to Celia’s cabin, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> he would. Celia made an attempt to reject his sexual advances, and when he refused to back down, she clubbed him over the head with the stick that she had brought into her cabin earlier that day. After she hit him the first time, he reached out his arms as if he was trying to grab her and she clubbed him a second time, killing him. She then moved his body into her {{fireplace}} and {{spent the rest of the}} night burning his remains. She crushed some of Newsom’s smaller bones with a rock, and hid the bones that were too big to crush “under the hearth, and under the floor between a sleeper and the fire-place.” The next morning, Celia enlisted the help of Newsom’s grandson, twelve-year-old Coffee Wainscott, in scattering the ashes of Robert Newsom. According to Coffee’s testimony, Celia told him “she would give [...] two dozen walnuts if [...] would carry the ashes out.” ...|$|E

When he rescues Kathy, he is considered a hero. In the aftermath, journalists appear in Kathy's Diner, wanting information about Graham. Sarah Sugden asks Pollard why he didn't warn her there were journalists there but Pollard verbally attacks her, angrily asking why should <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> when she and the [...] "rest of them" [...] never believed him about Graham in the first place.|$|R
