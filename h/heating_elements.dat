5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the <b>heating</b> <b>elements,</b> a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Natural convective heat transfer from a square horizontal flat isothermal <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> imbedded in a larger flat square adiabatic surface with a square flat horizontal adiabatic surface mounted parallel to the heated surface at a relatively short distance from it has been numerically studied. The surface of the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> {{is in the same}} plane as the surface of the surrounding adiabatic material. The square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> considered in this study is at a higher temperature than that of the surrounding fluid. Both the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing upwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is above the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (upward facing case) and the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing downwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is below the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (downward facing case) have been considered. The situation considered is a simplified model of some situations that arise in engineering practice examples occurring in some electrical and electronic component cooling problems. In this study, the range of conditions considered is such that laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows occur. The {{purpose of this study was}} to numerically determine how the heat transfer rate from the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> varies with the distance of the adiabatic covering surface from the <b>heated</b> <b>element.</b> The solution was obtained by numerically solving the governing equations subject to the boundary conditions using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT© using the kepsilon turbulence model with full account being taken of buoyancy force effects. Because of the applications that motivated this study, results have been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74, i. e., effectively the value for air. The effect of the dimensionless distance between the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> and the cover on the variation of the Nusselt number with Rayleigh number has been studied in detail for both the upward and the downward facing cases. dc 201...|$|R
