5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E

25|$|The PackML (Packaging Machinery Language) sub-committee’s {{focus was}} to develop a method to quickly {{integrate}} a line of machines without concern on what field bus (protocol & media-the domain of the PackConnect sub-committee) was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> the data set between machines, SCADA and MES. After several iterations the approach taken was to extend the ISA S88 Part 1 State Model concept to the Packaging Industry. Later in the development process, the concept of PackTags was introduced to provide a uniform set of naming conventions for data elements used within the state model. PackTags are used for machine-to-machine communications; for example between a Filler and a Capper. In addition, PackTags were designed to address OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations. PackTags can be used to provide data exchange between machines and higher level information systems like Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Information Systems.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, {{officers}} from the Emergency Response Unit were present when National Surveillance Unit detectives shot and killed an armed raider in Lucan, Dublin after he attempted to hold-up a cash-in-transit van. 27-year-old Gareth Molloy, who had previous criminal convictions, and his gang were under surveillance by the NSU {{for a number of}} weeks prior to the incident. Gardaí received intelligence that the gang were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out a heist, and the NSU were backed-up by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), Organised Crime Unit (OCU) and ERU. When Molloy and a gang associate attempted to hold-up a cash delivery van at gunpoint and fired a shot in the air, NSU detectives intervened and ordered the armed raiders to drop their weapons. Gareth Molloy pointed a sawn-off shotgun in the direction of armed Gardaí and was immediately fired upon by NSU officers and was fatally wounded. His associate refused to drop his weapon, and was also shot, but survived with serious injuries. 5 shots were fired by Gardaí in total. No one else was hurt. Four other gang members were arrested, charged and jailed following a pursuit {{in the aftermath of the}} incident.|$|E

500|$|Before Phantasmagoria was released, CompUSA, the nation's largest {{discount}} computer retailer, notified Sierra {{it would}} not stock the game. The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton: [...] "Software comes out all the time. Some we buy, some we don't. This one we chose not to." [...] Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game. Lee S. Isgur of Jefferies & Co., a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry, said CompUSA's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game, {{and that it could}} in fact help it generate publicity. He added that [...] "It's probably one of the bloodiest games ever." [...] Likewise, Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said, [...] "When you say you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> something, of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it's all about." [...] Roberta Williams said of CompUSA's announcement: [...] "I'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product." [...] Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock Phantasmagoria, but others like Walmart continued to carry it.|$|E
500|$|The adult defendants, {{facing the}} death penalty, portrayed {{themselves}} at trial as unwilling {{participants in the}} conspiracy. [...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, {{you have to be}} quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E

40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs: 2014 / 2015 The {{main idea}} is to explore {{colchicine}} derivatives as potential inhibitors of cellular division. It has been explained that colchicine is an antimitotic compound which stops or inhibits the cellular division. The main problem is that colchicine has a narrow therapeutic margin, which means that efficient and toxic doses are very similar. This research line is focused in the developing derivatives of colchicine with better therapeutic margin and improved antitumor activity. In addition, more tests are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> out {{in order to determine}} if these new compounds have inhibition abilities over certain genes related to cancer activities. In this case, modifications over the acetamide group of the colchicine are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> and it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be substituted with different regioisomers of chlorobenzoic acid. Hence, the objectives are: Synthesis of colchicine derivatives from 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -chlorobenzoic acid. Evaluation of the biological activity of synthesized compounds...|$|R

2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
