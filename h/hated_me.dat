500|$|... "The Darkness" [...] had {{the desired}} effect; Lineberger wrote that [...] "I {{was taken aback}} by the dark tone and {{emotional}} range generated by this episode. Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters as though I know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling." [...] Abramowitz said that Tessa's death strongly angered many viewers, and that [...] "...people <b>hated</b> <b>me</b> for killing her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} were simple and {{limited by the}} budget. The {{on-screen}} blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds [...] "Grandpa". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood {{to come out of}} its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was [...] "virtually solid" [...] by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface decapitates Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within [...] of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that [...] "everyone <b>hated</b> <b>me</b> {{by the end of the}} production" [...] and that [...] "it just took years for them to kind of cool off." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God <b>hated</b> <b>me</b> and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." [...] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac. In concluding her post, she wrote, [...] "Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this." ...|$|E

500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who <b>hated</b> <b>me</b> in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E
2500|$|On the Season 5 premiere {{episode of}} Secret Lives of the Super Rich, Lynsi Snyder, the then-33 year old {{heir to the}} In-N-Out chain, {{revealed}} that she had two Biblical-related tattoos. One of Matthew 6:10 in Aramaic: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.” The other of Hebrew characters to represent the word [...] "hated," [...] which reportedly refer to John 15:18: “If the world hates you, know that it <b>hated</b> <b>me</b> before.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Robertson also co-wrote a {{song with}} Lynott, [...] "Borderline", {{for which he}} did receive a writing credit. He later {{revealed}} that the song was written about a girlfriend: [...] "I was really in love, [...] she <b>hated</b> <b>me.</b> I was extremely down when I wrote it." [...] Alcock confirmed that Robertson had significant lyrical input on this track, and that the band's other guitarist Scott Gorham had similar influence on the lyrics for [...] "Sweet Marie".|$|E

2500|$|In his 1988 autobiography, LaRouche {{says the}} raid on his {{operation}} {{was the work}} of Raisa Gorbachev. In an interview that same year, he said that the Soviet Union opposed him because he had invented the Strategic Defense Initiative. [...] "The Soviet government <b>hated</b> <b>me</b> for it. Gorbachev also hated my guts and called for my assassination and imprisonment and so forth." [...] He asserted that he had survived these threats because he had been protected by unnamed U.S. government officials. [...] "Even when they don't like me, they consider me a national asset, and they don't like to have their national assets killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{holding the}} press conference, Litvinenko was {{dismissed}} from the FSB. Later, {{in an interview}} with Yelena Tregubova, Putin said that he personally ordered the dismissal of Litvinenko, stating, [...] "I fired Litvinenko and disbanded his unit ...because FSB officers should not stage press conferences. This is not their job. And they should not make internal scandals public." [...] Litvinenko also believed that Putin was behind his arrest. He said, [...] "Putin had the power to decide whether to pass my file to the prosecutors or not. He always <b>hated</b> <b>me.</b> And there was a bonus for him: by throwing me to the wolves he distanced himself from Boris [...] in the eyes of FSB's generals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fox {{has spoken}} {{extensively}} {{of her time}} in education; that in middle school she was bullied; consequently she ate lunch in the bathroom to avoid being [...] "pelted with ketchup packets". She said that the problem was not her looks, but that she had [...] "always gotten along better with boys" [...] and that [...] "rubbed some people the wrong way". Fox also said of high school that she was never popular and that [...] "everyone <b>hated</b> <b>me,</b> and I was a total outcast, my friends were always guys, I have a very aggressive personality, and girls didn’t like me for that. I’ve had only one great girlfriend my whole life". In the same interview, she mentions that she hated school and has [...] "never been {{a big believer in}} formal education" [...] and that [...] "the education I was getting seemed irrelevant. So, I was sort of checked out on that part of it".|$|E
