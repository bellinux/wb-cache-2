40|$|Abstract Background The main {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} is that Oxpentifylline administration will effectively treat erythropoietin- or darbepoietin-resistant anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients. Methods/design Inclusion criteria are adult patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (including dialysis patients) with significant anaemia (haemoglobin ≤ 110 g/L) for at least 3 months for which there is no clear identifiable cause and that is unresponsive to large doses of either erythropoietin (≥ 200 IU/kg/week) or darbepoetin (≥ 1 μg/kg/week). Patients will be randomized 1 : 1 to receive either placebo (1 tablet daily) or oxpentifylline (400 mg daily) per os for a period of 4 months. During this 4 month study period, haemoglobin measurements will be performed monthly. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in haemoglobin level between the 2 groups at the end of the 4 month study period, adjusted for baseline values. Secondary outcome measures will include <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agent dosage, Key's index (<b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agent dosage divided by haemoglobin concentration), and blood transfusion requirement.

40|$|Aim: Anemia {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} among patients wait-listed for renal transplant, and management with blood transfusion or erythropoietin stimulating agents may impact transplant wait time. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the impact of blood transfusion and <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agent therapy on renal transplant wait time. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all adult patients listed for first deceased donor kidney transplantation at two transplant centers in Central Pennsylvania between 2004 and 2008. The exposures of interest were blood transfusion and erythropoietin stimulating agent therapy. Cox proportional hazards were used to model time to deceased donor kidney transplant. Results: Among 407 patients listed for transplant, 84 received a deceased donor kidney during a median follow-up of 26. 3 months. In an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, with <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agent and transfusion both treated as time-dependent exposures, UNOS inactive status at listing date (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 81; 95 % CI 0. 73 - 0. 89; P < 0. 001) and transfusion during the wait list period (HR 0. 27; 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 69; P = 0. 01) independently predicted longer transplant wait time. <b>Erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agent use prior to or after transplant wait listing date did not independently predict wait time.

40|$|Modulation of {{the immune}} {{response}} against tumour cells is emerging as a valuable approach for cancer treatment. Some experimental {{studies have shown that}} secretion of colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factors</b> by cancer cells reduces their tumorigenicity and increases their immunogenicity probably by promoting the cytolitic and antigen presenting activities of leukocytes. We have observed that human colon cancer cells (HT- 29) are able to secrete granulocyte-macrophage-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor,</b> granulocyte-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> and macrophage-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> when <b>stimulated</b> with cytokines (IL- 1 β and TNF-α).

Cytokine-induced release of granulocyte-macrophage-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor,</b> granulocyte-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> and macrophage-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> was significantly increased by cisplatin and 6 -mercaptopurine.

40|$|We {{reported}} previously that {{stimulation of}} glycoprotein 130 (gp 130) {{by a combination}} of human IL- 6 and soluble IL- 6 receptor (sIL- 6 R) could support proliferation, differentiation, and terminal maturation of erythroid cells in the absence of erythropoietin (EPO) from human CD 34 + cells in culture with stem cell factor (SCF). This observation suggested that differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to erythroid cells progressed according to an intrinsic program and that EPO receptor (EPOR) could be replaced by other cytokine receptors. In other words, EPOR appeared to be dispensable for erythropoiesis. Here we examined the role of EPOR in <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulated</b> by SCF, sIL- 6 R, and IL- 6. Surprisingly, reduction of EPOR expression using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides suppressed <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulated</b> not only by SCF and EPO, but also by SCF, sIL- 6 R, and IL- 6. EPO mRNA was detected in erythroid cells but not myeloid cells cultured in the presence of SCF, sIL- 6 R, and IL- 6. Furthermore, high concentrations of anti–EPO-neutralizing antibody abrogated erythropoiesis in cultures without exogenous EPO. Based on these results, we suggest that erythroid progenitors themselves secrete EPO and that they have the potential to differentiate and mature in response to this endogenous EPO...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnemia is a {{frequent}} complication in cancer patients, both at diagnosis and during treatment, with a multifactorial etiology in most cases. Iron deficiency {{is among the most}} common causes of anemia in this setting and can develop in nearly half of patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Surprisingly, this fact is usually neglected by the attending physician in a way that proper and prompt investigation of the iron status is either not performed or postponed. In cancer patients, functional iron deficiency is the predominant mechanism, in which iron availability is reduced due to disease or the therapy-related inflammatory process. Hence, serum ferritin is not reliable in detecting iron deficiency in this setting, whereas transferrin saturation seems more appropriate for this purpose. Besides, lack of bioavailable iron can be further worsened by the use of <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agents that increase iron utilization in the bone marrow. Iron deficiency can cause anemia or worsen pre-existing anemia, leading to a decline in performance status and adherence to treatment, with possible implications in clinical outcome. Due to its frequency and importance, treatment of this condition is already recommended in many specialty guidelines and should be performed preferably with intravenous iron. The evidences regarding the efficacy of this treatment are solid, with response gain when combined with <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agents and significant increments in hemoglobin as monotherapy. Among intravenous iron formulations, slow release preparations present more favorable pharmacological characteristics and efficacy in cancer patients...|$|R

Five patients have been excluded from the {{analysis of}} mortality (four received renal transplantation, one changed dialysis center). Twenty tree deaths have been noted during first year of dialysis treatment. Nine of them occurred {{during the first three}} months of therapy. The leading cause of death was cardio-vascular events (n = 14, 60. 9 %), the second was malignancy (8, 34, 8 %), one patient died due to catheter associated infection. Malignancy as a cause of end-stage renal disease, lack of outpatient nephrology care, acute mode of beginning renal replacement therapy and lack of <b>erythropoiesis</b> <b>stimulating</b> agents therapy were associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality during first year of dialysis.

Objective and methods: Systematic review of literature reporting the use of granulocyte-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> to allow rechallenge or continuation of clozapine in people with previous episodes of clozapine-induced neutropenia. The efficacy of granulocyte-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> and predictors of successful rechallenge will be determined to elucidate whether evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding the use of granulocyte-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> in this context. Results: A total of 17 articles were identified that reported on clozapine rechallenge with granulocyte-colony <b>stimulating</b> <b>factor</b> support. In all, 76 % of cases were able to continue clozapine at median follow-up of 12 [*]months. There were no clear clinical or laboratory predictors of successful rechallenge; however, initial neutropenia was more severe in successful cases compared to unsuccessful cases. Cases co-prescribed lithium had lower success rates of rechallenge (60 %) compared to those who were not prescribed lithium (81 %). The most commonly reported rechallenge strategy was use of filgrastim 150 – 480 [*]µg between daily to three times a week.
