25|$|The Junkers Ju 49 was {{developed}} entirely to investigate techniques for flight at high altitude. To this end, {{it had a}} specially developed engine and the first pressurized cabin in a German aircraft. The engine was the Junkers L88a, which combined two six-cylinder inline L8 motors into an upright V-12 and had a two-stage supercharger plus intercooler to sustain power at high altitudes. It produced 522kW (700hp) at about 5,800m (19,000ft). This engine drove a large <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> The pressure cabin held the two crew. The original intention was for operation at about 6,000m (20,000ft).|$|E
25|$|Armament {{comprised}} two fuselage-mounted, synchronized 12.7mm (.50in) {{machine guns}} — a potentially difficult challenge to synchronize properly, {{due to the}} Hayate's <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> — and two wing-mounted 20mm cannon, a considerable improvement over the two 12.7mm (.50in) machine guns used in the Hayabusa. Defensive armor offered Hayate pilots better protection than the unsealed wing tanks and light-alloy airframe of the Ki-43. In addition, the Ki-84 used a 65mm (2.56in) armor-glass canopy, 13mm (.51in) of head and back armor, and multiple bulkheads in the fuselage, which protected both the methanol-water tank (used to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} supercharger) and the centrally located fuel tank.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{undercarriage}} was redesigned from the Typhoon, featuring lengthened legs and a wider track (16ft/4.9m) to improve stability {{at the high}} landing speed of 110mph (177km/h), and to allow tip clearance for a new de Havilland 14ft (4.26m) diameter <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> The {{main undercarriage}} units were Dowty levered suspension units incorporating trunnions which shortened the legs as they retracted. The retractable tailwheel was fully enclosed by small doors and could be fitted with either a plain Dunlop manufactured tyre, or a Dunlop-Marstrand [...] "twin-contact" [...] anti-shimmy tyre.|$|E

2500|$|The Jaguar-engined first prototype, {{registered}} as G-ABEZ [...] flew on 22 January 1931, piloted by Cyril Uwins. It flew under the experimental registration R-3 during 1931 and received its airworthiness certificate that December. A planned Baltic sales tour was disrupted by disputes over engine-manufacturing licensing rights. In the meantime Air Ministry {{interest in the}} Type 118 had increased and they hired [...] "R-3", now powered by a Mercury V, fitted with a <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> and stripped of armament for endurance and desert trials (in Iraq) of that engine from February 1932. During this time, the Type 118 wore RAF markings with the serial number K2873. After these trials, this aircraft returned to Filton and was stored until April 1935 when it {{was used as a}} testbed for the engine that became the two-speed supercharged Bristol Pegasus XVII.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 1943, {{the first}} Tempest Mk.II, LA602, flew {{powered by a}} Centaurus IV (2,520hp/1,879kW) driving a <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> LA602 {{initially}} flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This {{was followed by the}} second, LA607, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: LA607 was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four blade propeller was replaced with a five blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to [...] "tropicalise" [...] all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{came from}} four Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines, coupled {{together}} in pairs in a [...] "power system" [...] {{known as the}} DB 606, weighing 1.5 metric tonnes apiece. [...] The DB 606 [...] "power systems" [...] were originally developed for both the single-"engined" [...] Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft, and the Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber, but the Me 261's design housed the DB 606 [...] "power systems" [...] in nacelles that afforded significantly better access for maintenance and ventilation for the [...] "twinned" [...] DB 601 component engines in each one, than the Heinkel heavy bomber possessed. Each pair drove a variable-pitch propeller, each {{meant to be a}} pair of counter-rotating propellers as the He 177A used (for the fourth prototype onwards), each <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller</b> being driven through a gearbox shared between each of the [...] "twinned" [...] DB 601 engines forming the [...] "power system", generating 2,700PS (1,985kW) each.|$|E

2500|$|A {{total of}} six prototypes were ordered; two were to be powered by Rolls-Royce Griffon engines, two with Centaurus XXIIs, one with a Centaurus XII and one as a test structure. Hawker used the {{internal}} designations P.1019 and P.1020 respectively for the Griffon and Centaurus versions, while P.1018 was also used for a Fury prototype which was to use a Napier Sabre IV. [...] The first Fury to fly, on 1 September 1944, was NX798 with a Centaurus XII with rigid engine mounts, powering a Rotol <b>four-blade</b> <b>propeller.</b> Second on 27 November 1944 was LA610, which had a Griffon 85 and Rotol six-blade contra-rotating propeller. By now development of the Fury and Sea Fury was closely interlinked so that the next prototype to fly was a Sea Fury, SR661, described under [...] "Naval Conversion." [...] NX802 (25 July 1945) was the last Fury prototype, powered by a Centaurus XV. LA610 was eventually fitted with a Napier Sabre VII, which was capable of developing 3,400–4,000hp (2,535–2,983kW); this aircraft become possibly the fastest piston-engined Hawker aircraft after reaching a speed of around 485mph (780km/h).|$|E
