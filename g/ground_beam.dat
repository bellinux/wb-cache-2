40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of Quantum Communication in free space and space, pointing out how ESA Galileo constellation could be strengthens into an Optical Quantum Communication Network (OQCN), by the employment of a compact and low cost prototype (SaNe-QKD OPT). Considering table 2 according the guidelines of [70] (2012) for the European Quantum Information Processing and Quantum Communication, three crucial long term goals are fulfilled, (Satellite Quantum Communication, besides 1000 kilometers of spatial Quantum Cryptography, multi-node Quantum Network), with reference to Galileo constellation: the new devised OQCN will perform Quantum Communication between approaching satellites of the constellation in multi-node mode, and Quantum Key Distribution scheme will be employed over large distances, definitely above 1000 kilometers. My thesis summarizes three years of researches at the Luxor Laboratories in Padova. It is dedicated to two core topics, which are twofold aspects of the same issue: beam propagation in Quantum Communication over ground and over space, with the final realization of a Quantum Communication Network in which concretized the acquired knowledges in Quantum field. And Inter-island Canary links have been chosen as representing a worse case scenario for Quantum Communication experiments, an ideal test bed to investigate beam propagation {{in view of the}} space applications, where crucial aspects are the huge distances that Communication beams have to cover. The thesis is divided in two complementary parts: <b>Ground</b> <b>beam</b> propagation Beam propagation in free space along horizontal links in Canary Islands, performing long distances (143 kilometers) and aiming to exploit beam propagation through a turbulent medium. The results pointed out optical configurations and specifics in order to obtain an effective and stable communication link. These researches are within of the strategic project Quantum Future of the University of Padova, "the shift in the Quantum paradigm" Space beam propagation. The second part is dedicated to space beam propagation, regarding design and arrangement of the Quantum prototype SaNe-QKD to fuse with the Optical Communication prototype OPT (by Thales Alenia Space). The resulting system, SaNe-QKD OPT, will be positioned on board of Galileo satellites for performing Quantum Optical Inter-satellite links. Simulations about inter-satellite links, network topology features and key length evaluation, have allowed to obtain results and specifications about operative wavelengths and telescope apertures to use for inter-satellite communications. Then, the prototype SaNe-QKD have been arranged and is here shown in each part. This researches are part of the project "Application of Optical Quantum Communication Links for GNSS" by the European space Agency (ESA). My thesis is divided in four chapters, as follows <b>Ground</b> <b>beam</b> propagation Chapter 1 introduces an overview of main concepts of photonics, atmospheric models and turbulence parameters, optics and fiber-optics and telescopes, used throughout the treatment. The Newtonian telescope is investigated in order to analyze the optical path arriving at the prototype SaNe-QKD for space purpose and the Canary Telescope in order to realize an optical system implementing the centroid spot following system. Zemax simulations are presented for both to check aberrations and for collimation issues. For Newtonian off-axis field, coma and field curvature are revealed. For Canary Telescope chromatic aberration is revealed and the arrangement scheme of the experiment of beam propagation in free space in Canary Islands with co-propagating beams control is described. Kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence models with Hughnagel Valley model is then briefly reported too. It will be used in Canary experiments over 143 kilometers and in chapter 3 for up/downlink quantum communication simulations between a ground base transceiver and a satellite. Chapter 2. It is known that an unconfined optical mode propagating in a turbulent medium suffers of distortions. In Quantum Communication the information is encoded and transmitted as a train of single photons with mean average of about one photon for pulse; it follows that the link losses of a beam propagating in atmosphere increase with the distance; in contrast they cannot be reduced by increasing the signal power as in optical communication. Consequently, it is crucial to exploit beam propagation over long ranges, in order to analyze photon statistics, the transformations on the beam due to the ground in order to prevent the unleashing of the beam between transmitter and receiver. The turbulence introduces two contributes according the eddies size [51] [52]respect to the optical beam: • Beam wandering, which occurs when a laser beam is refracted by eddies with size larger than the beam diameter, causing a displacement of the beam center (centroid). • Beam spreading, which is due to the laser beam being refracted by eddies smaller than the beam diameter. The short-term beam spread is an additional spread with respect to the standard spread due to the free space laser beam propagation (without turbulence effects). These effects appears in relation to the exposition time: on short time scales the beam wandering is the dominant effect, while on long time scales the beam spread-ing is the dominant effect. Using turbulence as a resource, the research of beam propagation in free-space communication links opens to test a new equipment, the custom Canary telescope (Chapter 1). The team performed two free-space propagation links with the telescope: the former, a ‘short’ local range (about 20 km) test link between Asiago and Monte Grappa (Italy) in order to examine the Canary Tele-scope and check the communication equipment at the transmitting part; the latter, a ‘long’ range (143 km long) link between La Palma and Tenerife (Canary Islands) for free-space propagation experiments with severe turbulence conditions. Developments and data analysis are presented, pointing out methodologies for turbulence characterization in Ground Quantum Optical Links. The results of the propagation of single, double beams along 143 kilometers have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} optimize an optical system in order to reconstruct the beam long-term diameter and by techniques of beam co-propagating technique, the loss link could be reduced. This is promising as link losses are crucial aspect in Quantum Communication, when in a noisy channel the quantum signal (the in-formation encoded in single photons) cannot be improved by increasing the signal power. Besides we observed that the statistic of arrival of single photons over a free-space 143 km optical link confirms that there is a transformation from Poissonian to log-normal distribution: There is still the evidence of consecutive subintervals of low losses allowing us to envisage the exploitation of turbulence as an SNR improvement technique. Space beam propagation Chapter 3 according the requests of the ESA project, a feasibility study for Quantum Communication applications to Galileo constellation is shown. The chapter starts with an overview of the merits of Optical Communication (data rate exchanging, lightness, compactness, low power consumption [...] ) Pointing out that the intrinsically secure is the added value that only the Quantum counterpart could supply. A brief part recalling orbital motion in space in order to check satellite orbital motion. Then we open to up/downlink simulations overview: recalling the simulations in literature of ground to space or space to <b>ground</b> <b>beam</b> propagation through the atmosphere, the feasibility study shows that unfortunately Galileo constellation can realize only inter-satellite communication links, as the atmosphere and the altitude of the satellite constellation prevents any effective and real single photon transmission with the current technologies. However, simulation results of inter-satellite beam propagation show us that the huge distances can be overwhelmed (derived requirements are telescope diameters > 20 cm and operating wavelength < 532 nm), and time interval within perform Quantum Communication can be calculated: respect to a reference satellite of different orbital plane, the time interval in which the intra-satellite distances are within 15000 kilometers are • For satellite called three of about 176 minutes • For satellite called two of about 168 minutes Then exploiting the relative motion of satellites lying in different orbital planes, we show that it is possible to target communication between satellites that are closer in turns, and to achieve appreciable transmission rates: the distance intervals in which we calculated the raw key rate values are 6000, 10000 and 19000 kilometers, and the best values in raw key rates (18 M bits/s at 6600 kilometers, related to lower attenuation values) are obtained for a telescope diameter of 50 cm and wavelength of 50 nm, while the worse values in raw key rates (2. 2 Kbits/s at 6600 kilometers, related to higher attenuation values) are for a telescope diameter of 20 cm and wavelength of 800 nm. Finally, today information-based society security is of paramount importance: Galileo Optical Quantum Network will guarantee intrinsically secure key exchanging, free of PSN attack, within a satellite distance signed by decoy scheme approach. After a brief review of a model for a Quantum Communication System, simulations about key rate are shown in the final section, showing that for same wavelengths and within same beam propagation distances, larger apertures present higher values of key rate[bit/s]. At the same time we have observed that shorter operating wave- lengths presents higher values of key rate, assuring that in merit to Galileo OQCN decoy schemes could be applied in order to beat PNS attack over well defined communication links in relation to the link distance covered, the operative wavelength and the telescope aperture. Chapter 4 We present a summary about the results of a feasibility study with reference to the architecture of Optical Quantum Communication links to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) Galileo: for an inter-satellite Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network we have derived in the past chapter some specifications about the wavelength selection, by an analysis of the beam propagation outside the atmosphere for telescope radius and wavelength, showing that by decreasing the wavelength and increasing the telescope radius, the beam size at the receiver is reduced, and so is the attenuation, while the SNR increases. Given the GNSS motion, we have presented still some MATLAB simulations evaluating the time intervals in which two spacecraft reach the minimal intra-satellite distances, in order to investigate the feasibility of the OQL system and evaluate its expected performance in terms of achievable key lengths. In this chapter the expected final secret key rate are derived (by taking into account raw key rate, the average number of photons per qubit at the transmitter output, the QKD efficiency, the free-space link attenuation, the attenuation due to devices at the receiver side, the QBER) and the number of required sifted key vs QBER that must be available to Alice and Bob, after the transmission on the quantum layer and the sifting phase, are evaluated too, in order for them to be able to extract a secret key of the desired key length. (Assumed attenuation between - 40 dB and - 45 dB for the quantum channel.) Then the quantum prototype SaNe-QKD is described in each part, the Quantum Key Distribution protocol used B 92, the transmitter and receiver opto-mechanical arrangements with the dedicated interfaces to interface the Quantum module with the Optical one built by Thales Alenia Space.
