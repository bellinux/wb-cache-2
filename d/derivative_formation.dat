40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} method for the separation and quantitative measurement of phospholipids containing primary amino groups, such as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, is described. The method involves {{a simple and}} quantitative <b>derivative</b> <b>formation</b> of the phospholipids containing amino groups to their u. v. -absorbing biphenylcarbonyl derivatives. These have molar extinction coefficients of about 23, 000 at 268 nm. The phospholipid derivatives are then separated and non-destructively determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino phospholipids containing vinyl ether bonds (plasmalogens) can be determined separately from the diacyl- and alkylacyl-amino phospholipids.

The use of radioactive tracers, fluorimetry and protein electrophoresis showed that apomorphine autoxidation products covalently and nonspecifically bind to serum albumin and to rat liver microsomes.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of rutin on redox and endocannabinoid systems, as well as proinflammatory and proapoptotic processes, in UV-irradiated fibroblasts. Methods. Fibroblasts exposed to UVA and UVB radiation were treated with rutin. The activities and levels of oxidants/antioxidants and endocannabinoid system components, as well as lipid, DNA, and protein oxidation products, and the proinflammatory and pro/antiapoptotic proteins expression were measured. Results. Rutin reduced UV-induced proinflammatory response and ROS generation and enhanced the activity/levels of antioxidants (SOD, GSH-Px, vitamin E, GSH, and Trx). Rutin also normalized UV-induced Nrf 2 expression. Its biological activity prevented changes in the levels of the lipid mediators: MDA, 4 -HNE, and endocannabinoids, as well as the endocannabinoid receptors CB 1 / 2, VR 1, and GPR 55 expression.

For assessing potential industrial uses, the mineralogical nd chemical composition of the clay and its basic physical and physico-chemical parameters must be determined. Then some particular properties of commercial interest can be modified and improved by appropriate thermal, mechanical nd acid treatments, urface active agents, organo-mineral <b>derivatives</b> <b>formation,</b> etc. In this paper, a revision of the principal characteristics of commercial palygorskite-sepiolite clays is presented, and potential uses are suggested according to these data.

Finally, possible health effects of these elongate clay minerals are discussed. While commercial deposits of palygorskite and sepiolite are rare, these two clay minerals occur relatively frequently in sediments and soils.

Extensive filopodial protrusions in NC cells are thought to sense chemo-attractive/repulsive signals that provide directionality. To test this hypothesis, we generated null mutations in zebrafish fascin 1 a (fscn 1 a), which encodes an actin-bundling protein required for filopodia formation. Homozygous fscn 1 a zygotic null mutants have normal NC filopodia due to unexpected stability of maternal Fscn 1 a protein throughout NC development and into juvenile stages. In contrast, maternal/zygotic fscn 1 a null mutant embryos (fscn 1 a MZ) have severe loss of NC filopodia. However, only a subset of NC streams display migration defects, associated with selective loss of craniofacial elements and peripheral neurons. We also show that fscn 1 a-dependent NC migration functions through cxcr 4 a/cxcl 12 b chemokine signaling to ensure the fidelity of directional cell migration.

The yield of N-Cl derivatives was in the order: taurine greater than Tris greater than spermidine greater than spermine greater than glucosamine greater than putrescine greater than guanidinoacetate. Accumulation of N-C 1 derivatives was also observed in the absence of added amines, owing to the reaction of HOC 1 with endogenous taurine and other amines that were released from the cells into the medium. In the presence of compounds that yield lipophilic N-C 1 derivatives, little or no accumulation of oxidizing agents was observed. Instead, these compounds inhibited the accumulation of N-C 1 derivatives that was obtained with taurine, and their effect was competitive with taurine. Inhibition was in the order: methylamine greater than ethanolamine greater than phenylethylamine greater than p-toluenesulfonamide greater than ammonia greater than guanidine. Formation of lipophilic N-C 1 derivatives also resulted in inhibition of O 2 uptake and glucose metabolism. Inhibition was prevented by adding catalase to eliminate H 2 O 2, dapsone to inhibit myeloperoxidase, taurine to compete for reaction with HOC 1, or compounds that are rapidly oxidized by HOC 1 or N-C 1 derivatives, to reduce these oxidizing agents. The results indicate that: (a) formation of N-C 1 derivatives that do not penetrate biological membranes can protect leukocytes against the cytotoxicity of HOC 1 and lipophilic N-C 1 <b>derivatives,</b> and (b) <b>formation</b> of membrane-permeable N-C 1 derivatives in the absence of target cells or readily oxidized substances results in oxidative attack by the N-C 1 derivatives on leukocyte components and inhibition of leukocyte functions...|$|R
