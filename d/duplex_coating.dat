Due to the periodical {{changes in the}} mesostructures and properties of underlying substrate, the cracking and spalling behaviors of the <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> {{are expected to be}} different from that of conventional coating. A classic erosion experiment is selected to characterize the positive response of the <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> subjected to thermal loads. It is found that the surface cracking is partly restrained and the interface cracking is partly arrested. FEM modeling results show that a unique stress state is induced in the <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> with the tempering of the discrete pre-quenched regions due to thermal loading, which {{is believed to be the}} mechanism of controlling the damage modes...|$|E

In this study, the {{mechanical}} properties of a weaving machine component made of cast stainless steel are improved by the duplex coatings of electroplated hard-chrome and sputtered metal nitride layers. The {{effects of the}} first and second coat layers of three metallic nitrides, including TiN, TiN-Ni and NiN, were comparatively studied. The structural characteristics of the coating materials were studied by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Vicker hardness was then measured by nanoindenter. It was found that the <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> surfaces gives better surface quality than those of single-layer coated ones. In addition, the hardness of single-layer coating either with hard-chrome or metal nitride was only 2 - 3 times higher than uncoated ones whereas <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> with both layers synergistically increases the hardness by a factor of 7 - 8.

40|$|The Tungsten carbide cobalt coating {{has been}} {{extensively}} used for cutting and mining tools, aerospace, automotive and other wear resistance applications. These coatings not only have superior mechanical properties like high hardness, toughness and compressive strength but have also excellent controllable tribological properties. Nanocrystalline coatings can provide combination of high hardness and high toughness which otherwise are exclusive properties. But {{in the case of}} High Velocity Oxyfuel (HVOF) sprayed nanocrystalline WC-cobalt coatings, a higher degree of decarburization is reported in the published literature. This results in porosity and brittle phases formation in the coating structures. This in turn results in higher wear rate of nanocrystalline WC-cobalt coatings.

The microstructure and tribocorrosion failure behaviors of the duplex coatings were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, reciprocating-sliding tribometer, and electrochemical tests. The as-deposited <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> had a two-layered columnar growth structure consisting of face-centered cubic TiN and amorphous SiOx. Sliding tests showed that the TiN interlayer had good adhesion with the substrate, but the SiOx layer suffered from severe delamination failure. Friction force induced a number of micro-cracks in the coating, which provided channels for the diffusion of NaCl solution. The tribocorrosion test showed that the <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> exhibited a lower wear-performance in NaCl solution than in ambient atmosphere. Multi-scale chloride ion corrosion occurred simultaneously and substantially degraded the bonding strength of the columnar crystals or neighboring layers.

The duplex coatings were fabricated and structured such that the inner layer comprised carbon S phase with a CoCrMo matrix by sputtering a CoCrMo alloy target {{in the presence of}} carbon containing atmosphere. The duplex coatings were found to be elastically compatible with the CoCrMo alloy, and possess higher hardness and a larger hardness-to-modulus ratio than the uncoated alloy. Tribocorrosion tests were conducted in 0. 89 % NaCl solution at 37 oC under elastic contact and unidirectional sliding conditions. The results showed that the <b>duplex</b> S/Cr(N) <b>coating</b> was very effective in improving the tribocorrosion behaviour of the alloy at all applied potentials, in terms of reduced friction and much improved resistance to total material loss by up to more than one order of magnitude.

The longitudinal tensile strength of the as-prepared composites was measured at room temperature. In order to study the interfacial thermal stability and microstructure evolution characteristics of the composites, vacuum thermal exposures of the composites were carried out at 800, 900 or 940 °C for different durations.

40|$|In this study, we {{deposited}} Cr 2 O 3 /CrN duplex coatings, {{consisting of}} a thin Cr 2 O 3 oxide film {{on top of a}} CrN layer, with an unbalanced magnet ron (UBM) sputtering technique. Microstructure characterization was conducted with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tribological evaluations were also performed with a scratch tester and ball-on-disc tribometer. Experimental results showed a well-adherent Cr 2 O 3 /CrN <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> morphology. The Cr 2 O 3 top-layer possesses an amorphous lattice structure. Gas flow rates and bias voltages had an impact upon mechanical and chemical properties of the Cr 3 O 3 /CrN coatings. To compensate the fluctuation of pumping efficiency, target poisoning and sputtering parameters, the flow rate of the reactive gas was rapidly and accurately regulated via a set of piezo valves and an optical emission monitor (OEM). OEM readings revealed the exact proportions of reactive gas consumed by metal plasma (US Patent 4 525 (1985) 417 Appl. Phys. Lett. 50 (1987) 1056; Surf. Coat. Technol. 49 (1991) 543). Gas flow rates were thus controlled, dynamically, with variations of processing conditions. At an OEM setting of 30 - 50 % and a pulsed bias voltage of - 55 V, the Cr 2 O 3 /CrN <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> demonstrated excellent micro-hardness (2533 Hv(25) g) and adhesion strength (L-c = 75 N). The highest contact angle between water and Cr 2 O 3 was measured at 103 degrees at an OEM setting of 30 %. An improved mold releasing capability is anticipated, especially compared with the traditional hard chrome plating. Finally, an outstanding wear Life of 4250 m was achieved on the Cr 2 O 3 /CrN <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> deposited at 50 % of OEM setting.

Response of duplex Cr(N) /S and Cr(C) /S coatings on 316 L stainless steel to tribocorrosion in 0. 89 % NaCl solution under plastic contact conditions. J Biomed Mater Res Part B 2016 : 00 B: 000 – 000, which has been published in final form at [10. 1002 /jbm. b. 33690. This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Two duplex coatings, Cr(N) /S and Cr(C) /S, were deposited on 316 L stainless steel by magnetron sputtering. The effectiveness of these duplex coatings in improving the tribocorrosion behaviour of medical alloys under elastic contact conditions has been demonstrated in a recent publication. The present work focused on the response of these duplex coatings to tribocorrosion under plastic contact conditions. Tribocorrosion tests were conducted in 0. 89 % NaCl solution at 37 oC at an initial contact pressure of 740 MPa and under unidirectional sliding conditions for sliding duration up to 24 h. The results showed that during sliding in the corrosive solution, the duplex coatings were plastically deformed into the substrate to a depth about 1 m. The Cr(C) /S <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> had sufficient ductility to accommodate the deformation without cracking, such that it was worn through gradually, leading to the gradual increase in open circuit potential (OCP) and coefficient of friction (COF). On the other hand, the Cr(N) /S <b>duplex</b> <b>coating</b> suffered from cracking at all tested potentials, leading to coating blistering after prolonged sliding at OCP and stable pit formation in the substrate beneath the coating at applied anodic potentials...|$|E
40|$|Environmental barrier {{coatings}} (EBCs) with a Si bond coat, a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat, and various intermediate coats were investigated. EBCs were processed by atmospheric pressure plasma spraying. The EBC durability {{was determined by}} thermal cycling tests in water vapor at 1300 C and 1400 C, and in air at 1400 C and 1500 C. EBCs with a mullite (3 Al 2 O 3 (dot) 2 SiO 2) + BSAS (1 - xBaO (dot) xSrO (dot) Al 2 O 3 (dot) 2 SiO 2) intermediate coat were more durable than EBCs with a mullite intermediate coat, while EBCs with a mullite/BSAS <b>duplex</b> intermediate <b>coat</b> resulted in inferior durability. The improvement with a mullite + BSAS intermediate coat was attributed to enhanced compliance of the intermediate coat due to {{the addition of a}} low modulus BSAS second phase. Mullite + BSAS/YSZ and BSAS/YSZ interfaces produced a low melting (less than 1400 C) reaction product, which is expected to degrade the EBC performance by increasing the thermal conductivity. EBCs with a mullite + BSAS / graded mullite + YSZ intermediate coat showed the best durability among the EBCs investigated in this study. This improvement was attributed to diffused CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatch stress and improved chemical stability due to the compositionally graded mullite+YSZ layer...|$|R
40|$|Microwaves at 2 · 45 GHz {{have been}} used to ignite the self-propagating high {{temperature}} synthesis of Ni and Al powder mixtures (50 : 50 at-%) to produce a <b>duplex</b> intermetallic <b>coating</b> on Ti substrates. Owing to the high β-NiAl synthesis reaction enthalpy and the energy provided by the electromagnetic field, the newly formed aluminide is in the liquid phase. Thus, it can react with the underlying Ti substrate, forming a ternary eutectic at the interface, belonging to the Ni‐Al‐Ti system. The peculiar interlocking microstructure of such ternary layer is responsible for an increase in toughness and hardness compared to the parent NiAl coating. Moreover, the ternary layer’s oxidation resistance was tested, showing the possibility of replacing the functionality of hard and brittle NiAl, but limitedly up to 750 °C. This can be ascribed to the relatively low Al content in the ternary layer, which hinders the formation of a continuous and protective Al 2 O 3 scale. For this reason, the increase in Al content, or the addition of further elements such as Cr or Si, in the starting powder mixture, helps improve the oxidation resistance of the complex intermetallic coating at the interface, up to the tested temperature of 900 °C...|$|R

The melter borescope outer housing, fabricated from N 06690, was severely degraded by the combined effects of corrosion and oxidation after only {{five months of}} non radioactive operation. The melter was idled and not being fed over 85 % of the time during the cold run operations. The borescope was designed to perform in an oxygen rich, chloride containing environment with temperatures approaching 900 {degree}C (1650 {degree}F). The housing was designed {{for a minimum of}} two years of continuous service in the DWPF melter. Air and steam were purged through the borescope and swept over the optics assembly to keep molten glass and volatile gases from depositing on the lens cover. Upon exiting the borescope the air passes through a N 06690 orifice and enters the melter. Severe oxidation was observed around the orifice. Extensive material loss was also observed {{on the side of the}} outer housing which protrudes through the dome of the melter. Redesign of the borescope is currently underway and will include a new set of optics that will allow the size of the orifice to be significantly decreased, thus reducing the amount of air necessary to keep the lens cover clean. Application of a <b>duplex</b> diffusion <b>coating,</b> consisting of chromium and aluminum, on the end of the borescope outer housing and the use of an inert gas purge are also being considered...|$|R
