5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball {{match with}} Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee {{in the fifth}} contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal {{and the only way}} to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese <b>grater</b> by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation with Beer Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table on the floor next to the stage. Ray and Devon then sprayed the table with lighter fluid. Devine lit the table on fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

25|$|In the kitchen, tempeh {{is often}} {{prepared}} by cutting it into pieces, soaking in brine or salty sauce, and then frying. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh's complex flavor {{has been described}} as nutty, meaty, and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and health food stores. Tempeh performs well in a cheese <b>grater,</b> after which it may be used in the place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior—its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. Sometimes when tempeh is diced and left, they will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut—this is the Rhizopus mold still growing—this is normal and perfectly edible.|$|E

2500|$|A surform tool (also surface-forming tool) {{features}} {{perforated sheet}} metal and resembles a food <b>grater.</b> [...] A surform tool consists of a steel strip with holes punched out and the rim of each hole sharpened to form a cutting edge. [...] The strip is mounted in a carriage or handle. [...] Surform tools were called [...] "cheese graters" [...] decades before they entered the market as kitchen utensils used to grate cheese. [...] Surform planes {{have been described as}} a cross between a rasp and a plane.|$|E
2500|$|As kitchen utensils, surform {{tools are}} a recent innovation. [...] The Microplane wood rasp, a sleek {{stainless}} steel surform rasp first marketed as a woodworking tool and known generically as a microplane, recently became popular as a kitchen utensil for, among other uses, grating cheese (see Zester). [...] An early mention {{of using a}} Microplane [...] "rasp-like grater" [...] in the kitchen was a cookbook published in 1999. [...] This was soon followed by mentions such {{as one of the}} finest kitchen tools to come along in decades and a miracle citrus zester and hard cheese <b>grater.</b> [...] Initially, it was available from kitchen supply stores and Lee Valley Tools.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{specialized}} bicycle {{tools for}} use {{both in the}} shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a hand pump or CO2 Pump, tire levers, spare tubes, self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal <b>grater</b> (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing [...] "cones". [...] and sometimes even a block of French chalk.), wrenches, hex keys, screwdrivers, and a chain tool. There are also cycling specific multi-tools that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|Wood carving {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} arts of humankind. Wooden spears from the Middle Paleolithic, such as the Clacton Spear, show that people have engaged in {{utilitarian}} woodwork for millennia. Indeed the roots of the craft go so far back that, at least where timber is present, the use of wood exists as a universal in human culture as both a means to create or enhance technology and as a medium for artistry. The North American Indian carves his wooden fish-hook or his pipe stem just as the Polynesian works patterns on his paddle. The native of Guyana decorates his cavassa <b>grater</b> with a well-conceived scheme of incised scrolls, while the native of Loango Bay distorts his spoon with a design of figures standing up in full relief carrying a hammock. Wood carving is also present in architecture.|$|E

60|$|Effects purely {{relative}} from properties merely comparative, such as edge, point, <b>grater,</b> &c. are not proper qualities: {{for they}} are indifferently producible 'ab extra', by grinding, &c., and 'ab intra', from growth. In the latter instance, they suppose qualities as their antecedents. Now, therefore, since qualities cannot proceed from quantity, but quantity from quality,--and as matter opposed to spirit is shape by modification of extension, or pure quantity,--Paracelsus's 'dictum' is defensible.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} of ricotta in the Italian peninsula is old, {{dating back to}} the Bronze Age. In the second millennium BC, ceramic vessels called milk boilers started to appear frequently and were apparently unique to the peninsula. These were designed to boil milk at high temperatures and prevent the milk from boiling over. The fresh acid-coagulated cheeses produced with these boilers were probably made with whole milk. However, the {{production of}} rennet-coagulated cheese overtook the production of fresh whole-milk cheeses during the first millennium BC. Bronze cheese <b>graters</b> found in the graves of the Etruscan elite prove that hard-grating cheeses were popular with the aristocracy. Cheese <b>graters</b> were also commonly used in ancient Roman kitchens. Unlike the fresh acid-coagulated cheese, aged rennet-coagulated cheese could be preserved for much longer.|$|R
