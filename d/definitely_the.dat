25|$|The {{language}} of the Amidah most likely dates from the mishnaic period, {{both before and after}} the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) at which time it was considered unnecessary to prescribe its text and content.

Other sources, also in the Talmud, indicate, however, that this prayer was part of the original 18; and that 19 prayers came about when the 15th prayer for the restoration of Jerusalem and of the throne of David (coming of the Messiah) was split into two.|$|E

[...] Her low IQ also became a matter of discussion, with supporters citing this as a reason she should not have been sentenced to death. Legal novelist John Grisham echoed those sentiments and argued that evidence indicated Shallenberger, who had an IQ of 113, was the actual mastermind. Grisham quoted from an affidavit by co-conspirator Rodney Lamont Fuller: [...] "As between Mrs. Lewis and Shallenberger, Shallenberger was <b>definitely</b> <b>the</b> one in charge of things, not Mrs. Lewis." ...|$|E
