Yet, this contribution wants to discuss this model in parallel with the ancient rhetoric model of dispositio. It is argued that the CARS model does not envision a captatio benevolentiae in research articles, which are in fact quite often present. Then, the place and importance of the partitio, {{that is to say}} the announcement of the plan, is analyzed in a corpus of research articles to highlight this important but somewhat neglected move in the introduction.

30|$|With {{regard to}} option 2, not all chemicals, or more {{precisely}} their description, in the articles seems to warrant an inclusion in the database. Often, the <b>introduction</b> section <b>of</b> many <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> summarizes only previously known information (Ridley 2009). Long lists of substances can be neglected if the author’s main {{focus is on the}} description of properties of the substances. A chemical can be noted as a reagent, intermediate or otherwise, only mentioned in an inferior context with regard to the main purpose of the article. As an example, reagents are not indexed unless they are new or used in a novel way (Chemical Abstract 2002). Of course, this may work the other way round. Chemicals are often included with CAS number in the database without any priority range. In the latter case roles can be associated with the chemicals and in this way facilitate the search process.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} differences in the use of hedges employed by Malaysian writers across three rhetorical sections (abstract, <b>introduction</b> and discussion) <b>of</b> the <b>research</b> <b>article.</b> Hedges are commonly found in <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> because they are among the most important features used in academic writing to help writers qualify their statements. Despite its major role in academic discourse, much lesser attention has been given to the study of gender variations in the use of hedges in academic discourse. The data that formed the corpus of this study was extracted from 30 <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> from the discipline of Education and English Language Teaching (ELT) written by Malaysian authors. The findings indicate that female authors use almost as much hedging devices as their male counterparts. The rhetorical section found to be most hedged is the discussion, followed by the introduction, while the abstract was found to be the least hedged. This corroborates findings from previous studies which point out that most hedges do occur in the discussion and <b>introduction</b> sections <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> Exploring further, the independent samples t-test indicated no significant difference in the occurrence of hedging devices across the three rhetorical sections. The findings of the study further reveal that there is no significant difference in the frequency and distribution of hedges used by female and male authors. Interestingly, frequency counts of the top 15 hedge words indicate little variation of hedges used by either gender implying the lack of adequate repertoire of hedging devices. This calls for a more concerted effort in explicitly teaching the poly-pragmatic functions of hedges considered crucial in EAP. Further explorations on cross disciplinary as well as, cross-cultural dimensions in the usage of hedges should be looked into in understanding the writing practices of members of our academic community...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the types and frequency of hedges employed by Persian and English native speakers in the <b>introduction</b> section <b>of</b> academic <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> {{in the field of}} literature. In so doing, a corpus <b>of</b> forty <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> published in national and international journals were randomly selected and analysed through descriptive statistics in terms of frequency. In the introduction section, hedges allow researchers to establish an early niche for their <b>research.</b> The results <b>of</b> the study indicate that English writers are more tentative in putting forward claims and in rejecting or confirming the ideas of others than Persian writers. English native writers used modal auxiliaries, evidential main verbs, adjectives and nouns in RAs more frequently than their Persian native writers’ counterparts. The present findings can be employed to design tasks and materials for teaching writing that focus not only on grammar but also on rhetorical structures and various genres of writing. The study also recommends that as hedges are used differently across languages and non-native authors mostly desire to publish their scholastic writings in prestigious journals, adequate consideration seems necessary to be paid to the descriptions of linguistic and rhetorical devices in English...|$|R
40|$|Without proper {{linguistic}} competence in English language, academic writing {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks, especially, in various genre specific disciplines by L 2 novice writers. This paper examines the role of diction and expression through error analysis in English language of L 2 novice writers’ academic writing in interdisciplinary texts of IT & Computer sciences and Business & Management sciences. Though the importance of vocabulary in L 2 academic discourse is widely recognized, there has been little research focusing on diction and expression at higher education level. A corpus <b>of</b> 40 <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> the published <b>research</b> <b>articles,</b> downloaded from the journals (e. g., 20 from IT & Computer sciences and 20 Business & Management sciences) authored by L 2 novice writers, was analyzed to determine lexico-grammatical errors from the texts by applying Markin 4 method of Error Analysis. ‘Rewrites’ in italics letters is an attempt to demonstrate English language flexibility, infinite vastness and richness in diction and expression, comparing it with the excerpts taken from the corpus.

40|$|Research on {{academic}} writing in general, {{and on the}} <b>research</b> <b>article</b> genre in particular, has investigated the generic structure of the Abstract, or <b>of</b> the <b>Introduction</b> section <b>of</b> the <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> with little attention being paid to other sections (Methods, Results, Discussion and Conclusions). Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigates the move structures of all the sections <b>of</b> the <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> including the Abstract. The study explores the sequencing and structure of moves, and how linguistic features are used to realize authorial stance in the moves. The data are drawn from a randomly selected corpus <b>of</b> forty recent <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> from two key journals in each of two disciplines, applied linguistics and educational technology. The findings show {{that there are some}} differences between the two closely-related disciplines in terms of move structure and typical linguistic features of moves. However more significant is the finding that authorial stance, as expressed in linguistic realizations of moves, varies systematically across moves in both disciplines. The study provides a comprehensive description of the move structure <b>of</b> the entire <b>research</b> <b>article</b> in the fields of applied linguistics and educational technology, and of the typical linguistic features of the moves in different sections.

40|$|The {{controlled}} release of drugs for pulmonary, delivery {{is a research}} field which has been so far rather unexploited but is currently becoming increasingly attractive. The <b>introduction</b> part <b>of</b> this <b>research</b> <b>article</b> first details the potential advantages of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) as drug carrier compared to liposomes and polymeric microspheres. The aim of this work is to use SLMs to impart a sustained release profile to a model drug, salbutamol acetonide (SA). SA was synthesized from salbutamol {{in order to increase}} the lipophilicity of this molecule and thereby to increase its incorporation efficiency into SLMs. SA-loaded SLMs were then produced by a hot emulsion technique followed by high-shear homogenisation and the manufacturing parameters were optimized using the experimental design methodology in order to reach a suitable particle size for pulmonary administration. Scanning electron micrographs showed that SLMs are spherical, have a smooth surface and that SA crystallises outside of the particles when the drug loading is higher than 20 %. This was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. SA in vitro release study from SLMs showed that the release rate increased with SA loading but remained in every case lower than the dissolution rate of pure SA. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Research</b> <b>articles</b> {{are known}} to be concise and {{straight}} to the point however, studies have shown that promotional strategies have permeated into the writings of the scientific authors. The inclination to use promotional strategies {{can be attributed to the}} various <b>research</b> <b>article</b> writing motivations such as for career advancement, for sharing of knowledge, to secure research funding, to meet the requirement of the grant sponsors and to meet the university performance measures. While the native writers have been reported to utilize the promotional strategy as part of their writing strategy, lesser account on such practice has been described in relation to <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> written by non native writers. Broader account on the practice among non native writers is necessary to enhance the teaching of this strategy in the academic writing of ESL writers. This paper is aimed to discuss the use of promotional strategies in the <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and to examine the finding of promotional strategies found in the <b>introduction</b> section <b>of</b> the <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> in a journal published in Malaysia. Ancient Greek rhetorical concepts of Logos, Ethos, Pathos, Telos and Kairos are employed to explain the basic rhetorical function of the Computer Science <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and then, two steps in Swales (2004) CARS model are used to analyzed the <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> Findings showed that the use promotional strategy among the subjects is still limited, suggesting such strategy to be incorporated into the teaching <b>of</b> writing <b>research</b> <b>article.</b> Keywords- Non native writers, rhetorical strategies, promotional strategies, academic writing, ESL, English, <b>research</b> <b>article</b> I...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePatents {{represent}} a critically important research genre in numerous {{scientific and technological}} fields, yet their rhetorical and other linguistic features remain underexplored relative {{to those of the}} related and much more extensively studied <b>research</b> <b>article.</b> While patents share many common elements with <b>research</b> <b>articles,</b> and sometimes even cover the exact same scientific discoveries as articles, they differ from articles in substantial ways, largely due to differences in their communicative purposes, their intended readerships, and the presence of significant legal constraints that govern many aspects of patent construction. Here, I present a comparative analysis of a corpus containing pairs of U. S. patents and published <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> covering equivalent scientific discoveries in the area of biotechnology. For this analysis, I have focused on the “Background of the Invention” section of the patents and the <b>Introduction</b> section <b>of</b> the <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> <b>Research</b> <b>article</b> Introductions are perhaps the most widely studied of all sections of IMRAD-type articles, often displaying a rhetorical structure as described by Swales’s CARS model (Swales, 1990, 2004). While the Background section of patents may address similar scientific elements as article Introductions and may thus be expected to include aspects of the CARS model, the two sections often show fundamentally differences, including with respect to their rhetorical structures, the way in which cited work is addressed, and hedging. These differences, and their functional relations to the divergent communicative purposes of each genre, will be addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is twofold. Firstly it seeks to find the generic {{structures}} that are inherent in the <b>introduction</b> sections <b>of</b> entrepreneurship <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> and secondly it investigates the role of experiential metafunction and its distribution in realization of obligatory generic elements that are found in the data. The approach applied is a combination of Halliday and Hasan’s (1989) model of genre analysis to find the generic structure potential (GSP) <b>of</b> the <b>introduction</b> sections as well as Halliday’s (1994) model of transitivity analysis to find the typicality of the process types and their contribution in the realization of the obligatory elements. The corpus comprises 20 <b>research</b> <b>article</b> introduction sections that are published from 2010 onward in the Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship and Small Business and Enterprise Development. The analysis reveals that 13 types of generic elements might occur in the entrepreneurship <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>introductions.</b> Two <b>of</b> these elements such as ‘Purpose of study’ and ‘Previous study’ element are present in the whole data while others are found to be optional. Based on the obligatory, optional and recursive elements found on the data, the model of Generic Structure Potential (GSP) <b>of</b> the entrepreneurship <b>research</b> <b>article’s</b> <b>introduction</b> sections is proposed. Moreover, in the second phase of analysis the findings reveal that the typicality of the process types within each obligatory element is mostly in line with the function that each obligatory generic element fulfills in that particular genre. As an instance, in the present study, the ‘purpose of study’ element is mostly recognized with Mental processes and Relational processes while the ‘Previous study’ element is highly characterized with Material and Mental processes...|$|R
40|$|Teaching {{academic}} {{writing in}} English to native and non-native speakers is a challenging task. Quite {{a variety of}} computer-aided instruction tools have arisen {{in the form of}} Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems to help students in this regard. This thesis describes my contribution towards the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>Research</b> Writing Tutor (RWT), an AWE tool that aids students with academic research writing by analyzing a learner 2 ̆ 7 s text at the discourse level. It offers tailored feedback after analysis based on discipline-aware corpora. At the core of RWT lie two different computational models built using machine learning algorithms to identify the rhetorical structure of a text. RWT extends previous research on a similar AWE tool, the Intelligent Academic Discourse Evaluator (IADE) (Cotos, 2010), designed to analyze articles at the move level of discourse. As a result <b>of</b> the present <b>research,</b> RWT analyzes further at the level of discourse steps, which are the granular communicative functions that constitute a particular move. Based on features extracted from a corpus <b>of</b> expert-annotated <b>research</b> <b>article</b> <b>introductions,</b> the learning algorithm classifies each sentence of a document with a particular rhetorical move and a step. Currently, RWT analyzes the <b>introduction</b> section <b>of</b> a <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> but this work generalizes to handle the other sections of an article, including Methods, Results and Discussion/Conclusion. This research describes RWT 2 ̆ 7 s unique software architecture for analyzing academic writing. This architecture consists of a database schema, a specific choice of classification features, our computational model training procedure, our approach to testing for performance evaluation, and finally the method of applying the models to a learner 2 ̆ 7 s writing sample. Experiments were done on the annotated corpus data to study the relation among the features and the rhetorical structure within the documents. Finally, I report the performance measures of our 23 computational models and their capability to identify rhetorical structure on user submitted writing.

40|$|Conventional {{definitions}} of genres, {{based on the}} notions of specific conventions such as of content (theme, setting etc.) and form (structure and style) have been disputed. Some scholars {{do not believe in}} the rigid rules of inclusion and exclusion of texts in a particular genre as they can be recognized intutively as instances of repetition and difference because of their 'family resemblences' among texts. Swales (1990) prefers the psycholinguistic concept of 'prototypicality'. Genres usually go through phases or cycles of popularity as the crucial ideological concerns of the time in which they are popular are embodied in the generic conventions. The popular genre <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>article,</b> amongst the <b>research</b> and academic community, is undergoing a continuous evolution. Many scholars have attempted to explore this complex process <b>of</b> writing <b>research</b> <b>article.</b> The list is long, to name some: Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995); Montgomery (1996); Salager-Meyer (1998); Atkinson (1999); Valle (1999); Gross et al. (2002). The work of these scholars includes <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> from different disciplines. However, such scholarly work in the field of Computer science is limited. Cooper (1985), Posteguille (1999) and Anthony (1999) studies are either too broad or too narrow. As compared to these works, the present study addresses the issue at a greater length and is more in depth. The increasing use of computer led text corpora containing millions of words inspired the utilization of the corpus-based techniques for the present <b>research.</b> A corpus <b>of</b> 56 <b>Research</b> <b>articles</b> was created electronically. These articles were taken from five different journals of IEEE, the leading Computer society of the world. Wordsmith tools such as word frequency list, key word, collocation and concordance were applied to the corpus. Secondly, Swales (2004) CARS model was applied for the rhetorical analysis. Lexico-grammaticl analysis was done in terms of the rhetorical objectives <b>of</b> writing <b>Introductions.</b> The findings <b>of</b> the <b>research</b> as discussed in Chapter four focus on the syntactic and lexical patterns evident in the data. Theses include interesting N-grams (three and four word clusters); voice of the author (very different from the authors of other disciplines) and passivization of verbs. These stylistic excursions make an initial contribution to our understanding <b>of</b> Computer science <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> <b>Introductions.</b> The last three chapters of the dissertation constitute the heart of the discoursal analysis <b>of</b> the 56 <b>Introductions</b> in the corpus. These examine the structural-rhetorical features of the moves and steps involved, and the possible linkages between form and function. A revised CARS model has been suggested for writing <b>Introductions</b> <b>of</b> computer science <b>research</b> <b>articles.</b> Some recommendations have been put forward.
