Twenty young normal-hearing adults (10 male and 10 female) participated in the study. As stimulus, Korean spondee words were presented via one of five skull locations (i. e., jaw angle, condyle, temple, mastoid, and vertex), while the participants wore one of four protection methods (i. e., ear form, <b>ear</b> plug, <b>ear</b> <b>muff,</b> and <b>ear</b> form and <b>muff</b> together) against white noise in one of four noise directions (i. e., 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees). The results showed: 1) {{there was a significant difference}} among the five skull locations with condyle being the most sensitive placement; 2) there was a significant difference among the four protection methods, with the ear form plus <b>ear</b> <b>muff</b> condition (or dual protection) providing the lowest threshold; 3) when exposed to noise from 90 degrees, the significantly lowest threshold was found; 4) there was no significant difference in results by gender.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the bone conduction (BC) part and the air conduction (AC) part of one's own voice has previously not been well determined. This relation is important for hearing impaired subjects as a hearing aid affects these two parts differently and thereby changes the perception of one's own voice. A large ear-muff that minimized the occlusion effect while still attenuating AC sound was designed. During vocalization and wearing the <b>ear</b> <b>muff</b> the ear-canal sound pressure {{could be related to}} the BC component of a person's own voice while the AC component was derived from the sound pressure at the entrance of an open ear-canal. The BC relative to AC sensitivity of one's own voice was defined as the ratio between these two components related to the ear-canal sound pressure at hearing thresholds for BC and AC stimulation. The results of ten phonemes showed that the BC part of one's own voice dominated at frequencies between 1 and 2 kHz for most of the phonemes. The different phonemes gave slightly different results caused by differences during vocalization. However, similarities were seen for phonemes with comparable vocalization.

The hearing level at 4000 Hz was used to indicate the noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS). The lumberjacks were exposed, at their present pace of work, to noise, Leq values 96 - 103 dB(A), and to the vibration of a chain saw (linear acceleration 30 - 70 ms- 2). The chain saws of the early 1960 s were more hazardous, with the average noise level of 111 dB(A) and a variation acceleration of 60 - 180 ms- 2. When classified on the basis of age, the lumberjacks with VWF had about a 10 dB greater NIPTS than subjects without VWF.

With the same duration of ear protection the lumberjacks with VWF consistently had about a 10 dB greater NIPTS than those without VWF. The differences in NIPTS were statistically significant.

Due to the mechanical processes essential to production methods in mining and quarrying, noise exposure control is heavily reliant on the use hearing protectors including <b>ear</b> plugs and <b>muffs.</b> Training is also provided on how to prevent hearing damage. This includes the selection and fitting of hearing protection devices. If the type of hearing protector does not reduce the noise to an acceptable level nor is it fitted correctly, noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) will occur.

High noise levels can cause headaches, irritation, fatigue, impaired sleep, headache, and tinnitus and have resulted in an inability to hear alarms. Speech intelligibility may be more impaired for crew understanding non-native language in a noisy environment. No hearing loss occurred, but significant effects on crew performance and communication occurred. Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS) have not been observed in the US shuttle program. Russian specification for noise in spacecraft is 60 dBA (awake) and 50 dBA (asleep) while the U. S. noise specification on ISS is NC 50 (awake) and NC 40 (asleep) with a 85 dBA hazard limit. Background noise levels of ISS modules have measured 56 - 69 dBA. Treadmill exercise operations measure 77 dBA. Alarms are required to be 20 dBA above ambient. Hearing protection is recommended when noise exceeds 60 dB 24 hour Leq. Countermeasures include hearing protection and design/ engineering controls.

Therefore, there have lots of workers must wearing the hearing protector to avoid the injury to its sense of hearing of various kinds of industrial noises in its environment. The conventional passive methods, such as <b>ear</b> <b>muffs,</b> are ineffective against low-frequency noise. To solve this problem, the present study developed a headset equipped with a digital signal processing system to implement feedback adaptive active noise cancellation (FbAANC) to reduce the low-frequency noise. The proposed FbAANC headset was effective against wideband industrial noise, with a maximal noise spectrum power reduction of 37. 9 dB. The study also evaluates the effects of FbAANC headset on speech intelligibility on a disyllabic Mandarin word discrimination test (WDT) platform. Finally, the SNR below- 10 dB, the mean WDT score with FbAANC headset was superior to without FbAANC headset 13 to 32 % through 30 subjects of normal hearing threshold for evaluation. These results suggest that the FbAANC headset would be useful for hearing protection in workplaces with high levels industrial noise.
