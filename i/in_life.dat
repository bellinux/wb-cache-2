5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later <b>in</b> <b>life</b> {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later <b>in</b> <b>life</b> he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
