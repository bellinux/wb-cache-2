5|$|The {{team has}} {{utilized}} two color palettes {{prior to its}} current color scheme. The original colors, used from 1978 to 1998, consisted of red, white, and blue. From 1998 to 2014, the Sounds used a black and red palette similar to the club's current colors. Both color schemes {{were used in the}} 1998 season during the transition <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E

On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting $130million from the PRC for this action. In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005, and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005. However, the PRC continues to maintain a representative office on Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Yu Yu Hakusho anime {{adaptation}} {{was directed}} by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The series, consisting of 112 episodes, aired from October 10, 1992 to January 7, 1995 on Fuji Television. The episodes were released on 23 video cassettes by Pony Canyon from January 1, 1995 to December 6, 1995. They were also released on 28 DVD volumes by Beam Entertainment, with volumes 8-14 being released on March 25, 2002, volumes 15-21 being released on April 25, 2002 and volumes 22-28 being released on May 25, 2002. The anime differed from its manga source material by containing different levels of violence and profanity, as well as minor variations in art style <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> In early 2001, the series was acquired by Funimation Entertainment for North American distribution as Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files. Funimation's production saw a significant contribution from voice actor Justin Cook, who not only directed the dub but also voiced the protagonist Yusuke.|$|E

5|$|The finest {{and most}} {{prolific}} year {{of her career}} was 1963, when she appeared {{in a number of}} leading productions. She starred alongside Burt Lancaster in Visconti's The Leopard (1963) (Il Gattopardo), portraying a village girl who married a progressive young aristocrat (Alain Delon), and played a film actress cast by a director (Marcello Mastroianni) in Federico Fellini's 8½. Both films were critically acclaimed and are often cited by critics and scholars as among the greatest films ever made. She participated in the two films during exactly the same period, frequently moving <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and experiencing the strictly planned approach of Visconti which contrasted strongly with Fellini's much more relaxed style and his almost total reliance on improvisation. Cardinale remembered Visconti's set as having an almost religious atmosphere, everything focused on the film, far removed the outside world. Visconti needed silence for his work while Fellini preferred noise and confusion.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} {{factors are}} involved in host preferences, the species {{and the age of}} the leaf. Offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids moved <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> depending on the active growth state of each and the senescence of each host plant. Thus in late summer and autumn, the beet leaves were old and unattractive to the aphids in comparison with the leaves of the spindle, whereas in spring, the young unfolding leaves of the beet were more attractive than those of the spindle.|$|E

50|$|A {{physical}} system can {{have as many}} resonant frequencies as it has degrees of freedom; each degree of freedom can vibrate as a harmonic oscillator. Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, pendulums, balance wheels, and LC tuned circuits have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as coupled pendulums and resonant transformers can have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, {{the time it takes}} <b>to</b> transfer energy <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin <b>to</b> travel through <b>the</b> coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, <b>from</b> <b>one</b> oscillator <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next.|$|R
5|$|Two {{vertices}} in a {{directed graph}} {{are said to}} be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite {{the best efforts of}} Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) {{announced}} its 1941 production plan on 9 December 1940. Zavod Nr. 1 {{would be required}} to build a total of 3,500 in 1941. Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG-3 and complete one hundred aircraft {{by the end of the}} year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor'kiy would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG-3, although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards. 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was on pace to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July, 562 in August and 450 in September. In October the German advance on Moscow forced the factory, and its OKO, to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions. However, shortly afterwards, Stalin sent a telegram to the directors of the plants building the Ilyushin Il-2 and the MiG-3 demanding more Il-2 production, resulting in MiG-3 production being terminated in favor of the Il-2, with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares. An additional factor in cancellation of the MiG-3 was that its Mikulin AM-35A engine was closely related to the Il-2's AM-38 allowing production to be quickly switched <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
