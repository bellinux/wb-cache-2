30|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study how the {{maintenance}} that uses CAC <b>gouging</b> <b>torch</b> process affects the microstructural behavior and mechanical properties in {{the most commonly used}} SAE 5130 and ASTM 514 S grade steels used in the manufacture of high-tonne mining equipment.|$|E
30|$|The <b>gouging</b> <b>torch</b> process using air {{carbon arc}} cutting (CAC) device is a {{standard}} maintenance procedure carrying out in high-tonne equipment used in the minery industry. The application of this process could locally affect the mechanical properties and the microstructure in the thermally affect zone (HAZ). The changes involve variation in the local carbon concentration and a tempering effect. In commonly used steels {{in the manufacture of}} buckets (SAE 5130) and shovel handles (ASTM 514 grade S), the processes influence negatively the work lifetime and the future maintenance works on the device.|$|E
30|$|During the {{application}} of the CAC <b>gouging</b> <b>torch</b> process, it is possible to cause damage to the steel base substrate of the mining equipment, due to the high temperatures involved in the process, which can easily reach 2000  °C in the molten metal. At first, thermal fluctuations so as the addition of carbon concentration may cause effects on the thermally affected zone (HAZ) (Tingaev et al. 2016; Andrés et al. 2016), which may include residual stresses (Yilbas and Arif 2011; Michaleris 1999; Hu et al. 2007; Kyong-Ho and Lee 2007; Ma et al. 2016) and subsequently generate fatigue in the material (Goldberg 1978; Ramaswamy 1989; Cicero et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; ASM 2013; Lara et al. 2013) or even spontaneous fracture, starting from micro-crack formation. It is also possible to suppose that solid-solid phase transformations so as micro-structure changes take place into the affected area during the cooling after the process end.|$|E
