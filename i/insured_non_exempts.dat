We examined the self-referral incidence rate and the association of health care delivery system structure with {{utilization of}} primary physician and specialist. Materials and Methods: Office visit for patients in private sector and outpatients in public clinic care, stratified by insurance status (Rural Health Insurance, Imam Khomeini Welfare Committee, private <b>insured</b> patients and <b>non</b> <b>insured</b> patients or self-pay patients). 1306 subjects were randomly selected for the study purpose. 39. 9...|$|R

40|$|Cataract {{surgery is}} the most {{commonly}} performed medically necessary proce-dure in Canada, and the costs are cov-ered under provincial and territorial health insurance plans. Patients who require this sur-gery are frequently offered {{one or more of}} a number of optional services related to refractive correction during cataract surgery. These ser-vices, which include innovative diagnostics, laser therapies and surgical devices, are sup-plied at additional cost to the patient because they are not deemed to be medically necessary by government funding agencies across Can-ada.

2500|$|There {{are seven}} current masjids in the Greater Richmond area, with three more {{currently}} in construction, accommodating the growing Muslim population, {{the first one}} being Masjid Bilal. In the 1950s, Muslims from the East End got organized under Nation of Islam (NOI). They used to meet in Temple #24 located on North Avenue. After the NOI split in 1975, the Muslims who joined mainstream Islam, start meeting at Shabaaz Restaurant on Nine Mile Road. By 1976, the Muslims used to meet in a rented church. They tried to buy this church, but due to financial difficulties the Muslims instead bought an old grocery store at Chimbarazoo Boulevard, the present location of Masjid Bilal. Initially, the place was called [...] "Masjid Muhammad #24". Only by 1990 did the Muslims renamed it to [...] "Masjid Bilal". Masjid Bilal {{was followed by the}} Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA masjid. The ICVA was established in 1973 as a <b>non</b> profit tax <b>exempt</b> organization. With aggressive fundraising, ICVA was able to buy land on Buford road. Construction of the new masjid began in the early 1980s.

40|$|Chronic {{renal failure}} (CRF) {{is a major}} public health problem. Early {{diagnosis}} of kidney diseases and proper management has important roles in prevention of (CRF) progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this purpose, determining the etiology of (CRF) may be helpful. Hospital – based cross- sectional descriptive {{study was conducted to}} describe the basic characteristics of the patient’s diagnosed with (ESRD) according to socio-demographic, medical characteristics and behavior. This study was conducted in Khartoum state during the period from October 2008 to May 2009, to identify the associated factors of (CRF) in adult patients, and estimate the direct and indirect cost of treatment by haemodialysis. A total of 341 patients with a diagnosis of (ESRD) were involved in the study. To determine individual units included in sample size a proportional multistage cluster sampling was followed. Relevant data were collected using a reliable questionnaire. All data were analyzed by the computer using (SPSS) / PC version 13 software. The study showed that 68. 6 % of patients were males and 31. 4 % were females. The most affected age groups were over 47 years (44 %) and {{the mean age of the}} study patients was 45. 32 ± 6. 34 years. The associated risk factors of (CRF) in this study included: hypertension in 47 %, diabetes mellitus in 13. 2 %, renal diseases in 21. 2 % VI (Atrophy in 22. 7 %, kidney stone 12 %, cystic kidney 6. 7 %, urinary tract infections in 13. 3 %, obstructive nephropathy (ON) 32 %, vasculitis in 4 % and nephrotoxic drugs 9. 3 %), infectious diseases in 7 %, and unknown causes in 21. 6 % of the patients. The high frequency of (CRF) of unknown in this study may be attributed to diagnostic limitations prevailing in our country. The study showed that the health-care sector costs associated with hemodialysis expenditure exceed 2, 800, 000 SDG per year. The total average direct cost per patient insured were 1428 SDG per year and <b>non</b> <b>insured</b> were 3931. 32 SDG per patients year. The study revealed that the average indirect cost associated with (ESRD) was estimated at 3085. 2 SDG per patient per year...|$|R
