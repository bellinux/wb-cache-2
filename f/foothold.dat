5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their <b>foothold</b> in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E

She campaigned with her husband door to door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982, and was heavily involved in campaign strategy. Her wealth from an expired trust from her parents provided significant loans to the campaign and helped it survive a period of early debt.|$|E

30|$|In {{a single}} {{climbing}} step, collision-free motion planning involves three adjacent <b>footholds,</b> {{one of which}} determines the grasping configuration of the base gripper {{and the other two}} are the initial and the target configurations of the swinging gripper. 1 A feasible and collision-free trajectory is to be found between the two <b>footholds</b> for the swinging gripper. The problem can be described as follows.|$|R

5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans. At first the enemy secured a <b>foothold</b> in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held, but sturdy counterattacks succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, and the line was entirely re-established.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1941, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} {{to end the}} conflict in the Balkans and subjugate Allied-sympathetic states. The Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning. The German Wehrmacht also intervened in Greece thus beginning the Battle of Greece.

5|$|Projects in the United States {{during the}} late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain a <b>foothold</b> in {{occupied}} Japan. This helped to restart the building boom in occupied Japan after the war.

5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small <b>foothold</b> in {{southern}} Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the <b>foothold</b> that it did.|$|E

5000|$|Holds come in {{different}} colours, {{those of the}} same colour often being used to denote a route, allowing routes of different difficulty levels to be overlaid on one another. Coloured tape placed under climbing holds is another way that {{is often used to}} mark different climbing routes. In attempting a given route, a climber is only allowed to use grips of the designated colour as handholds but is usually allowed to use both handholds and <b>footholds</b> of the designated colour and surface structures and textures of the [...] "rockface" [...] as <b>footholds.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of developing BiPCRs is to autonomously carry out high-rise tasks in place of humans. To this end, autonomous climbing is a fundamental and essential functionality of a BiPCR. In some sense, a BiPCR {{can be regarded as}} a mobile manipulator, whose base may be changed and fixed in turn. During climbing, the robot fixes and supports itself with one of the two grippers served as the base, and moves the other one (the swinging gripper) to the target position, interchanging the roles of the two grippers in each climbing cycle. Hence to completely describe how a BiPCR climb in a spatial truss, we have to provide a series of discrete <b>footholds</b> and the continuous trajectories between adjacent <b>footholds</b> of the same swinging grippers. While the former define the gripping configurations of the BiPCR from the initial position to the destination, the latter determine the climbing motion of the robot in each climbing step. How to plan the <b>footholds</b> refers to climbing path planning or grasp pose planning of a BiPCR, which is out of the scope of this paper. Rather, given the <b>footholds</b> of the two grippers, how to plan the smooth and collision-free motion of the swinging gripper in one climbing step for a BiPCR in complex spatial trusses is an open and challenging issue and is the focus of this paper.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous <b>foothold</b> around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{now that}} the Greeks (and {{therefore}} {{the rest of the}} region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent <b>foothold</b> in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any <b>foothold</b> in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled {{to wipe out the}} remains of Peter's existence. But at the last moment September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified.|$|E

5|$|English in Ireland {{was first}} during the Norman invasion. It was spoken {{by a few}} peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely {{replaced}} by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent <b>foothold</b> in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for {{a vast majority of}} the population.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{penetrations}} inland, confused hard-fought individual actions {{pushed the}} <b>foothold</b> out {{two and a}} half kilometers (1.5 mi) deep in the Colleville area to the east, less than that west of St. Laurent, and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area. Pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind the American front line, and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire. At 21:00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry, but losses in equipment were high, including 26 artillery pieces, over 50 tanks, about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels.|$|E

The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal not just to secure the border and to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings saw as a geo-political necessity to secure the <b>foothold</b> of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E

Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
