40|$|It is a {{great honor}} to receive this award, {{particularly}} since it is named for M. Powell Lawton. Powell was a creative and eminent scholar. Those of us fortunate to have worked with him {{know that he was}} a kind, caring and positive man. Despite all his accomplishments, he was totally without pretensions. He always had time to talk to everyone, whether it was the President of the Gerontological Society seeking his advice or the greenest graduate student who just wanted to say hello. Powell is a model for all of us, not just for his outstanding scholarship, but for his decency and kindness. I also want to acknowledge colleagues and graduate students with whom I have worked over the years, and who have added richness to the research I will describe. <b>I</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|R

40|$|Minimizing floor-to-floor {{heights in}} mid- to {{high-rise}} buildings {{is a concern}} held by both engineers and architects. Many {{attempts have been made}} in steel construction to adopt design philosophies that utilize structural floor members with high span/depth ratios. These designs, however, have been limited to floor systems that predominantly span in one direction. The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the structural feasibility of interlocking open-web steel joists to form a panelized two-way steel floor system. This thesis includes a detailed discussion of the fabrication of the proposed floor system. A complete description of a proposed construction sequence is also presented. Finally, the structural behavior of the floor system is demonstrated under static loading. Conclusions were made discussing the benefits of this new system as well as recommendations for the direction of further investigation. ii Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Chris Foley, for his time, guidance, and willingness to listen as my proposed floor system design evolved. <b>I</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|R

40|$|I want {{to seize}} this {{opportunity}} to thank every one who directly or indirectly helped me in completing this work. It {{is not possible to}} state all names nevertheless I feel indebted to all my teachers, friends, family members, university staff, neighbors and colleagues for their contributions in my work and my life. However, some names should be necessarily mentioned without those this work was not possible. First of all, I would like to express my heartiest gratitude to Dr. Brian Mark for his guidance, supervision and efforts during the last three years. His critique and assessment always helped me in improving my work and his consolation and support kept me from being frustrated and disappointed. Working with him was certainly a pleasure and a great rewarding opportunity. I am thankful to my committee members for their comments and analysis, though kept me awake for several nights, were surely vital to my work. I also want to thank Electrical Engineering faculty in general for their involvement in my graduate studies. I specially want to mention Dr. S. C.

I would also like to thank my fellow graduate students who have helped over the past several years. Specifically, the input of Jason Gentry and Xiaowei Xu has provided the cornerstone for much of this research. To all of the faculty and staff in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at OSU and I thank them as well for the lessons learned during my studies both as a graduate student and as an undergraduate.

40|$|Why are {{the same}} {{intellectual}} battles fought over and over again? Why aren’t there arguments good enough to settle those debates once and for good? What are facts, situations, or events? When Situation Semantics {{was born in the}} eighties, I objected because I could not swallow the idea that situations might be chunks of information. For me, they had to be particulars like sticks or bricks. I could not imagine otherwise. The first manuscript of “An Investigation of the Lumps of Thought ” that I submitted to Linguistics and Philosophy had a footnote where I distanced myself from all those who took possible situations to be units of information. In that context and at that time, this meant Jon Barwise and John Perry. I eventually met Jon Barwise at a colloquium at MIT. When we had a drink together afterwards, he asked me: “Why did you put that footnote in your paper? ” I don’t remember what I replied, but Jon invited me to Stanford for a talk. I accepted the invitation. I have been ashamed about the footnote ever since. I took it out. It never made it into the printed version of my paper. However, I am sad that I was never able to pay back Jon’s generosity. <b>I</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|R

While I will take the blame for any errors in this text, I would at the very least like to thank by name some of those who made the last six years both enjoyable and fulfulling. For most of my graduate studies I have had both the blessing and the curse of having two academic advisors: Professors Fiona Harrison and Shri Kulkarni. Though stylistically quite different, I could not have asked for a better pair to match my temperment. Shri was a constant source of enthusiam, energy, and ideas, while Fiona was always there with a keen eye for detail and a vital sense of perspective. Because of them I was given the tools and support necessary to attack an interesting problem and the freedom to do so in my own unique way — no graduate student could ever ask for any more. In addition to Shri and Fiona, the entire GRB group at Caltech (and beyond) offered a stimulating working environment in which to pursue my research.
