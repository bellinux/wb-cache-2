Establishing {{the first commercial}} plants, he convinced railroad men that it was commercially feasible to make money by spending money on treating ties to extend their service time and reduce replacement costs. As a way to track the age and longevity of railroad ties and other wooden structures, he also introduced the railroad <b>date</b> <b>nail</b> in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{practice}} of branding, many utilities would set a 2- to 4-digit <b>date</b> <b>nail</b> into the pole upon installation. The use of date nails went out of favor during World War II due to war shortages but is still used by a few utilities. These nails are considered valuable to collectors, with older dates being more valuable, and unique markings such as the utilities' name also increasing the value. However, regardless of the value to collectors, all attachments on a utility pole are {{the property of the}} utility company, and unauthorized removal is a felony.|$|E
50|$|Dirk Hartog Island is of {{historical}} significance due to landings upon it by early explorers. In 1616, Dirk Hartog landed at Inscription Point {{on the north}} end of the island and marked his discovery with a pewter plate, inscribed with the <b>date</b> and <b>nailed</b> to a post. This plate was then replaced by Willem de Vlamingh and returned to Holland. It is now kept in the National Museum of Holland. There is a replica in the Shark Bay Discovery Centre in Denham.|$|R
5000|$|The first nails {{were made}} of wrought-iron. <b>Nails</b> <b>date</b> {{back at least to}} Ancient Egypt [...] - [...] bronze nails found in Egypt have been dated 3400 BC. The Bible {{provides}} a number of references to nails, including the story in Judges of Jael the wife of Heber, who drives a nail (or tent-peg) into the temple of a sleeping Canaanite commander; the provision of iron for nails by King David for what would become Solomon's Temple; and in connection with the crucifixion of Christ.|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} date of Plato's birth (428/427) {{is based}} on a dubious interpretation of Diogenes Laertius, who says, [...] "When [...] was gone, [...] joined Cratylus the Heracleitean and Hermogenes, who philosophized in the manner of Parmenides. Then, at twenty-eight, Hermodorus says, [...] went to Euclides in Megara." [...] As Debra Nails argues, [...] "The text itself gives no reason to infer that Plato left immediately for Megara and implies the very opposite." [...] In his Seventh Letter, Plato notes that his coming of age coincided with the taking of power by the Thirty, remarking, [...] "But a youth under the age of twenty made himself a laughingstock if he attempted to enter the political arena." [...] Thus, <b>Nails</b> <b>dates</b> Plato's birth to 424/423.|$|R

When he 'took the sun, {{and with the help}} of [...] "The Old Farmer's" [...] almanac found the latitude, Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the reckoning and <b>date</b> with a <b>nail</b> on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the chief engineer of the liner could have done no more, and no engineer of thirty years' service could have assumed one half of the ancient-mariner air with which Harvey, first careful to spit over the side, made public the schooner's position for that day, and then and not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There is an etiquette in all these things.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground and purposeDiaphyseal and metaphyseal {{fractures}} in children are frequently {{treated with the}} flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) method. The {{aim of this study}} was to record postoperative complications and outcome in consecutive fracture patients treated with the new precurved tip and shaft nails and dedicated ergonomic instrumentation. MethodsWe report the analysis of 100 consecutive fractures followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Ninety-seven children were included, comprising 77 shaft and 23 metaphyseal fractures. Demographic data, duration of surgery, nail and medullary canal diameter, <b>date</b> of <b>nail</b> removal, clinical assessment, follow-up radiographs and all complications were recorded. ResultsMean age was 9. 7 years, and mean body weight 35. 1 kg. Twenty-one fractures had associated lesions. Mean duration of surgery was 42. 4 minutes. Nail removal was at a mean 6. 1 months. Twelve percent of patients had complications, with six insufficient reductions, one delayed union, one non-union, one iterative fracture, and three skin impingements. Unexpected surgical revision was required in seven cases. At follow-up, only one patient showed functional impairment, with 20 ° pronation loss, and three showed more than 10 ° axial deviation on X-ray. ConclusionThe low rate of skin impingement compared with the literature may be due to the new dedicated instruments. We believe that other complications can be avoided if one follows the FIN principles, avoiding weak assembly due to an insufficient nail/medullary canal diameter ratio, which is a limiting factor for indications in adolescents. The surgeons reported that precurved shaft nails facilitated the FIN procedure, although this subjective judgment may be due simply to the novelty of the nails. Level of evidenceLevel IV.
