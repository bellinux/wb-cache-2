6000|$|BRODIE. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> answers. (Producing {{purse and}} dice.) These are both too light. This purse is empty, these dice are not loaded. Is it indiscretion to inquire how you share? Equal with the Captain, I presume? ...|$|E

Also, as it chances, I am {{something}} more, namely, an envoy appointed by the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid, having full powers to deal with your case. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> credentials if you care to read them," [...] and I heard a crackling as of parchment being unfolded.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Gentlemen,--I {{received}} {{just now}} your answer, by which you say I ask no terms. I {{thought it was}} useless, since I asked you to come aboard for agreement. But <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> terms:--I will have 30,000 pounds sterling at least, and six of the chiefs men of the town for otage.

6000|$|... "Well, {{it is very}} seducing to be pitied, after all; so <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> three grievances: In {{the first}} place, I am a girl, and not a young fellow, and would be shut up in a mad-house if I did half the things that I have a mind to;--and that, if I had your happy {{prerogative}} of acting as you list, would make all the world mad with imitating and applauding me." ...|$|E

60|$|If, however, I {{were asked}} to give an advice merely as such, <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> ideas. I am not for a total indemnity, nor a general punishment.

They may become an object of more or less {{constant}} watchfulness and suspicion, as their preservation may best require, but they can never become an object of punishment. This {{is one of the few}} fundamental and unalterable principles of politics.|$|E
