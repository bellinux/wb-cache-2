When they came out at night on the Embankment they found it cold and dreary; sometimes a light fog covered the river-banks, and made the lamps glow out dim and large; a light rain would be falling, which sent a chill into their very souls; foot passengers came along at rare intervals, holding up umbrellas, and staring straight {{in front of them}} as they hurried along in the damp and cold; a cab would pass rapidly by, splashing up the mud on each side. The benches were deserted, except, perhaps, for some poor homeless wretch who could afford no shelter, and, huddled up in a corner, with his head buried in his breast, was sleeping heavily, like a dead man. The wet mud made Liza's skirts cling about her feet, and the damp would come in and chill her legs and creep up her body, till she shivered, and for warmth pressed herself close against Jim. Sometimes they would go into the third-class waiting-rooms at Waterloo or Charing Cross and sit there, but it was not like the park or the Embankment on summer nights; they had warmth, but the heat made their wet clothes steam and smell, and the <b>gas</b> <b>flared</b> in their eyes, and they hated the people perpetually coming in and out, opening the doors and letting in a blast of cold air; they hated the noise of the guards and porters shouting out the departure of the trains, the shrill whistling of the steam-engine, the hurry and bustle and confusion.

40|$|We have {{produced}} annual estimates {{of national and}} global <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> efficiency from 1994 through 2008 using low light imaging data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Gas flaring is a widely used practice for the disposal of associated gas in oil production and processing facilities where there is insufficient infrastructure for utilization of the gas (primarily methane). Improved utilization of the gas is key to reducing global carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The DMSP estimates of <b>flared</b> <b>gas</b> volume {{are based on a}} calibration developed with a pooled set of reported national <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> volumes and data from individual flares. Flaring efficiency was calculated as the volume of <b>flared</b> <b>gas</b> per barrel of crude oil produced. Global <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> has remained largely stable over the past fifteen years, in the range of 140 to 170 billion cubic meters (BCM). Global flaring efficiency was in the seven to eight cubic meters per barrel from 1994 to 2005 and declined to 5. 6 m 3 per barrel by 2008. The 2008 <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> estimate of 139 BCM represents 21 % of the natural gas consumption of the USA with a potential retail market value of $ 68 billion. The 2008 flaring added more than 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) into the atmosphere. The DMSP estimated <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> volumes indicate that global <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> has declined by 19 % since 2005, led by <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> reductions in Russia and Nigeria, the two countries with the highest <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> levels. The flaring efficiency of both Russia and Nigeria improved from 2005 to 2008, suggesting that the reductions in <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> are likely the result of either improved utilization of the gas, reinjection, or direct venting of gas into the atmosphere, although the effect of uncertainties in the satellite data cannot be ruled out. It is anticipated that the capability to estimate <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> volumes based on satellite data will spur improved utilization of gas that was simply burnt as waste in previous years...|$|R

The enactment of legislation with adequate provisions for the reduction and elimination of <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> from oil and gas activities is very important.

The subsequent Concordance regime supported YPF, however, and its role as the nation's leading oil distillates retailer was bolstered by a 1936 agreement with the Automóvil Club Argentino (ACA) to supply a chain of ACA service stations.

In Nigeria alone, gas flaring amounts to about 23 billion cubic metres per annum of the gas generated {{in association}} with crude oil production in over 100 flare sites, constituting over 13 percent of global gas flaring out of the over 150 billion cubic metres of natural <b>gas</b> <b>flared</b> and vented annually. This translates to greenhouse gas emission of 45 million tons of CO 2 out of the global total of 400 million tons annually. Even as the environmental effect of gas flaring is trans-boundary or global in terms of global warming and climate change, it has some negative environmental and health impacts on the immediate or local environment. Economically, Nigeria lost about $ 72 billion in revenue between 1970 and 2006 due to gas flaring; and currently, loses about $ 2. 5 billion annually for flaring associated gas.

30|$|For most of {{the studies}} that were subject to this review, the <b>gas</b> <b>flares</b> are not relevant; they should be removed before {{performing}} any analysis. However, this operation was hardly ever done, or else, it was not mentioned explicitly in the publication. This phenomenon is present in at least 20 countries, notably Russia, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq and Algeria, and, especially for small countries (such as Qatar, Kuwait) it could lead to a misinterpretation of the results, since <b>gas</b> <b>flares</b> can be easily confused with small cities. It was calculated for the year 2000, that <b>gas</b> <b>flares</b> represented 3.2 percent of the worldwide light emanation, and in some regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. Nigeria) they accounted for even 30 % of the total illumination [5].|$|R
