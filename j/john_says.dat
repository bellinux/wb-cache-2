25|$|John Proctor, a local {{farmer and}} husband of Elizabeth, enters. He sends {{the other girls}} out (including Mary Warren, his family's maid) and confronts Abigail, who tells him that she and the girls were not {{performing}} witchcraft. It is revealed that Abigail once worked as a servant for the Proctors, and that she and John had an affair, for which she was fired. Abigail still harbors feelings for John and believes he does as well, but <b>John</b> <b>says</b> he does not. Abigail angrily mocks John for denying his true feelings for her. As they argue, Betty bolts upright and begins screaming.|$|E
25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. <b>John</b> <b>says</b> he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is the wrong thing for him to do, John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|E
500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and <b>John</b> <b>says</b> he can smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E

500|$|According to the Life of William Marshal, {{which dates}} to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, {{one of the}} richest and most {{influential}} barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the Life has Walter say in reply [...] " [...] 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but mark my words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" [...] This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of <b>John,</b> <b>says</b> of Walter that [...] "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|This gospel, today {{generally}} {{believed by}} scholars {{to be the}} first and to have been used as a basis for Matthew and Luke, begins with Jesus' baptism by John, who preached a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.

At Jesus' baptism, he hears God's voice proclaiming him to be his Son, and he sees the spirit like a dove descend on him.|$|E
2500|$|A concept {{related to}} the accumlation of wealth is Worldliness, which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John: [...] "Don't you know that {{friendship}} with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes {{to be a friend}} of the world makes himself an enemy of God" [...] (Ja 4.4). The first letter of <b>John</b> <b>says,</b> in a similar vein: [...] "Do not love the world or the things in the world.

[...] "We understand that those same prophets (Moses and Elias) will come before His Coming, who, the Apocalypse of <b>John</b> <b>says,</b> will be slain by Antichrist, although there are various opinions of very many, as to Enoch or Jeremiah, that one of them is to die, as Elias." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{examination}} of John's Gospel makes {{it almost impossible}} to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From John we learn the name of the [...] "woman" [...] who anointed Christ's feet previous to the last supper. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because Matthew and Mark say [...] "two days before the Passover", while <b>John</b> <b>says</b> [...] "six days" [...] there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. John {{does not necessarily mean that}} the supper and the anointing took place six days before, but only that Christ came to Bethany six days before the Passover. At that supper, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, [...] "she hath wrought a good work upon Me...in pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done it for My burial...wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached...that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her." [...] Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the cross, nor at the tomb of Christ? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the Evangelists, stood at the foot of the cross and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the Resurrection. And while John calls her [...] "Mary Magdalen" [...] in 19:25, 20:1, and 20:18, he calls her simply [...] "Mary" [...] in 20:11 and 20:16.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{had already}} {{wondered}} about the materialism implied by his ideas, noting in his transmutation notebook [...] "Thought (or desires more properly) being hereditary {{it is difficult to}} imagine it anything but structure of brain hereditary, analogy points out to this. ‚Äì love of the deity effect of organization, oh you materialist!" [...] The letter shows Emma's tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should [...] "belong to each other" [...] for eternity. The Gospel of <b>John</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Love one another" [...] (13:34), then describes Jesus as the Word Incarnate saying [...] "I am the way, the truth and the life: no man comes to the Father, except through me." [...] (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues [...] "Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"(15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could [...] "hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine." ...|$|E
