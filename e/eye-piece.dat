6000|$|While {{they were}} thus working at Bath an {{incident}} occurred which is worth mentioning {{because it shows}} the very different directions in which the presence or the want of steady persistence may lead the {{various members of the}} very self-same family. William received a letter from his widowed mother at Hanover to say, in deep distress, that Dietrich, the youngest brother, had run away from home, it was supposed for the purpose of going to India, [...] "with a young idler no older than himself." [...] Forthwith, the budding astronomer left the lathe where he was busy turning an <b>eye-piece</b> from a cocoa-nut shell, and, like a good son and brother as he always was, hurried off to Holland and thence to Hanover. No Dietrich was anywhere to be found. But while he was away, Carolina at Bath received a letter from Dietrich himself, to tell her ruefully he was [...] "laid up very ill" [...] at a waterside tavern in Wapping--not the nicest or most savoury East End sailor-suburb of London. Alexander immediately took the coach to town, put the prodigal into a decent lodging, nursed him carefully for a fortnight, and then took him down with him in triumph to the family home at Bath. There brother William found him safe and sound on his return, under the sisterly care of good Carolina. A pretty dance he had led the two earnest and industrious astronomers; but they seem always to have treated this black sheep of the family with uniform kindness, and long afterwards Sir William remembered him favourably in his last will.|$|E

50|$|It is {{done for}} each {{independent}} observation to bring {{the image of the}} object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the telescope towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused <b>eye-piece.</b> If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye {{from one side to the}} other or from top to bottom.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{polarimeter}} {{to measure}} this rotation {{consists of a}} long tube with flat glass ends, into which the sample is placed. At {{each end of the}} tube is a Nicol prism or other polarizer. Light is shone through the tube, and the prism at the other end, attached to an <b>eye-piece,</b> is rotated to arrive at the region of complete brightness or that of half-dark, half-bright or that of complete darkness. The angle of rotation is then read from a scale. The same phenomenon is observed after an angle of 180°. The specific rotation of the sample may then be calculated. Temperature can affect the rotation of light, which should be accounted for in the calculations.|$|E

50|$|The framed model says 1851…It {{may have}} been {{replicated}} for the 1851 world exposition.transcribed from the noted publication (5)...under notices and abstracts, in 1850:On a Model of the Moon's Surface, By Henry Blunt. This model is an accurate representation of {{a part of the}} moon's surface as it appears through a Newtonian telescope of seven feet focus and nine inch aperture, under a magnifying power of about 250. The large volcanic crater, which forms the principal object in the model, has received the name of Eratosthenes. It is about thirty miles in diameter and stands {{at the end of a}} lofty range of mountains not far from the centre of the moon's disc. A hilly district, rising into two or three lofty peaks, runs upwards from Eratosthenes, connecting it with what appears to have been an ancient crater now filled up. Touching the edge of this crater and descending from it towards the right, may be seen a long line of minute volcanic cups, which are nearly the smallest objects visible with the instrument by which the observations were made. The whole is represented as seen with an inverting <b>eye-piece,</b> and the model ought to be held in an oblique light in order to view it to advantage.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} of gas by the British was at the Battle of Loos, 25 September 1915, but the attempt was a disaster. Chlorine, codenamed Red Star, was the agent to be used (140 tons arrayed in 5,100 cylinders), and the attack was {{dependent}} on a favorable wind. However, on this occasion the wind proved fickle, and the gas either lingered in no man's land or, in places, blew back on the British trenches. This debacle was compounded when the gas could not be released from all the British canisters because the wrong turning keys were sent with them. Subsequent retaliatory German shelling hit some of those unused full cylinders, releasing more gas among the British troops. Exacerbating the situation were the primitive flannel gas masks distributed to the British. The masks got hot, and the small <b>eye-pieces</b> misted over, reducing visibility. Some of the troops lifted the masks to get some fresh air, causing them to be gassed.|$|R
2500|$|The next advance was the {{introduction}} of the gas helmet — basically a bag placed over the head. The fabric of the bag was impregnated with a chemical to neutralize the gas — however, the chemical would wash out into the soldier's eyes whenever it rained. <b>Eye-pieces,</b> which were prone to fog up, were initially made from talc.

5000|$|A further {{refinement}} of microscopic methods {{consists of the}} use of strongly convergent polarized light (konoscopic methods). This is obtained by a wide angled achromatic condenser above the polarizer, and a high power microscopic objective. Those sections are most useful which are perpendicular to an optic axis, and consequently remain dark on rotation. If they belong to uniaxial crystals they show a dark cross or convergent light between crossed nicols, the bars of which remain parallel to the wires in the field of the eyepiece. Sections perpendicular to an optic axis of a biaxial mineral under the same conditions show a dark bar which on rotation becomes curved to a hyperbolic shape. If the section is perpendicular to a [...] "bisectrix" [...] (see Crystallography) a black cross is seen which on rotation opens out to form two hyperbolas, the apices of which are turned towards one another. The optic axes emerge at the apices of the hyperbolas and may be surrounded by colored rings, though owing to the thinness of minerals in rock sections these are only seen when the double refraction of the mineral is strong. The distance between the axes as seen in the field of the microscope depends partly on the axial angle of the crystal and partly on the numerical aperture of the objective. If it is measured by means of <b>eye-piece</b> micrometer, the optic axial angle of the mineral can be found by a simple calculation. The quartz wedge, quarter mica plate or selenite plate permit the determination of the positive or negative character of the crystal by the changes in the color or shape of the figures observed in the field. These operations are precisely similar to those employed by the mineralogist in the examination of plates cut from crystals. It is sufficient {{to point out that the}} petrological microscope in its modern development is an optical instrument of great precision, enabling us to determine physical constants of crystallized substances as well as serving to produce magnified images like the ordinary microscope. A great variety of accessory apparatus has been devised to fit it for these special uses.|$|E

40|$|The {{binocular}} indirect {{argon laser}} photocoagulator was newly designed to enable visualisation {{of the entire}} fundus during panretinal laser photocoagulation and to treat retinal tears immediately after buckling procedures of the sclera. The lamp housing of the binocular ophthalmoscope was remodelled and adjusted so that the laser beam and illuminating light are coaxial after leaving the ophthalmoscope. The blocking filter was permanently fixed in the <b>eye-pieces</b> to lighten {{the weight of the}} ophthalmoscope. This new delivery system of the laser beam supplies the clinician with a better view of the whole fundus than the standard slit-lamp delivery system, and may become the ideal method for panretinal photocoagulation in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein obstruction and for the repair of retinal tears. However, a fine and delicate laser technique in the posterior pole does not suit the function of this new delivery system well. Proper use of photocoagulation therapy by combining the standard and the new delivery system of the laser beam is preferable, depending on the location and nature of the retinal lesions...|$|R

40|$|Drosophila is {{a premier}} genetic {{model for the}} study of both {{embryonic}} development and functional neuroscience. Traditionally, these fields are quite isolated from each other, with largely independent histories and scientific communities. However, the interface between these usually disparate fields is the developmental programs underlying acquisition of functional electrical signaling properties and differentiation of functional chemical synapses during the final phases of neural circuit formation. This interface is a critically important area for investigation. In Drosophila, these phases of functional development occur during a period of < 8 hours (at 25 °C) during the last third of embryogenesis. This late developmental period was long considered intractable to investigation owing to the deposition of a tough, impermeable epidermal cuticle. A breakthrough advance was the application of water-polymerizing surgical glue that can be locally applied to the cuticle to enable controlled dissection of late-stage embryos. With a dorsal longitudinal incision, the embryo can be laid flat, exposing the ventral nerve cord and body wall musculature to experimental investigation. This system has been heavily used to isolate and characterize genetic mutants that impair embryonic synapse formation, and thus reveal the molecular mechanisms governing the specification and differentiation of synapse connections and functional synaptic signaling properties.
