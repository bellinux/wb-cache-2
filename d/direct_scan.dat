The mass is 200 times that of an electron, so storage rings behave like those of proton machines while a beam energy spread as low at 10 − 5 may be possible, which means that narrow resonances can be scanned. The lack of beamstrahlung means that thresholds are clean, and the energy can be measured to 10 − 6 via g- 2. This measurement of the Higgs mass benefits from the coupling ghµµ, which gives a crosssection for s-channel production 40, 000 times the electron equivalent.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} performing rapid, high-resolution, low-radiation-dose spiral CT scans {{of the temporal bone}} in unsedated pediatric patients. METHODS: Axial spiral CT examinations with an effective section thickness of 1. 25 mm were performed in 41 infants and children. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated using 360 ° and 180 ° linear interpolation algorithms. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the middle ear were also performed. RESULTS: Complete axial spiral scans were performed without sedation in all patients. Three hundred sixty-degree linear interpolation images had comparable resolution to conventional CT; 180 ° linear interpolation images with an effective section thickness of 1. 0 mm at 0. 2 -mm intervals showed good detail of middle and inner ear anatomy, and multiplanar reconstructions from this algorithm were comparable to <b>direct</b> <b>scans.</b> Three-dimensional reconstructions clearly displayed the oval window, malleus, and incus.

Introduction: Traditionally, digital {{models have been}} made from alginate impressions, which are either scanned directly or poured in plaster and then scanned. The development of chairside oral scanners now allows <b>direct</b> intraoral <b>scanning</b> of the dentition, but questions remain regarding the accuracy of full-arch digital models acquired using this technology, the time required for such scanning, and patient acceptance. These factors will be critical in determining the acceptance of <b>direct</b> <b>scanning</b> technology in the orthodontic setting. Materials and Methods: Fifteen consecutive patients had full-arch digital models acquired using a chairside oral scanner (Lava COS; 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) and conventional alginate impressions, which were then digitized using a computed tomography scanner (OrthoProof, Albuquerque, NM, USA). The time required to perform the procedures was recorded to the closest second. Each patient was given a questionnaire to assess model acquisition preference. For each digital model pair, the individual arches were globally superimposed utilizing best-fit surface-based registration. Discrepancies in individual tooth position between models were computed using eModel 9. 0 software (GeoDigm, Falcon Heights, MN, USA). A Bland-Altman comparison was performed on each discrepancy measurement. Time differences were tested for statistical significance using a Student's t-test. For all tests, P< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: When compared to digital models made from alginate impressions, those made from intraoral scans were not significantly different. The chairside time required to perform impressions was significantly shorter (7 m, 35 s +/- 0 m, 26 s) than that required for COS scans (20 m, 27 s +/- 3 m, 6 s). When the time required for disinfection and packaging of the impressions was included, the time requirement {{did not differ significantly}} from the scan time. While 73. 33 % of patients preferred conventional impressions because they were "easier" and/or "faster," 26. 67 % preferred the intraoral scan because it was "more comfortable. " Conclusions: Despite the high relative accuracy of intraoral scans, traditional alginate impressions are still the preferred model acquisition method with respect to chairside time and patient acceptance. As digital technologies evolve to increase efficiency and patient acceptance, <b>direct</b> <b>scanning</b> technology may become more accepted by the orthodontic community...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we segment advisors {{into five}} types {{based on the}} ratio of {{positive}} to negative reviews (referred to as review balance). If the proportion of positive (negative) reviews is extremely higher than, substantially higher than, or almost equal to the proportion of negative (positive) reviews, the review balance is respectively defined as extreme positive (negative), positive (negative), or neutral. We choose review balance as representative of review history {{because it can be}} easily noticed by buyers through <b>direct</b> <b>scanning</b> of an advisor’s review history list or a summary table provided by the platform. Prior studies indicate that buyers usually do not scrutinize reviews [13, 14]; they form attitude only based on the information they gain easily. Intuition also suggests that it is unrealistic for a buyer to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of review history for each advisor in the product page.|$|R
40|$|We {{have made}} {{estimates}} of the sizes of 19 infrared galaxies drawn from the highest luminosity galaxies detected by the IRAS survey. The techniques we used were to make multiaperture photometric measurements on the ground-based IR Telescope Facility and to compare these flux densities with the much broader beam measurements obtained by the IRAS survey. Our primary result is that most, but not all, of the galaxies in our sample are extended at 10 - 25 microns, with characteristic radii {{of a few hundred}} parsecs. This result directly supports the widely held assumption that the bulk of the infrared luminosity in these galaxies comes from a central starburst region rather than from the whole disk of the galaxy or from a compact nucleus. The compact nature of Arp 220 is confirmed by <b>direct</b> <b>scans</b> with a 2. 9 arcsec aperture at 32 microns...|$|R
40|$|The {{tessellation}} of the Euclidean plane by regular polygons {{has been}} contemplated since ancient times and presents intriguing aspects embracing mathematics, art, and crystallography. Significant efforts {{were devoted to}} engineer specific 2 D interfacial tessellations at the molecular level, but periodic patterns with distinct five-vertex motifs remained elusive. Here, we report a <b>direct</b> <b>scanning</b> tunneling microscopy investigation on the cerium-directed assembly of linear polyphenyl molecular linkers with terminal carbonitrile groups on a smooth Ag(111) noble-metal surface. We demonstrate the spontaneous formation of fivefold Ce-ligand coordination motifs, which are planar and flexible, such that vertices connecting simultaneously trigonal and square polygons can be expressed. By tuning the concentration and the stoichiometric ratio of rare-earth metal centers to ligands, a hierarchic assembly with dodecameric units and a surface-confined metal-organic coordination network yielding the semiregular Archimedean snub square tiling could be fabricated...|$|R
