50|$|It is {{a medium}} tree, growing to 25 metres tall with a {{straight}} trunk in forests, although on the scrubland where it is more common it is a large shrub or small tree, branching from the base upwards with a broad, <b>flat,</b> <b>crown</b> and 1-8 metres tall.

5000|$|Efforts {{to unify}} the {{sponsorship}} and marketing of all three Triple Crown races began in 1987 when ABC Sports negotiated a deal with Chrysler to pay $5 million to any horse that swept all three races, and $1 million each year there was no Triple <b>Crown</b> <b>sweep</b> to the horse with the highest combined Triple Crown finish. [...] This sponsorship lasted until 1993.

60|$|The pestiferous skunk is universal; {{and there}} are two quaint-looking weasels, {{intensely}} black in colour, and grey on the back and <b>flat</b> <b>crown.</b> One, the Galictis barbara, is a large bold animal that hunts in companies; and when these long-bodied creatures sit up erect, glaring with beady eyes, grinning and chattering at the passer-by, they look like little friars in black robes and grey cowls; but the expression on their round faces is malignant and bloodthirsty beyond anything in nature, and it would perhaps be more decent to liken them to devils rather than to humans.|$|R

50|$|It {{is one of}} the few Keaton {{films to}} {{reference}} his fame. At the time of filming, he had stopped wearing his trademark pork pie hat with a short <b>flat</b> <b>crown.</b> During an early scene in which his character tries on various hats (something that was copied several times in other films), he tries on several pork pie hats similar to the one he generally wore, but with higher crowns or wider brims or of slightly different colors. The character briefly has the trademark cap set on his head, but quickly rejects it, tossing it away.|$|R
50|$|The Balmoral (more {{fully the}} Balmoral bonnet in Scottish English or Balmoral cap otherwise, and {{formerly}} called the Kilmarnock bonnet) {{is a traditional}} Scottish hat that can be worn as part of formal or informal Highland dress. Developed from the earlier blue bonnet, dating to at least the 16th century, it {{takes the form of}} a knitted, soft wool cap with a <b>flat</b> <b>crown.</b> It is named after Balmoral Castle, a royal residence in Scotland. It is an alternative to the similar and related (informal) Tam o' Shanter cap and the (formal or informal) Glengarry bonnet.|$|R

Unlike other cloches {{such as the}} GFM or the JM, the LG cloche was {{effectively}} [...] "blind", possessing a single shuttered orifice 60 mm in diameter in its <b>flat</b> <b>crown.</b> It had no observation ports at all, as it did not project appreciably above the surrounding surface. The LG cloche came in three models: a small version, 1.3 m high, a large 2.1 m version, and a cloche for two persons, 2.2 m tall. All were 1.9 m in diameter. LG cloches were usually found {{in the vicinity of}} an entrance block.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} World War II {{the pork}} pie's broad {{popularity}} declined somewhat, though {{as a result of}} the zoot suit connection it continued its association with African American music culture, particularly jazz, blues, and ska. In television between 1951 and 1955, Art Carney frequently wore one in his characterization of Ed Norton in The Honeymooners, and in Puerto Rico the actor Joaquín Monserrat, known as Pacheco, was the host of many children's 1950s TV shows and was known for his straw pork pie hat and bow tie—in this incarnation, the pork pie returned to its Buster Keaton style with rigidly flat brim and extremely low <b>flat</b> <b>crown.</b>|$|R
50|$|This Bodhisattva, {{from the}} early Seventh-century, sits with one leg over the other, lost in thought with fingers on its cheeks. The pose is derived {{from that of the}} Buddha contemplating the life of human beings. This statue wears a <b>flat</b> <b>crown</b> called the 'Three Mountain Crown' or 'Lotus Crown.' The torso is naked, adorned by a simple necklace. There are {{remarkable}} similarities with the wooden Pensive Bodhisattva at the Koryuji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, which {{is believed to have been}} founded by a Silla monk. It is likely, then, that this statue was created in Silla. The well-balanced shape, however, and elegant and refined craftsmanship is typical of the Baekje period.|$|R
