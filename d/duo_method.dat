40|$|Biomechanical {{studies of}} wound {{strength}} are impor-tant because of new investigations in growth factors, cytokines, and fetal wounds. We compared two tradi-tional methods of wound disruption measurement {{with a novel}} computerized model designed for in uivo exper-iments. An Instron tensiometer (INSTS) and an air in-sufflated positive pressure device (AIPPD) were com-pared with a vacuum-controlled wound chamber de-vice (VCWCD). The VCWCD produced vacuum at the wound site and wound disruption was monitored with two video camera/recorders. Rats were marked with a template guide for a 2. 5 cm, full-thickness, abdominal incisional wound. Rats were divided into three groups and studied at 2, 7, or I 4 days after wounding. The recorded images were computer digitalized to generate wound strength curves from a three-dimensional model. A comparison of the wound disruption curves demonstrated that the VCWCD was comparable to the INST or AIPPD in normal wound healing (P 1. 40). The VCWCD provided data with less standard error at 2 days after wounding (P < 05). In separate series of experiments, VCWCD was tested in the early phases of healing and {{was found to be}} sensitive to change at in-tervals of 48 hr after wounding (P <. 005). The INST or AIPPD methods could not perform this task because of an unacceptable level of random error after tissue manipulation. The VCWCD system was considered su-perior for evaluating early wound healing because it was an in <b>duo</b> <b>method</b> which required minimal wound manipulation. 0 1992 Academic Press. Inc...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in a small forced-draught water cooling tower. The results were {{analysed}} by a graphical <b>method</b> <b>duo</b> to Mickley (31), which enabled the estimation of the gas- and liquid-film heat transfer coefficients {{as well as the}} gas-film mass transfer coefficient. The group of experiments has a factorial design and it was possible to correlate the results in terms of the three major operating variables Air Rate, Water Rate and Packed Height. Two complete sets of experiments {{were carried out}}. The first showed the limitations of the method which severely restrict its range of useful applicability and which are discussed in some detail. The second set, designed to overcome these difficulties, gave highly satisfactory results, showing that the method is extremely useful under suitable conditions of, operation. It is also shown that the liquid-film heat transfer coefficient is far from negligible in the present work and it is felt that it ought {{to be included in the}} design of water cooling apparatus. Equations are presented describing the variations of the three film coefficients and the tie-line slope with change in magnitude of the three major operating variables. These are found to agree well with those of other workers whose experiments were carried out in more or less the same range of Air and Water Rate but with much larger Packed-Heights. The Mickley method of analysis is considered to be potentially very important, however a considerable amount of work is needed to try to increase its range of applicability to all cases before it can be used to its fullest advantage...|$|R

40|$|Background In vivo {{measurement}} of wear in {{the ball and}} socket articulation of total hip arthroplasties is {{of interest in the}} evaluation of both existing and new implants. Controversy reigns regarding the accuracy of different radiological measurement techniques and in particular how accuracy has been assessed. Material and methods We assessed the accuracy of 2 radiostereometric (RSA) techniques for wear measurement and 3 standard radiographic techniques, namely Imagika (image analyzing software), Imagika corrected for head center displacement, and the Charnley <b>Duo</b> <b>method.</b> 5 custom-made adjustable phantoms with different prosthetic components were used. Results In 20 measurements of all 5 phantoms at 3 levels of simulated wear (0. 2 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 5 mm), the mean measurement error of the digital RSA examinations was 0. 010 mm (accuracy 0. 42). The corresponding error values for the three radiographic techniques were 0. 19 (accuracy 1. 3) for Charnley Duo, 0. 13 (accuracy 1. 3) for Imagika corrected, and 1. 021 (accuracy 2. 99) for Imagika. Measurement error decreased from 0. 011 mm with ordinary RSA to 0. 004 with RSA digital measurement. Head size, direction of wear in relation to the cup or type of prosthetic component did not influence the measurement error. The results of Charnley Duo and Imagika corrected were similar but the latter had an inexplicable systematic error in measuring one of the phantoms. Imagika had the worst results due to its inability to compensate for the out-of-head center effect. Alumina heads were difficult to analyze with all methods. Interpretation By using the ISO standard for assessing accuracy, RSA can be expected to measure wear with an accuracy of about 0. 4 mm irrespective of prosthetic component studied or direction of wear, whereas the best technique, in our study, based on standard radiographs can be accurate to about 1. 3 mm...|$|E
