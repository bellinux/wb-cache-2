Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2, 504 individuals from 26 populations {{using a combination of}} low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84. 7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3. 6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60, 000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes > 99 % of SNP variants with a frequency of > 1 % for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.
