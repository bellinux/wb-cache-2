40|$|Tourism {{companies}} {{are caught in}} a changing environment, characterized by technological advances, increased global competition {{and the consequences of}} the global economic crisis. Under these circumstances, tourism {{companies are}} forced to devise marketing strategies and implement strategic plans. Well, to understand the marketing and developing effective strategies is to understand {{the context in which the}} company operates, since it will generate market opportunities and threats presented that will condition their future. Among the forces that comprise the business environment are the economy, society, politics, demographics, among others. One of the most significant demographic phenomena for tourism enterprises in the last decade has been the increase in the disabled population, combined with greater participation in the tourism sector itself. However, this participation could be even greater if both destinations and companies comprising it were accessible to the disabled. The scant attention paid to them until recently, disabled people, and especially their right to leisure and <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> free <b>time,</b> have led to tourist destinations not accessible to disabled tourists.

[...] OnlyKollywood gave it 2.75/5 and remarked: [...] "Kakki Sattai is made on the tried and tested old formula, {{with little or no}} big surprises in store.

5000|$|The {{predictive}} {{validity of}} the theory of Reasoned Action has been examined in numerous studies that have previously served as literature for at least three quantitative reviews. Ajzen and Fishbein (1973) reviewed 10 studies and reported a [...]63 average correlation for the prediction of behavior from intentions and a mean multiple correlation of [...]76 for the equation predicting intentions from both attitudes and norms. With similar objectives but larger samples, Sheppard et al.'s and van den Putte's meta-analyses estimated correlations of [...]53 and [...]62 for the prediction of behavior and multiple correlations of [...]66 and [...]68, respectively, for the prediction of intentions. All these studies have reflected the strong correlation exists between people’s attitudes, social norms and their intentions, as well as between their intention and the prediction of their behaviors. However, these correlations are not remain unchanged across all the conditions in people’s life. Although people are likely to develop intentions to perform the behavior, if they have a favorable attitude and perceive the behavior as controllable, then people’s perception of control would be irrelevant to intentions when people have negative attitudes and perceive normative pressure not to commit certain behaviors. Research has also pointed out that {{people are more likely to}} perform the behavior if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. Their intentions to perform the behavior appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors. The very first one is your intention. Whether you have a positive attitude towards drinking as it can help you relieve stress and <b>enjoy</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> can greatly determine your attitude towards drinking after work. Second factor is the subjective norms around you. The level of intention of drinking after work you are most likely to develop is influenced by whether significant people around you also hold favorable attitude towards drinking and whether the society tends to reward people who can drink. The last factor is the level of perceived behavioral control you have towards your intended behavior, more specifically how much confidence you have on controlling how much you will drink. If all of these factors leading towards a direction to enhance your intention to have some drink after work, you are more likely to perform such a behavior. The longer you maintain the behavior of drinking after work, the stronger and higher consistency your original intention will become. As a result, the higher likelihood you will have some drinks in the future.|$|E
