40|$|This article {{contains}} a generalization of the authors' results on numbers of nodal points of eigenfunctions on "good curves" in analytic plane domains (arXiv: 0710. 0101). The term `good' means that the L^ 2 norms of restrictions of eigenfunctions of eigenvalue λ^ 2 to the curve are bounded below by e^- C λ. In this article, the result is generalized to all real analytic Riemannian manifolds (M, g) of any dimension m without boundary. Moreover, a similar lower bound is given for the Hausdorff m- 2 measure of {{the intersection of the}} nodal set with a good real analytic hypersurface. Most of the article is devoted to giving a dynamical or geometric control condition for `goodness' of a hypersurface. The conditions are that the hypersurface H be asymmetric with respect to geodesics and that the <b>flowout</b> of the unit vectors with footpoint on H have full measure in S^*M. This gives a partial answer to a question of Bourgain-Rudnick of characterizing hypersurfaces H on which a sequence of eigenfunctions vanishes. We show that under our conditions, a positive density sequence cannot vanish on H or even have smaller L^ 2 norms than e^- C λ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the Michel-type accretion onto a static spherically symmetric black hole. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical approach, {{we show that}} the standard method employed for tackling the accretion problem has masked some properties of the fluid flow. We determine new analytical solutions that are neither transonic nor supersonic as the fluid approaches the horizon(s); rather, they remain subsonic for all values of the radial coordinate. Moreover, the three velocity vanishes and the pressure diverges on the horizon(s), resulting in a <b>flowout</b> of the fluid under the effect of its own pressure. This {{is in favor of}} an earlier prediction that pressure-dominant regions form near the horizon. This result does not depend on the form of the metric and it applies to a neighborhood of any horizon where the time coordinate is timelike. For anti-de Sitter-like f(R) black holes we discuss the stability of the critical flow and determine separatrix heteroclinic orbits. For de Sitter-like f(R) black holes, we construct polytropic cyclic, non-homoclinic, physical flows connecting the two horizons. These flows become non-relativistic for Hamiltonian values higher than the critical value allowing for a good estimate of the proper period of the flow. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|Accurate batch {{dispensing}} {{of pharmaceutical}} powders, {{on the scale}} of hundreds of microns, in small doses is a challenging task. A novel dispensing technique has been developed by Yang et al. using high-frequency vibration to control powder <b>flowout</b> of a narrow hopper. Thismethod removes the need for mechanical valves because the powder, very quickly, forms a bridge-like structure across the passive outlet preventing outflow. Activation of the vibration has been found to destabilise the bridging structure enabling the powder to flow, when vibration stops the bridge structure quickly rebuilds and dispensing stops. In this work the Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to simulate this novel dispensing control method in order to identify the internal mechanism that allows the flow to be controlled so precisely. A simulated conical hopper was filledwith particles then oscillated vertically at high frequency (~ 10 kHz), amplitude and frequency were scaled from the experimental system. Two orifice sizes, a variety of DEM parameters and two vibration modes were simulated. The parametric study of DEM parameters was based around a case that provided flow rates within a factor of 2 of the experimental flow rates. Dispensing after vibration was found to stop very quickly as in experiments. Visualisation of internal structures during fill, vibration and immediately after vibration revealed a central mass of slow moving particles floating above the nozzle outlet. When the vibration stops the central mass of particles drops into contact with the walls and quickly plugs the flow...|$|E
40|$|We {{employ a}} new NARMAX (Nonlinear Auto-Regressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) code to {{disentangle}} the time-varying {{relationship between the}} solar wind and SYM-H. The NARMAX method has previously been used to formulate a Dst model, using a preselected solar wind coupling function. In this work, which uses the higher-resolution SYM-H in place of Dst, {{we are able to}} reveal the individual components of different solar wind-magnetosphere interaction processes as they contribute to the geomagnetic disturbance. This is achieved with a graphics processing unit (GPU) -based NARMAX code that is around 10 orders of magnitude faster than previous efforts from 2005, before general-purpose programming on GPUs was possible. The algorithm includes a composite cost function, to minimize overfitting, and iterative reorthogonalization, which reduces computational errors in the most critical calculations by a factor of ∼ 106. The results show that negative deviations in SYM-H following a southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are first a measure of the increased magnetic flux in the geomagnetic tail, observed with a delay of 20 – 30 min from the time the solar wind hits the bow shock. Terms with longer delays are found which represent the dipolarization of the magnetotail, the injections of particles into the ring current, and their subsequent loss by <b>flowout</b> through the dayside magnetopause. Our results indicate that the contribution of magnetopause currents to the storm time indices increase with solar wind electric field, E = v × B. This is in agreement with previous studies that have shown that the magnetopause is closer to the Earth when the IMF is in the tangential direction...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Aquifer Reference System of France (BDLISA 1) {{proposes a}} {{delineation}} of its hydrogeologicalunits, including aquifer reservoirs and impervious units, according to local,regional and national scale. Each unit {{is characterized by}} a class of permeability, porosity andtype of geological formation. The ranking number increases with increasing depth and thisenables identification of the vertical position at each point with respect to the other units. Thus, an aquifer in a sedimentary basin can be covered by several dozen other units. Theclasses enable identification of all carbonate rocks in France and their vertical position: fromsurface outcrops down to deep carbonates (Figure 1). Carbonate rocks cover more than 60 %(350, 000 km²) of Metropolitan France, of which 55 % (193, 000 km²) in outcrop. Each carbonate rock is a potential karst aquifer (World Karst Aquifer Mapping Project). Nevertheless, the absence or differing degrees of karstification demand a classification ofthese aquifers according to karst indicators. Specialists strive to find approaches that are bothadapted and homogeneous on a national scale. Initially, BDLISA was built on a regional scale, witheach region employing its own approach depending ondata availability: mapping of all surface disordersrelated to karst (swallets, sinkholes, dolines etc.),tracer tests in karst aquifers and identification ofgroundwater catchment areas, borehole analyses (<b>flowout</b> by fractures and karst) 2, karst springs, wells withvery high specific discharge, stream sink, etc. In a later stage, and in order to harmonize the nationalscale of BDLISA, two approaches were proposed depending on the surface karstification rate: 1) The whole unit is classed as a karst aquifer: four classes distinguish whether thegeological formation can be characterized by a network of underground karst systems or,moreover, a second or third network, all being part of the hydrodynamic system. 2) Karst only constitutes part(s) of the unit: a supplementary layer enables the delineation ofareas inside the aquifer unit where the presence of karst is well known. The national cavity database 3 provides a non-exhaustive listing of natural karst cavity as wellas karst springs and wells with very high specific discharge (BSS). These GIS layers wereoverlain on the extension of carbonate rocks. This information enabled a better understandingof many karst areas. For approach 1, the complete unit classed as karst aquifer, the mappingreveals 2 / 3 of the karst at outcrop and 1 / 3 in the subsurface (25 %, corresponding to 545 unitsat local scale). For approach 2, 108 karst areas have been delineated and linked to their 60 aquifer units. A new 1 : 1 M scale hydrogeological map of France will be published in 2015, based on theinformation of the BDLISA units. It is designed for hydrogeologists and is a communicationand educational tool: the representation of karst aquifers had to be modified in order to allowvisibility at this scale by a differentiation of karst aquifer outcrops and deeper karst units, thedisplay of karst springs (World Karst Aquifer Mapping Project) and karst aquifer labels...|$|E
