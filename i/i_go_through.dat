500|$|Yankovic {{was dismayed}} by the album's lackluster reception. He noted that he [...] "thought {{it was the end}} of [...] career". Yankovic {{explained}} that [...] "I figured I'd peaked with 'Eat It' and 'Like a Surgeon' and now people were slowly forgetting about me and I was well on my way to obscurity." [...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{appreciate}} {{other kinds}} of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [...] sometimes, and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I {{realize that this is}} what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Bono stated [...] "When things aren't {{going right}} and I'm feeling like we're not communicating, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> terrible things on stage." [...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it. That was when I realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well-being." [...] On another occasion he said [...] "I just want to take a bath after we do that. I just want to wash it off my skin." [...] Graham wrote that [...] "performances of 'Exit' would grow ever more fraught and purgative." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E
2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this behavioral change {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he would let her into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We did that for several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development. I think that it also is funny and I think once her cover was blown with the Connors, she kind of was able to drop that persona and become who she really is around them, if that answers the question." ...|$|E
60|$|ESTHER--[With a sigh.] <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> {{something}} when mine were born--but {{this is too}} awful.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mercy me! {{how shall}} <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> it?" [...] said {{the young lady}} again, but merely {{to those in the}} bedroom, with a {{breathing}} of a kind between a sigh and a pant, round shining eyes, and warm face.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, mother, here's my notion. Why {{should not}} we hide our diminished heads there? You could keep house while the Monk and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the lectures and hospitals, and King's College {{might not be}} too far off for Armine." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{extracts}} from the TIMES I really cannot trust myself to comment upon. They were infernally satisfactory; so, and perhaps still more so, {{was a letter}} I had {{at the same time}} from Lord Pembroke. If I have time as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> Auckland, I am going to see Sir George Grey.|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Mr. Bixby, reassuringly; [...] "'twon't be no bother. I {{know him}} as well as I do you--call each other by our given names. Guess I was the first man he sent for last spring. He knows <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> all them river towns. He says, 'Bije, you get 'em.' I understood." ...|$|E
5000|$|Raitt {{has taken}} sabbaticals, {{including}} after {{the deaths of}} her parents, brother and best friend. She has said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> a lot of loss, I took a hiatus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And--and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> {{it like a}} brick," [...] said Mr Moffat, {{with the}} gravest {{possible}} face, taking up in his utter confusion the words that were put into his mouth.|$|R
60|$|But {{notwithstanding}} this, {{with patience}} and labour, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> many things, and indeed ever thing that my circumstances made necessary {{for me to}} do, as will appear by what follows.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You play dark,’ said Ballantrae, ‘but have a care! Be more frank with me, or I {{will cut}} you out. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> no form of {{qualifying}} my threat, {{which would be}} commonplace and not conscientious. There is only one point in these campaigns: that is the degree of admiration offered by the man; and to our hostess I am in a posture to make victorious love.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got to {{find where}} that money is," [...] he said abruptly. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> fire and water to get it, I'll have it! I'll keep on Morris's flat. I'll go to his tailor! I'll--you're {{laughing}} at me. But I mean it! I've had enough of grubbing along on nothing a week, and living in the gutters. I want a bit of Morris's luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on, please, and let {{me follow}} alone. I want to think over my {{pleasant}} day, and finish it with waking dreams, as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this enchanted wood," [...] said Rose, whose mind was full of sweet yet sober thoughts; for she had gathered herbs of grace while carelessly pulling wayside flowers, and from the simple adventures of the day had unconsciously received lessons that never were forgotten.|$|E
5000|$|McMahon {{has said}} that he [...] "wanted it to be about the longing for family from a {{rejected}} youth's perspective, which <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> myself and that many of us have felt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Texas," [...] {{said the}} red-faced man. [...] "It was too cold in Alaska for me. And I found it warm in Texas. I'll {{tell you about}} one hot spell <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> there.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> {{the same}} motions with my lips, {{in order to}} make certain there could be no mistake, and Darius nodded his head in token that I had the words correctly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You play dark," [...] said Ballantrae, [...] "but have a care! Be more frank with me, or I {{will cut}} you out. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> no form of {{qualifying}} my threat, {{which would be}} commonplace and not conscientious. There is only one point in these campaigns: that is the degree of admiration offered by the man; and to our hostess I am in a posture to make victorious love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{ten days}} or a fortnight. I shall {{be a day}} or two in town as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> for I want to arrange about Ralph's commission. Then, perhaps, I shall persuade Mrs. Conway to come up with Ralph to town with us, and to go about with the young people to see the sights. Now, if you and Mrs. Withers would join us there, that would {{complete}} my happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, cut that, Tommy," [...] said Bellchambers, cheerfully. [...] "Don't {{be afraid}} that I'll pass around the plate. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> these thing-um-bobs {{with the rest}} of these old boys because they are the rules. I'm Brother Ambrose here, you know. I'm given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows. That's rather a new design in {{waistcoats}} you have on, isn't it, Gilliam? Are they wearing those things on Broadway now?" ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> {{the little}} gate {{in the wall}} in a natural kind of way, as though I had seen nothing, and {{appeared}} to be struck by the sight of the little fires.|$|R
60|$|After this I {{remember}} no more, for <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to sleep, and so {{remained for}} about twenty-four hours. This was not wonderful, seeing that {{for two days}} and nights practically I had not rested, during which time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> much fatigue and many emotions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} {{looking over my}} things; I was as idly and as frivolously {{employed}} as the most idle and most frivolous woman living. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> my dresses, and my linen.
