I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

Kove's style is simplistic, which she says is less a specific style choice than [...] "quite simply [...] the only one <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to do." [...] The backgrounds were painted by Montreal artist Anne Ashton.|$|E
500|$|Hughes {{intended}} {{the movie to}} be more focused on the characters rather than the plot. [...] "I know how the movie begins, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it ends", said Hughes. [...] "I don't ever know the rest, but that doesn't seem to matter. It's not the events that are important, it's the characters going through the event. Therefore, I make them as full and real as I can. This time around, I {{wanted to create a}} character who could handle everyone and everything." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, Mulan signed with Republik Cinta Management under Ahmad Dhani. Mulan released a solo album entitled Makhluk Tuhan Paling Seksi (God's Sexiest Creature) in 2008 and changed her stage name to Mulan Jameela. Mambo, the Ratu's original vocalist, had already released a solo album, entitled Aku Tahu Rasanya (<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> It Feels) in 2006.

His performance was appreciated by other celebrities such as Akkineni Nagarjuna, Mahesh Babu, and Ram Gopal Varma; Varma said he recognised Sudeep's potential after watching Eega, adding, [...] "Many take his acting in that film for granted, with respect to his expressions when interacting with the fly, but as a director, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> {{difficult it is to}} act when you are imagining the fly to be there".

500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Mambo {{had long}} nurtured {{a desire to}} become a solo singer. After she left Ratu, she was signed by Sony BMG [...] for six solo albums. Distancing herself from her former band, she found {{inspiration}} for her first album from a doll named she saw in a magazine. Considering herself as coquettish and pampered as the doll, she decided to base her album on the concept.

500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{spoken by}} the giant mutant Stan {{was inspired by}} a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How's Your News?, which Parker and Stone produced; according to Parker and Stone, the character could only say phrases like [...] "Bubba chop, bubba chewy chomp", and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way. Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> all those white women felt", but he had no problem repeating it.

Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> hard it is. That's not enough money!" [...] and the offer was raised accordingly.

500|$|Cisneros {{explores the}} issue of place in {{relation}} not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E

What's it sound like? Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not use our voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E
