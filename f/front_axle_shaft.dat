50|$|In 1989, {{the gear}} ratios changed, front brakes and outer <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were made larger, the rear {{differential}} was reinforced and the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were identical lengths {{thanks to an}} intermediate extension shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Auto mode was {{featured}} on both Explorer and Expedition {{and allows for}} all-weather, full-time four-wheel drive capability on pavement as needed. In Auto mode, the engineâ€™s torque is normally routed to the rear drive wheels. A misconception about the system is that it continuously shifts {{into and out of}} four-wheel drive as needed. This is not true, for when Auto mode is selected, the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> hubs are permanently engaged, locking them to the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> <b>front</b> differential, and front drive shaft. This is so the front drive shaft always rotates (turns) when the vehicle is being driven at speed. The computer control system needs the front drive shaft to turn, so that it can monitor and compare the rotational speed of both the front and rear drive shafts. If the rear drive shaft starts to turn faster than the front, the system interprets that (along with input from other sensors) as traction loss. When traction loss is detected, torque is sent forward to the front differential in 10 percent increments, via the center multi-disc clutch. As it does so, intelligent control software allows the center multi-disc clutch to behave like a geared center differential, such that [...] "driveline binding" [...] and [...] "torque windup" [...] do not occur. The transfer of torque is done in secrecy, virtually undetectable by the occupants of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} is attached behind the engine, with a driveshaft that sends {{power to the}} front of the car to an asymmetrically installed limited-slip differential which then supplies power to the front wheels using half shafts; this allowed the powertrain to remain slightly behind the front wheels. This also gave the car a 60:40 front to rear weight distribution. The turning radius of the Inspire also was not as tight as its competitors due to the use of Constant-velocity joint installed on the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> half <b>shafts,</b> but the Inspire did have an advantage in adverse traction conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{was used}} in 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> started out with 23 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> {{and then went to}} 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> While these <b>axles</b> were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R
2500|$|New {{low-drag}} {{disc brakes}} were featured as standard equipment. A five-speed manual transmission joined the options list. The optional automatic transmission received wider gear ratios for better fuel economy. All received as standard equipment the [...] "Select Drive" [...] {{system that could}} be changed between all-wheel drive and two-wheel drive for a potential increase in fuel economy. The system put the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and prop <b>shaft</b> into the gas-saving freewheeling mode from the driver's seat. The Series 30 sedan was no longer available with the Sport package.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} split shaft PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> drive <b>shaft</b> completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|R

50|$|The Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has a {{great deal}} of aftermarket/third-party support, {{including}} many upgrades. Stronger <b>axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> universal joints and ball joints are widely available. As well as a large selection of traction control devices such as locking differentials and limited slip differentials. <b>Axle</b> <b>shafts,</b> universal joints and carriers made from chromoly steel are even available. High capacity differential covers are available that increase the amount of oil the differential holds. These covers also feature heat sinks that help keep the axle cool.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} three speed {{gearboxes}} and worm-driven back <b>axles</b> with propellor <b>shaft</b> and torque mechanism and transmission brakes and <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> with steering gear.In 1906 Wrigley's showed a complete car gearbox at that year's Olympia Show and were manufacturing <b>front</b> and live-rear <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in <b>front</b> drive <b>axles</b> on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b> The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
5000|$|Dodge {{versions}} were {{passenger side}} differential drop, standard rotation gears, kingpin knuckles and 35 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> in early models. The 2nd Generation axles were driver's side with ball joints. 30 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> were {{used instead of}} 35 splines, except 2000, 2001 and 2002 models which were equipped with 32 spline <b>axle</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dana 27 axles {{were used}} for the front and rear wheels in the 80 and 800 models until circa 1968. Both front and rear {{differentials}} were offset to the passenger side for the purpose of lining up the driveshafts with the Dana 18 transfer case. With the transition to the 800A model, the rear axle was upgraded to a Dana 44, with a centered differential mated to the Dana 20 transfer case (which had replaced the Dana 18). Some Scouts from this transitional time are a mix of old and new designs, with the rear driveshaft running at an angle. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was still a Dana 27 model, though if the buyer ordered the 3500 lb. <b>axle</b> option the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was upgraded to a hybrid unit built from a Dana 30 centersection and 27 tubes. The V8 engine option included an automatic upgrade to the heavier duty Dana 30 axle. The rear <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> changed from two pieces to one piece circa 1968 or 1969. A Powr-Lok limited slip differential was provided as an option for both <b>front</b> and rear <b>axles.</b> Common gear ratios are 3.31, 3.73, 4.27, though nearly any ratio was available by special order (there is at least one instance where a Scout 800 was shipped with a 5.71).|$|R

50|$|In general, Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are uncommon, due to {{attributes}} that the Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has over a Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is better gross axle weight ratings.|$|R

5000|$|A full-floating <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> {{does not}} carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating <b>axle</b> <b>shafts</b> are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the <b>axle</b> <b>shaft</b> itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|R

50|$|The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{reduces the}} turn {{radius of the}} tractor. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam turns with the wheels to give an {{effective}} turn angle of 65Â°. The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working. The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> also increases the wheelbase, {{with the weight of}} the front ballast resting directly on the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam. Traction is enhanced in certain conditions without need for extra ballast.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue failure {{has become}} a major concern in the {{automobile}} and aircraft industry, heavy machinery etc. Failures by fatigue are especially dangerous because they are unpredictable; giving no prior notification of the imminent failure they occur suddenly. <b>Front</b> <b>axle</b> of tractor {{is one of the major}} and very important components that undergo severe load conditions and it fails unexpectedly causes unrecoverable losses. The objective of this study is to analyze the existing design of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> of the tractor for service load conditions and redesign to its functional requirements and to increase its life expectations. Finite element simulation is carried out for the existing <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> using ANSYS. The critical location of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has to be identified and redesigned to ensure the safety. The existing geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified to the optimum size which suits for functional requirements with increased life and minimum cost. In this analysis, the geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified and a new design is proposed. The life expectancy of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was predicted for the dynamic load using ANSYS fatigue design module...|$|R

50|$|Historically, this {{designation}} {{was used}} {{regardless of whether}} the entire engine was behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> line. In recent times, the manufactures of some cars have added to the designation with the term front-mid which describes a car where the engine is in front of the passenger compartment but behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> Most pre-World War II front engine cars would qualify as front-mid engine, using the front-mid designation, or on the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mmï½ž 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste times to get up and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the bus floor height should be lower. The bus floor height is about 360 mmï½ž 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and full-scale finite element analysis of the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> emergenc...|$|R
