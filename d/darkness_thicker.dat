60|$|The {{blue light}} {{went out and}} left {{everything}} in <b>darkness</b> <b>thicker</b> than ever, but not before a rapid though ineffective discharge of musketry had been made from the battery. Another blue light, however, showed that the fugitives were getting rapidly out to sea beyond the range of musketry, and that boats were leaving the port in chase. Before the light expired {{a cloud of smoke}} burst from the battery, and the roar of a heavy gun rushed over the sea. An instant later and the water was torn up by grape-shot all round the little boat; but not a ball touched them save one, which struck Bill Bowls on the left hand and cut off his thumb.|$|E
6000|$|How Life was nought but ray of sun [...] that clove the <b>darkness</b> <b>thick</b> and blind, The ravings of the {{reckless}} storm, [...] the shrieking of the ravening wind; ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{suddenly}} in his arms, the warm wind shrieking about them, the <b>darkness</b> <b>thick</b> and soft as a mantle. Only {{he saw the}} anguished happiness in her eyes as they closed beneath his kisses.|$|R
60|$|I stole round by {{the eastern}} end, keeping close in shadow, {{and at a}} {{convenient}} place, where the <b>darkness</b> was <b>thickest,</b> crossed the palisade.|$|R
60|$|Lan-O {{joined her}} and {{together}} the two investigated the dark aperture, finding a small platform {{from which a}} narrow runway led downward into Stygian <b>darkness.</b> <b>Thick</b> dust covered the floor within the doorway, indicating that a great period of time had elapsed since human foot had trod it--a secret way, doubtless, unknown to living Manatorians. Here they dragged the corpse of E-Med, leaving it upon the platform, and {{as they left the}} dark and forbidden closet Lan-O would have slammed to the panel had not Tara prevented.|$|R
60|$|But {{all this}} {{had not been}} done without a {{considerable}} splashing, which had so far indicated his position to the men along the battlements. Arrows and quarrels fell thick around him in the <b>darkness,</b> <b>thick</b> like driving hail; and suddenly a torch was thrown down--flared through the air in its swift passage--stuck {{for a moment on}} the edge of the bank, where it burned high and lit up its whole surroundings like a bonfire--and then, in a good hour for Dick, slipped off, plumped into the moat, and was instantly extinguished.|$|R
60|$|For some {{hours after}} a <b>darkness</b> <b>thick</b> and heavy brooded over the settlement. The sombre pines {{encompassing}} the village seemed to close threateningly about it as if to reclaim the wilderness that had been wrested from them. A low rustling as of dead leaves, and the damp breath of forest odors filled the lonely street. Emboldened by the darkness other shadows slipped by, leaving strange footprints in the moist ditches for people to point at next day, until the moon, round and full, was lifted above {{the crest of the}} opposite hill, and all was magically changed.|$|R
2500|$|A Little Light in the <b>Thick</b> <b>Darkness</b> (Pouca luz em muitas trevas) ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{once more}} they sat silent; and <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> came {{down upon the}} mountain, hiding the stars.|$|R
60|$|Were {{they the}} stars in the dark sky? Was it {{possible}} it was stars in the dark sky? Stars? The world? Ah, no, he could not know it! Stars and the world were gone for him, he closed his eyes. No stars, no sky, no world. No, No! The <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> of blood alone. It should be one great lapse into the <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> of blood in agony.|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessary}} {{to go around the}} long line of box-cars. Olsen led the way, with Kurt just back of him. The men spoke but little and in whispers. At the left end of the line the <b>darkness</b> was <b>thick</b> enough to make objects indistinct.|$|R
60|$|I {{got out of}} bed, and I {{ought to}} have lit a candle, but I didn't think of it {{until it was too}} late. It was the darkest place that ever was. There has never been <b>darkness</b> any <b>thicker</b> than that. It just lay in cakes.|$|R
60|$|In {{the light}} of the pistol fire, Barnaby had only {{sufficient}} opportunity to distinguish a flat face wearing a large pair of mustachios, a cocked hat trimmed with gold lace, a red scarf, and brass buttons. Then the <b>darkness,</b> very <b>thick</b> and black, again swallowed everything.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{work has}} been divided into two stages. In the first, her work is marked by strong patriotism for Mexico. The second is more mystical and rebellious. Her mystical bent has been seen in {{individual}} shows such as [...] "La piel de dios", [...] "De los jardines amantes", [...] "Secreto de piedra," [...] "Piel adentro" [...] "In lak´ ech a lak" [...] and [...] "Talismanes". In a number of works, {{the human body is}} obscured in <b>darkness,</b> <b>thick</b> texture and color, seen in Homenaje a Elizabeth Catlet, Lamento de un blues azul and Aún en las noches más largas. She has also created works related to tragedy, such as the Mexico City earthquake of 1985 and an explosion at San Juanico, along with depictions of children with cancer and disabilities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph, {{have you}} ever thought about that other world? Shall we be {{permitted}} to walk hand in hand through the first <b>thick</b> <b>darkness,</b> darling?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} the roaring and bellowing ceased, and all was {{as still as}} death, though the <b>darkness</b> was as <b>thick</b> and black as ever.|$|R
60|$|Once more we beg our {{reader to}} {{accompany}} us to sea--out into the <b>thick</b> <b>darkness,</b> over the wild waves, {{far from the}} abodes of man.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the figure}} {{stood in front}} of them, a thing of light framed in the <b>thick</b> <b>darkness,</b> and now in a sweet, low voice it spoke.|$|R
60|$|Hard riding {{had been}} {{the order of the}} day, but still we covered ten more miles by sundown. The canyon {{apparently}} closed in on us, so camp was made for the night. The horses were staked out, and supper made ready while the shadows were dropping; and when <b>darkness</b> settled <b>thick</b> over us, we lay under our blankets.|$|R
60|$|They made {{straight}} for {{the spot where the}} flare light had been seen. At first <b>darkness</b> and <b>thick</b> spray combined prevented them from seeing anything, but in a few minutes a dark object was seen looming faintly against the sky, and the coxswain observed with anxious concern that it lay not to leeward, but to windward of him.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{encouraging}} each other, {{and keeping}} close together, lest {{they should get}} separated in the <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> of the night, the two friends struck out bravely for the shore.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the short}} hall Pepper opened a door, and led Lane down steep steps in <b>thick</b> <b>darkness,</b> to another hall, dimly lighted by a window opening upon the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "To-night I shall {{know the}} little hollow under her ankle, where the blue vein crosses." [...] And {{the thought of}} it, {{and the desire for}} it, made a <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> of anticipation.|$|R
50|$|When {{the fifth}} bowl is poured out, a <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> overwhelms {{the kingdom of}} the beast. The wicked {{continue}} to stubbornly defame the name of God while refusing to repent and glorify God.|$|R
6000|$|Down swept another mighty {{blast of}} wind, clothed in spray and <b>thick</b> <b>darkness.</b> At such {{a moment as}} this, came from away forward that most appalling of all cries that are ever heard at sea: ...|$|R
60|$|Evening came at last, and <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> closed {{about the}} lonely tent. Neither {{of the men}} ate much, and when the frugal meal had been cleared away, Maxwell once more spread his map on the table.|$|R
60|$|So they {{remained}} as separate in the light, {{and in the}} <b>thick</b> <b>darkness,</b> married. He supported her daytime authority, kept it inviolable at last. And she, in all the darkness, belonged to him, to his close, insinuating, hypnotic familiarity.|$|R
60|$|The <b>darkness</b> {{was almost}} <b>thick</b> here, {{the ground like}} a morass, with inches of clayey mud, which stuck to everything, whilst the sparse lanterns, hung to the prison walls and beneath the portico, threw {{practically}} no light into the square.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take it, one of you," [...] cried she, [...] "and quit this foolish quarreling. For my part, I {{shall be}} glad {{of a little}} <b>thick</b> <b>darkness.</b> Take it quickly, however, or I must clap it into my own head again!" ...|$|R
60|$|The savage entered its yawning {{mouth in}} a few seconds and glided noiselessly into its dark {{recesses}} like an evil spirit. Soon after, the trio reached the same spot and stood for some time silently gazing upon the <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> within.|$|R
60|$|The sight was {{sufficiently}} appalling. <b>Thick</b> <b>darkness</b> still brooded on the deep, {{and nothing was}} visible save, now and then, {{the crest of a}} breaking wave as it passed close to him, or, rolling under him, deluged his face with spray.|$|R
6000|$|As {{he did so}} {{a sudden}} squall struck the tents, {{levelling}} two with the ground, and entirely whisking off one, which, after making a wild circle in the air, was launched over a precipice into <b>thick</b> <b>darkness,</b> and never more seen! ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the flash}} of red light, and in the instant {{stunning}} report of the pistol shot, Barnaby saw, as stamped upon the blackness, a broad, flat face with fishy eyes, a lean, bony forehead with {{what appeared to be}} a great blotch of blood upon the side, a cocked hat trimmed with gold lace, a red scarf across the breast, and the gleam of brass buttons. Then the <b>darkness,</b> very <b>thick</b> and black, swallowed everything again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'For Phoebus' awful self {{encountered}} him Amid {{the battle}} throng invisible, In <b>thickest</b> <b>darkness</b> shrouded all his face; He stood behind, and with extended palm Dealt on Patroclus' neck and shoulder broad A mighty buffet.' [...] Iliad, Book xvi. (EARL OF DERBY.) ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, step by step, with bated {{breath and}} loudly beating hearts, pausing often to listen, and gasping in a subdued way at times, the three friends {{advanced}} from the gloom without into the <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> within, until their gliding forms were swallowed up.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{sitting down}} upon {{a pile of}} skins, the chief filled his pipe, and made signs to his wife to bring fire. Then he smoked in silence for some time until the sun went down, and a <b>thick</b> <b>darkness</b> closed over the valley.|$|R
