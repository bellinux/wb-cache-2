40|$|A recent {{trend to}} address the {{toughness}} problems of epoxy resins as most widely used <b>engineering</b> <b>resin</b> is to incorporate nanofillers in epoxy matrix. Considering the practical drawbacks of most of nanofillers such as high cost, availability and difficult dispersion, halloysite nanotubes (HNT) -as cheap, abundant, and easy to process naturally-occurring clay minerals- has provided a great opportunity {{in the field of}} polymeric nanocomposites. Although studies showed that HNTs could considerably enhance impact toughness of epoxies, more study is needed yet to determine the best processing parameter to prepare high-performance epoxy nanocomposite. The aim of this research is to provide detailed understanding of the effects of HNTs on the properties of epoxy nanocomposites and to highlight the proper process and material design to get the full benefit of nanofiller (HNTs) for improving the toughness of epoxy resin. In this regards, the effects of various processing parameters (such as mixing methods, curing system, types of HNTs and their surface modification) on the rheological, curing and impact behavior of epoxy nanocomposites was studied. Moreover, new kind of self-healing material with ability to heal the possible cracks in epoxy matrix was developed. For this purpose, the feasibility of using HNTs’ lumen as carrier of healing agent to achieve possible simultaneous self-healing and toughening effects for production of smart self-healing nanocomposite was explored and a new method for preparation of self-healing epoxy composite based on novel electrospun nanofibrous membranes has been developed. This study shows that proper design of process and material has crucial effect on the final properties of epoxy nanocomposite. While the viscosity of the uncured epoxy increased after the incorporation of HNTs, the impact properties of the cured epoxy/HNTs nanocomposites was highly dependent on the characteristics of base epoxy matrix determined by the type of curing agent. Fracture mechanism studies revealed that if shear yielding happened in the epoxy matrix, the incorporation of HNTs deteriorated the impact properties of epoxy nanocomposites. Compared to the commonly used mechanical mixing method, ultrasonication effectively improved the dispersion of HNTs in epoxy matrix, and considerably enhanced the viscosity and impact strength of the epoxy/HNTs nanocomposites, especially at high HNTs loading. Types of HNTs had a significant effect on the impact properties of epoxy/HNTs nanocomposites in a way that those nanocomposites reinforced with longer and more uniform HNTs showed significantly higher impact strength. Furthermore, surface modification of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) by γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and Bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether (DGEBA) was explored through NaOH pretreatment and found to be effective in improving their toughening effect in epoxy nanocomposites. The quality of modification had a significant effect on the impact properties of epoxy/HNTs nanocomposites. Whilst the crack initiation stage was not affected by incorporation of modified or unmodified HNTs, the crack propagation energy was dramatically increased by the incorporation of HNTs and their modification. The force required for crack propagation was considerably increased in epoxy/modified-HNTs nanocomposites to even higher than those of crack initiation force which is important to maintain the structural integrity of the nanocomposites after crack initiation. In addition, to prepare smart self-healing epoxy composite, feasibility of using HNTs’ lumen space as carrier of the healing agents was explored. It was found that nanosized lumen of HNTs could not provide adequate amount of healing agents required for self-healing structural composites. To have adequate amount of healing agents, new carrier system based on electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous mats was developed. The average healing efficiency of approximately 75 % at 50 ºC and 38 % at room temperature was achieved in epoxy/electrospun PAN composites. These epoxy composites were capable of repeated self-healing for up to 6 times at room temperature. To have simultaneous benefits of HNTs and self-healing functionality hybrid Epoxy/HNTs/PAN nanocomposites was developed...|$|E

40|$|For {{aerospace}} applications, {{the use of}} polymers {{can result}} in tremendous weight savings over metals. Suitable polymeric materials for some applications like EMI shielding, spacecraft grounding, and charge dissipation must combine high electrical conductivity with long-term environmental stability, good processability, and good mechanical properties. Recently, other investigators have reported hybrid films made from an electrically conductive polymer combined with insulating polymers. In all of these instances, the films were prepared by infiltrating an insulating polymer with a precursor for a conductive polymer (either polypyrrole or polythiophene), and oxidatively polymerizing the precursor in situ. The resulting composite films have good electrical conductivity, while overcoming the brittleness inherent in most conductive polymers. Many aerospace applications require a combination of properties. Thus, hybrid films made from polyimides or other <b>engineering</b> <b>resins</b> are of primary interest, but only if conductivities on the same order as those obtained with a polystyrene base could be obtained. Hence, a series of experiments was performed to optimize the conductivity of polyimide-based composite films. The polyimide base chosen {{for this study was}} Kapton. 3 -MethylThiophene (3 MT) was used for the conductive phase. Three processing variables were identified for producing these composite films, namely time, temperature, and oxidant concentration for the in situ oxidation. Statistically designed experiments were used {{to examine the effects of}} these variables and synergistic/interactive effects among variables on the electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of the films. Multiple linear regression analysis of the tensile data revealed that temperature and time have the greatest effect on maximum stress. The response surface of maximum stress vs. temperature and time (for oxidant concentration at 1. 2 M) is shown. Conductivity of the composite films was measured for over 150 days in air at ambient temperature. The conductivity of the films dropped only half an order of magnitude in that time. Films aged under vacuum at ambient temperature diminished slightly in conductivity in the first day, but did not change thereafter. An experimental design approach will be applied to maximize the efficiency of the laboratory effort. The material properties (initial and long term) will also be monitored and assessed. The experimental results will add to the existing database for electrically conductive polymer materials.

In those techniques, use of fiber preforms offer some distinct advantages. Using thermoplastic binders that bond the fabrics together allows the plies to be consolidated into near net shape preform. In the present work, glass preforms were consolidated by application of heat and pressure over plies of the glass fabrics that were coated with various concentration of thermoplastic polyester binder. Composite laminates with and without binder were fabricated by utilizing VARTM technique. The peel strength of the preforms with various binder contents was measured to determine the optimum binder concentration. The highest peel strength was obtained from preforms that were prepared with about 9 wt. % of the binder. Preform compression test was also performed using universal test machine with preforms composed of eight plies of glass fabrics with binder (3, 6 and 9 wt. %) and without binder. It was observed that the binder has significant effect on the degree of preform compaction. The highest thickness reduction and therefore fiber volume fraction of the preforms was reached via 3 wt. % of binder. The flexural strength and modulus, compressive strength and modulus through ply-lay up and in-plane loading directions, apparent interlaminar shear strength, mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the composites with and without binder were measured to evaluate the effects of the binder on the mechanical properties of the composite plates. It was found that the flexural strength, mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the E-glass/polyester composite system decreases 30 and 40 percentage, respectively due to the presence of 3 wt. % and 6 wt. % of binder. On the other hand, the flexural modulus of the composite increases while the apparent interlaminar shear strength remains almost constant by the introduction of the binder. The ply-lay up compressive strength and modulus were found to increase up to 3 wt. % of binder and decrease upon further addition of binder. The same findings are valid for the compressive strength and modulus through in-plane loading direction. Ballistic test was performed on E-glass/polyester composite panels according to NATO standards 2920 using 1. 1 -gr. fragment-simulating projectiles (FSPs) to evaluate the effects of the binder on the ballistic performance of the E-glass/polyester composite laminates. The ultrasonic C-scan test method was used to monitor the extent of the damage on the panels due to ballistic impact. It was seen that the damage on the ballistically impacted composite panels decreases with increasing binder. A model matrix material was prepared adding various concentrations of the binder to the reacting resin system in order to follow the extend of binder dissolution within the matrix resin. It was found that there is no complete dissolution of the binder in the matrix resin...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical <b>Engineering.</b> Vacuum-Assisted <b>Resin</b> Transfer Molding (VARTM) {{has become}} a widly used and rapidly growing {{manufacturing}} process for wind turbine blades. However, {{in the case of}} complex geometries, resin flow pattern during the VARTM process tends to be unpredictable. In addition, increasing the size and thickness of the blades is expected to result in additional technical difficulties. Therefore, use of flow pattern simulation tools {{has become a}} necessity in order to avoid costly and time-consuming trial-and-error procedures during manufacturing. In this thesis, a 3 -D non-isothermal framework for modeling the VARTM process for a wind turbine blade was developed. The model was utilized in a case study optimizing inlet gate arrangement, resin temperature, and mold temperature to shorten the filling time. Sequential filling scheme was assumed and different inlet gate arrangements and activation times were used in {{the first phase of the}} study. It was observed that, although increasing the number of the inlet gates tends to shorten the filling process, its effectiveness kept decreasing monotonically. The generally observed filling issue was the formation of dry spots in the sandwich region at the bottom of the part. In the sandwich region, the core splits the flow and forms two flow fronts, one on the top and another at the bottom of the sandwich region. The two flow fronts converge right after the core. For some cases, the slow moving flow front beneath the core was not able to reach its way out and converge with the flow front on the top of the core. To overcome the problem, activation of the auxiliary inlet gates located on the top of the core was postponed. In the second phase of the study, different resin temperatures were used. Increasing the temperature up to 325 °K resulted in shorter filling durations while increasing the temperature further produced dry spots beneath the core. From the flow pattern results in non-sandwich areas, it was concluded that resolving the issue of slow moving flow front at the bottom of the core vii makes it possible to decrease the filling time by 17 % through increasing the resin temperature by 20 °C. The effect of different mold temperatures on the filling time was examined in the third phase of the study. Increasing the mold temperature from the initial value (330 °K) did not result in shorter filling times. To investigate the necessity of employing 3 -D non-isothermal model, a 2. 5 -D non-isothermal model and a 3 -D isothermal model were developed and their results were compared to the results of the 3 -D non-isotheral model. The 2. 5 -D non-isothermal model was unable to accurately predict the flow behavior in the sandwich region. In addition, although the same inlet arrangement and activation times were used for all simulations, the predicted filling time using the 2. 5 -D model was 30 % shorter than the filling time using the 3 -D non-isothermal model. On the other hand, the predicted flow pattern for the 3 -D isothermal model was very similar to that for 3 -D non-isothermal model and the difference between the filling times was relatively small. However, since the model does not keep track of the temperature variations and curing during filling, the simulation of cure after the filling would not provide accurate results...|$|R
