40|$|City {{traffic light}} {{control is a}} complex, {{challenging}} problem, {{making it difficult to}} perform analyses with traditional analytical techniques. An essential goal of traffic management, planning, and design is setting traffic signals at intersections to minimize the queue length and vehicle delay time. The au-thor presents a simulation methodology that can be used as an efficient design aid for the analysis, management, and design of efficient traffic signaling in intersections. A four-leg signalized intersec-tion is used as a design example. The performance of the three-phase and four-phase plans using simulation was compared, and simulation results showed that the three-phase plan has better perfor-mance characteristics than the four-phase plan. The main performance metrics considered are the mean waiting time, mean queue length, and mean utilization of <b>green-light</b> <b>time.</b> The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the methodology...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a fully {{cooperative}} control scheme that produces both effective traffic schedules for the traffic lights and suitable speeds for oncoming vehicles {{to get through}} intersections during <b>green-light</b> <b>time.</b> The {{ultimate goal is to}} reduce substantially the delay, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission. The proposed system is shown to have achieved this goal, compared to a base-line system. More specifically, the controller optimizes traffic signals of a single intersection online. The mathematical model used {{to solve the problem of}} scheduling is a Markov Decision Process, and the solution is found by Approximate Dynamic Programming. The controller employs a simulation-based method to compute suitable speeds for vehicles to get through intersections during green lights. The speeds are broadcast to vehicles via telematics (technologies that allow communications between vehicles and infrastructure). The controller is implemented and evaluated in a microscopic simulation environment. A fixed-time controller is built from schedules produced by the TRAffic Network StudY Tool (TRANSYT) software. The fixed-time controller is used as the bench-mark system. The proposed system saves a maximum of 36 percent delay, more than 11 percent fuel consumption, and more than 12 percent carbon dioxide emission, compared to the base-line system...|$|E
40|$|An {{abstract}} {{representation of}} a map was used to incorporate realistic con-ditions not currently in place in commercial path finding programs. As the project {{is focused on the}} back-end of random graph generation and search-ing, it can be useful for other projects as an educational tool about efficiency and memory usage, as well as more sophisticated frontend systems. The project incorporates more realistic aspects of traffic movement such as traf-fic light and stop sign delays in order to provide realistic delay calculation when traversing a map. Other factors such as whether one is turning left or right are also considered in delay calculation. Traffic light intersections are weighed in favor of larger roads, meaning smaller roads tend to have less <b>green-light</b> <b>time</b> on average than larger ones intersection with smaller roads. Exits are placed only in realistic locations, meaning a tiny driveway won. t have its own exit onto I- 95. The map is generated using a sophisticated random graph generator, which was also developed as part of this project. The graph generator works by assigning random location a higher density value, making roads stem-ming from that location more likely to be larger roads. interstate and local highways, so on. Residential areas are properly structured with a road ar-chitecture that resembles real life, and intersections are placed with realistic 1 delay mechanisms (traffic lights, stop signs, different kinds of exits, etc). The entire project is also designed to be easily testable, flexible, and scalable. All of the parts of the project, from the shell to the final heuristic were be de-signed and created with a large-scale problem in mind. The Java display is more of a testing and debug tool, {{and the vast majority of}} the work is done on the back-end, with little visual representation. The python code for generating the graph and searching is also meant to be a tool for future projects, perhaps on learning heuristics and similar endeavors. ...|$|E
