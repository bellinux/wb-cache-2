40|$|In recent years, the {{international}} oil price has fluctuated violently, bringing about huge risk for {{the international}} oil trade. In fact, the risk of crude oil and petroleum product imports is different because of the different import origins and prices. Which import risk is lower for China? From the perspective of oil supply security, how should China portfolio crude oil and petroleum product imports to minimize its <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> risk? Using portfolio theory and a diversification index approach, this paper compares and analyzes the supply, price and transport risks of crude oil and petroleum product imports. Our {{results show that the}} following: (1) Specific risk (diversification risk) and marine transport risk of China's petroleum product imports are lower than that of crude <b>oil</b> <b>imports.</b> (2) The average rate of return of China's petroleum product imports is higher than that of crude <b>oil</b> <b>imports.</b> Moreover, the average import price variance of petroleum product imports is lower than that of crude <b>oil</b> <b>imports.</b> Thus, the systematic risk (price risk) of petroleum products is lower too. Therefore, from the perspective of oil supply security, China should increase petroleum product imports to decrease its <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> risk. <b>Oil</b> <b>import</b> risk <b>Oil</b> <b>import</b> diversification Portfolio theory...|$|R

25|$|Canadian refineries, {{outside of}} the major oil {{producing}} provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built {{on the assumption that}} light and medium crude oil would continue to be cheap in the long term, and that <b>imported</b> <b>oil</b> would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces, and British Columbia where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of <b>imported</b> <b>oil</b> and declining domestic demand for fuel.|$|E

A unique long-run cointegration relationship exists between crude <b>oil</b> <b>imports</b> and the explanatory variables. The short-run dynamics are estimated by specifying a general error correction model. The estimated long-run price and income elasticities of - 0. 147 and 0. 429 suggest that import demand for crude oil is price and income inelastic.

25|$|After the big {{discoveries of}} the 1940s and 1950s, the U.S. noticed that Alberta was {{protected}} from invasion {{by the wall}} of the Rocky Mountains to the west, the vast boreal forest to the north, and the bottomless swamps of the Canadian shield to the east, but was highly accessible from the vast industrial areas of the U.S. Midwest to the south. Its landlocked location was easier to defend from foreign attack than the United States own oil fields in Texas, Alaska and California. As a result, the U.S. gave preference to oil imports from Canada, and for the purposes of energy policy treated Alberta {{as if it were a}} U.S. state. Since this resulted in producers in Alberta receiving better treatment from the United States government than the Canadian government, producers asked the federal government for access to the Eastern Canadian oil market. Oil producers in Alberta calculated they could deliver Alberta oil to the refineries at Montreal for a cost equal to or only slightly higher than the price of <b>imported</b> <b>oil.</b> However, the Montreal area refineries and the Quebec government balked at the restriction, so the result was the National Oil Policy of 1961. This drew a dividing line at the Ottawa River and gave Canadian producers exclusive rights to the areas to sell oil to the west of the line. Refineries to the east of the line could continue to process <b>imported</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s, British Railways were making a working profit, albeit a small one. However, Britain had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in terms of {{dieselisation}} and electrification of its railways. There were political as well as practical reasons behind the resistance to dieselisation in particular: the Labour Government of Clement Attlee did not want to significantly reduce the demand for domestically-produced coal in favour of <b>imported</b> <b>oil,</b> thus both affecting the balance of payments and potentially causing unemployment. Robin Riddles, who was effectively the British Railways' Chief Mechanical Engineer, disagreed with the dieselisation programme, arguing that it would be too expensive to import oil given the large amounts of domestically available coal. He continued to order steam locomotives on a large scale and from 1948 to 1953, 1,487 steam locomotives were built.|$|E
25|$|The IPL line {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} pricing of Alberta oil {{to make it}} sensitive to international rather than regional factors. The wellhead price reflected {{the price of oil}} at Sarnia, less pipeline tolls for shipping it there. IPL is by far the longest crude oil pipeline in the western hemisphere. Looping, or constructing additional lines beside the original, expanded the Interprovincial system and allowed its extension into the American midwest and to upstate New York. In 1976, it was 3,680 kilometres through an extension to Montreal. Although it helped assure security of supply in the 1970s, the extension became a threat to Canadian oil producers after deregulation in 1985. With Montreal refineries using cheaper <b>imported</b> <b>oil,</b> there was concern within the industry that a proposal to use the line to bring foreign oil into Sarnia might undermine traditional markets for Western Canadian petroleum.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 {{a second}} oil shock nearly doubled {{the price of}} <b>imported</b> <b>oil</b> to Brazil and lowered the terms of trade further. The rise in world {{interest}} rates sharply increased Brazil's balance of payments problem {{and the size of}} the foreign debt. Nevertheless, the government continued borrowing, mainly to face an increasing debt burden, while it tried vainly to maintain the high-growth strategy. At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the foreign-debt problem became acute, leading to the introduction of a program to generate growing trade surpluses in order to service the foreign debt. The program was achieved by reducing growth and, with it, imports, and by expanding exports. As a result, in 1981 real GDP declined by 4.4 percent. The 1982 Mexican debt crisis ended Brazil's access to international financial markets, increasing the pressure for economic adjustment.|$|E
40|$|Turkey {{is one of}} {{the most}} energy import {{dependent}} countries in the world, suffering deeply from the economic and strategic burdens of oil importation. Our purpose is to determine the factors behind the crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> policy of Turkey and to measure their contribution to a well-organized import strategy. We implemented a principle component analysis to construct an <b>Oil</b> <b>Import</b> Vulnerability Index (OIVI) based on four factors, which are crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> dependency of primary energy consumption, crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> bill as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), non-diversification of import sources, and share of oil in total energy import. The contribution of these factors to the OIVI is found to be approximately equal. While an overall deterioration in the OIVI has been observed during periods of increasing oil prices, better diversification of <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> sources has lead to significant improvements. We suggest Turkish policy-makers implement sound policies, emphasizing diversification of crude <b>oil</b> <b>import</b> sources and reduction of the share of crude oil in primary energy imports to increase energy supply security. This study has also demonstrated that it is possible to construct an index representing crude oil vulnerability caused by <b>import</b> dependency. <b>Oil</b> <b>import</b> policy Vulnerability index Turkey...|$|R
