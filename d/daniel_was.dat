50|$|Fans {{speculated that}} Starbuck or {{her father was}} a version of the {{corrupted}} Seven line. Instead <b>Daniel</b> <b>is</b> merely a plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on Cavil's character (noting that <b>Daniel</b> <b>is</b> essentially the Abel to Cavil's Cain).

In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act.

5|$|Hurricane <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> {{the second}} strongest {{hurricane}} of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. The fourth named storm of the season, Daniel originated on July16 from a tropical wave {{off the coast}} of Mexico. It tracked westward, intensifying steadily to reach peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) on July22. At the time, the characteristics of the cyclone resembled those of an annular hurricane. Daniel gradually weakened as it entered an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the Central Pacific Ocean, it quickly degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on July26.|$|E

5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

5|$|When Hurricane <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the Hawaiian islands as a tropical storm, state and Hawaii County officials recommended residents prepare hurricane kits. They also suggested purchasing non-perishable foods and batteries. Initially, the storm was several days away from potentially affecting the state, and as a result few residents rushed to prepare. The Honolulu National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory for east facing beaches in Hawaii, and warned beachgoers to remain out of the water. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch and wind advisory in association with the remnants of Daniel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the midway}} point the {{following}} season, <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> named to his second consecutive NHL All-Star Game in January 2012. He {{was one of}} four players representing the Canucks, including Henrik, Alexander Edler and Cody Hodgson. Chosen to Team Alfredsson in the All-Star Fantasy Draft, he recorded a goal and an assist in a 12–9 loss to Team Chara. Later in the season, Daniel sustained a concussion after receiving a hit from Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith during a game on 21 March 2012. With Daniel in the neutral zone and without possession of the puck, Keith hit him in the head with his elbow. After being helped off the ice by a trainer, Daniel remained in the game for a shift before leaving the contest entirely. Two days later, Keith was suspended five games for his hit by the League. Sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} regular season, Daniel finished 2011–12 with 30 goals and 67 points over 72 games, a drop off from his League-leading total from the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Daniel {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career in the}} Swedish Hockey League with Modo Hockey in 1997 and was co-recipient, with Henrik, of the 1999 Golden Puck as Swedish player of the year. He played four seasons with Modo (including a return in 2004–05 due to the NHL lockout), helping the club to two consecutive appearances in the Le Mat Trophy Finals, in 1999 and 2000, where they lost both times. Selected second overall by the Canucks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, Daniel moved to the NHL in the 2000–01 season. He has spent his entire NHL career in Vancouver, and in 2016 became the club's all-time top goalscorer. After emerging as a top player in the club during the 2005–06 season, Daniel has since recorded six consecutive campaigns of at least 20 goals and 70 points. In 2011, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the League's leading point-scorer and the Ted Lindsay Award as {{the best player in}} the League, as voted by fellow players. <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> also nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League's most valuable player.

5|$|In 1997, Fluor's {{revenues}} fell almost 50 percent, in {{part due}} to the Asian financial crisis and a decrease in overseas business. Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project. Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing. In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2005, <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> {{named to}} the Swedish Olympic team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

Competing in his first Olympics, he contributed four points as Sweden won a gold medal, {{defeating}} Finland 3–2 in the final. Four years later, he was once again {{named to the}} Swedish Olympic team for the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Despite going into the tournament as one of Sweden's key players (in the corresponding NHL season, he was third among Swedish players in points despite missing 19 games), he ranked seventh among team forwards in total ice time. Sweden failed to defend their gold medal from Turin, losing to Slovakia in the quarterfinal. Daniel had a goal and two assists in four games.|$|E
5|$|The Blagrave {{family were}} wealthy landowners around Reading, and the manor passed {{down through the}} family (which {{included}} mathematician John Blagrave, who built a new house at Southcote); a lease document dated from 1596 suggests that the manor was divided between three Blagrave brothers. Daniel Blagrave, a cousin of John, inherited the manor on the latter's death in 1611. At {{the time of the}} English Civil War, during the Siege of Reading in 1643, the Blagraves allowed Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to use the manor as his headquarters. The Blagrave family, who were sympathetic to the Roundheads, are said to have hosted Oliver Cromwell, John Hampden and Robert Blake for a council of war in one of the house's oak panelled rooms. In January 1649, <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> one of the signatories of Charles I's death warrant.|$|E
50|$|Pearlman {{is thrilled}} when her partner Cedric <b>Daniels</b> <b>is</b> touted by the papers as a {{potential}} replacement for Commissioner Burrell. <b>Daniels</b> <b>is</b> concerned that his history of corruption might surface, but does not confide in Pearlman. Daniels' fears are allayed when Burrell accepts a deal to leave quietly and Pearlman attends a press conference at which Daniels' promotion is announced. In the end-of-season montage, she is shown on the bench wearing judges robes and recusing herself from {{a case in which}} <b>Daniels</b> <b>is</b> a defense attorney.|$|R

5|$|The {{funds for}} her {{continuing}} care {{were provided by}} Charles Widmore. As a result of Theresa's fate, Oxford fired Daniel and quietly removed all references to him ever having been at the university. At some point, Daniel also performed an experiment upon himself, resulting in long-term memory damage. While in Essex, Massachusetts, Daniel saw a news report covering {{the discovery of the}} apparent wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 {{in the depths of the}} Sunda Trench. Widmore approached Daniel and after informing him that the Sunda Trench wreckage was a hoax, urged him to go to the island, which he said would heal him of his plight. At first, <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> reluctant, but Eloise convinced him to go. Daniel is then recruited into a covert team alongside Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), which is organized by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) and led by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). Their mission was to travel to the island, find Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the then current leader of the Others, and disable the Dharma Initiative station called the Tempest, which contained poisonous gases.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{crossed into}} the area of forecast responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center on July24, and upon doing so, its eye disappeared from satellite imagery. <b>Daniel</b> <b>was</b> forecast to track through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm as water temperatures near the islands were warmer, and wind shear {{was expected to be}} minimal. However, it decelerated as the ridge to its north weakened, and due to the combination of cool waters and increasing easterly shear, Daniel weakened to a tropical storm on July25. Later that day, no active convection remained near the exposed circulation center, and early on July26 it weakened to tropical depression status. Thunderstorm activity failed to redevelop, and Daniel degenerated into a remnant low pressure area by 0000UTC on July27. The remnant low continued west-northwestward, dissipating just south-east of the Big Island of Hawaii on July28.|$|E
