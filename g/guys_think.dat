So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the Millennium Group was a real-life organization called the Academy Group, which consisted of retired law enforcement agents working as a private investigative firm. Millennium creator Chris Carter {{had come to know}} members of the Academy Group through contacts he had made with the Federal Bureau of Investigation while researching his earlier television series The X-Files. The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Describing his initial inception of the Group, Carter has stated [...] "they believe that all this random violence we see these days, there may actually be some order in the chaos [...] These <b>guys</b> <b>think</b> that, if they care enough, that they can stem the tide of this thing".|$|E
500|$|Hadji, age 16, became Dr. Quest's {{personal}} assistant, lacking his mentor's {{formal education}} but sharing his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and the paranormal. A Hindu, as {{mentioned in the}} original series episode [...] "Riddle Of The Gold," [...] and a yogi, he held a fatalistic attitude towards the show's drama, reacting to situations [...] "from the philosophical {{point of view that}} everything is as it's supposed to be". Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling Jonny. Lawrence cut Hadji's classic telekinesis to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices. [...] "He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," [...] season one voice actor Michael Benyaer explained. [...] "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad <b>guys</b> <b>think</b> he is dead."

500|$|Talk of {{a reunion}} {{commenced}} {{weeks after the}} trio began speaking again. After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up.

The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E

Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of the}} night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. [...] "I thought he was going to die," [...] says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph. [...] "Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again. The trio eventually met up in the hospital, laying the grounds for what was going to be the band's reunion. Eventually, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. The three opened up, discussing the events of the hiatus and their break-up, and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting.

2500|$|Minneapolis became {{noted as}} a center for rhythm and blues (R) in the 1980s, when the multi-talented star Prince (d. 2016) rose to fame.
