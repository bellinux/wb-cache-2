5|$|After {{the police}} leave, Cheenu comes running after {{the car in}} which Viji is travelling. He follows them to the railway station and tries to gain the {{attention}} of Viji, but she is unable to recognise him. Cheenu acts like a dancing monkey that Viji developed a liking for, but Viji, unable to comprehend, thinks that he is insane and begging for food. Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain <b>her</b> <b>attention,</b> and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him. Cheenu, who was injured while chasing her car {{and trying to get}} <b>her</b> <b>attention,</b> is left alone, heartbroken.|$|E

6000|$|... "Couldn't--couldn't we let {{him come}} to see us awhile? Couldn't we explain our ways to him, and allow him to pay <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> without letting <b>her</b> know about this letter?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Annie, {{apparently}} a barmaid at Mrs. Hitchcock's inn, {{may also be}} the house prostitute. It is never clear if <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> to the soldiers are motivated by romance or other considerations.|$|R
5|$|Carrie-Anne Moss as Jerri Falls, Crystal's laidback mother. She {{is obsessed}} with Terri Bratley's {{interior}} design work, but cannot catch <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> until she tells Terri that her son was at Jerri's house.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Mint gained {{its first}} female Director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and despite initial mistrust {{between her and}} O'Reilly, they came to forge a strong bond. Although {{scheduled}} for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly {{was considered to be}} so indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> to Catholic charitable work.|$|E
5|$|Soegiati (Fifi Young) is {{the mother}} of four children: sons Achmad (Rd Ismail), Idris (S Poniman) and Soemadi (Ali Sarosa), and a {{daughter}} named Soepinah (Soelami). She loves them all, but Soemadi receives the most of <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> because he receives little from his father, the merchant Soebagio (Ali Joego). As the children grow, they marry and move away, and eventually only Soemadi is left. Although he begins a relationship with a young woman named Noormala (Soerip), he does not marry her as his income is not enough to support them.|$|E
50|$|Her {{constant}} {{interest for}} modern arts is leading <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> into future projects {{which will include}} the world of contemporary music and dance, working {{with some of the}} most renowned composers and choreographers.|$|R

60|$|This {{information}} made Elizabeth smile, as {{she thought}} of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all <b>her</b> <b>attentions,</b> vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.|$|R
5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, and I could not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event. Nothing could ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez further emphasises the Infanta by his {{positioning}} {{and lighting}} of her maids of honour, whom he sets opposing one another: to left and right, before {{and behind the}} Infanta. The maid to the left faces the light, her brightly lit profile and sleeve creating a diagonal. Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of <b>her</b> <b>attention,</b> making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker {{told her that she}} could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 Teremoana turned <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> to a solo career, {{releasing}} the singles [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and {{a cover of}} the Nina Simone song [...] "Four Women", and was awarded Best Female Vocalist at the 1996 New Zealand Music Awards.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "Something like that. But {{it ought}} to be more definite. He ought to realize that if another girl cared for him, it would be cruel to <b>her,</b> paying <b>her</b> <b>attentions,</b> when he was engaged to some one else." ...|$|R
50|$|Blue Beetle #16 shows Eclipso {{kidnapping}} a {{baby with}} huge raw magical abilities and attempting to corrupt it into a new host for herself. The combined efforts of Blue Beetle and Traci Thirteen foils her plans, steering <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> toward Mary Marvel herself.|$|R
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} more of <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and {{was dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on {{the house for a}} supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|At age 37, Mary turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> {{to finding}} {{a husband and}} {{producing}} an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line {{under the terms of}} Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{new party}} won only 5,674 votes {{and failed to}} cross the electoral {{threshold}} of 1%, subsequently disappearing. Freedman turned <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> to charity, helping to found the women's centre Kol HaIsha (Voice of the Woman) in 1979, {{and returned to the}} United States in 1981.|$|R
5|$|In 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam {{relocated}} to Worcester, Massachusetts, where they operated a successful luncheonette. At {{the end of}} June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> the trio's first opportunity for political action: the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania were locked out when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory {{on the morning of}} July6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|Josephine toured Britain in 1870, {{travelling}} 3,700 {{miles to}} attend 99 {{meetings in the}} course of the year. She focused <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E

Wolf comes to love and respect his father and soon forgets his mother, though Lad continues to search for her daily. A month later, Wolf falls through the ice of the semi-frozen lake, and Lad nearly drowns while saving him. When Lad staggers to shore, he is ecstatically greeted by the recovered Lady.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> to conservation, {{especially}} {{some problems}} {{that she believed}} were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, {{which led to a}} nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E

Meanwhile, in another nightclub, a man convinces a girl to dance with him by touching her hand.|$|E
60|$|At length, a {{something}} like composure succeeded. Suspense must be submitted to, and {{must not be}} allowed to wear her out, and make her useless. Time did something, her own exertions something more, and she resumed <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> to Susan, and again awakened the same interest in them.|$|R
60|$|Janet {{had been}} sedulous in <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> to Sir Louis, {{and had not}} troubled her mistress; but she had not had an easy time of it. Her orders had been, that either she or Thomas should remain in the room the whole day, and those orders had been obeyed.|$|R
60|$|The {{object of}} <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> {{withdrawing}} for the purpose, Miss Smallweed takes that opportunity of jumbling {{the remainder of}} the bread and butter together and launching two or three dirty tea-cups into the ebb-tide of the basin of tea as a hint that she considers the eating and drinking terminated.|$|R
