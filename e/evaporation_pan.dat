50|$|For crop irrigation, optimal water {{efficiency}} means minimizing losses due to evaporation, runoff or subsurface drainage while maximizing production. An <b>evaporation</b> <b>pan</b> {{in combination with}} specific crop correction factors {{can be used to}} determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements. Flood irrigation, the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. Overhead irrigation, using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. Drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions. There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation {{such as the use of}} soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation.|$|E

Accordingly, a project was conducted in the form of stadistical perfect accidendal block in four repetitions and four treatments in 1383 on Ahwaz Azad university research land situated in Choneibeh.

The suitable irrigation period was chosen according to the best treatment performance and its components, and the total amount of water in the taking period defines the depth of irrigation. The soil texture is clay lomy silty and the internal soil is silty clay. According to the amount of the accumulated evaporation from class A <b>evaporation</b> <b>pan</b> and taking the plant coefficient (Kc) into consideration, the amount of needed evapotrans piration was calculated and the amount of needed water for plot was measured by water counter.

As the environmental humidity changes, daily actual evapotranspiration and <b>pan</b> <b>evaporation</b> rates have a contradictory tendency, with the relationship between these two evaporations presenting a clear asymmetrical complementary behavior.

Superiority of S 704 was attributed to be more of 100 grain weight, row number per cob, grain number per cob, cob diameter and cob weight.
