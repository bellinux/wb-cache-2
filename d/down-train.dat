6000|$|... "Now, then--look sharp! Eh, what? The Station-Master? [...] THAR'S NONE! We stopped here {{of our own}} accord. [...] The man {{got killed}} in that <b>down-train</b> {{disaster}} [...] This time last evening. Right there! All aboard!" ...|$|E
60|$|Golightly {{rose from}} the floor feeling very sick and giddy, with his shirt ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back. He yielded to his luck, {{and at that point}} the <b>down-train</b> from Lahore came in {{carrying}} one of Golightly's Majors.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{more highly}} common causes of {{functional}} anorectal pain are levator ani syndrome (LAS) and proctalgia fugax. Both {{of these conditions}} {{are thought to be}} caused by muscle spasms of the either the levator ani muscle or the anal sphincter muscle respectively, and may overlap symptomatically with a third less-common condition called coccygodynia which is the result of previous trauma to the coccyx bone. Stress, prolonged sitting, and constipation all seem to be associated with LAS. The majority (90%) of those reporting chronic episodes of such pain are women. Some researchers group these conditions under the medical category of [...] "tension myalgia of the pelvic floor". Less than a third of those experiencing these conditions seek medical treatment for them. Treatment can involve the use of antispasmotic medications as well as the <b>down-training</b> (conscious involvement and relaxation of previously unconscious muscle movements) so that spasms occur less frequently or not at all.|$|R
60|$|On {{a certain}} day, however, in the {{particular}} year which has now been reached by this narrative--the month being early June--the features of the town excite little interest, though many visitors arrive by the trains; some <b>down-trains,</b> in especial, nearly emptying themselves here. It is {{the week of the}} Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents of an investing army. Rows of marquees, huts, booths, pavilions, arcades, porticoes--every kind of structure short of a permanent one--cover the green field for the space of a square half-mile, and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass, and make straight for the exhibition ground. The way thereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make a market-place of the whole roadway to the show proper, and lead some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see.|$|R
40|$|A re-emergence of {{research}} on EEG-neurofeedback followed controlled evidence of clinical benefits and validation of cognitive/affective gains in healthy participants including correlations in support of feedback learning mediating outcome. Controlled studies with healthy and elderly participants, which have increased exponentially, are reviewed including protocols from the clinic: sensory-motor rhythm, beta 1 and alpha/theta ratios, <b>down-training</b> theta maxima, and from neuroscience: upper-alpha, theta, gamma, alpha desynchronisation. Outcome gains include sustained attention, orienting and executive attention, the P 300 b, memory, spatial rotation, RT, complex psychomotor skills, implicit procedural memory, recognition memory, perceptual binding, intelligence, mood and well-being. Twenty-three of the controlled studies report neurofeedback learning indices along with beneficial outcomes, of which eight report correlations {{in support of a}} meditation link, results which will be supplemented by further creativity and the performing arts evidence in Part II. Validity evidence from optimal performance studies represents an advance for the neurofeedback field demonstrating that cross fertilisation between clinical and optimal performance domains will be fruitful. Theoretical and methodological issues are outlined further in Part III...|$|R
60|$|The railway at Carriford Road {{consisted}} only of {{a single}} line of rails; and the short local <b>down-train</b> by which Owen was going to Budmouth was shunted on to a siding whilst the first up-train passed. Graye entered the waiting-room, and the door being open he listlessly observed the movements of a woman wearing a long grey cloak, and closely hooded, who had asked for a ticket for London.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he guided}} the pony to where some lights {{indicated}} the station of the railway, which here crossed the moor. There was just {{time to return}} the pony to the person at the station from whom it had been borrowed, and obtain their tickets, when the bell of the <b>down-train</b> sounded, {{and in a few}} minutes the Religious and her companions {{were on their way to}} Mowbray, whither a course of two hours carried them.|$|E
60|$|The surprise, {{which had}} owed its origin to his {{imperfect}} acquaintance with the topographical features of that {{end of the}} estate, had been but momentary; the disturbance, a well-known one to dwellers by a railway, being caused by the 6.50 <b>down-train</b> passing along a shallow cutting {{in the midst of}} the wood immediately below where he stood, the driver having the fire-door of the engine open at the minute of going by. The train had, when passing him, already considerably slackened speed, and now a whistle was heard, announcing that Carriford Road Station was not far in its van.|$|E
60|$|If the 6.50 <b>down-train</b> {{had been}} a flash of forked {{lightning}} transfixing him to the earth, he could scarcely have remained in a more trance-like state. He still leant against the railings, his right hand still continued pressing on his walking-stick, his weight on one foot, his other heel raised, his eyes wide open towards the blackness of the cutting. The only movement in him was a slight dropping of the lower jaw, separating his previously closed lips a little way, as when a strange conviction rushes home suddenly upon a man. A new surprise, not nearly so trivial as the first, had taken possession of him.|$|E
60|$|Jude {{found his}} aunt {{even worse than}} the {{communication}} from the Widow Edlin had led him to expect. There was every possibility of her lingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood. He wrote to Sue informing her {{of the state of}} her aunt, and suggesting that she might like to see her aged relative alive. He would meet her at Alfredston Road, the following evening, Monday, on his way back from Christminster, if she could come by the up-train which crossed his <b>down-train</b> at that station. Next morning, according, he went on to Christminster, intending to return to Alfredston soon enough to keep the suggested appointment with Sue.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I {{saw that}} you were {{good enough to be}} {{interested}} in my welfare {{to a greater extent than}} I could have anticipated or hoped, judging you by the frigidity of other employers, and this caused me to hesitate. I was vexed at the complication of affairs. So matters stood till three nights ago; I was then walking home from the pottery, and came up to the railway. The <b>down-train</b> came along close to me, and there, sitting at a carriage window, I saw my wife: she had found out my address, and had thereupon determined to follow me here. I had not been home many minutes before she came in, next morning early she left again--' ...|$|E
6000|$|This was true, when, {{having left}} his baggage at the Junction, he drove another mile {{into the country}} to see the farmer of the gentleman who had his summer-house here, and who had once bantered Bartley to sell him his colt. The farmer was away, {{and would not be}} at home till the up-train from Boston was in. Bartley looked at his watch, and saw that to wait would lose him the six o'clock <b>down-train.</b> There would be no other till eleven o'clock. But it was worth while: the gentleman had said, [...] "When you want the money for that colt, bring him over any time; my farmer will have it ready for you." [...] He waited for the up-train; but when the farmer arrived, he was full of all sorts of scruples and reluctances. He said he should not like to buy it till he had heard from Mr. Farnham; he ended by {{offering}} Bartley eighty dollars for the colt on his own account; he did not want the cutter.|$|E
6000|$|In the <b>down-train</b> {{that was}} timed to reach Aldbrickham station about ten o'clock the next evening, a small, pale child's face {{could be seen}} in the gloom of a third-class carriage. He had large, frightened eyes, and wore a white woollen cravat, over which a key was {{suspended}} round his neck by a piece of common string: the key attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight. In the band of his hat his half-ticket was stuck. His eyes remained mostly fixed {{on the back of the}} seat opposite, and never turned to the window even when a station was reached and called. On the other seat were two or three passengers, one of them a working woman who held a basket on her lap, in which was a tabby kitten. The woman opened the cover now and then, whereupon the kitten would put out its head, and indulge in playful antics. At these the fellow-passengers laughed, except the solitary boy bearing the key and ticket, who, regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes, seemed mutely to say: [...] "All laughing comes from misapprehension. Rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"I idled in {{the lane}} behind the wood till the last <b>down-train</b> had come in, not being in a mood to face strangers. Whilst I was there the fire broke out, and this perplexed me still more. However, I was still {{determined}} not {{to stay in the}} place. I went to the railway-station, which was now quiet, and inquired of the solitary man on duty there concerning the trains. It was not till I had left the man that I saw the effect the fire might have on my history. I considered also, though not in any detailed manner, that the event, by attracting the attention of the village to my former abode, might set people on my track should they doubt my death, and a sudden dread of having to go back again to Knapwater--a place which had seemed inimical to me from first to last--prompted me to run back and bribe the porter to secrecy. I then walked on to Anglebury, lingering about the outskirts of the town till the morning train came in, when I proceeded by it to London, and then took these lodgings, where I have been supporting myself ever since by needlework, endeavouring to save enough money to pay my passage home to America, but making melancholy progress in my attempt. However, all that is changed--can I be otherwise than happy at it? Of course not. I am happy. Tell me what I am to do, and believe me still to be your faithful wife, EUNICE.|$|E
6000|$|Next day the Man {{with the}} Sorrow and myself {{and a few}} others began the real ascent of the Rockies; up to that time our {{climbing}} didn't count. The train ran violently up a steep place and was taken to pieces. Five cars were hitched on to two locomotives, and two cars to one locomotive. This seemed to be a kind and thoughtful act, but I was idiot enough to go forward and watch the coupling-on of the two rear cars in which Cæsar and his fortunes were to travel. Some one had lost or eaten the regularly ordained coupling, and a man picked up from the tailboard of the engine a single iron link about as thick as a fetter-link watch-chain, and [...] "guessed it would do." [...] Get hauled up a Simla cliff by the hook of a lady's parasol if you wish to appreciate my sentiments when the cars moved uphill and the link drew tight. Miles away and two thousand feet above our heads rose the shoulder of a hill epauletted with the long line of a snow-tunnel. The first section of the cars crawled {{a quarter of a mile}} ahead of us, the track snaked and looped behind, and there was a black drop to the left. So we went up and up and up till the thin air grew thinner and the chunk-chunk-chunk, of the labouring locomotive was answered by the oppressed beating of the exhausted heart. Through the chequed light and shade of the snow tunnels (horrible caverns of rude timbering) we ground our way, halting now and again to allow a <b>down-train</b> to pass. One monster of forty mineral-cars slid past, scarce held by four locomotives, their brakes screaming and chortling in chorus; and in the end, after a glimpse at half America spread mapwise leagues below us, we halted at the head of the longest snow tunnel of all, on the crest of the divide, between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea. The locomotive wished to draw breath, and the passengers to gather the flowers that nodded impertinently through the chinks of the boarding. A lady passenger's nose began to bleed, and other ladies threw themselves down on the seats and gasped with the gasping train, while a wind as keen as a knife-edge rioted down the grimy tunnel.|$|E
