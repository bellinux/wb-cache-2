25|$|The {{potential}} {{need for}} a JohnsonKennedy ticket was ultimately eliminated by the Republican nomination of conservative Barry Goldwater.

When attempts to ease Kennedy {{out of the running}} failed, Johnson searched for a way to eliminate him with minimal party discord, and eventually announced that none of his cabinet members would be considered for the position.

25|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} before the United States invaded Iraq, Ramadan {{suggested}} U.S. President George W.

Ramadan's offer included the possibility that a group of US officials would face off with a group of Iraqi officials of same or similar rank (President v. President, Vice President v. Vice President, etc.). Ramadan proposed that the duel be held in a neutral land, with each party using the same weapons, and with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presiding as the supervisor. On behalf of President Bush, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer declined the offer.|$|E
25|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} first road trip {{of the second}} half of the season in New York City against the Mets on July 20. Kemp and Luis Cruz each slugged two-run homers off Mets starter Johan Santana and the team held on for a 7-6 victory. Juan Uribe, who had {{struggled}} in the first half of the season, broke out in the next game, with a homer, double, two walks, four RBI and three runs scored. Chris Capuano picked up his team leading 10th win in the 8–5 victory. Matt Treanor's pinch hit two-run single in the top of the 12th inning led the Dodgers to an 8–3 victory over the Mets on July 22. The win completed the Dodgers first 3-game series sweep of the Mets in New York since 2002 and gave rookie Josh Wall the win. Wall was the first Dodger to pick up a win in relief in his first appearance since Tim Belcher in 1987. Billingsley came off the disabled list to pitch six solid innings in the Dodgers 5–3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on July 24. Luis Cruz's three-run homer was main offense in the game. Kershaw struggled in the next game, allowing 8 earned runs, in the Dodgers 8–2 loss to the Cardinals that ended the five-game winning streak. The Dodgers acquired Hanley Ramírez from the Miami Marlins in a trade on July 25 and Ramírez went 2-for-4 with a triple in his Dodgers debut against the Cardinals. It wasn't enough, however, as ex-Dodger Rafael Furcal hit a two-out single to left in the bottom of the 12th to give the Cardinals a 3–2 victory. Chris Capuano turned in his worst start of the season in the finale against the Cardinals, as the Dodgers lost 7–4. Ramírez hit his first home run as a Dodger in the opener of a key series against the division leading Giants. The two-run homer, in the top of the 10th inning was the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 5-3 victory. The Dodgers picked up another win against their rivals the next day as Chad Billingsley pitched 7 scoreless innings while allowing only 4 hits and Matt Kemp went 4 for 5 with two doubles and a home run in the 10–0 rout. Kershaw pitched a five-hit complete game shutout to complete the Dodgers sweep of the Giants, 4–0, and move them back into a tie for first place in the division.|$|E
