5|$|A <b>French</b> fry {{vending machine}} is a vending machine that {{dispenses}} hot <b>French</b> fries, {{also known as}} chips. The first known <b>french</b> fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured <b>French</b> fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the <b>French</b> Army {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin. It had been {{the legacy of the}} <b>French</b> King and its fusion with the formations of the <b>French</b> revolution and Napoleon's reforms had transformed it into a military machine that had dominated Europe since 1805. Each corps of the <b>French</b> Army was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had never}} before served in the Far East, as CEFEO commander, Leclerc was charged with {{recovering}} <b>French</b> Indochina. This territory, comprising the present day states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, had been conquered by the <b>French</b> during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Vichy regime had allowed the Japanese to use Indochina as a base from which to attack the Allies in Malaya, Burma and China. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese had deposed the <b>French</b> colonial government, taken direct control of Indochina, defeated the <b>French</b> army in several engagements, and imprisoned surviving <b>French</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Although the Ligurian Sea was by {{this stage}} largely <b>French</b> {{territorial}} waters, after the Royal Navy had destroyed the <b>French</b> Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile off Egypt in 1798, the British in fact controlled {{it and the}} whole Mediterranean Sea. By 1801 British bases at Gibraltar, Menorca and Malta allowed British naval forces to cruise throughout the sea largely unopposed; their presence forced {{the remnants of the}} <b>French</b> fleet based at Toulon to make short journeys between <b>French</b> bases to avoid interception and capture. It was therefore not until a large <b>French</b> squadron under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume briefly asserted regional naval superiority that a <b>French</b> expeditionary force was able to secure Elba. They sailed from Piombino on 2 May 1801 with 1,500 men under General Jean Victor Tharreau, who landed unopposed at the Neapolitan town of Porto Longone.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the <b>French</b> Revolutionary Wars was the effect of British {{blockade}} on <b>French</b> movements. The Royal Navy maintained an active close blockade of all major <b>French</b> ports during the conflict, which resulted in every <b>French</b> ship that left port facing attack from squadrons and individual ships patrolling the <b>French</b> and allied coasts. The losses the <b>French</b> Navy suffered {{as a result of}} this strategy were high, and the blockade was so effective that even movement between ports along the <b>French</b> coasts was restricted. In the Indian Ocean however the huge distances between the <b>French</b> bases on Réunion and Isle de France and the British bases in India meant that close blockade was an ineffective strategy: the scale of the forces required to maintain an effective constant blockade of both islands, as well as the Dutch ports at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Dutch East Indies were too large to be worth their deployment to such a distant part of the world. As a result, the <b>French</b> raiders operating from the Indian Ocean bases were able to travel with more freedom and less risk of interception than those in the Atlantic or Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|At 10:30, <b>French</b> forces reached al-'Azma's headquarters, {{unhindered}} by {{the mines}} laid en route by the Syrians. Little information {{is known about}} the battle from the Syrian side. According to one version, when <b>French</b> forces were about 100 meters in the distance, al-'Azma rushed to a Syrian artilleryman stationed near him and demanded him to open fire. However, before any shells could be fired, a <b>French</b> tank unit spotted al-'Azma and gunned him down by machine gun. In another account, al-'Azma had attempted to mine the trenches as the <b>French</b> forces approached his position, but was shot down by the <b>French</b> before he could set off the charges. Al-'Azma's death marked the end of the battle, although intermittent clashes continued until 13:30. Surviving Syrian fighters were bombed from the air and harried by the <b>French</b> as they retreated toward Damascus.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the British and <b>French</b> {{had been}} at war for seven years and the British {{dominated}} the sea, following {{a number of significant}} victories over the <b>French,</b> Dutch and Spanish fleets. Off every <b>French</b> port, large squadrons of British ships of the line and frigates awaited <b>French</b> movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed <b>French</b> merchant vessels and warships. While British trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, <b>French</b> ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the British blockade. To counter British control of the seas, the <b>French</b> periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid British trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained only minimal forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} on 22 June, approximately 1.8million <b>French</b> soldiers were in captivity; a figure representing roughly 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. One of the terms of the Compiègne Armistice was that <b>French</b> prisoners would remain in German custody {{until the end of the}} war which was thought to be imminent. <b>French</b> prisoners came from all backgrounds, regions and civilian occupations within France and also included a substantial number of soldiers from the <b>French</b> colonial empire. Nevertheless, approximately a third of all <b>French</b> prisoners of war were <b>French</b> farmers or peasants and, in some regions, the total proportion of agricultural workers captured was much higher. This created labour shortages in many civilian occupations, particularly agriculture which was largely unmechanised.|$|E

5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the <b>French</b> versions of his given names, and after receiving <b>French</b> citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a <b>French</b> passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking <b>French.</b> Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be <b>French,</b> despite his father's <b>French</b> origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>French</b> Revolution and Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII {{lived in}} exile in Prussia, the United Kingdom and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally {{defeated}} Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the <b>French</b> royalists, considered his rightful position. Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba, however, and restored his <b>French</b> Empire. Louis XVIII fled and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the <b>French</b> Empire, defeated Napoleon, and restored Louis XVIII to the <b>French</b> throne.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy {{was charged}} with {{limiting}} the passage and operations of the <b>French</b> Navy, <b>French</b> merchant ships and <b>French</b> privateers. To achieve this objective, the Royal Navy imposed a system of blockades on <b>French</b> ports, especially the major naval bases at Toulon and Brest. This stranglehold on <b>French</b> movement off their own coastline seriously affected the <b>French</b> colonies, including those in the West Indies, as their produce could not reach France and supplies and reinforcements could not reach them without the risk of British interception and seizure. These islands provided excellent bases for <b>French</b> ships to raid the British trade routes through the Caribbean Sea: in previous conflicts, the British had countered {{the threat posed by}} <b>French</b> West Indian colonies by seizing them through force, such as Martinique, which had been previously captured by armed invasion in 1762 and 1794. An attempt in 1780 was defeated by a <b>French</b> battle squadron at the Battle of Martinique. By 1808 there were no <b>French</b> squadrons at sea: any that left port were eliminated or driven back in a series of battles, culminating at the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The fleet that was destroyed at Trafalgar had visited Martinique the year before and was the last full scale <b>French</b> fleet to visit the Caribbean {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>French</b> colonization, the {{language}} of instruction and media changed from Malagasy to almost exclusively <b>French.</b> Moreover, the first <b>French</b> governor-general, Gallieni, also encouraged the <b>French</b> officials to learn Malagasy as well. After {{the advent of the}} Malagasy independence, the Madagascans tried to reinstate Malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools. However, {{the language}} policy was inadequately planned and Malagasy was struggling to surpass <b>French</b> as {{the language of}} instruction.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>French</b> {{surrender}} on 22 June, the <b>French</b> fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the <b>French</b> ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the <b>French</b> fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the <b>French</b> vessels to join the British with the Free <b>French,</b> surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the <b>French</b> rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the <b>French</b> National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in <b>French</b> West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories.

Following the <b>French</b> constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the <b>French</b> Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
