5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of <b>excess</b> <b>fat,</b> is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church União do Vegetal, suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.|$|E
25|$|Liposuction, {{also known}} as lipoplasty, is a {{cosmetic}} surgical procedure that slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing <b>excess</b> <b>fat</b> deposits, improving the body's contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing the patient's self-image. Liposuction {{involves the use of}} a small stainless steel tube, called a cannula. The cannula is connected to a powerful suction pump and inserted into the fat through small incisions in the skin. Fat removal is accomplished as the suction cannula creates tiny tunnels through the fatty layers. Liposuction can be performed on both men and women. Ideal for this type of procedure are non-smokers, healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing, adults within 30% of their ideal weight who have firm and elastic skin.|$|E

Methods: These cross-sectional analyses {{are part of the}} Health, Wellbeing and Aging Study conducted in São Paulo, Brazil, with 806 older adults with self-reported hypertension and diabetes Mellitus. The study included the annual costs with medicines, hospital admissions, and outpatient services for hypertension and diabetes Mellitus control. <b>Excess</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> was diagnosed based on waist circumference. Level of physical activity, age, and gender were considered covariates. The sample was divided into two groups according to waist circumference. Multiple logistic regression analyzed the associations between annual costs and waist circumference. Results: The cost of services and hospitalizations (R$ 551. 05; 95 %CI= 418. 27 - 683. 83) and total costs (R$ 817. 77; 95 %CI= 669. 21 - 966. 33) were higher in the <b>excess</b> abdominal <b>fat</b> group. Older adults with high waist circumference had higher odds of increasing annual costs due to medicines (OR= 2. 6; 95 %CI= 1. 13 - 3. 77), regardless of gender, age, and level of physical activity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the sensitivity and specificity of BMI-based classification systems for detecting <b>excess</b> body <b>fat</b> in schoolchildren. A total of 2, 795 schoolchildren aged 7 to 10 years were examined. <b>Excess</b> body <b>fat</b> was defined as the standardized residuals of sum of three skinfolds thickness ranking at or above the 90 th percentile. The international BMI-based systems recommended by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the World Health Organization(WHO- 2007) were evaluated on the basis of their sensitivity and specificity for detecting <b>excess</b> body <b>fat</b> and compared with a national BMI reference (Brazil- 2006). The positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios analysis was also used to compare the diagnostic accuracies of the three BMI criteria. The three classification systems presented moderately high sensitivity (78. 4 - 98. 6 %) and specificity (75. 9 - 91. 6 %) for both genders. Overall, the three classification systems showed both LR+ and LR- values consistent with adiagnosis of moderate evidence for overweight (LR+ above five and LR- below 0. 2). The results showed that the three BMI classification systems can be usedas screening instruments of <b>excess</b> body <b>fat.</b> However, the performance of the Brazil- 2006 classification system was superior because it showed the best balance between the diagnostic accuracy indices...|$|R

25|$|Atherogenesis is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of <b>excess</b> <b>fat,</b> collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in detecting <b>excess</b> body <b>fat</b> among schoolchildren in Florian&# 243;polis, Santa Catarina. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 2, 772 schoolchildren aged seven to ten years. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the BMI, the WC and the WHtR in identifying children with <b>excess</b> body <b>fat</b> (defined as values that were equal to or higher than the 90 th percentile of the standardized residuals obtained from the sum of the four skinfolds thickness). Likelihood ratio estimates were used to select, for each anthropometric index, the cut-off points that presented the highest association with <b>excess</b> body <b>fat.</b> RESULTS: The BMI, WC and WHtR performed well in detecting <b>excess</b> body <b>fat,</b> indicated by areas under the ROC curve (AUC) close to 1. 0, with slightly higher AUC for the BMI in comparison to the WC and the WHtR concerning both sexes. Highly sensitive and specific cut-off points were derived for the three anthropometric indices. Sensitivity ranged from 85. 7 to 92. 9 % for the BMI, from 78. 6 to 89. 7 % for the WC, and from 78. 6 to 89. 2 % for the WHtR. Specificity ranged from 83. 2 to 91. 4 %, from 75. 0 to 90. 7 %, and from 77. 4 to 88. 3 % for the BMI, the WC and the WHtR, respectively.

40|$|The global overfat {{pandemic}} is {{a serious}} public health crisis that places a substantial burden on economic resources in developed countries.

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this <b>excess</b> <b>fat</b> is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Normal weight obesity (NWO) {{is defined}} as an {{excessive}} body fat associated with a normal body mass index (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)), but its prevalence {{in the general population}} is unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the prevalence of NWO in Switzerland according to different cut points used to define <b>excess</b> body <b>fat.</b> METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 3, 213 women and 2, 912 men aged 35 - 75 years. Body fat was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis and prevalence of NWO was assessed using four previously published definitions for <b>excess</b> body <b>fat.</b> RESULTS: Percent body fat increased with age: in men, the values (mean +/- SD) were 20. 2 +/- 5. 4, 23. 0 +/- 5. 4, 26. 3 +/- 5. 2 and 28. 2 +/- 4. 6 for age groups 35 - 44, 45 - 54, 55 - 64 and 65 - 75 years, respectively; the corresponding values for women were 29. 9 +/- 7. 8, 33. 1 +/- 7. 4, 36. 7 +/- 7. 5 and 39. 6 +/- 6. 9. In men, prevalence of NWO was < 1 % irrespective of the definition used. Conversely, in women, a 1 - to 20 -fold difference (from 1. 4 to 27. 8 %) in NWO prevalence was found. The prevalence of NWO increased with age when age-independent cut points were used in women, but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of NWO is low in the general population and higher in women than in men. The prevalence is highly dependent on the criteria used to define <b>excess</b> body <b>fat,</b> namely in women. The use of gender- and age-specific cut points to define <b>excess</b> body <b>fat</b> is better than fixed or gender-specific only cut points...|$|R

40|$|The overfat {{condition}} {{is defined as}} <b>excess</b> body <b>fat</b> sufficient to impair health. The problem exists in most overweight and obese individuals and can also occur in those who are normal-weight and non-obese, often due to <b>excess</b> abdominal <b>fat.</b> Despite previous indications that the prevalence overweight and obesity is leveling, these conditions are currently at their highest levels in US history. Our review estimated the number of overfat Americans at 91 % for adults and 69 % for children.
