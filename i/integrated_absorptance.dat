40|$|Line {{and band}} models for {{infrared}} spectral absorption are discussed. Radiative transmittance and <b>integrated</b> <b>absorptance</b> of Lorentz, Doppler, and voigt line profiles were compared {{for a range}} of parameters. It was found that, for the intermediate path lengths, the combined Lorentz-Doppler (Voigt) profile is essential in calculating the atmospheric transmittance. Narrow band model relations for absorptance were used to develop exact formulations for total absorption by four wide band models. Several continuous correlations for the absorption of a wide band model were compared with the numerical solutions of the wide band models. By employing the line-by-line and quasi-random band model formulations, computational procedures were developed for evaluating transmittance and upwelling atmospheric radiance. Homogeneous path transmittances were calculated for selected bands of CO, CO 2, and N 2 O and compared with experimental measurements. The upwelling radiance and signal change in the wave number interval of the CO fundamental band were also calculated...|$|E
30|$|Black Si was {{fabricated}} on a 450 -μm-thick single-side polished boron-doped Si (100) wafer with a resistivity of 10  Ω cm. A 1 -kHz, 100 -fs, and 800 -nm Ti:sapphire laser {{was used}} for the laser processing. To fabricate a microstructural surface, cleaned Si wafer was placed on a translation stage in a vacuum chamber filled with high pure SF 6 gas at a pressure of 5 [*]×[*] 104  Pa. The wafer was irradiated with a snakelike scanning in SF 6 ambient by the fs laser with a fluence of approximately 0.75  J/cm 2, leading to the formation of 2 [*]×[*] 2  cm 2 black Si with a microstructural surface. Then, black Si was thermally treated at 825  K in a furnace with N 2 ambient for 10  min. Thin Ag films were deposited on the microstructural surface by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.5  Å/s. The surface morphology was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The integrated reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) spectra between 500 and 2500  nm were measured in a spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda- 1050) equipped with a 160 -mm integrating sphere. The <b>integrated</b> <b>absorptance</b> (A) spectra were extracted through A[*]=[*] 1 [*]−[*]R[*]−[*]T.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of low-energy metal-adsorbate vibrational modes of CO molecules and O atoms chemisorbed on a Pt(111) surface using infrared spectroscopy (IRS). The infrared selection rule states that only vibrational modes having a non-vanishing component of its dynamical dipole moment perpendicular to the surface can be directly excited using IRS, known as dipole-allowed modes. However, there exist at least two mechanisms that indirectly can excite dipole-forbidden modes vibrating parallel to the surface. One is seen as a doublet structure due to anharmonic coupling to a combination of dipole-forbidden modes, a Fermi resonance. The second is observed as a dip, an increase in the surface reflectivity at the energy of a dipole-forbidden mode, an anti-absorption. The low-energy modes of CO chemisorbed in the ordered c(4 x 2) structure on Pt(111) were investigated at 100 K. The dipole-allowed Pt-CO stretch of both ontop- and bridge bonded CO were investigated. For the bridge-bonded species a doublet line shape was observed for one of the isotopes which we assigned to a Fermi resonance, a coupling between the Pt-CO stretch and a combination of dipole-forbidden modes, being the first Fermi resonance observed for a low-energy mode. The temperature dependence of the doublet was very strong, it vanished at 50 K and became one single peak which gained in intensity with a factor of two which supports the Fermi resonance interpretation if the combination mode involved thermally excited low-energy modes. No anti-absorption was observed for the frustrated rotation of CO ontop on Pt(111). The detailed IRS investigation of oxygen chemisorbed in the p(2 x 2) structure on the same surface was the first for an atomic adsorbate on a metal surface. The dipole-allowed Pt-O stretch of atomic oxygen in a hollow site was detected around 480 cm- 1 and investigated between 50 and 300 K. Its line width exhibited a strong temperature dependence. A dip, an anti-absorption, was observed in the spectrum around 400 cm- 1 which we assigned to the dipole-forbidden frustrated translation. The temperature dependence of the anti-absorption was weak. An adsorbate dependence was observed for the anti-absorption. The accompanying broadband reflectance change was two times larger for O/Pt(111) than for CO/Pt(111). The relative <b>integrated</b> <b>absorptance</b> of the dipole-allowed metal-adsorbate stretches was discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{method is}} based upon {{molecular}} line parameters and makes use of a far wing scaling approximation and k distribution approach previously applied to the computation of the infrared cooling rate due to water vapor. Taking into account the wave number dependence of the incident solar flux, the solar heating rate is computed for the entire water vapor spectrum and for individual absorption bands. The accuracy of the method is tested against line by line calculations. The method introduces a maximum error of 0. 06 C/day. The method has the additional advantage over previous methods in {{that it can be}} applied to any portion of the spectral region containing the water vapor bands. The <b>integrated</b> <b>absorptances</b> and line intensities computed from the molecular line parameters were compared with laboratory measurements. The comparison reveals that, among the three different sources, absorptance is the largest for the laboratory measurements...|$|R
40|$|The total {{reflectance}} {{spectra of}} lunar simulant dusts (< 20 mm particles) were measured {{in order to}} determine their <b>integrated</b> solar <b>absorptance</b> (alpha) and their thermal emittance (epsilon) for the purpose of analyzing the effect of dust on the performance of thermal control surfaces. All of the simulants except one had a wavelength-dependent reflectivity (p (lambda)) near 0. 10 over the wavelength range of 8 to 25 microns and so are highly emitting at room temperature and lower. The 300 K emittance (epsilon) of all the lunar simulants except one ranged from 0. 78 to 0. 92. The exception was Minnesota Lunar Simulant 1 (MLS- 1), which has little or no glassy component. In all cases the epsilon was lower for the < 20 micron particles than for larger particles reported earlier. There was considerably more variation in the lunar simulant reflectance in the solar spectral range (250 to 2500 nm) than in the thermal infrared. As expected, the lunar highlands simulants were more reflective in this wavelength range than the lunar mare simulants. The <b>integrated</b> solar <b>absorptance</b> (alpha) of the simulants ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 75. This is lower than values reported earlier for larger particles of the same simulants (0. 41 to 0. 82), and for representative mare and highlands lunar soils (0. 74 to 0. 91). Since the of some mare simulants more closely matched that of highlands lunar soils, it is recommended that and values be the criteria for choosing a simulant for assessing the effects of dust on thermal control surfaces, rather than whether a simulant has been formulated as a highlands or a mare simulant...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} reflectance properties of a commercially prepared black chrome over dull nickel, both plated on steel, for various plating {{times of the}} black chrome were measured. The plating current was 180 amperes per square foot. Values of <b>absorptance</b> <b>integrated</b> over the solar spectrum, and of infrared emittance integrated over black-body radiation at 250 F were obtained. It is shown that plating between one and two minutes produces the optimum combination of highest heat absorbed and lowest heat lost by radiation...|$|R
40|$|Six {{samples of}} {{pristine}} and dust-abraded outer layer spacesuit fabrics {{were included in}} the Materials International Space Station Experiment- 7, in which they were exposed to the wake side low Earth orbit environment (LEO) on the International Space Station (ISS) for 18 months in order to determine whether abrasion by lunar dust increases radiation degradation. The fabric samples were characterized using optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and tensile testing before and after exposure on the ISS. Comparison of pre- and post-flight characterizations showed that wake side LEO environment darkened and reddened all six fabrics, increasing their <b>integrated</b> solar <b>absorptance</b> by 7 to 38 percent. There was a decrease in the ultimate tensile strength and elongation to failure of lunar dust abraded Apollo spacesuit fibers by a factor of four and increased the elastic modulus by a factor of two. The severity of the degradation of the fabric samples over this short exposure time demonstrates the necessity to find ways to prevent or mitigate radiation damage to spacesuits when planning extended missions to the Moon...|$|R
40|$|The first {{comparative}} study of the reflectance spectra of lunar simulants is presented. All of the simulants except one had a wavelength-dependant reflectivity (()) near 0. 10 over the wavelength range of 8 to 25 m, so they are highly emitting at room temperature and lower. The 300 K emittance () of all the lunar simulants except one ranged from 0. 884 to 0. 906. The 300 K of JSC Mars- 1 simulant was 0. 927. There was considerably more variation in the lunar simulant reflectance in the solar spectral range (250 to 2500 nm) than in the thermal infrared. Larger particle size simulants reflected much less than those with smaller particle size. As expected, the lunar highlands simulants were more reflective in this wavelength range than the lunar mare simulants. The <b>integrated</b> solar <b>absorptance</b> () of the simulants ranged from 0. 413 to 0. 817 for those with smaller particles, and 0. 669 to 0. 906 for those with larger particles. Although spectral differences were observed, the for the simulants appears {{to be similar to}} that of lunar soils (0. 65 to 0. 88). These data are now available to be used in modeling the effects of dust on thermal control surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The Thermal Control Surfaces Experiment (TCSE) on the LDEF was a {{comprehensive}} experiment that combined in-space measurements with extensive pre- and post-flight analyses of thermal control surfaces {{to determine the}} effects of exposure to the low earth orbit (LEO) space environment. The TCSE is the first space experiment to directly measure in-situ total hemispherical reflectance of thermal control surfaces in the same way they are routinely measured in the laboratory. In-space optical measurements performed by the TCSE provide the unique opportunity for trend analysis of the performance of materials in the space environment. Such trend analysis of flight data offers the potential to develop an empirical life time prediction model for several thermal control surfaces. For material research, trend analysis of the TCSE flight data, particularly the spectral data, can provide insight into the damage mechanisms of space exposure. Trend analysis for the TCSE samples has been limited to those materials that were not significantly eroded by the atomic oxygen (AO) environment. The performance of several materials on the LDEF mission was dominated by AO effects. Trend analysis was performed on both the detailed spectral reflectance measurements (in-space, pre-flight, and post-flight) and on the <b>integrated</b> solar <b>absorptance.</b> Results of this analysis for the five selected TCSE materials are presented along with the spectral flight data. Possible degradation and effects mechanisms will be discussed to better understand and predict the behavior of these materials in the LEO space environment...|$|R
40|$|During the Apollo {{program the}} effects of lunar dust on thermal control {{surfaces}} {{was found to be}} more significant than anticipated, with several systems overheating due to deposition of dust on them. In an effort to reduce risk to future missions, a series of tests has been initiated to characterize {{the effects of}} dust on these surfaces, and then to develop technologies to mitigate that risk. Given the variations in albedo across the lunar surface, one variable that may be important is the darkness of the lunar dust, and this study was undertaken to address that concern. Three thermal control surfaces, AZ- 93 white paint and AgFEP and AlFEP second surface mirrors were dusted with three different lunar dust simulants in a simulated lunar environment, and their <b>integrated</b> solar <b>absorptance</b> () and thermal emittance () values determined experimentally. The three simulants included JSC- 1 AF, a darker mare simulant, NU-LHT- 1 D, a light highlands simulant, and 1 : 1 mixture of the two. The response of AZ- 93 was found to be slightly more pronounced than that of AgFEP. The increased with fractional dust coverage in both types of samples by a factor of 1. 7 to 3. 3, {{depending on the type of}} thermal control surface and the type of dust. The of the AZ- 93 decreased by about 10 percent when fully covered by dust, while that of AgFEP increased by about 10 percent. It was found that / varied by more than a factor of two depending on the thermal control surface and the darkness of the dust. Given that the darkest simulant used in this study may be lighter than the darkest dust that could be encountered on the lunar surface, it becomes apparent that the performance degradation of thermal control surfaces due to dust on the Moon will be strongly dependent on the and of the dust in the specific localit...|$|R
