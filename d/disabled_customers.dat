40|$|A {{required}} {{feature of}} a Long-Term Disability (LTD) insurance policy is its method of calculating Basic Monthly Earnings (BME), which determines {{how much a}} <b>disabled</b> <b>customer</b> will be paid. Most BMEs conform to some standard formula. However, to increase sales of its LTD policies, a large U. S. -based LTD company increased its use of Non-Standard BMEs (NSBME), which led to more errors and higher costs. Our model tested various processing approaches and found the optimal way to process these claims: an even mix of low-level Disability Benefits Specialists (DBS) and mid-level Benefits Financial Consultants (BFC). The costs of the BFC review were offset by the savings from all the errors they detected. Also, suspecting that he company’s reliance on NSBMEs {{was an example of}} the “Fixes that Fail ” and “Shifting the Burden ” systems archetypes, we found that eliminating this practice was the highest leverage policy of all.

40|$|Disaster Recovery with General Parallel File System 2. 2 The {{ability to}} detect and quickly recover from a massive-scale {{hardware}} failure {{is of paramount importance}} to businesses that make use of real-time data processing systems. General Parallel File System (GPFS) provides a number of features that facilitate the implementation of highly-available GPFS environments capable of withstanding catastrophic hardware failures. By maintaining a redundant replica of the file system’s data at another (geographically separated) location, we allow the system to sustain its processing using the secondary replica of the data {{in the event of a}} total failure in the prime environment. In this paper, we present an overview of the disaster recovery features available in the 2. 2 release of GPFS and provide detailed hands-on guidance on implementing the various types of disaster-tolerant configurations supported in this release. Overview and terminology Businesses that depend on real-time data processing systems are vulnerable to a profound negative impact from natural or unnatural disasters such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, or power failures.

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} level of political, {{economic and social}} pressures, the role of third sector non-executive directors, undertaken voluntarily and unremunerated, is poised to become less attractive. Introduction The Australian disability sector is the current research focus due to environmental pressures on the governance structures. The Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) was introduced to fund lifestyle requirements of disabled people in Australia. Previously this funding was provided to disability organisations that essentially decided the care available to its disabled clients (Soldatic & Pini 2012).   Under the NDIS these disabled clients now start to control the funding stream previously provided to disability organisations by state and federal governments. The challenge faced by the boards of disability organisations {{is that they are}} now in the position of courting the disabled to provide the services which will then be paid for instead of dispensing services directly to the <b>disabled.</b> This <b>customer</b> orientation change in organisations’ focus drives considerable pressures on the current boards to reframe the strategic emphasis of the organisations from essentially a paternalistic to a more market oriented perspective. Given {{the increasing}} level of political, economic and social pressures, the role of third sector non-executive directors, undertaken voluntarily and unremunerated, is poised to become less attractive. Understanding the relationship between volunteering for one of these roles and the symbolic, career or social capital this provides to the individual means that board roles in the third sector become more feasible for both the director and the organisation when understanding the potential rewards that accrue to the individual director...|$|R

40|$|The Autonomous Non-Commercial Organization “Minority Report” Research Center {{carried out}} a complex all-Russian {{monitoring}} of accessibility of higher education {{for students with disabilities}} in 1 / 3 of state universities (165 universities in 51 regions). The authors explored the issue {{from the point of view}} of organizations offering services in higher education (universities) as well as from the point of view of their <b>customers</b> (<b>disabled</b> students and their parents) and completed the picture with the data obtained through monitoring and participant observation; this enabled the authors to reveal the main problems that students with disabilities experience in getting higher education – in the stages of career guidance, university admission, studying at university and further employment. For instance, the authors point out to the legal restriction ‘one university – one profession’ referring to admission quotas for students with disabilities; problems with getting documents required for university application; low accessibility of educational environment and insufficient supply of special teaching devices; low accessibility of university websites etc. The authors propose the following specific measures for raising the accessibility of higher education for the disabled: introducing changes to legal acts restricting the opportunities of the disabled in higher education; changing the practices in organizations responsible for medical and social assessment in how they provide documents required for university application; expanding the services offered by resource and training centers; introducing a unified standard for university websites in sections referring to disability services, etc. This project was supported by state grant funds, Executive Order of the President of the Russian Federation issued on April 01, 2015 # 79 -рп, and on the basis of the contest carried out by the All-Russian Non-Governmental Organization «Liga Zdorovya Natsii»...|$|R
