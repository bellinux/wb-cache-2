5|$|Between {{approximately}} 1967 and 1978, {{large quantities}} of videotape and film stored in the BBC's <b>Engineering</b> <b>department</b> and film libraries, respectively, were wiped or destroyed {{to make way for}} newer programmes.

5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Film and Videotape Library, an audit of the <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> found 60 of the 128 Third Doctor episodes starring Jon Pertwee, which in addition to the Film Library's copies of the film-originated Spearhead from Space, brought that Doctor's episode count up to 64 out of 128.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> had no {{mandate to}} archive the {{programme}} videotapes they held, although typically {{they would not}} be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes. The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial The Highlanders, which were erased on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further erasing and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master videotape of the programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were those for the 1968 serial Fury from the Deep, in late 1974.|$|E

5|$|After Zobel {{arrived at}} the <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> of AT he used his {{mathematical}} skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters.

5|$|Birch {{went to work}} in the <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> of the New York Telephone Company. He {{applied for}} and {{received}} an American Field Service Fellowship in 1926, which he used to travel to Strasbourg, and study at the University of Strasbourg's Institut de Physique under the tutelage of Pierre Weiss. There, he wrote or co-wrote four papers, in French, on topics such as the paramagnetic properties of potassium cyanide, and the magnetic moment of Cu++ ions.|$|E

The department would be reincarnated after the war under the guidance of Lane Mitchell.|$|E

Perhaps most significantly, Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A is {{a commercially}} {{produced}} loudspeaker {{driven by the}} need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It {{was derived from the}} LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> in the early 1970s, when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E

5|$|When the BBC audited its Film Library in 1977, 47 episodes {{were found}} to exist. These Film Library copies were a random {{sampling}} of viewing prints for various episodes, along with seven of the nine episodes that had originally been telerecorded onto film for editing and/or transmission, rather than recorded to videotape. These film-originated masters were stored in the Film Library, {{rather than in the}} <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> with the videotapes.

5|$|After 34 {{years at}} NASA, Jackson had {{achieved}} {{the most senior}} title within the <b>engineering</b> <b>department.</b> She {{decided to take a}} demotion in order to serve as an administrator in the Equal Opportunity Specialist field.

She served as both the Federal Women’s Program Manager in the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs and as the Affirmative Action Program Manager, and she worked to influence the career paths of women in science, engineering, and mathematics positions at NASA. She continued to work at NASA until her retirement in 1985.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{provided}} {{universities and colleges}} with grants to acquire small nuclear reactors for research programs. The University of Washington began nuclear engineering classes {{as part of the}} College of Engineering in 1953, and formed a Department of Nuclear Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from Boeing and the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The Nuclear <b>Engineering</b> <b>department</b> used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E

Instead, released {{at the same time as}} Gotcha and showcased at the early November 1973 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition were two additional versions of Gotcha: one with a tinted color overlay, and a true multi-color version of Gotcha with red, blue, and green colors. The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E
