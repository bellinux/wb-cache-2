After the multi-platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and a subsequent yearlong world tour, follow-up Adore was considered [...] "one of the most anticipated albums of 1998" [...] by MTV.

500|$|Harrison had {{intended}} to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector, a mainstay of his career since 1970. Spector's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable, in light of how Spector's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as [...] "Who Can See It" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round". Another regular Harrison collaborator, John Barham, provided orchestral arrangements as before, and noted an [...] "austere quality" [...] {{in some of the}} new songs. [...] "George was under stress during Living in the Material World," [...] Barham said later. [...] "I felt that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> some kind of a crisis.

At the time, his only acting experience had been in a Kroger television commercial and a Vacation Bible School training film. For three years, Hutcherson and his mother lived in Los Angeles' Oakwood apartments, a housing community that accommodates young child actors and their families.|$|E

500|$|In early 2010, an Afghan man {{approached}} the NDS claiming to represent senior Taliban commander Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. Offering a letter allegedly written by Mansour, he said Mansour was interested {{to open a}} channel for negotiations. Saleh's people started testing the credentials of the supposed messenger, and judged them to be false, closing the case. The man then approached other Afghan government institutions. Saleh recounts, [...] "When I learned ... that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> a different avenue, I warned the government that if it is this Aminullah, if he claims this, {{and if it is}} this guy, trust me, he is not representing anybody; it's a scam. ... Be careful. This is not Mansour. But there was a perception that Amrullah is against talks, so let's sideline him." [...] The Afghan man, who lived in Pakistan where the Taliban's leadership council is based, subsequently held three meetings with NATO and Afghan officials. Having been flown from Pakistan to Kabul on a NATO airplane, the man met with President Karzai in the presidential palace. In late 2010, it turned out, that the supposed representative for Mansour was an impostor as Saleh had previously warned. The New York Times writes: [...] "In an episode that could have been lifted from a spy novel, United States and Afghan officials now say the Afghan man was an impostor." ...|$|E

I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

These anxieties he poured out to a neighbouring minister, Mr Wodrow of Eastwood, {{at the time of}} his call to Cambuslang. He felt he was [...] "nothing but a hollow hypocrite" [...] because he had been preaching since his ordination on the nature of Conversion and was a [...] "perfect stranger to it himself". He was always very serious and dutiful, and preferred the company of righteous people, but had no inward experience of conversion.

He was also much depressed by conversations with ordinary people, who told him about their experiences of conversion, which [...] "he has been a stranger to". Mr Wodrow thought him a sincere, studious and depressive sort of person, with the tendency of such people to be over-critical of themselves and rather obsessive on the details of theological study.
