Projections {{indicate that the}} world's <b>human</b> <b>population</b> will reach 9.2billion in 2050. Most of the growth {{is expected to take}} place in developing nations. <b>Human</b> <b>population</b> density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia. By 2020, 60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.|$|E

There are about 80,000Icelandic horses in Iceland (compared to a <b>human</b> <b>population</b> of 317,000), and around 100,000 abroad. Almost 50,000 are in Germany, which has many active riding clubs and breed societies.|$|E

25|$|In a 2013 study, the {{researchers}} {{suggested that the}} observed genetic affinities between archaic and modern <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> are mostly explained by common ancestral polymorphisms—and not admixture—followed by genetic drift, explaining that {{the differences in the}} observed genetic affinities among modern <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> are most-likely a result from different retention rates of these polymorphisms among the modern <b>human</b> <b>populations.</b> However, they also stated that the study did not rule out archaic introgression to modern humans.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from sexual}} dimorphism, {{there are many}} other {{examples}} of human genetic polymorphisms.

5|$|Although rare, {{infection}} of humans by rabies from vampire bat bites has been documented; {{for example in}} 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the <b>human</b> <b>population</b> is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites. Only 0.5% of bats carry rabies, {{and those that do}} may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the <b>human</b> <b>population,</b> which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
40|$|It is {{suggested}} that disease limits populations only under exceptional circumstances, when other population-limiting factors are inoperative. This is precisely the situation with <b>human</b> <b>populations,</b> which have grown well (perhaps as much as three logs) beyond sustainability. It is inconceivable that any self-regulatory mechanism will bring <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> down to a level compatible with the survival of other large mammals, so the only hope for environmental survival is disease. In this essay, I discuss the inexorable rise of <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> and our seeming escape from all normal boundaries to population growth, apart, perhaps, from diseases. I then provide examples of how the various leishmaniases have affected and constrained <b>human</b> <b>populations,</b> or have failed to do so, providing {{an example of how}} diseases may ultimately protect landscapes from anthropogenic change...|$|R

5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the <b>human</b> <b>population</b> and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The <b>human</b> <b>population</b> also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the <b>human</b> <b>population</b> are {{allergic}} to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded.

5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably became extinct before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690.

From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a <b>human</b> <b>population.</b> The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the <b>human</b> <b>population</b> in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
