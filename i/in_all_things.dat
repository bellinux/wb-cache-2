5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish {{tradition}} gives great {{stress to}} reverence for parents.

25|$|The {{subject has}} grown in {{popularity}} with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture.

25|$|According to Sri Aurobindo, {{the current}} status of human {{evolution}} is an intermediate stage in the evolution of being, which {{is on its way to}} the unfolding of the spirit, and the self-revelation of divinity <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things.</b> Yoga is a rapid and concentrated evolution of being, which can take effect in one life-time, while unassisted natural evolution would take many centuries or many births. Aurobindo suggests a grand program called sapta chatushtaya (seven quadrates) to aid this evolution.|$|E
25|$|As only {{a limited}} number of American jazz records were {{released}} in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and Lonnie Johnson, who visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences' interest in jazz, as well as the interest <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time. The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period.|$|E

25|$|His {{primary goal}} in educating his {{students}} was to produce ethically well-cultivated {{men who would}} carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> (Analects 12.11; see also 13.3). He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, {{as long as they}} were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn (Analects 7.7; 15.38). He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught practical skills, but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.|$|E
25|$|Another {{monument}} {{is located}} in Fertőrákos, Hungary, {{at the site of}} the Pan-European Picnic. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by Gabriela von Habsburg.

On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text:” In necessariis unitas – in dubiis libertas – in omnibus caritas.” (Unity in unavoidable matters – freedom in doubtful matters – love <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things.)</b> The memorial symbolises the iron curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Muhammad, a meeting took place at Saqifah. At that meeting, Abu Bakr was elected caliph by the Muslim community. Sunni Muslims {{developed}} {{the belief that the}} caliph is a temporal political ruler, appointed to rule within the bounds of Islamic law (The rules of life set by Allah in the Qur'an). The job of adjudicating orthodoxy and Islamic law was left to Islamic lawyers, judiciary, or specialists individually termed as Mujtahids and collectively named the Ulema. The first four caliphs are called the Rashidun, meaning the Rightly Guided Caliphs, because they are believed to have followed the Qur'an and the sunnah (example) of Muhammad <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ignatian Spirituality {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} earlier spiritual traditions: finding God <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things,</b> or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has {{roots in the}} Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability {{is the extent to}} which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning to the events of Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord.|$|E
25|$|Since the Arminian controversy, the Reformed tradition—as {{a branch}} of Protestantism {{distinguished}} from Lutheranism—divided into two separate groups, Arminians and Calvinists. However, it is now rare to call Arminians {{a part of the}} Reformed tradition, as many see these two schools of thought as opposed, making the terms Calvinist and Reformed synonymous. While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word Calvinism is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on soteriology and predestination, which are summarized in part by the Five Points of Calvinism. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the sovereignty or rule of God <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> including salvation.|$|E
25|$|Advaita also posits {{the fourth}} state of Turiya, which some {{describe}} as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya {{is the state}} of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta.|$|E
