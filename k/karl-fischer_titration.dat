40|$|The liquid organic {{fraction}} of pyrolytic tar {{has a high}} energy value which makes possible its utilization as an energy source. However, before utilization, {{it is crucial to}} remove water from the liquid fraction. The presence of water reduces the energy value of pyrolytic tars. Water separation from the organic tar fraction is a complex process, since an emulsion can be readily formed. Therefore, after phase separation, {{it is important to know}} the residual water content in the organic phase and whether it is necessary to further dry it. The results presented in this manuscript focus on a water determination in liquid products from coal and biomass pyrolysis by a coulometric <b>Karl‑Fischer</b> <b>titration.</b> The Coulometric <b>Karl‑Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> is often used for a water content determination in gaseous, liquid and solid samples. However, to date, this titration method has not been used for a water determination in tars. A new water determination method, which has been tested on different types of tar, has been developed. The Coulometric <b>Karl‑Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> is suitable for tar samples with a water content not greater than 5 wt. %. The obtained experimental results indicate that the new introduced method can be used with a very good repeatability for a water content determination in tars...|$|E

40|$|Decades of {{work have}} shown that trace- to minor-amounts of hydrous {{components}} commonly occur in minerals whose chemical formula would be normally written without any hydrogen, namely, the nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs). When the concentrations of the hydrous components are several tenths of a percent by weight or higher, a variety of analytical methods such as weight loss on heating, X-ray cell parameters, X-ray structure refinement, <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titrations,</b> or even careful electron microprobe analyses {{can be used to}} establish their concentrations (e. g., Aines and Rossman 1991). However, for most NAMs, accurate determinations with these common analytical methods prove difficult if not impossible. For this reason, infrared (IR) spectroscopy has become, and remains, the most widely used method to detect and analyze hydrous components (OH or H_ 2 O) in minerals and glasses because it is both highly sensitive and can be done rapidly with a commonly available, modestly priced instrument and at dimensions of just a few tens of micrometers. A change in the electric dipole occurs when the OH bond in either water and hydroxyl ions vibrate. This motion has a resonance coupling with electromagnetic radiation generally in the 3500 cm^(- 1) region of the infrared spectrum. In addition, bending motions of the water molecule, and overtones and combination of these motions produce absorption in the infrared...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Partitioning of {{trivalent}} actinides (in particular, americium and curium) {{from the}} fission produced light lanthanides {{is a major}} concern of used nuclear fuel reprocessing for the purposes of waste disposal. Several solvent extraction processes have been developed to address these chemically difficult separations. The historically employed TALSPEAK Process utilizes di- 2 -ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (HDEHP), a cation exchange extractant as an organic phase extractant, while the Advanced TALSPEAK Process utilizes 2 - ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono- 2 -ethylhexyl ester (HEH[EHP]), its phosphonic acid analog as an organic extractant to alleviate processing problems. The newly developed mixed extractant ALSEP Process utilizes either HDEHP or HEH[EHP] in conjunction with either tetraoctyldiglycolamide (TODGA) or tetra- 2 -ethylhexyldiglycolamide (T 2 EHDGA), collectively DGA, to perform two separation steps in a single process. The nature of organic phase chemical interactions in these systems must be clarified in order to effectively model and operate them on an engineering scale. Neodymium speciation in HDEHP organic phases, the organic extractant used in the TALSPEAK Process, have been subject to multiple interpretations necessitating further investigations. UV-Visible spectroscopy coupled with <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titrations</b> reveal that water in the inner neodymium coordination sphere results in an increase in the metal coordination number. Furthermore, the extraction of water was found to be independent of metal concentration, but was dependent on the HDEHP concentration. Investigating across the lanthanides revealed that light f-elements (americium, praseodymium, and neodymium) can contain inner-coordination sphere water, while heavier lanthanides (samarium, holmium, and erbium) cannot, presumably due to their smaller ionic radii. For HEH[EHP] organic phases, the Advanced TALSPEAK extractant, water extraction was found to be similarly independent of metal concentration and dependent on HEH[EHP] concentration, although a weaker water extractant. Compared the HDEHP, only the lightest lanthanide measured (praseodymium) revealed a change in UV-Vis spectra resembling a speciation change, suggesting that only the lightest of lanthanides can occupy water in the inner-metal coordination sphere. Characterization of the organic phase of the ALSEP Process is necessary to advise scaling efforts and to identify any potential difficulties which may exist due to inter-ligand interactions. The ALSEP ligand combinations tested were HDEHP - T 2 EHDGA, HEH[EHP] - TODGA, and HEH[EHP] - T 2 EHDGA. IR spectroscopy shows that the ability of the ALSEP ligand combinations to form intermolecular adducts in metal-free organic phases are relatively similar, although approximately an order of magnitude lower for the HDEHP - CMPO combination proposed for the previously developed TRUSPEAK system. Metal loaded IR spectroscopy shows that, when trivalent lanthanides are extracted from an aqueous phase which should not allow for the formation of neutral DGA solvates, the nature of the DGA carbonyl bond is shifted for the HDEHP - T 2 EHDGA system and the HEH[EHP] - TODGA system, but not for the HEH[EHP] - T 2 EHDGA system. Job’s Method further reveals that, for the ligand combinations which are measured to form ternary species, a 1 : 6 : 1 ratio of the cation exchange extractant to the DGA forms with metals in the organic phase. UV-Vis titrations further reveal that HDEHP - T 2 EHDGA forms ternary species the strongest with extracted metals, followed by HEHEHP] - TODGA and HEH[EHP] - T 2 EHDGA. Furthermore, americium forms ternary species the strongest with ALSEP ligand combinations, followed by neodymium and holmium. Finally, the dependence of organic phase nitrate on the complexation of metals in the ALSEP process was investigated for advising process operations. IR spectroscopy revealed that titration of an organic phase containing a DGA loaded with nitric acid shifts the metal coordination from the cation exchange ligand to the DGA similar to extraction of metal from a high concentration nitric acid aqueous phase. UV-Vis titration addition of nitrate to a metal loaded organic phase reveals that, in general, TODGA is more able to accommodate metal-nitrate complexes than T 2 EHDGA and the neodymium more strongly complexes with DGAs in the presence of nitrate than holmium. Also seen is that holmium exists in a complicated coordination environment at higher organic phase nitrate concentration, potentially indicating some process issues...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} has been studied the {{influence}} of the milling process of two ceramic frits used in the ceramic tile industry. Both glass frits were of similar chemical composition changing SiO 2 by 5 % of B 2 O 3 and both of them were water or dry milled. Glass frit surfaces were characterized by FT-IR, <b>Karl-Fischer</b> (K-F) <b>titration</b> and Inverse Gas Chromatography at Infinite Dilution (IGC-ID). By K-F titration it was observed that water milled frits presented 28 and 26 OH groups for 100 A 2 if they do not contain or contain boron, respectively. These surface changes are also observed by IGC-ID. Thus, the glass frit without boron and dry milled presented the highest dispersive surface energy (44 mJ. m - 2) and the less acidic constant (0. 13 kJ. mol - 1). Both glass frits are amphoteric with acidic and base surface active sites, and that frit without boron presents the higher basicity. Milling process influences in the acid-base surface characteristics of both frits by increasing the basicity for the one without boron and increasing for the other one. This has been assigned to the different location of hydroxyl groups where the higher interaction is the one that does not contain boron and dry milled as K-F results.

Mediante valoración se han determinado los contenidos en moléculas de agua e hidroxilos. El mayor contenido en hidroxilos lo posee la frita sin boro seguida de la de boro ambas molidas en húmedo, poseyendo 28 y 26 grupos OH por cada 100 A 2, respectivamente.

40|$|Bio-oil from biomass through {{thermochemical}} conversion is not readily usable as fuel {{because of its}} extremely high oxygen content and relatively poor storage stability. Thus, fast pyrolysis to upgrade the quality of biomass is possible by means of thermochemical pathway through which pyrolysis oil is upgraded via hydroprocessing to motor-vehicle grade oil product. The catalytic treament of biomass under hydrogen pressure (i. e., hydropyrolysis) is an attractive route to obtainin high yield of liquid hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). The effect of catalyst is to convert oxygen in bio-oil to H 2 O, CO, and CO 2. The decrease in oxygen content contributes to a remarkable increase in the heating value of bio-oil. We have proposed in our research the utilization of nickel-loaded brown coal (Ni/LY) char as an alternative catalyst for upgrading the quality of bio-oil product. The Ni/LY char was prepared according to the ion-exchange method as it is inexpesive and {{there are reports that}} the metallic Ni disperses well on the support in Ni/LY char with large specific surface area. Loy Yang brown coal was used in the preparation of the catalyst because it contains carboxyl and phenol groups which can exchange ions with metals. In this study the effects of catalysts (Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/LY char, Dolomite, and CoMo/Al 2 O 3) on product yield and composition of bio-oil were investigated. Then the catalytic behavior of Ni/LY char was examined and employed to obtain the bio-oil with relatively low oxygen content that can be used as liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. In chapter 2, pyrolysis of rice husk was carried out in fluidized bed reactor. The effect of different catalysts (i. e., Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/LY char, Dolomite and CoMo/Al 2 O 3) was investigated. The results showed that a low molecular weight and low oxygen content of bio-oil are obtained with pyrolysis using catalyst. Catalysts supported the deoxygenation reaction by convert the oxygenated compounds of bio-oil to form H 2 O, CO 2 and CO. Best results are obtained with Ni/LY char and CoMo/Al 2 O 3 which can reduce the oxygen content of bio-oil from 33. 8 % without catalyst to 27. 6 and 24. 9 % with Ni/LY char and CoMo/Al 2 O 3, respectively. The decreasing of the oxygen content of bio-oil contributes to a remarkable increase in HHV. However, Ni/LY char is deemed more favorable than CoMo/Al 2 O 3 in term of the production cost of bio-oil. In chapter 3, hydropyrolysis of rice husk without catalyst was performed in a fluidized bed reactor. The effects of parameter conditions (i. e., hydrogen pressure, temperature, gas residence time (GRT), and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)) on product yields were studied to determine the optimal condition for bio-oil yield. The hydropyrolysis under 0. 1 MPa hydrogen gas produced bio-oil with relatively low oxygen content. The optimal hydropyrolysis temperature for the production of bio-oil from rice husk was found to be 500 °C and GRT of 2. 7 s. The high GHSV of 4891 h- 1 was found to be more favorable for the production of bio-oil due to the reduced residence time of vapors in bed material, maximizing the bio-oil yield at about 47. 1 wt. %. In chapter 4, hydropyrolysis of biomass materials (i. e., rice husk, coconut shell, and pine) was conducted in a fluidized bed reactor to evaluate bio-oil production. The hydropyrolysis was performed at 500 °C, GRT of 2. 7 s and GHSV of 4891 h- 1. The bio-oil yields from rice husk, pine, and coconut shell were 47. 1, 64. 5, and 52. 1 wt. %, respectively. The bio-oils were analyzed with an elemental analyzer, <b>Karl-Fischer</b> moisture <b>titration,</b> Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that the bio-oils from all biomass have high oxygen content and oxygenated compounds such as phenols. The HHVs of bio-oils from pine and coconut shell are higher than that of rice husk due to their high carbon content, while rice husk has the lowest HHV, which can be ascribed to its low carbon content and high oxygen content. It is advisable that the bio-oil products be further processed to remove the condensed water and oxygen content for chemical and/or biofuel production. In chapter 5, hydropyrolysis of rice husk was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The effects of different catalysts, on the carbon conversion of rice husk and composition of bio-oils were studied. The experiments with catalysts under hydrogen atmosphere to produce bio-oils with much lower oxygen content were performed. The results show that the oxygen content of bio-oils is markedly reduced because the oxygenated hydrocarbons are hydrocracked resulting in the formation of H 2 O, CO and CO 2 when catalysts are introduced. The oxygen content of bio-oil under hydrogen atmosphere decreased from over 31. 1 % without catalyst to 25. 9 %, 20. 5 %, 26. 5 % and 10. 1 % with Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/LY char, Dolomite and CoMo/Al 2 O 3, respectively. The use of CoMo/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/LY char under hydrogen atmosphere showed high activity to decrease the oxygen content, which leaded to a higher heating value and more aromatic hydrocarbons. These experiments indicated that catalytic hydropyrolysis is suitable for producing bio-oils with lower molecular weight and high aromatic hydrocarbons which are possible to use as a potential liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. In chapter 6, catalytic hydropyrolysis of rice husk using Ni/LY char was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor {{in order to determine the}} bio-oil with the lowest oxygen content and investigate the effects of an inexpensive Ni/LY char activity, catalytic hydropyrolysis temperature, and volume fraction of Ni/LY char on product yield and composition of bio-oils. These conditions were tested at the optimal condition (i. e., temperature of 500 °C, GRT of 2. 7 s and GHSV of 4891 h- 1). In the presence of Ni/LY char the oxygen content of bio-oil decreased by about 16 % compared with that of non-catalyst. Raising the temperature from 500 to 650 ºC reduced the oxygen content of bio-oil from 27. 5 % to 21. 5 %. The characteristics of bio-oil were analyzed by Karl Fischer, GC/MS, GPC, FT-IR, and CHN elemental analysis. The result indicated that hydropyrolysis of rice husk using Ni/LY char at temperature of 650 ºC produced bio-oil with relatively lower oxygen content, oxygenated compounds, high aromatic hydrocarbons, and high heating value. For the effect of volume fraction of Ni/LY char, which was investigated at the optimal condition for bio-oil yield, it was found that the oxygen content of bio-oils decreased, whereas the higher heating value of bio-oils increased when increasing the volume fraction of Ni/LY char. The bio-oil with the lowest oxygen content (20. 7 wt. %) and the highest heating value (30 MJ/kg) was obtained with 75 % volume fraction of the Ni/LY char. The catalytic hydropyrolysis oil contained more aromatic hydrocarbons with slightly reduced oxygenated compounds than that from the non-catalytic hydropyrolysis oil. High quantities of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained from hydropyrolysis with volume fraction of Ni/LY char > 50 %. The results indicated that the bio-oils from the hydropyrolysis, using high volume fraction of Ni/LY char (75 v/v%) at high catalytic hydropyrolysis temperature of 650 °C, contained more aromatic hydrocarbons with slightly reduced oxygenated compounds and could be used as liquid fuel and chemical feedstock. 学位記番号：工博甲 442, 学位の種類：博士（工学...|$|R

The nature of the proton conductivity in phosphoric acid and {{the interaction between the}} polymer matrix and phosphoric acid were investigated recently by MD simulations [1]. Experimental conductivity data are available extensively for temperatures up to 100 °C and different water contents, while it gets scares for higher temperatures [2, 3].

Well established time-based maintenance by ex-perienced maintenance staff as well as conservative replacement planning are being sacrificed now. Condi-tion based maintenance by hired staff and online moni-toring as an early warning system are gaining impor-tance in insulation ageing assessment of power trans-formers in service. Insulation ageing is a four dimensi-onal problem due to dielectric, chemical, thermal and electromechanic stresses, which are highly depending on operational conditions. All these ageing processes lead {{to the formation of}} water molecules. Therefore, water plays a key role for the ageing of oil paper insula-tion systems since water acts as a catalyst for the ageing process. Due to the complex nature of moisture migration a multitude of different analytical diagnostic procedures is required [1]. To date ageing and moisture can only be reliably detected by paper sample shaving at critical locations (leads, outer winding) and analysing these samples in the laboratory by <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> and determination of degree of polymerisation. This paper presents the Polarisation and Depolarisation Current analysis (PDC analysis) as an excellent and non-destructive method for determination of the moisture content in the solid insulation material of power trans-formers. On the basis of this reliable information one can decide about further actions like on-site drying of the active part of a power transformer...|$|E
40|$|Smart optical {{composite}} materials suitable for ratiometric sensing applications and harvesting options have been developed. The hybrid materials consist of core/shell particles with Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 {{as the core}} and different luminescent lanthanide-containing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as the shell. The magnetic properties enable collection of microparticles via an external magnetic field and, thus, a strong signal augmentation of the luminescence signal. Thereby, MOF luminescence functions as a read-out signal of the sensing that can be influenced by different chemical compounds, e. g. by quenching with low concentrations of water. The combination of MOFs, which contain different luminescence centers combined with a different sensitivity towards water, results {{in a system that}} can be exploited as a ratiometric sensor. We have utilized the MOFs 3 ∞[Eu 2 (BDC) 3]· 2 H 2 O· 2 DMF (BDC 2 − = benzene dicarboxylate) and 2 ∞[Ln 2 Cl 6 (bipy) 3]· 2 bipy (Ln = Eu, Tb; bipy = 4, 4 ′-bipyridine) for functionalization of the microparticles, resulting in a color-tuned yellow-emitting mixed-MOF composite system together with a Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 core. Interaction with water decreases the luminescence unequally for both luminescence centers, which enables a quantitative determination of the water content by analysis of the ratio of the Tb 3 + and Eu 3 + luminescence bands. This process is supported by possible harvesting via superparamagnetism of the composite. Altogether, high sensitivity with a detection limit of 0. 3 % (20 μg) is achieved, equal to <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> but also suitable for an “on-the-fly” analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{authoritative}} case of Vulcanian eruptive dynamics is {{the series}} of 88 explosions that occurred between August and October 1997 at Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat Island. The state of the magmatic column just before a Vulcanian explosion is still poorly understood, but conditions the eruptive style. This study establishes such a pre-explosive stratigraphy by 1) documenting the textures covering {{the range of the}} 1997 products, 2) quantitative analysis of H 2 O content in interstitial glass measured by <b>Karl–Fischer</b> <b>Titration,</b> and 3) combining these data with a simple model linking pre- and post-explosive vesicularities. The model shows that syn-explosive degassing affects greatly the way porosity evolves by decompression during an explosion. The stratigraphy reconstruction shows a three-part vertical layering of the conduit prior to explosion with overall denser values than those previously suggested. A dense and strongly degassed plug caps the column. It is underlain by a shallow transition zone featuring complex mingling between vesicular and dense magma up to 10 MPa. At higher pressure, up to 80 MPa, lies a more homogeneous zone of relatively dense (10 – 20 vol. %) magma, which was emplaced under partly open-system degassing. This conduit stratigraphy gives the vision of a strongly heterogeneous magma column immediately prior to its disruption. Our analysis suggests that fragmenting such a composite magma cannot happen in a single coherent pulse, but rather as stages. The transition zone contains heterogeneous amounts of exsolved gas that could explain the pulsatory nature of the Vulcanian jets {{at the beginning of the}} explosions. This contrasts with the nearly constant vesicularities of the deeper part of the pre-explosive magma column, which are propitious to a general, short-lived disruption...|$|E

Understanding the mechanism of the conduction of mineral oil will benefit the research of oil condition which is important for reliable operation of power transformers. This paper presents findings from frequency domain dielectric spectroscopy method on new transformer oil supplied by Shell. As the moisture has {{a significant impact on}} dielectric properties of oil, <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> method has been used to measure the water content in the oil before dielectric spectroscopy tests. It is generally accepted that the main charge carriers in the oil are ions and these ions start to move {{under the influence of the}} applied electric field. The movement is also affected by the resistance force from the viscosity. Electrode effect caused by the accumulation of ions in the oil near to the electrode, which would give rise to the real part of permittivity strongly up to very high values while lower the real part of conductivity at very low frequency, has been revealed in the test results. In this paper, the dielectric response of the new oil has been measured using dielectric spectroscopy technique and it has been found that the conductivity of the oil calculated from dielectric response in the low frequency range (100 Hz~ 0. 001 Hz) comprises three stages: two steady states joined by a transient process. Both the distance between two electrodes of the testing cell and temperature of oil influence the start frequency of the transient process.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of the monomethyl sulfite ion by iodine and triiodide (which is {{the basic}} reaction in a <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration)</b> has been investigated with a po-tentiometric technique [1] and with the rotating ring<lisk electrode [2] in Parts I and II, respectively. Both methods demand a rather high iodide concen-tration. In the potentiometric method, {{the potential of the}} indicator electrode must be only a function of the triiodide concentration and therefore the iodide concentration must remain constant. In the ring-disk electrode method, the current hrough the disk electrode must only be controlled by the galvanostat and may not be limited by diffusion phenomena. No such demand exists for the measurement of limiting currents at a rotating disk electrode; on the contrary, it is necessary to have a small iodide concentra-tion.

Pyrolysis, a thermochemical conversion process under oxygen-absent condition is an attractive way to convert biomass into bio- oil. In this study, the pyrolysis experiments were carried out ina fixed-bedreactor at a range of temperature of 400 - 600 °C, heating rate range between 10 - 50 °C/min, and a range of nitrogen flow between 2 - 4 litre/min. The aims of this work were to explore the effects of pyrolysis conditions and to identify the optimum condition for obtaining the highest bio-oil yield. The effect of nitrogen flow rate and heating rate on the yield of bio-oil were insignificant. The most important parameter in the bio-oil production was the temperature of the pyrolysis process. The yield of bio-oil initially increased with temperature (up to 550 °C) then further increase of temperature resulting in the decreased of bio-oil yield. Results showed that the highest bio-oil yield (52. 6 %) wasobtainedat 550 °C with nitrogen flow rate of 4 L/min and heating rate of 50 °C/min.

40|$|The {{compositional}} {{dependence of}} H 2 O solubility was investigated at 2 kbar and 800 °C in haplogranite melts (system SiO 2 [...] - 1 bNaAlSi 3 O 8 [...] - 1 bKAlSi 3 O 8 or Qz [...] - 1 bAb [...] - 1 bOr). The sixteen investigated compositions contained 25, 35 or 45 wt. % normative Qz and various Ab/(Ab+Or) ratios (0. 15 – 0. 92). Starting solid materials were anhydrous bubble-free glasses to which 10 wt. % H 2 O was added. The H 2 O {{contents of the}} isobarically quenched melts (glasses) were measured by <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration.</b> The results show that H 2 O solubility in aluminosilicate melts depends significantly upon anhydrous composition. The highest solubility values are obtained for the most Ab-rich melts. At a constant normative quartz content, the solubility of water decreases from 6. 49 ± 0. 20 wt. % H 2 O for a composition Qz 35 Ab 60 Or 05 (normative composition expressed in wt. %) to 5. 50 ± 0. 15 wt. % H 2 O for a composition Qz 35 Ab 10 Or 55. Along this join, the most significant changes are observed for Ab-rich melts whereas H 2 O solubility in Or-rich melts remains almost constant. The H 2 O solubility data imply that H 2 O is preferentially associated with the Ab component in aluminosilicate melts. Application of the results to natural granitic melts suggests that Na-rich, H 2 O-saturated melts may be significantly less viscous than H 2 O-saturated, K-rich melts. The temperature dependence of H 2 O solubility, investigated for composition Qz 28 Ab 38 Or 34 at 2 kbar, is low. Increasing temperature from 750 ° to 1150 °C only causes a decrease in H 2 O solubility from 6. 00 to 5. 41 wt. % H 2 O. These data are in agreement with previous data obtained for albite melts. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn June 2011, an {{eruption}} of rhyolite magma {{began at the}} Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex, southern Chile. By January 2012, explosive activity had declined from sustained pyroclastic (Plinian to sub-Plinian) fountaining to mixed gas and ash jetting punctuated by Vulcanian blasts. This explosive activity was accompanied by synchronous effusion of obsidian lava in a hybrid explosive-effusive eruption. Fortuitous climatic conditions permitted ground-based observation and video recording of transient vent dynamics as well as real-time collection of proximal juvenile ash as it sedimented from the active plume. The main eruptive vent complex and site of lava effusion was represented by two loci of Vulcanian blasts within a single tephra cone containing a pancake-shaped proto-lava dome. These blast loci each consisted of clusters of sub-vents that expressed correlated shifts in eruption intensity, indicating the presence of partially connected and/or branching zones of high permeability within the upper conduit. Pyroclast textures were examined by X-ray computed microtomography and their permeability was modeled by lattice Boltzmann simulations. The porosity (39 to 67 %) and Darcian permeability (3. 1 x 10 - 15 m 2 perpendicular to fabric to 3. 8 x 10 - 11 m 2 parallel to fabric) of fine ash emitted during ash jetting indicates that the permeable zones comprised highly sheared, tube-like bubbly magma, and contrast with the low porosity (~ 17 %) and nul permeability of bombs ejected to hundreds of metres from the vent in Vulcanian blasts. Residual H 2 O content of ash (0. 14 wt %) and two bombs (0. 2 - 0. 25 wt %), determined by <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> indicate degassing of this pyroclastic material to near-atmospheric pressures. Ash textures and simple degassing/vesiculation models indicate the onset of permeability by ductile processes of shear-enhanced bubble coalescence in the upper 1 to 1. 5 km of the conduit. Repeated ash jetting and Vulcanian blasts indicate that such ductile processes were not sufficiently effective to accommodate all degassing requirements, and additional brittle (e. g., fragmentation) events transiently assisted in maintaining an open-system degassing regime that permitted long-lived, hybrid explosive-effusive activity.

Both fully porous and core-shell column types were included. Preferential uptake of water by the columns can be described by Langmuir isotherms. Even though a diffuse rather than a compact adsorbed discrete layer {{of water on the}} adsorbent surface can be formed because of the unlimited miscibility of water with acetonitrile, for convenience, the preferentially adsorbed water was expressed in terms of a hypothetical monomolecular water layer equivalent in the inner pores. The uptake of water strongly depends on the polarity and type of the column. Less than one monomolecular water layer equivalent was adsorbed on moderate polar silica hydride-based stationary phases, Ascentis Express F 5 and Ascentis Express CN column at the saturation capacity, while on more polar stationary phases, several water layer equivalents were up-taken from the mobile phase. The strongest affinity to water was observed on the ZIC cHILIC stationary phases, where more than nine water layer equivalents were adsorbed onto its surface at its saturation capacity. Columns with bonded hydroxyl and diol ligands show stronger water adsorption in comparison to bare silica. Columns based on hydrosilated silica generally show significantly decreased water uptake in comparison to stationary phases bonded on ordinary silica. Significant correlations were found between the water uptake and the separation selectivity for compounds with strong polarity differences.

Its thermal expansivity and compressibility have been measured up to 375  °C and 6. 0  GPa, respectively. Within the uncertainty of the microchemical determination of H 2 O by <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration,</b> it invariably contains 1  mol of H 2 O per mol of KAlSi 3 O 8. Under the SEM, it appears a small idiomorphic prisms. It is optically negative, with no= 1. 553 (1) and ne= 1. 521 (1). FTIR spectrum identifies the water in its structure as molecular H 2 O. Its lattice constants are a= 5. 3348 (1)  Å, c= 7. 7057 (1) Å, V= 189. 924 Å 3, the space group being P 6 /mmm. The 29 Si MAS-NMR suggests a weak short-range order of Al and Si in the symmetrically equivalent tetrahedral sites. A Rietveld structure refinement demonstrates that it is isostructural with cymrite (BaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ·H 2 O), the structure comprising double tetrahedral sheets with H 2 O molecules residing in their cavities, K serving as an interlayer cation. Whereas cymrite, with its ordered tetrahedral Al/Si distribution, shows a Pm symmetry, the weak short-range Al/Si order in K-cymrite (abbreviated below as KCym) makes it crystallize in the space group P 6 /mmm. Three reversal experiments on the reaction K[AlSi 3 O 8]·H 2 O (KCym) =K[AlSi 3 O 8] (Kfs) +H 2 O, executed in this study, confirm the earlier results of Thompson (1994) and supplement her data. A simultaneous treatment of those reversals, together with the thermodynamic data for Kfs and H 2 O available in the literature, helps derive the standard enthalpy of formation (− 4233 ± 9. 4  kJ/mol) and standard entropy (276. 3 ± 10. 2 J/K·mol) for K-cymrite. The computed phase relations of KCym in the KAlSi 3 O 8 -H 2 O binary are shown in Figure 4 for three different values of aH 2 O. Given a 5  °C/km isotherm in a subducting slab of metasediments in a ultra-high-pressure metamorphic environment, KCym will be expected to grow by hydration of Kfs, unless the aH 2 O had been substantially less than 0. 5.

Using IR spectroscopy, the water speciation was determined from the peak intensities (linear absorbance as well as integrated intensity) of the near-infrared (NIR) absorption bands at 4500 and 5200 cm(- 1) assigned to structurally bonded hydroxyl groups and molecular H 2 O, respectively. For LiAlSi 4 O 10 glasses, a new calibration of the linear and integral molar absorption coefficients of the IR absorption bands at 4500 and 5200 cm-' is presented. Using NMR spectroscopy, the water speciation was determined from the static 1 H NMR spectra acquired at temperatures between 170 and 130 K, where the H- 1 NMR signal consists of a well-defined Fake doubler due to rigid water molecules and an overlapping, but narrower, central peak due to structurally bonded OH groups. The distinct nature of these two signals (doublet and Gaussian) enables a reliable deconvolution of the 1 H NMR spectra and quantitative determination of water speciation in the glasses. For a series of hydrous NaAlSi 3 O 8 glasses containing 1. 5 - 10 wt. % water, we found a very good agreement of water speciation determined by NMR and IR spectroscopy (about 4 % standard deviation in OH concentration), demonstrating the reliability of both methods. Total water contents determined with H- 1 NMR spectroscopy are in excellent agreement with results from <b>Karl-Fischer</b> <b>titration</b> (KFT, < 2 % standard deviation). Depending on whether peak heights or peak areas are used {{for the evaluation of}} MR spectra, relatively large deviations in water speciation (12 - 24 % in OH content) are observed for KAlSi 3 O 8, LiAlSi 3 O 8 and LiAlSi 4 O 10 glasses. Static H- 1 NMR spectroscopy on KAlSi 3 O 8 and LiAlSi 4 O 10 glasses containing 2. 80 - 4. 25 wt. % water tends to support the use of peak areas instead of peak heights for calculation of water speciation from NIR spectra. However, {{in the case of the}} LiAlSi 3 O 8 glass (4. 04 wt. % water), no clear conclusion can be drawn from the NMR data and other effects such as the choice of the baseline for the NIR peaks or water-dependent molar absorption coefficients may have to be taken into account. In order to resolve these questions, more systematic NMR and IR spectroscopic studies on glass series covering a large range of water concentrations are required. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
