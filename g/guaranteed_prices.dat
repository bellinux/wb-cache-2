25|$|In theory, Iranian {{agricultural}} policy {{is intended to}} support farmers and encourage the production of strategically important crops. The policy is twofold: first, to purchase certain crops at <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> and second, to encourage the production of specific crops through farm subsidies. The policy of purchasing agricultural crops from farmers at <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> {{was put in place}} in the 1989 crop year. On average, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> increased at the rate of inflation over the past 15 years. Individual subsidy levels for major crops, however, vary annually.|$|E
25|$|This {{prosperity}} continued up to 1955 {{at which}} point Britain stopped giving New Zealand <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> for its exports. From then on, what New Zealand received was dictated by the free market. As a result, during the 1950s and 1960s the country's standard of living began to slip as the export sector was {{no longer able to}} pay for the level of imported goods required to meet the country's growing consumerism.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-20th century, pastoral-farming {{products}} made {{up more than}} 90% of New Zealand's exports, 65% of which was going to Britain in the 1950s. Having a secure market with <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> also enabled New Zealand to impose high tariffs on imported goods from other countries. Tough import controls gave local manufacturers the ability to produce similar products locally, broaden the base of jobs available in New Zealand and still compete against higher priced imports.|$|E

25|$|The policy's price {{controls}} and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were intervention stores of products bought {{up by the}} Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold {{on the world market}} at prices considerably below Community <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices,</b> or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world. Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{government}} reduced its total spending, it managed {{to support a}} new public works program to provide temporary employment and to direct more resources to rural producers as intended in its program for structural change. Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased agricultural credit, financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed agricultural prices from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices {{of goods and services}} not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control. Wholesale prices in manufacturing increased 26 percent, but those for agricultural products increased 142 percent.|$|E
500|$|The War had a {{profound}} influence upon rural areas, as the U-boat blockade required the government to take full control of the food chain, as well as agricultural labour. Cereal production was a high priority, and the Corn Production Act 1917 <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices,</b> regulated wage rates, and required farmers to meet efficiency standards. [...] The government campaigned heavily for turning marginal land into cropland. [...] The Women's Land Army brought in 23,000 young women from the towns and cities to milk cows, pick fruit and otherwise replace the men who joined the services. More extensive use of tractors and machinery also replaced farm labourers. However, there was a [...] shortage of both men and horses on the land by late 1915. County War Agricultural Executive Committees reported that the continued removal of men was undercutting food production because of the farmers' belief that operating a farm required a set number of men and horses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{caused by}} his initial press conference had continued. The National Farmers Union had protested and the Minister (Maurice Webb) {{had to give}} an assurance to them that the Ministry would fail {{if it did not}} assist food producers. However, Evans was to cause further problems at a press conference in Manchester on 14 April. He asserted that farmers were provided with <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> and assured markets at taxpayers' expense, and asked how long it could continue. Evans then went on to claim that subsidies concealed inefficiency and inertia, and commented that [...] "no other nation feather-beds its agriculture like Britain".|$|E
2500|$|The Agriculture Act 1947 broadly revamped {{agricultural}} law. [...] It was {{a reaction}} to the privations of the Second World War, and was aimed at food security, so as {{to reduce the risk of}} a hostile foreign power being able to starve the UK into submission. [...] The Act <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices,</b> markets and tenure, so that a farmer could be assured that his land would not be taken away and whatever he grew would be sold at a known price. [...] Yet another consolidating Agricultural Holdings Act followed it in 1948. [...] These Acts made it harder to evict tenant farmers. [...] With the new security tenants enjoyed, a system of rent reviews was necessary to take account of land price inflation. [...] There were many other changes in the law, and each of these Acts needed negotiations between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers Union (NFU) to fix the support price to be paid for each agricultural product. [...] They were enacted in a series of Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts in 1949, 1954, 1963, 1968 and 1972.|$|E

50|$|The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Act 1919 {{abolished}} the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries {{and created the}} Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, which took on {{the powers of the}} Board and the remaining functions of the Food Production Department established during the war. In 1919, prices of farm produce had risen by 25% compared to prices {{at the end of the}} war. The Agricultural Act 1920 set out <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> for wheat and oats based on the 1919 averages, to be reviewed annually. However, in the early 1920s, prices fell drastically, the Act was repealed, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> were replaced by lump sum payments and the Agricultural Wages Board abolished, as part of the Government's deflationary policies. By 1922, virtually all of war-time controls had gone. The area under cultivation in Britain fell from 12 million acres (49,000 kmÂ²) in 1918 to 9 million acres (36,000 kmÂ²) in 1926. Farm prices continued to decline and then fell by 34% in the three years after 1929.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{need for}} {{electricity}} {{and lack of}} enough governmental resources {{for the development of}} related infrastructures forced the Iranian Government to invite private investors and to sign Energy Conversion Agreement (ECA) in the form of build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-operate-own (BOO) contracts with them. Accordingly, electricity purchase would be based on a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price.</b> Changes in some laws in 2007 caused the management of the ECAs and electricity purchase based on <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price</b> to face challenges. Shortening the commercial operation period of the earlier ECAs and signing some new short-term ECAs were the steps taken by the authorities to resolve the problems. By shortening the ECAs' commercial operation period, it is likely to cause serious problems concerning the payments of the project companies, because of shortages in the government's financial resources. The findings of the present viewpoint suggest signing of new long-term contracts (20 years long) {{in the form of a}} combinational agreement for buying the produced electricity with a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price</b> (in the first 5 years) and supplying it in the competitive power market (for the following years) would be a better way to reduce the problems. ...|$|R

40|$|For the ten crop seasons 1979 - 80 to 1988 - 89, {{returns to}} {{producers}} in the Australian wheat industry were underwritten by a government-guaranteed price floor. Similar schemes operate in other rural industries (dairy, apples and pears, dried fruits). Although the underwriting provisions have only been triggered once (in the 1986 - 87 season), the provision of this scheme has acted {{to reduce the risk}} normally associated with returns to producers of wheat in all years of its operation. This reduction in risk has been granted free-of-charge by the Commonwealth Government. The <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price</b> {{can be viewed as a}} put option taken out by the Government on behalf of growers - it gives growers the option to sell to the Australian Wheat Board at this floor price.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the issue costs and initial pricing of bonds {{in the international}} market. In particular, we investigate the determinants of three components of issue costs: underwriter fee, underwriter spread (the difference between the offering <b>price</b> and the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price</b> to the issuer), and underpricing (the difference between the market price and the offering price). Total underwriter compensation increases with the bondsâ credit risk and maturity, but it is insignificantly related to issue size. Interestingly, underwriters appear to price some issue characteristics directly (by adjusting the fee) and other characteristics indirectly (by setting the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price).</b> The two compensation components (fee and spread) are negatively related to each other. We provide evidence that this trade-off is consistent with income tax considerations, {{as well as with}} two-tier pricing by underwriters. We find no evidence of underpricing.
