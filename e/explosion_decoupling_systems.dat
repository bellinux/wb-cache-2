Since the <b>decoupled</b> control <b>system</b> is considered as several single-input/single-output systems, the input-output characteristic of the <b>decoupled</b> control <b>system</b> is reduced to the single-input/single-output control problem. Therefore we can specify the input-output characteristics of multiple-input/multiple-output systems.

In this paper, we propose a design method for decoupling control method for non-minimum phase systems using full state feedback control and dynamic precompensator.

For such a system, we propose a nonlinear modal decoupling (NMD) approach inversely constructing as many decoupled nonlinear oscillators as the system oscillation modes so that individual decoupled oscillators can easily be analyzed to infer dynamics and stability of the original system. The NMD follows a similar idea to the normal form except that we eliminate inter-modal terms but allow intra-modal terms of desired nonlinearities in <b>decoupled</b> <b>systems,</b> so <b>decoupled</b> <b>systems</b> can flexibly be shaped into desired forms of nonlinear oscillators.
