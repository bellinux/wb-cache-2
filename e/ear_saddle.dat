40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{surgical}} interventions for a patient with relapsing polychondritis who presented with late ocular complications. Observations: A 44 -year-old male was diagnosed to have relapsing polychondritis {{on the basis of}} recurrent acute auricular chondritis, deformity of the <b>ear,</b> <b>saddle</b> nose deformity and painful nasal chondritis, acute ocular inflammation with conjunctivitis, episcleritis and keratouveitis, laryngotracheal chondritis, erythema nodosum in the skin, a history of polyarthritis, and abnormal blood examination findings. The acute ocular and auricular inflammation was resolved with oral corticosteroid treatment. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of the left eye was 60  mmHg as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometer. Gonioscopic observation revealed the presence of peripheral anterior synechiae and plateau iris configuration. Express drainage screw implantation was applied to the left eye, because topical and systemic medicines failed to decrease the IOP. After 12 months, complicated cataract aggravated in the right eye, and phacoemulsification operation was performed with corticosteroids administered during the perioperative period. His corrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 for the right eye, and the IOP remained below 21  mmHg for the left eye. The patient has been healthy, without any recurrence, for 36 months. Conclusions and importance: The present case of relapsing polychondritis is the first to be reported wherein late ocular complications were alleviated by surgical interventions. Routine use of corticosteroids is necessary for successful anti-glaucoma and phacoemulsification operations...|$|E
50|$|During the excavations, {{traces of}} foundations, brick walls, floors, post-holes, fallen roofs and a ring well were discovered. The {{artifacts}} found {{from the site}} included punch-marked coins, copper coins of the Satavahanas and the Kshatrapas; a few terracotta bullae with legends in Greek; coin moulds and seals. About 2000 beads made of terracotta, glass, shell and semi-precious stones were also found. A large number of terracotta, iron, copper and ivory objects were found from the site.The other important items found at site compromised: scores of human and animal figurines; ivory and shell bangles; terracotta <b>ear</b> ornaments; <b>saddle</b> querns with Buddhist symbols and burnt grains which compromised wheat, Jowar, gram, ber and rice.|$|R

5000|$|The Elkhead Mountains are a {{mountain}} range in Colorado. The mountain range {{is considered to}} be low altitude within Colorado as the mountains are under 11000 ft. [...] Located within Routt and Moffat counties, the mountain range is far from metropolitan areas and has few lakes and streams, so it attracts few visitors. The mountain range is a volcanic range and all of the peaks were formed by volcanic action. The mountain range extends approximately 16 mi east to west and 10 mi north to south, and its center is located at , approximately 20 mi northeast of Craig and north of Hayden, Colorado 13 mi south of the Wyoming border. Almost all of the peaks within the Elkhead Mountains are a part of Routt National Forest. Significant peaks are: Bears <b>Ears,</b> Sugar Loaf, <b>Saddle</b> Mountain, Black Mountain, Pilot Knob, and Meaden Peak.|$|R
