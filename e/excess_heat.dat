5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> through their skin.|$|E

In the typical Pd 40 Ni 10 Cu 30 P 20 metallic glass forming liquid, the <b>excess</b> specific <b>heat</b> is independent of temperature. A quantitative description of the <b>excess</b> specific <b>heat</b> is built up.

5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about {{seven percent of}} the volume of Saturn's upper {{atmosphere}} is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
50|$|A {{factor of}} some {{importance}} in solar radiation-reproduction relationships is <b>excess</b> <b>heating</b> {{of the soil}} surface by radiation.

5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms, including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using recirculating <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. Waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining waste is compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of the roof tops. It serves as a pilot installation for the declared middle term target of reducing the oil consumption of the research station significantly, by extending the solar PV plant over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> easier. According to Prothero, {{this would have been}} true for Paraceratherium; he points to robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{the interplay}} of current-induced forces (CIF), Joule heating, and heat transport inside a current-carrying nano-conductor. We find that the CIF, due to the electron-phonon coherence, can control the spatial heat dissipation in the conductor. This yields a significant asymmetric concentration of <b>excess</b> <b>heating</b> (hot-spot) even for a symmetric conductor. When coupled to the electrode phonons, CIF drive different phonon heat flux into the two electrodes.

25|$|For maximum life, {{capacitors}} usually {{need to be}} able {{to handle}} the maximum amount of reversal that a system may experience. An AC circuit experiences 100% voltage reversal, while underdamped DC circuits experience less than 100%. Reversal creates excess electric fields in the dielectric, causes <b>excess</b> <b>heating</b> of both the dielectric and the conductors, and can dramatically shorten the life expectancy of the capacitor. Reversal ratings often affect the design considerations for the capacitor, from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used.|$|R
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

25|$|An <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> {{observation}} {{is based on}} an energy balance. Various sources of energy input and output are continuously measured. Under normal conditions, the energy input can be matched to the energy output to within experimental error. In experiments such as those run by Fleischmann and Pons, an electrolysis cell operating steadily at one temperature transitions to operating at a higher temperature with no increase in applied current. If the higher temperatures were real, and not an experimental artifact, the energy balance would show an unaccounted term. In the Fleischmann and Pons experiments, the rate of inferred <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> generation was in the range of 10–20% of total input, though this could not be reliably replicated by most researchers. Researcher Nathan Lewis discovered that the <b>excess</b> <b>heat</b> in Fleischmann and Pons's original paper was not measured, but estimated from measurements that didn't have any <b>excess</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{centralized}} power plants, {{the supply}} of [...] "waste heat" [...] may exceed the local heat demand. In such cases, {{if it is not}} desirable to reduce the power production, the <b>excess</b> waste <b>heat</b> must be disposed of (e.g. cooling towers or sea cooling) without being used. A way to avoid <b>excess</b> waste <b>heat</b> is to reduce the fuel input to the CHP plant, reducing both the heat and power output to balance the heat demand. In doing this, the power production is limited by the heat demand.|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} for the project is the 320 MVA generator step-up transformer for Jostedal Power Plant. The transformer experiences <b>excess</b> <b>heating</b> in a limited part of the steel tank and lid from eddy current loss caused by the low voltage busbar configuration. This is unfavorable for the gasket and the transformer oil. In the project a test rig has been constructed which features a mild steel plate, being subjected to a magnetic field. The temperature in the plate is recorded and compared versus a numerical model created in Comsol Multiphysics {{and the use of}} the New Thermometric Method. The non-linear magnetic permeability in mild steel has also been investigated. The heat transfer analysis from the numerical model showed an acceptable temperature deviation compared with the actual temperature in the steel plate. The knowledge from this has been used to create numerical model of a selected part of the transformer utilizing symmetry conditions. The Heat Transfer analysis of this coincides well with thermography images of the overheating area. Poor electromagnetic contact between tank and lid may be an important part of the <b>excess</b> <b>heating</b> in the flange. It is recommended to mount braided copper links over the flange to see if this will reduce some of the excess temperature. If this is not adequate, the evaluation of the different measures that could be done to reduce stray loss concluded that mounting an aluminum shield would be the preferable choice. Mounting such a shield would repel the flux from entering the tank steel, and thereby reduce the temperature. However, the shield itself may experience heating, but not to an extent that the steel experience today. </p...|$|R
