5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an <b>emigration</b> <b>office</b> there, Eichmann was {{transferred}} to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for themselves in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E
25|$|In September 1920 Maklakov {{visited the}} Crimea to meet Pyotr Wrangel and other White Russian leaders. This {{was his last}} visit to Russia. Later he assumed control {{of a network of}} offices Russes that {{certified}} marriages and births of Russian émigrés throughout France and performed other work normally undertaken by the consulates. Despite encroaching deafness, Maklakov remained {{at the helm of the}} Russian <b>Emigration</b> <b>Office</b> (eventually subsumed into the structure of Charles de Gaulle's government) until his death at the age of 88. His front-rank reputation and talent for mediation allowed Maklakov (rather than the better known but controversial figures like Kerensky and Miliukov) to manoeuvre between the many warring factions that made up the Russian émigré community and to represent their interests in dealing with the French government. He also wrote several books on the history of social thought and the Russian liberal movement.|$|E
2500|$|Lincoln {{had long}} {{supported}} colonization as a plausible {{solution to the}} problem of slavery, and pursued colonization plans throughout his presidency. In 1862, Congress approved $600,000 to fund Lincoln's plan for colonizing Blacks [...] "in a climate congenial to them", and granted Lincoln broad executive powers to orchestrate colonization. Lincoln immediately created an <b>Emigration</b> <b>Office</b> within the Department of the Interior and instructed the State Department to acquire suitable land. The first major plan considered would have sent employed free Blacks as coal miners in Chiriquí Province, Panama (then part of Gran Colombia). Volunteers were promised 40 acres of land and a job in the mines; Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy, whom Lincoln had appointed to oversee the plan, had also purchased mules, yokes, tools, wagons, seeds, and other supplies to support a potential colony. Pomeroy accepted 500 of the 13,700 people who applied for the job. However, the plan was canceled by the end of the year—due perhaps to Latin American and British opposition, or to a discovery that Chiriquí's coal was of poor quality.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, based on key {{legislation}} in force in Lithuania from 1918 to 1940 and from 1990 to 2009, is to reveal consistent patterns in the position taken by the state with regard to emigration. A comparison of the legal regulation of emigration in both periods reveals the following. In the period from 1918 to 1940, emigration issues in Lithuania were regulated {{at the level of}} national legislation only (the 1922 and 1929 Laws on Emigration); this regulation proved quite one-sided, and mostly concerned issues regarding the regulation of <b>emigration</b> <b>offices.</b> By contrast, in the period from 1990 to 2009 the issue of emigration from Lithuania found its place in both the domestic law of Lithuania (e. g., Art. 32 of the Constitution of Lithuania and the Law on Emigration in effect from 1991 to 2000) and in international and European Union legislation (Art. 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, etc.); this period also included a broader range of emigration-related issues. This study may serve as a basis for further examination of emigration issues in both their empirical and theoretical aspects...|$|R
40|$|Acknowledges {{letter of}} Mar. 17 with copy of Jewish Telegraph Agency report; it is true, had talk with Mr. [Victor Heine] Bernstein, {{correspondent}} of Jewish Telegraph Agency in Berlin {{for last year}} or two; Bernstein has done good work in Vienna and Berlin and has not run amuck with Secret Police; wanted to give him background on negotiations which Intergovernmental had here; difficult to explain in letter realities of Jewish situation in Germany; whole problem bound up with U. S. immigration problem; has been anxious that work of Intergovernmental Committee succeed in order to relieve pressure on U. S. Visa departments and to relieve distress of thousands of innocent people in Germany; was anxious to impress upon Bernstein importance of not starting such a campaign in the American press that Germans, out of revenge, would break off negotiations with the Committee; Bernstein made no notes of what was said, and probably was unaware that he was misquoting; did not say, as Bernstein reported, that Nazis will live up to whatever they promised; said Germans would carry out {{those parts of the}} plan that were to their advantage; Secret Police has set up, in conjunction with the Jewish Community <b>emigration</b> <b>offices</b> which are preparing 180 - 200 people a day for emigration; chief factor in preparation is issue of passports; problem will be number of emigrants foreign countries are prepared to take; if negotiations take too long, Germans may call off deal and handle Jewish problem in their own way...|$|R
50|$|Jacksboro {{was first}} {{settled in the}} 1850s, {{attracted}} by land offers from the Texas <b>Emigration</b> and Land <b>Office.</b> Originally called Mesquiteville, the community grew up {{along the banks of}} Lost Creek and spread out over the pastureland between Lost Creek and the waters of the West Fork of Keechi Creek. It was renamed Jacksboro in 1858 when it became the county seat, in honor of brothers William and Patrick Jack, veterans of the Texas Revolution. Regular postal service began in 1859.|$|R
5000|$|The British signed two further {{treaties}} with Al Khalifa in 1880 and 1892, putting {{the defense and}} foreign relations of Bahrain in the control of Britain and turning Bahrain into a British colonial protectorate. Following an incident in 1904, in which a relative of the ruler attacked Persians and Germans, the ruler agreed to place foreigner affairs in British hands. The term [...] "foreigner" [...] was vague, because Bahrain had no naturalization policy, population census or <b>emigration</b> <b>office.</b> This and the rapidly growing number of foreigners {{as a result of}} the pearl boom created a dual authority system, one led by the British agent and the other by the Al Khalifa ruler (Isa bin Ali).|$|E
50|$|The University of Deseret was {{established}} in 1850, and although it was located in the Salt Lake Valley, just like the schools in Provo, the university struggled with financial problems and was closed from 1853-1868. When the university was reestablished the Second Dusenberry School was converted into the Timpanogos Branch of the university. From 1870 to 1875, Dusenberry was the principal the University of Deseret's Timpanogos Branch (also called Timpanogos University), but {{for much of his}} time in that position {{he was not able to}} be a full-time administrator. In 1871, Dusenberry was sent to New York to help with the <b>emigration</b> <b>office.</b> When he returned home he focused more on civil duties and the practice of law than being in the classroom. After more financial struggles, the Timpanogos Branch was closed in April 1875.|$|E
50|$|After the war {{he joined}} the newly formed {{government}} of the Second Polish Republic. In the years 1921-1923 he directed the <b>Emigration</b> <b>Office.</b> From 1923 he was employed at the Ministry of Finance, and the following year he became {{the director of the}} Currency Department of the Ministry. He took part in the Grabski Monetary Reform of 1924, which ended hyperinflation in interwar Poland and was a co-creator of the (second) Bank of Poland for which he served as vice-president between September 1924 and September 1924. In the years 1925-1927 he helped negotiated several economic agreements between Poland and the United States. He fell out of favor with the sanacja government of Józef Piłsudski and resigned from governmental positions in 1929. In the 1930s he taught at the Warsaw Trade Academy, and consulted for the League of Nations on currency issues.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Bryanstown, County Wexford, Ireland, the son of Richard Goff. In 1809, he married Mary Somaindyke Ryan, the {{daughter}} of John Ryan. That same year, he emigrated to St. John's in Newfoundland to join his father-in-law. There he met John Stewart who hired Goff as his agent for his property in Prince Edward Island and {{he moved to the}} island the following year. Goff also later became agent for George and Alexander Birnie. He found that the role of land agent left him in a position of permanent financial obligation to his employers. He attempted to profit by other activities, such as operating a flour mill and an <b>emigration</b> <b>office,</b> without much success. In 1813, he was named coroner and clerk of the crown by William Townshend, colonial administrator. Goff also was named a justice of the peace and was appointed high sheriff in 1831. He was named to the colony's Council in 1832. He died at Erinvale in Lot 34 after a lengthy illness.|$|E

50|$|Herschel {{attended}} a state primary school {{until he was}} 14, in 1935. He later said that he left school because Jewish pupils were already facing discrimination. He was an intelligent, sensitive youth with few close friends, although he was {{an active member of}} the Jewish youth sports club, Bar-Kochba Hanover. When he left school, his parents decided there was no future for him in Germany, and tried to arrange for him to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine. With financial assistance from Hanover's Jewish community, Herschel was sent to a yeshiva (rabbinical seminary) in Frankfurt, where he studied Hebrew and the Torah: he was, by all accounts, more religious than his parents. After eleven months he left the yeshiva and returned to Hanover, where he applied to emigrate to Palestine. But the local Palestine <b>emigration</b> <b>office</b> told him he was too young, and would have to wait a year. Rather than wait, Herschel and his parents decided that he should go to live with his uncle and aunt, Abraham and Chawa Grynszpan, in Paris. He obtained a Polish passport and a German residence permit, and received permission to leave Germany for Belgium, where another uncle, Wolf Grynszpan, was living. He had no intention of staying in Belgium, however, in September 1936, he entered France illegally. He was unable to enter France legally because he had no financial support, while Jews were not permitted to take money out of Germany.|$|E
