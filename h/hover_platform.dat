5000|$|CCGS Alexander Henry {{served her}} entire coast guard career on the Great Lakes, {{stationed}} on Lake Superior. In 1976, the vessel {{was used for}} an experiment testing the icebreaking capability of a <b>hover</b> <b>platform</b> pushed {{in front of the}} ship. Attached to the ship's bow, the <b>hover</b> <b>platform</b> worked well in certain conditions, but required lots of fuel and made excess noise. The <b>hover</b> <b>platform</b> also became an impediment to the ship should the platform breakdown. The planned deployment to cargo ships was never approved and though the experiment failed, self-propelled hovercraft are now utilised for icebreaking. Alexander Henry retired from service in 1984 after [...] entered service.|$|E

He also had a strength boosting harness that made his axe swings even more powerful and deadly. He was sent to help the Enforcers escape from Spider-Man, which he accomplished by forcing Spider-Man to flee. Harry Osborn alerted Spider-Man to the criminals' meeting place, and the Headsman was forced to flee after the ensuing battle after Spider-Man damaged his power pack. After repairing his pack, Headsman teamed with Lucky Lobo to kill Spider-Man. Believing he had killed Spider-Man, he left the hero buried under a pile of rubble. Facing Spider-Man again, he was assaulted by the Green Goblin, who revealed himself to Headsman as his employer. The Green Goblin destroyed the Headsman's equipment and knocked him out, allowing Spider-Man to turn him over to the police.|$|E
50|$|In the Marvel Adventures {{version of}} Iron Man, AIM, {{through the use}} of dummy companies, {{acquired}} Stark International's <b>hover</b> <b>platform</b> and uni-beam technology in their invasion of Madripoor, a third world country. Gia-Bao Yinsen tried to tell the world about AIM's terrorist attacks on his country. However, his message is dismissed. During Tony Stark's test of his new solar-powered glider, AIM causes Tony to crash on their artificial island. Tony's heart is damaged, and AIM force him to build an EMP weapon to allow A.I.M.'s forces to finish their conquest of Madripoor. In exchange, AIM will repair his heart. Tony learns that Yinsen was also kidnapped, as A.I.M. wanted to prevent him from telling the world about their attacks on his country and to use his intellect to build technology for AIM. Similar to Iron Man's main Marvel Universe origin, Yinsen and Tony both build armor to escape. However, Yinsen destroys the generator powering the island in order to save his homeland. The explosion kills Yinsen, but Tony Stark lives. Tony becomes Iron Man to prevent people like AIM from committing evil against innocents. Here, the Supreme Scientist is a black-haired woman who is extremely brilliant. In addition, the uniforms that AIM uses are basically NBC orange suits. However, the Supreme Scientist wears black clothing in a style similar to Darth Vader.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} vision-based {{estimation}} of the position and orientation of an object using a single camera relative to a novel target that incorporates the use of moir 6 patterns. The objective is to acquire the six degree of freedom estimation that {{is essential for the}} operation of vehicles in close proximity to other craft and landing platforms. A target contains markers to determine relative orientation and locate two sets of orthogonal moir 6 patterns at two different frequencies. A camera is mounted on a small vehicle with the target in the field of view. An algorithm processes the images extracting the attitude and position information of the camera relative to the target utilizing geometry and 4 single-point discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) on the moir 6 patterns.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} to produce short time pulses [6]. Since the Fourier series method for waveform generation overcomes these limitations [15], UWB radar signals are generated using the Fourier series-based waveform paradigm [15]. The present {{article is based}} on the Fourier series signal generation. Here, it is shown that the UWB received signal is an almost periodic signal which can be represented as a Fourier series expansion with time-varying coefficients. Cyclostationary characteristics which appear in this type of waveform can be exploited to determine a blind detector which is based on detecting the presence of cyclostationarity. Cyclostationary detection is examined in [16]. Although cyclostationary features appear in these kind of signals, actually, there is no pure cyclostationarity, especially, when the observations have to be made in large intervals and high resolution, velocity estimation is intended. In this article, in Section 2, we first describe the model of received ultra-short pulse signal scattered from a target, based on Fourier series model for transmitted signal. Then, in Section 3, we will do an analysis on the IPCP detector and demonstrate its inability in velocity detection. Next, we aim to show that the non-stationary received signal can be modeled by a Fourier series with time-varying coefficients. In Section 4, we have used here time-varying orthonormal sequences as the optimal weights, that is an index-limited sequence with maximum energy concentration in a finite sample interval to introduce a linear MMSE estimation for the time-varying coefficients. The aforementioned optimal window is related to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) [17]. In Sections 5 and 6, based on the estimation of the coefficients, we extract range and velocity of targets. We fully describe the analysis of resolution of range and velocity and the error estimation. Because of utilization of time-varying weights in the estimation of range and doppler, which leads to the estimation of non-stationary signals, the novel estimator is robust {{for a wide variety of}} lifelike scenarios including slow-moving or <b>hovering</b> <b>platforms.</b> Since there is no assumption on noise distribution, all analyses are done based on general correlated non-Gaussian noise. Therefore, the noise considered herein accounts for all interferences, clutters, and thermal noise. In Section 7, in simulations, using this signal, we have sketched the range-velocity plot to visualize the results of detection and ROC plot to verify the advantages of our work compared to IPCP. This will be done for both cases of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, as well as colored and white noise.|$|R

40|$|Master of Engineering (Research) This thesis, by {{developing}} a Miniature Aerial Vehicle (MAV) <b>hovering</b> <b>platform,</b> presents a practical solution to allow researchers and students to implement their theoretical methods for guidance and navigation in the real world. The thesis is not concerned {{with the development of}} guidance and navigation algorithms, nor is it concerned with the development of external sensors. There have been some recent advances in guidance and navigation towards developing algorithms and simple sensors for MAVs. The task of developing a platform to test such advancements {{is the subject of this}} thesis. It is considered a difficult and time consuming process due to the complexities of autonomous flight control and the strict size, weight and computational requirements of this type of system. It would be highly beneficial to be able to buy a platform specifically designed for this task that already possesses autonomous hovering capability and the expansion connectivity for interfacing your own custom developed sensors and algorithms. Many biological and computer scientists would jump at the opportunity to maximize their research by real world implementation. The development of such a system is not a trivial task. It requires a great deal of understanding in a broad range of fields including; Aeronautical, Microelectronic, Mechanical, Computer and Embedded Software Engineering in order to create a successful prototype. The challenge of this thesis was to design a research platform to enable easy implementation of external sensors and guidance algorithms, in a real world environment for research and education. The system is designed so it could be used for a broad range of testing experiments. After extensive research in current MAV and avionics design it became obvious in several areas the best available products were not sufficient to meet the needs of the proposed platform. Therefore it was necessary to custom design and build; sensors, a data acquisition system and a servo controller. The latter two products are available for sale by Jimonics (www. jimonics. com). It was then necessary to develop a complete flight control system with integrated sensors, processor and wireless communications network which is called ‘The MicroBrain’. ‘The MicroBrain’ board measures only 45 mm x 35 mm x 11 mm and weighs 11 grams. The coaxial contra-rotating MAV platform design provides a high level of mechanical stability to help minimise the control system complexity. The platform was highly modified from a commercially available remotely controlled helicopter. The system incorporates a novel collision protection system that was designed to also double as a mounting place for external sensors around its perimeter. The platform equipped with ‘The MicroBrain’ is capable of fully autonomous hover. This provides a great base for testing guidance and navigational sensors and algorithms by decoupling the difficult task of platform design and low-level stability control. By developing a platform with these capabilities the researcher can now focus on the guidance and navigation task, as the difficulties in developing a custom platform have been taken care of. This therefore promotes a faster evolution of guidance and navigational control algorithms for MAVs...|$|R
50|$|The third current {{application}} of {{militarisation of space}} can be demonstrated by the emerging military doctrine of network-centric warfare. Network-centric warfare relies heavily {{on the use of}} high speed communications which allows all soldiers and branches of the military to view the battlefield in real-time. Real-time technology improves the situational awareness of all of the military’s assets and commanders in a given theatre. For example, a soldier in the battle zone can access satellite imagery of enemy positions two blocks away, and if necessary e-mail the coordinates to a bomber or weapon <b>platform</b> <b>hovering</b> overhead while the commander, hundreds of miles away, watches as the events unfold on a monitor. This high-speed communication is facilitated by a separate internet created by the military for the military. Communication satellites hold this system together by creating an informational grid over the given theatre of operations. The Department of Defense is currently working to establish a Global Information Grid to connect all military units and branches into a computerised network in order to share information and create a more efficient military.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the use of GNSS location determination for formation flying of multiple Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). These MAVs are the core component {{of a system that}} realizes a chain of airborne communication relays to provide communication services to mobile terminals. This chain of communication relay nodes improves wireless radio communication by utilizing two effects. Firstly, a chain of relay nodes is able to convert an unfavorable non-line-of-sight condition to a line-of-sight condition by positioning its nodes around the obstacle. Secondly, relay nodes reduce free-space losses. The transmission of a radio signal in free-space is subject to a reduction in received signal power proportional to the square of the distance between transmitter and receiver. By placing a communication relay between the original transmitter and receiver, the distance is cut in half, reducing the required transmission power for each transmitter by a factor of four. The reductions in required transmission power can be directly utilized to increase the range and/or data rate of the communication system. The motors required to <b>hover</b> the relay <b>platform</b> also consume power, typically more than the transmission power. But as the transmission power of a single antenna is limited and cannot be increased over a certain level, range and bandwidth are limited. Flying relay nodes increase the necessary total electrical power, but offer the possibility to enhance range and data rate above the limits of a single node. Location determination of all involved network nodes, both airborne and on the ground, is crucial for determining and maintaining the optimal formation as well as network routing information. Due to the known spatial configuration of the nodes, routing is significantly simplified, since the network topology neighborhood relations are known. Routing tables can be initialized and maintained based on the knowledge of the nodes’ spatial configuration. We provide experimental results carried out with up to six nodes. Four of which are autonomous quadrotor MAVs, which are able to hover at a fixed position. One ground terminal acts as a stationary base, another ground terminal is mobile and moves. The optimal formation, given the positions of the ground stations, is automatically determined and maintained by the fleet of quadrotor MAVs. We discuss a suite of necessary further work, including automatic replacement, rearrangement and replenishment of MAVs, as well as covering user terminals at multiple locations and perching of MAVs in order to extend their battery life...|$|R
40|$|The new Olympic Tennis Centre is {{peripherally}} {{located on}} the gently sloping western edge of Forest Park, the vast new landscape that visually terminates the axis of the main Olympic site. The Tennis Centre is ordered by a linear sequence of four giant platforms that step up against the slope from west to east. The sequence of raised podiums allows the forest to permeate incisively from south to north, and to establish promontories to enjoy the panoramic view across Forest Park back to the National Stadium. These heroically scaled platforms organise the 17, 400 capacity venue {{into a series of}} programmatic clusters commencing with the landscaped entry court and 2000 seat number two court, followed by the second platform of intermediate height which accommodates eight match courts. The third and highest platform contains the 10, 000 seat centre court and 4, 000 seat number one court and features recessed landscaped courtyards that provide daylight and ventilation to the facilities below. The fourth platform holds the six practices courts and allows direct access for players' to their facilities. The platform's edges are defined by horizontal bands of concrete that act as deep beams to provide large openings for the varying points of entry to the accommodation below. The venue is clearly organised and memorable as well as having a symbolic and important centre court as the climax of the architectural composition. The Centre Court demonstrates a direct and elegant tectonic solution composed in twelve segments, with a concentric upper seating bowl cantilevering out from the lower bowl that is recessed into the platform. The raking surfaces of the bowl fold into a dramatically cantilevering roof structure that shades two thirds of the seats. At night the raking surfaces are back lit providing an important effect for night games - a giant lantern <b>hovering</b> of the <b>platforms</b> that rise through the forest canopy. The Centre Court Stadium incorporates twelve tapered openings to the upper bowl and roof; a innovative strategy introduced to provide significant improvement to environmental amenity and enjoyment for players and spectators. The openings provide visual relief from the intense focus of the bowl, permit distant views of Forest Park and Olympic Green, and allow for engagement of spectators with those outside. As the major tournaments are often held during the extreme conditions of summers peak, the openings allow the release of heat that collects in the upper bowl and the inducement of a slow cyclonic air flow to increase vertical air movement to assist with the reduction of court level temperatures. Other aspects of the projects sustainability involve its extensive water/sewerage re-cycling systems and utilisation of solar heating. From a rigorous analysis of context, programme and amenity, the Tennis Centre has arisen as an ensemble of components responding specifically to their circumstance. The architecture is not derivative from cultural or metaphoric associations. The formal distinction of the architecture is achieved within the expressive potential of its components articulated with a precise and efficient purpose attuned to the local context both landscape and culture...|$|R
