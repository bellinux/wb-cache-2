40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} year, solar energy has {{acquired}} {{an important role}} in the production of energy, and today it represents a large quota of the energy demand, so as to represent, together with wind power, quite 100 % of it during some days of the year. The quick diffusion of this technology has emphasized the question about which kind of installation could be productive, efficient and environmental friendly. Buildings are a good site for installation, but in many cases historical restrictions or an insufficient area make this kind of plants not a good investment. Ground installation seems to be easier and has fewer problems to solve, except for the intended use that the chosen area could have. Lands that are suitable for cultivation should not be used for the installation of PV. This paper aims to propose the installation of PV plants on closing (or closed) landfills, as a solution for the area for the PV plant thus achieving a beneficial reuse of <b>dismantled</b> areas. Geographic <b>Information</b> System (GIS) has been used for the screening of areas at regional level and then the technical feasibility of a PV-plant has been evaluated in one among the more suitable landfills...|$|R
