While recent studies claim that International Sign <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pidgin, they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language.|$|E
25|$|Similes {{introduced}} {{with the}} word mint ‘as, like’ are to be preceded by a comma. The exception <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ‘more than’ construction that has a mere intensifying function (as opposed to ‘practically’ or ‘almost’). In case of a double conjunction expressing ‘instead of (doing)’, ‘without (doing)’ etc., only the first element should be preceded by a comma – except if the first element closely belongs to the first clause, {{in which case the}} comma is placed between the two conjunctions.|$|E
25|$|Short path {{distillation}} is a distillation {{technique that}} involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure. A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, {{without the need for}} a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost {{on the sides of the}} apparatus. The Kugelrohr <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.|$|E

Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5. Furtado has cited the [...] "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" [...] of the band Eurythmics, particularly their 1983 song [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again", as an influence on [...] "Say It Right" [...] and other tracks on Loose. [...] "I'm not 100 percent sure what [...] about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said.

Yung said about her character: [...] "Jinx wants to fight and she has an objective, and she’s fiery [...] Whoever is in her way is not a problem to her, she’s so focused and she just wants to get straight to the point. And with Snake Eyes, he’s such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he’s become an icon, he’s a role model. He’s Snake Eyes, he’s the coolest, he’s the best, and Jinx wants to compete with him, you know? In the test that they have in the beginning she wants to win and she wants to prove that she wants to be better, or at least as good as him.

60|$|The rattel-waggon, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long waggon {{set with}} benches, carried us in {{four hours of}} travel to the great city of Rotterdam. It was long past dark by then, but the streets pretty brightly lighted and thronged with wild-like, outlandish characters--bearded Hebrews, black men, and the hordes of courtesans, most indecently adorned with finery, and {{stopping}} seamen by their very sleeves; the clash of talk about us made our heads to whirl; and, {{what was the most}} unexpected of all, we appeared to be no more struck with all these foreigners than they with us. I made the best face I could, for the lass's sake and my own credit; but the truth is, I felt like a lost sheep, and my heart beat in my bosom with anxiety. Once or twice I inquired after the harbour or the berth of the ship Rose; but either fell on some who spoke only Hollands, or my own French failed me. Trying a street at a venture, I came upon a lane of lighted houses, the doors and windows thronged with wauf-like painted women; these jostled and mocked upon us as we passed, and I was thankful we had nothing of their language.
