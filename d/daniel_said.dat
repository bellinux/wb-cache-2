5|$|The {{evidence}} against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both {{had been seen}} to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash. <b>Daniel</b> <b>said</b> he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E

Eric R.

Denton Record-Chronicles Mike <b>Daniel</b> <b>said</b> the best tracks of Blackout are [...] "the unwaveringly catchy 'Radar' and the neo-wave curveball of 'Heaven and Earth'". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said some of the songs of Blackout, [...] "really show off the skills of the producers", exemplifying [...] "Gimme More", [...] "Radar", [...] "Break the Ice", [...] "Heaven on Earth" [...] and [...] "Hot as Ice". He also selected it as one of his 'track picks' of the album. Jedd Rosche of The Maneater deemed it as one of the standout tracks of Blackout along with [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby." ...|$|E

Clifton <b>Daniel</b> <b>said,</b> [...] " [...] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, [...] "'It will {{come as a surprise to}} you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl, he began... asps; amazement in the ranks.

Lord, I have said that a natural man may have right notions of the gospel, and yet be without the saving grace thereof, and they make me suffer for that. Lord, I cannot consent that human inventions and doctrines of men should be joined with thy institution as matters of worship, and imposed upon my conscience as such, and they make me suffer for that. Lord, I own the government, pray for my superiors, live quietly among my neighbours, give to all their dues, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, relieve the afflicted, and show myself, by my faith and life, to be a true Christian man, and yet my neighbours will not let me alone. True, I cannot comply with all that some men would have me comply with; no more did Daniel, no more did Paul; and yet <b>Daniel</b> <b>said,</b> that he had to the king done no hurt (Dan 6:22), and Paul said, 'neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended anything at all'" [...] (Acts 25:8).|$|E

Shortland Street producer Jason <b>Daniel</b> <b>said</b> Justine Jones was a popular character, central to both current and upcoming storylines, hence the decision to recast the role, a first for the kiwi soap opera.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{symbols are}} used in {{chapters}} 2 and 7 concerning the first kingdom of both. Speaking to Nebuchadnezzar in chapter 2 <b>Daniel</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You are the king of kings, ... in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts {{of the field and}} the birds in the sky." [...] In Chapter 7 <b>Daniel</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle, ... it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it." [...] The related terms are mankind with human being, beast of the field with lion (king of beasts), and bird with eagle. The lion therefore denotes, according to Smith, the same kingdom as the head of gold of the great image. The parallel is strengthened by another story in the book of Daniel. While bragging about himself, Nebuchadnezzar [...] "lost his mind", he [...] "lived with the wild beasts of the field, a king among beasts, his hair was like feathers of an eagle, his nails were like claws of a bird." [...] After a period of time, [...] "he raised his eyes to heaven and praised the Most High. Immediately his sanity was restored, his advisers and nobles restored him to the throne." [...] Thus Douchan states that the first beast, the lion, corresponds to the first kingdom of the statue, namely Bablylon.|$|E

[...] "I’ll say this, I’ve enjoyed each opportunity, but frequently I was asked later, 'What previous experiences helped most to be an effective governor?,' that sort of thing. People would always expect me to name something from public life, but probably the experience in business, trying to manage for results, trying to get large numbers of people aligned and headed in a common direction, these were probably the most valuable days I spent." ...|$|R
