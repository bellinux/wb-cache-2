Total lipids (TL) ranged from 11 % of dry weight (DW) in winter to 30 % of DW in autumn. 50 % {{of the variation}} in TL could be explained by light and temperature. As the <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> <b>was</b> recorded during autumn indicating an optimal, non-linear, response to light and temperature we hypothesize that enhanced thylakoid stacking under reduced light conditions resulted in more structural lipids, concomitantly with the increase in glycerides due to released photo-oxidative stress. The relative amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) increased during autumn. This suggested a synthesis, either of structural fatty acids as MUFA, or a relative increase of C 16 : 1 incorporated into TAGs and DAGs.

However, under optimal growth conditions, large amounts of algal biomass are produced, but with relatively low <b>lipid</b> <b>contents,</b> while species with <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>contents</b> <b>are</b> typically slow growing.

40|$|Age {{and growth}} were {{determined}} from otoliths for 181 juvenile bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, collected {{using a variety}} of gear in northeast Florida during 2003 and 2005. Three distinct cohorts were identified recruiting to the near shore waters during spring, summer and fall. Growth rates were high regardless of cohort or season. To compare pre- and post-recruitment growth rates, models were fit to individual growth trajectories using change point analysis. Post-estuarine growth rates were generally higher. Growth rates and hatching times were within the range of those obtained in other bluefish studies conducted at higher latitudes. As this is the only area where winter recruitment of bluefish has been observed, coastal Florida habitats may be essential for the bluefish stock and will need to be carefully monitored in future studies. A technique to estimate the lipid content of bluefish was developed using fat stage (subjectively assigned based on mesenteric fat around the stomach), fish length, and fish weight. A highly significant relationship was observed between fat stage and lipid content in a generalized linear model. The visual lipid content technique provides rapid results, is inexpensive and could be easily implemented into current fisheries sampling methods. Total lipids were also extracted from potential bluefish prey species collected during sampling. Prey lipids ranged from 0. 88 % to 19. 52 %.

The effect of genetic background on lipid content and fatty acid composition in common carp was investigated. An approach of using biologically active compound sesamin which might modulate the fish metabolism to synthesize more n- 3 HUFA from ALA was tested. The results showed that lipid content and composition differed strongly among the three parts of common carp fillet. The lowest lipid content was found in dorsal white muscle (0. 95 ± 0. 14 %), medium in red muscle (16. 7 ± 5. 0 %), whereas the highest was found in abdominal wall (30. 2 ± 7. 8 %). Abdominal wall with the <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> <b>was</b> dominated by triacylglycerols whereas the white muscle had the highest contribution of phospholipids.

Here, we show that moderate reliability already allows mutualists to optimize their rewards. The colours of Mediterranean fleshy-fruits indicate lipid rewards (but not other nutrients) to avian seed dispersers on regional and local scales. On the regional scale, fruits with <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> <b>were</b> significantly darker and less chromatic than congeners with lower <b>lipid</b> <b>content.</b> On the local scale, two warbler species (Sylvia atricapilla and Sylvia borin) selected fruit colours that were less chromatic, and thereby maximized their intake of lipids-a critical resource during migration and wintering. Crucially, birds were able to maximize lipid rewards with moderate reliability from visual fruit colours (r 2 1 / 4 0. 44 - 0. 60). We suggest that mutualisms require only that any association between the quality and sensory aspects of signallers is learned through multiple, repeated interactions. Because these conditions are often fulfilled, also in social communication systems, we contend that selection on reliability is less intense than hitherto assumed. This may contribute to explaining the extraordinary diversity of signals, including that of plant reproductive displays. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs), {{a type of}} {{professional}} antigen-presenting cells, are responsible for initiation and maintenance of immune responses. Here we report that a substantial proportion of DCs in tumor-bearing mice and people with cancer have high amounts of triglycerides as compared with DCs from tumor-free mice and healthy individuals. In our studies, lipid accumulation in DCs was caused by increased uptake of extracellular lipids due to upregulation of scavenger receptor A. DCs with <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> <b>were</b> not able to effectively stimulate allogeneic T cells or present tumor-associated antigens. DCs with <b>high</b> and normal <b>lipid</b> levels {{did not differ in}} expression of major histocompatibility complex and co-stimulatory molecules. However, lipid-laden DCs had a reduced capacity to process antigens. Pharmacological normalization of lipid abundance in DCs with an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase restored the functional activity of DCs and substantially enhanced the effects of cancer vaccines. These findings suggest that immune responses in cancer can be improved by manipulating the lipid levels in DCs. 1 R 21 AI 070598 /AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United StatesG 0500677 /Medical Research Council/United KingdomHL 094488 /HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHL 70755 /HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK 24 CA 128953 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesOH 008282 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United StatesR 21 AI 070598 /AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United StatesR 21 AI 070598 - 02 /AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States 2011 - 02 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 20622859 PMC 291748...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in new marine resources {{for the production of}} aquaculture feed, to meet the increasing growth of the aquaculture industry. Marine species from lower trophic levels are a potential resource that could partly cover the increasing need for lipid and protein in aquaculture feed. The mesopelagic layer present a variety of species that is estimated to hold a vast biomass to harvest from, both globally and in the Norwegian Sea and fjords. Marine species at high latitudes are known for a high lipid content, with a potential for high concentrations of essential fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are sought to incorporate into aquaculture feed. The main objective of this present study was to quantify the species composition and assess the biomass distribution and production in the Norwegian Sea and fjords by trawling. The catch were further analysed, and the suitability catch from the mesopelagic layer would provide as a feed component was determined by analysing the total lipid content, and further assess the fatty acid and lipid class composition. Catches from the mesopelagic layer showed high variation in densities of species at different season and location. With jellyfish and mesopelagic fish dominating the hauls conducted in the fjords, while krill and mesopelagic fish were dominating the hauls at sea. The mesopelagic fishes Maurolicus muelleri (Gmelin, 1789) and Benthosema glaciale (Reinhardt, 1837) had the highest lipid content of the analysed species from the mesopelagic layer, with mixed layer samples containing an average of 30. 6 % lipid from dry weight, equivalent to 9. 1 % lipid of wet weight. Placing a mixed catch from the mesopelagic layer between some of the pelagic fish species that are the main source of fishmeal and fish oil today in regards of lipid content. The <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> <b>was</b> found in samples collected in the fjords during spring.

40|$|Abstract Background Lipids {{produced}} from filamentous fungi show great promise for biofuel production, but a major limiting {{factor is the}} high production cost attributed to feedstock. Lignocellulosic biomass is a suitable feedstock for biofuel production due to its abundance and low value. However, very limited study has been performed on lipid production by culturing oleaginous fungi with lignocellulosic materials. Thus, identification of filamentous fungal strains capable of utilizing lignocellulosic hydrolysates for lipid accumulation is critical to improve the process and reduce the production cost. Results The growth performances of eleven filamentous fungi were investigated when cultured on glucose and xylose. Their dry cell weights, <b>lipid</b> <b>contents</b> and fatty acid profiles were determined. Six fungal strains with <b>high</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> selected to culture with the hydrolysate from dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of wheat straw. The results showed that all the selected fungal strains were able to grow on both detoxified liquid hydrolysate (DLH) and non-detoxified liquid hydrolysate (NDLH). The <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> of 39. 4 % was obtained by Mortierella isabellina on NDLH. In addition, NDLH with some precipitate could help M. isabellina form pellets with an average diameter of 0. 11 [*]mm. Conclusion This study demonstrated the possibility of fungal lipid production from lignocellulosic biomass. M. isabellina was the best lipid producer grown on lignocellulosic hydrolysates among the tested filamentous fungi, because it could not only accumulate oils with a high content by directly utilizing NDLH to simplify the fermentation process, but also form proper pellets to benefit the downstream harvesting. Considering the yield and cost, fungal lipids from lignocellulosic biomass are promising alternative sources for biodiesel production. </p...|$|R
