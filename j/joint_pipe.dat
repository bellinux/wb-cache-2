40|$|Abstract: <b>Pipe</b> <b>joints</b> {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} in industrial plants, where dynamic load of vibration is considerably harmful for sealing performance. However, there is a lock of design codes and experimental procedures developed for vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper proposes an experimental setup for testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints,</b> which use metal gaskets, in vibratory conditions. Also, a flexible piezoelectric film sensor is introduced into this test rig for monitoring of stress in pipes. With the proposed test rig, vibration testing of <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> can be conducted, therefore further investigations such as fatigue analysis of the contact surfaces, and computational analysis of metal gaskets and seal devices are readily available. Finally, some experimental results of a gasketed flange joint, which uses a 1. 5 -inch diameter stainless steel gasket, were reported...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} plastic pipe joints {{are widely used}} in the pi ping industry. However, current fiber {{reinforced plastic}} joint standards are based on standards written for their metallic counterparts, and the relevant design codes lack reliable design guidelines. We have developed an innovative fiber reinforced plastic joining technique to address these and other problems that {{have been reported in}} the literature. The proposed joint can be used with filament wound pipes, the most common fiber reinforced plastic pipe manufacturing technique. This joint can be manufactured using current filament winding equipment with minor alterations. This report emphasizes the design concept and the development of the design calculations for the proposed fiber reinforced plastic <b>joint.</b> <b>Pipe</b> joints are susceptible to two failure mechanisms, failure from the standpoint of strength and leakage. The strength design procedure is derived from first principles taking into account the orthotropy of the fiber reinforced plastic material. The leakage analysis follows the guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel code. The analytical design calculations are checked using finite element analysis. The agreement is excellent. We also conducted a detailed finite element analysis of a particular joint, designed using the simplified method, in order to assess the safety of the simple design calculations.

40|$|AbstractAdhesively bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> are {{extensively}} used in pipelines. In {{the present}} work, cohesive zone model (CZM) based analytical solutions are derived for the bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints</b> under torsion. The {{concept of the}} minimum relative interface rotation ϕm is introduced and used as the fundamental variable to express all other parameters, such as external torsion load, distribution of interfacial shear stress, length of elastic zone and softening zone, etc. It is found that when the bond length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is longer than a certain value, further increase in bond length cannot bring any significant increase in torsion load capacity. Given that the bond length of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> is long enough, the torsion load capacity is indeed independent of the shape of cohesive laws and the bond length. Consequently, simplified expressions of the torsion load capacity are derived {{as a function of}} the interface fracture energy, torsion stiffness of the pipe, and the geometric properties of the <b>pipe</b> <b>joints.</b> Depending on the torsion stiffness ratio of the pipe and the coupler, the macroscopic-debonding can initiate at the right end, left end or both ends simultaneously. It is interesting to note that the maximum torsion load capacity is achieved when the torsion stiffness of the pipe and the coupler are identical. Good agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) result validates the accuracy of the current model. Fracture energy based formulas of the torsion load capacity derived in the present work can be directly used in the design of adhesively bonded <b>pipe</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{actively}} {{reduce the}} stress concentration effect in adhesive layers, a novel smart adhesively bonded composite <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system {{was developed by}} integrating piezoelectric layers as sensor/actuator in the connection coupler. In the presently developed smart <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system, the mechanical loading induced structural deformation can be detected and monitored by integrated sensing piezoelectric layers, and then the signal is fed back to the integrated actuating piezoelectric layers to adaptively produce additional forces and moments so as to decrease the maximum peel and shear stresses in the adhesive layer. In order to theoretically predict {{the efficiency of the}} developed smart <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system, an electro-mechanical theoretical analytical model was established to investigate the characteristics of the joint system under end tension load in terms of first-order shear deformation theory. Simultaneously, the state-space method was utilized to deduce the final analytical solutions, including the peel and shear stress distributions in the adhesive layer. Finally, some detailed numerical results were obtained to demonstrate the optimal design method of such smart <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> system and further validate the integrity of this joint system...|$|R
40|$|Sand cores were {{produced}} using Ojolofe silica sand and cassava starch (manihot esculenta crantz) as binder. This {{was with the}} aim of determining their suitability for casting of intricate shapes. To achieve this, various compositions of starch bonded sand cores {{were produced}}. Standard core samples were produced and tested for green and baked compressive strength. The determination of green and baked compressive strengths was carried out on a large number of cores containing 6 – 12 % water and 4 – 12 % cassava starch. Core baking was carried out at temperature between 90 and 200 oC for 60 – 150 minutes. From the results obtained, appropriate baking conditions and optimum core mixtures were established for cassava starch bonded core. The major results in the research showed that good cores can be produced using cassava starch as binder. Optimum core mixture for this purpose was found to be that containing 10 % starch and 10 % water and at appropriate baking temperature and time were 180 oC and 2 hours respectively. The green compressive strength was 290 N/mm 2 and that of baked compressive strength was 4122 N/mm 2. The above properties were found to be adequate for production of strong sand cores using cassava starch as binder for non- ferrous castings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Apparently no {{analytical}} method {{is available to}} analyze the bolt tension in a flanged <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> subjected to flexure {{taking into account the}} actual stress distribution at the joint. Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to flanged <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> connection, so that a definite guideline on determining the bolt tension can be developed. In addition, results are compared with the conventional analysis. To carry out the investigation, a flanged <b>pipe</b> <b>joint</b> subjected to bending has been modeled using finite element method, which also includes contact simulation. In this analysis, shell element has been used for the modeling of pipe and flange. Non-linear spring has been used to model contact surface and bolt.
