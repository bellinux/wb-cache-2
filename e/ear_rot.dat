40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the stability, across well-differentiated environments, of genetic control of maize resistance to Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium verticillioides <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> and mycotoxin contamination, found in genotypes of diverse origin and adapted to different environments. This knowledge will help to design the most appropriate breeding programme to reduce mycotoxin content across a wide range of environments. Although maize genetics involved in resistance to <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> and mycotoxin contamination greatly depended on the environment, additive and dominance effects were the predominant genetic effects in most environments. The stability across environments for resistance to <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> and deoxynivalenol and fumonisin contamination was low, and recommended target areas of breeding programmes for either Fusarium species are different based on the different nature of genetic effect × environment interactions for each species. In general, the classification of inbreds and hybrids according to their resistance levels was similar across environments, suggesting that the same sources of resistance could be suitable for different environments, and breeding for resistance to one species would affect resistance to the other one.

50|$|To conclude, B. maydis can infect the leaf, sheaths, ear husks, ears, cobs, shanks, and stalks. If {{infection}} of the shank occurs early enough the ear may be killed prematurely which causes the ear to drop. SCLB affected kernels will be covered in a felty, black mold, which may cause cob rot. <b>Ear</b> <b>rot</b> is more extensive with Race T on corn of cms-T cytoplasm. Seedlings that become infected may wilt and die within a view weeks of the planting date.|$|E
50|$|F. graminearum is a haploid {{homothallic}} ascomycete. The fruiting bodies, perithecia, develop on the mycelium {{and give}} rise to ascospores, which land on susceptible parts of the host plant to germinate. The fungus causes fusarium head blight on wheat, barley, and other grass species, as well as <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> on corn. The primary inocula are the ascospores, sexual spores which are produced in the perithecia. Spores are forcibly discharged and can germinate within six hours upon landing on the plant surface. The scab disease is monocyclic; after one cycle of infection with ascospores, the fungus produces macroconidia by asexual reproduction. These structures overwinter in the soil or in plant debris {{on the field and}} {{give rise to}} the mycelium in the next season.|$|E
50|$|The Fusarium genus {{as a whole}} {{includes}} {{species that}} cause several crop diseases, including <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> in maize, and head blight in wheat, thus contributing to significant crop yield reduction. Although F. sporotrichioides itself causes only wheat head blight, this disease is a significant concern in the agricultural industry, as crop yield losses due to head blight can be extensive. In Russia for example, head blight has in past years been responsible for 25 to 50% reductions in crop yield. F. sporotrichioides, along with F. poae and F. avenaceum also cause the discolouration of cereals such as oats, and several Fusaria {{have been shown to}} contribute to the rotting of certain fruits and vegetables in suboptimal storage conditions. In the case of F. sporotrichioides, the affected produce includes peas and apples.|$|E
40|$|Corn is {{vulnerable}} to the following infections by plant pathogens throughout the growing season under favorable environmental conditions: seed rots and seedling blights soon after planting, foliar diseases in mid-season, and stalk and <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> {{toward the end of}} the growing season. Many of these diseases are caused by pathogens that survive in crop residue or in the soil. Thus, the risk of increased disease severity is higher when corn follows corn. However, do not forget the disease triangle (below). Weather conditions during the growing season will still significantly impact disease severity...|$|R
30|$|Assessing farmers’ {{perceptions}} of crop production constraints {{has been used}} as a tool for documenting pest status and designing pest management options suitable for a particular community (Smit and Matengo 1995; Obopile et al. 2008). Soleri et al. (2000) emphasized the need for integrating methods from both biological and social sciences to understand farmers’ selection criteria of crop varieties, since objectives of farmers while selecting a particular maize variety, differed from what research scientists had normally assumed. In a similar way, it would be equally important for crop entomologists to integrate farmers’ perspectives of insect pest management in the development of any intervention measure for local use. Bonhof et al. (2001) used farmer participatory rural appraisals for maize farmers at the Kenyan coast to understand the pest status and control strategies for the maize stemborer (Chilo partellus Swinhoe). In central Zambia, Mukanga et al. (2011) solicited farmers’ views on various management practices of maize <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> caused by several fungal pathogens before resistant varieties to <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> could be developed. Lebesa et al. (2012) and Midega et al. (2012) undertook household surveys in western Kenya using questionnaires to determine the pest status of herbivorous blister beetles (Hycleus spp.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) pests. Tounou et al. (2013), similarly used questionnaires to interview farmers to determine geographic distribution and importance of stemborers on maize in southern Togo.|$|R

50|$|Cochliobolus carbonum (anamorph: Helminthosporium carbonum) {{is one of}} {{more than}} 40 species of {{filamentous}} ascomycetes belonging to the genus Cochliobolus (anamorph: Bipolaris/Curvularia). This pathogen has a worldwide distribution, with reports from Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Congo, Denmark, Egypt, India, Kenya, New Zealand, Nigeria, Solomon Islands, and the United States. Cochliobolus carbonum {{is one of the most}} aggressive members of this genus infecting sorghum (Sorghum spp. Poaceae), corn (Zea mays Poaceae) and apple (Malus domestica Rosaceae). As one of the most devastating pathogens of sweet corn, C. carbonum causes Northern leaf spot and <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> disease while the asexual stage causes Helminthosporium corn leaf spot. Cochliobolus carbonum is pathogenic to all organs of the corn plant including root, stalk, ear, kernel, and sheath. However, symptoms of infection show distinct manifestations in different plant parts: whole plant - seedling blight affects the whole plant, leaf discoloration and mycelial growth, black fungal spores and lesions appear on inflorescences and glumes, and grain covered with very dark brown to black mycelium which gives a characteristic charcoal appearance due to the production of conidia.|$|E
5000|$|Fumonisins: Fumonisins {{were first}} {{described}} and characterized in 1988. The most abundantly produced {{member of the}} family is fumonisin B1. They are thought to be synthesized by condensation of the amino acid alanine into an acetate-derived precursor. Fumonisins are produced by a number of Fusarium species, notably Fusarium verticillioides (formerly Fusarium moniliforme = Gibberella fujikuroi), Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium nygamai, as well as Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. These fungi are taxonomically challenging, with a complex and rapidly changing nomenclature which has perplexed many nonmycologists (and some mycologists, too). The major species of economic importance is Fusarium verticillioides, which grows as a corn endophyte in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, often without causing disease symptoms in the plant. However, when weather conditions, insect damage, and the appropriate fungal and plant genotype are present, it can cause seedling blight, stalk rot, and <b>ear</b> <b>rot.</b> Fusarium verticillioides is present in virtually all corn samples. Most strains do not produce the toxin, so the presence of the fungus {{does not necessarily mean that}} fumonisin is also present. Although it is phytotoxic, fumonisin B1 is not required for plant pathogenesis.|$|E
50|$|A. flavus {{is found}} {{globally}} as a saprophyte in soils and causes disease on many important agriculture crops. Common hosts of the pathogen are cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. Specifically, A. flavus infection causes <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> in corn and yellow mold in peanuts either {{before or after}} harvest. Infection can {{be present in the}} field, preharvest, postharvest, during storage, and during transit. It is common for the pathogen to originate while host crops are still in the field; however, symptoms and signs of the pathogen are often unseen. A. flavus has the potential to infect seedlings by sporulation on injured seeds. In grains, the pathogen can invade seed embryos and cause infection, which decreases germination and can lead to infected seeds planted in the field. The pathogen can also discolor embryos, damage seedlings, and kill seedlings, which reduces grade and price of the grains. The incidence of A. flavus infection increases in the presence of insects and any type of stress on the host in the field as a result of damage. Stresses include stalk rot, drought, severe leaf damage, and/or less than ideal storage conditions. Generally, excessive moisture conditions and high temperatures of storage grains and legumes increase the occurrence of A. flavus aflatoxin production. In mammals, the pathogen can cause liver cancer through consumption of contaminated feed or aspergillosis through invasive growth.|$|E
50|$|Fusarium culmorum is a fungal plant {{pathogen}} and the causal agent of seedling blight, foot <b>rot,</b> <b>ear</b> blight, stalk <b>rot,</b> common root rot {{and other diseases}} of cereals, grasses, and {{a wide variety of}} monocots and dicots. In coastal dunegrass (Leymus mollis), F. culmorum is a nonpathogenic symbiont conferring both salt and drought tolerance to the plant.|$|R

Three mycotoxin-producing Fusarium fungi are common in Kentucky corn fields: 1. Fusarium verticillioides (formerly called Fusarium moniliforme).

40|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>rots</b> {{of maize}} caused by Fusarium spp. reduce grain yield and produce mycotoxins, which are harmful to humans and animals. To breed maize cultivars {{resistant}} to Fusarium spp., reliable large-scale phenotyping is essential. Our objectives were to (i) examine {{the precision of}} the ELISA method for determination of important mycotoxins, namely deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins (FUM), (ii) evaluate the potential of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to estimate concentrations of DON and FUM in grain produced in inoculated maize plants, and (iii) compare the efficiency of ELISA, NIRS, and visual rating of disease severity for estimation of mycotoxin concentrations. Insignificant variation was observed between duplicate evaluations of DON and FUM by ELISA, showing the high repeatability of this method. DON and FUM determinations by ELISA were more closely correlated with mycotoxin concentrations predicted through NIRS than with visual rating of disease severity. For the prediction of DON, NIRS had very high magnitude of the coefficients of determination of calibration and cross validation (R 2 = 0. 90 – 0. 88). Thus, NIRS has a promising potential to predict DON concentration in grain samples of inoculated maize genotypes evaluated in resistance breeding programs...|$|R

40|$|Fusarium verticillioides is {{the fungus}} {{commonly}} associated with maize production in temperate regions of the world, producing <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> and contamination of grain by fumonisins. Genetic resistance is the best preventive action against fumonisins contamination, although no commercial maize hybrids are completely resistant at present. Several studies {{of the relationship between}} Fusarium and other species producing <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> suggest that these fungal species interact in similar ways with the host plant. Consequently, host plant resistance to one pathogen could be associated with resistance to another. The aim {{of this study was to}} introduce sources of resistance to Fusarium spp. into maize inbred lines and to evaluate <b>ear</b> <b>rot</b> severity and fumonisin B 1 contamination in advanced breeding lines and hybrids after artificial and natural infection with F. verticillioides. Two inbred lines (Co 430 and Mp 420) with resistance to kernel infection by F. graminearum and A. flavus, respectively, were crossed and backcrossed to susceptible inbred 1203. The BC 1 S 1 progenies were evaluated for plant morphology and silk date and the selected S 1 plants were self-pollinated. The S 2 families were evaluated under artificial and natural infection with F. verticillioides. Selected S 2 progenies were grown ear-to-row until S 5 -derived inbreds were developed. The S 5 lines were evaluated under artificial and natural infection and used as males to produce single crosses.

50|$|Finger millet is {{generally}} seen as not very prone to diseases and pests. Nonetheless, finger millet blast, {{caused by the}} fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (anamorph Pyricularia grisea), can locally cause severe damages, especially when untreated. In Uganda, yield losses up to 80% were reported in bad years. The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves, neck <b>rots</b> and <b>ear</b> <b>rots.</b> These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis, translocation of photosynthetic assimilates and grain filling and therefore reduce yield and grain quality. Finger millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related Eleusine indica, Eleusine africana or Digitaria spp., Setaria spp. and Doctylocterium spp. Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures, chemical treatments {{and the use of}} resistant varieties. Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with non-host crops like legumes, deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields, washing of field tools after use to prevent dissemination of the pathogen to non-infected fields, weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts and avoiding of too high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant. Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides, such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or tricyclazone or seed dressings with fungicides like trycyclozole.|$|R

F. graminearum also causes stalk and <b>ear</b> <b>rots</b> of maize {{and is a}} producer of mycotoxins such as the trichothecenes that contaminate grain and are harmful to humans and livestock (Goswami and Kistler, 2004). The fungus produces two types of spores. Ascospores, the propagules resulting from sexual reproduction, are {{the main source of}} primary infection. These spores are forcibly discharged from mature perithecia and dispersed by wind (Francl et al 1999). Secondary infections are mainly caused by macroconidia which are produced by asexual means on the plant surface. To study the developmental processes of ascospores in this fungus, a procedure for their collection in large quantity under sterile conditions was required. Our protocol was filmed in order to generate the highest level of information for understanding and reproducibility; crucial aspects when full genome gene expression profiles are generated and interpreted. In particular, the variability of ascospore germination and biological activity are dependent on the prior manipulation of the material. The use of video for documenting every step in ascospore production is proposed in order to increase standardization, complying with the increasingly stringent requirements for microarray analysis. The procedure requires only standard laboratory equipment. Steps are shown to prevent contamination and favor time synchronization of ascospores...|$|R
