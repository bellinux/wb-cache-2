5|$|The {{two teams}} first played in 1895 and met six more times through 1923. In those early matches, <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> scored a {{combined}} sixty points to Maryland's three. In 1924, Maryland fielded its first varsity-level lacrosse team, which defeated Hopkins, 4–2, but the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Blue Jays the co-national championship (along with Syracuse). Since that season, the teams have met annually {{with the exception}} of a two-year hiatus due to World War II. <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> won three straight national titles from 1926 to 1928, where each season culminated with a victory over Maryland. In 1928, Maryland had a perfect 9–0 record until <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins</b> defeated the Terps in the season finale, 6–3. At season's end, a single-elimination tournament was held to determine which team would represent the United States in a trial lacrosse competition during the Summer Olympics. Maryland defeated Navy and Rutgers to advance to the final game, where they were again bested by <b>Johns</b> <b>Hopkins.</b>|$|E
