40|$|To {{get high}} output power with good beam quality, a tapered section is {{introduced}} to large-mode-area (LMA) Yb-doped fiber laser. Output {{characteristics of the}} fiber laser <b>without</b> <b>tapered</b> section and with tapered section are compared experimentally. When the launched pump power is 119. 1 W, 77. 9 W with M- 2 3. 08 and 56. 4 W with M- 2 1. 14 can be obtained, respectively. The corresponding slope efficiencies are 71. 8 % and 54. 1 %, respectively. Although output power of the tapered fiber laser has 30. 6 % penalty, brightness of it is as much as 5. 28 times of the fiber laser <b>without</b> <b>tapered</b> section. Moreover, spectra of them are measured. It is found that tapered section makes lasing wavelength of the fiber laser shorter. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Generally many auxiliary antenna elements are required to protect a radar with a high gain antenna <b>without</b> <b>tapering,</b> from a single jammer with generic direction of arrival.

In this paper we introduce two extractor-based properties {{that allow us to}} gain insight into the design of such schemes and to go be-yond known feasibility results in this area. We formalise strong plaintext awareness and secret key awareness and prove their suitability in realis-ing these goals. Strong plaintext awareness imposes that it is infeasible to construct a ciphertext under any public <b>key</b> <b>without</b> knowing the un-derlying message.

In addition, we identify new regimes where g b, we present a phenomenological formula which accurately describes the dependence of the loss factor on the parameters σ, b, d, and L.

40|$|The mode {{interactions}} {{and the sound}} transmission loss across the expansion chambers with and <b>without</b> <b>tapered</b> sections are studied by the finite element method in the present investigation. Results from chambers with symmetrical inlet and outlet suggest lower sound power transmission loss at frequencies below that of the first symmetrical transverse chamber mode when the tapered section angle is reduced. Weak sound power transmission loss is also observed for this chamber type at frequency {{higher than that of}} the first symmetrical duct mode. Numerous high and low sound power transmission loss regions are observed between these two eigenfrequencies. Higher plane wave power transmission loss can be found at smaller tapered section angle only if one of the chamber endings is not tapered. Such chamber bears important industrial application.

30|$|In summary, we have {{demonstrated}} the MBE growth of InAs NWs on graphite without foreign catalyst, SiO 2 or patterned substrates. The InAs NWs are vertically aligned on the substrate surface and have a homogeneous diameter distribution <b>without</b> <b>tapering</b> and metal droplets on the tops. Our NWs have a larger diameter, shorter length and less number density in comparison with InAs NWs on Si, which are ascribed {{to the lack of}} dangling bond on the graphite surface. The growth was proposed to follow a VS growth mechanism. The surface collection of impinging indium adatoms is the dominant contribution to the axial growth for short NWs, while impinging adatoms on sidewalls and diffusion {{to the top of the}} NWs become dominant for the longer NWs. We have also shown that the resulting NWs have mixed pure ZB and WZ insertions.|$|R
