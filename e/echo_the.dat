5|$|Inland Empire is a 2006 mystery film. The film stars Laura Dern, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, Grace Zabriskie, Jeremy Irons and Diane Ladd. While remaking a Polish {{film that}} was {{abandoned}} after a mysterious tragedy, an actress finds herself falling for a fellow cast member and realises {{that her life}} is starting to <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> plot of their production.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Liners House, the company's new {{headquarters}} in Salford Docks, was officially opened on 12 December 1969 by the High Commissioner for Canada. The design was advanced for its {{day and it}} remains basically unchanged today except for re-glazing. The unusual curved facade of the ten-storey building was designed to <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> bridge shape of the Manchester Miller. Later renamed Furness House, it {{was built on the}} former Manchester Ship Canal railway sidings between Nos. 8 and 9 Docks.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four of his colleagues in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E

50|$|The later Papadikai {{mentions}} that changes between <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> tritos and <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> plagios tetartos were bridged by the enharmonic phthora nana, and changes between <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> protos and <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> plagios devteros by the chromatic phthora nenano.|$|R
5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning <b>echo.</b> <b>The</b> delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child at the {{forefront}} might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience. Their poses are similar and her tall crown is typical of those seen on statues rather than either royalty or painted figures of the Virgin. Harbison further suggests that the two pools {{of light on the}} floor <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> two candles on either side of one of the statues, and notes that the copies described below retain the prayer tablet, one bringing it nearer to the foreground.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
50|$|The {{title of}} the 1955 musical Damn Yankees refers {{specifically}} to the New York Yankees baseball team but also <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> older cultural term. Similarly, a book about <b>the</b> ball club <b>echoes</b> <b>the</b> {{title of the}} Holmes film: The Magnificent Yankees.|$|R

5|$|Following a major {{refurbishment}} of the Bridge Street {{base in the}} mid-1960s, the next milestones for the paper came in 1973. The first was Sunderland A.F.C.'s 1–0 win over Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. Ian Porterfield's winning goal was headline news at the time, giving the Echo its all-time record circulation figure of 95,000copies of the Sports <b>Echo.</b> <b>The</b> second important event of 1973 was the 100th anniversary of the paper. Celebrations included a birthday party, with dignitaries such as Sunderland A.F.C. manager Bob Stokoe among the guests. Lord Buckton, the chairman of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, announced his retirement at the event, and was succeeded by his son, The Honourable Richard Storey. News of a move from Bridge Street to Pennywell, Sunderland, was also announced during the anniversary celebrations. The old newspaper building has since {{been replaced by a}} modern apartment block. The Echo name still lives on, however, as the project as been named Echo24.|$|E
5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} the herbal extends beyond {{medicine}} to botany and horticulture. Herbal medicine is still practiced {{in many parts of}} the world but the traditional grand herbal, as described here, ended with the European Renaissance, the rise of modern medicine and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs. The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways. Firstly, discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. Secondly, at a more popular level, there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens, medicinal and useful plants. Finally, the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that <b>echo</b> <b>the</b> herbals of the past, an example being Maud Grieve's A Modern Herbal, first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions.|$|E
40|$|Transorbital {{ultrasonic}} examination was deviced by <b>the</b> anthor. <b>The</b> <b>echo</b> from <b>the</b> IVth ventricle {{were obtained by}} using this method. In order to record normal echo-gram, the probe (1 MC or 2. 25 MC) was placed directly on the upper eyelid and <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> from <b>the</b> orbit, pyramid, IVth ventricle and occipital bone were recorded by this method. Clinically, this method would be applied to diagnosis of the infratentorial tumors. Abnormal echos would be obtained between <b>the</b> <b>echos</b> from <b>the</b> pyramid and the occipital bone {{on the side of}} tumor or <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> of <b>the</b> displaced IVth ventricle would be obtained...|$|R

5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an <b>echo.</b> <b>The</b> exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E

25|$|In {{almost all}} cases the phrases {{used in the}} Beatitudes are {{familiar}} from an Old Testament context, but in the sermon Jesus gives them new meaning.

5000|$|The {{rivalry between}} Corwin and Eric roughly {{parallels}} the Wars of the Roses, as portrayed in Shakespeare's [...] "Wars of the Roses" [...] cycle.

30|$|In the experiments, we collect five {{hundreds}} {{echoes of}} P 410 radar for no person status and other seven statuses with 1000 samples for each <b>echo.</b> Firstly, <b>the</b> residual subspace matrix P {{could be achieved}} by <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> signal matrix under no person status. For the human being detection, we select the signals from <b>the</b> 200 th <b>echo</b> to <b>the</b> 300 th <b>echo</b> and obtain one test <b>echo</b> signal from <b>the</b> average of every ten <b>echoes.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results are showed below.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{multipath}} <b>echoes</b> {{are then}} analyzed {{on the radar}} display as echoes extending in a radial direction behind the actual location of the hail/heavy rain core. The loss of energy by due to multiple reflections means weaker return <b>echoes.</b> <b>The</b> hail spike region has thus comparatively quite weaker <b>echoes</b> than <b>the</b> <b>echoes</b> directly from <b>the</b> hail or heavy rain core.|$|R
