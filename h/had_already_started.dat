5|$|On June 20, the cremated {{remains of}} Terri Schiavo were buried. The Schindlers' {{attorney}} {{stated that the}} family was notified by fax only after the memorial service; by then, the family <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> getting calls from reporters. The ashes were interred at Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park in Clearwater, Florida.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{concession}} was given construction of the railway <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started.</b> At the most 2,000 workers {{were involved in the}} construction of the plant, the Rjukan Line, and the Tinnoset Line. This was in addition to the Svelgfoss Power Station and a new potassium nitrate factory in Notodden. During the construction one worker lost his life in a landslide, while two survived the accident. Housing was provided in simple barracks, and few laborers came with family. Prostitution and the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley.|$|E

5|$|Located {{south of}} Sopron, {{the small town}} of Kőszeg was only {{a few miles from the}} Austrian border. It was held by a task force {{commanded}} by the Croatian soldier and diplomat Nikola Jurišić. Kőszeg was not considered a place of importance. It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded without a fight. The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha, did not realize how poorly defended Kőszeg was. After taking a few minor places, Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards, when the siege <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|When the Swedish invaded Zealand in August 1658, the Dutch Republic was not {{the only}} foreign power that took notice. A union between Brandenburg, Poland and Austria <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> to put {{together}} a relief army in December 1657, but preparations of the polyglot force took so long that the Treaty of Roskilde was signed before the army was ready to march. However, the preparations were not in vain—with the 1658 invasion the allies were in an excellent position to quickly put together a force and march towards Denmark.|$|E

5|$|By 1972, Pink Floyd had {{recorded}} the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On {{the back of}} Mores success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived. The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> working on another album, The Dark Side of the Moon, including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, {{either side of a}} Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was then mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.|$|E
5|$|In April, Sakanaction <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> making {{songs for}} Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, {{which had been}} released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E
5|$|Most of the UK's Caribbean territories {{achieved}} independence {{after the}} departure in 1961 and 1962 of Jamaica and Trinidad from the West Indies Federation, established in 1958 {{in an attempt}} to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members. Barbados achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s, but Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands opted to revert to British rule after they <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> on the path to independence. The British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and Montserrat opted to retain ties with Britain, while Guyana achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, British Honduras, became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed Belize in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A dispute with Guatemala over claims to Belize was left unresolved.|$|E

5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started.</b> They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Chinese attacks on along the 38th parallel, Ridgway worried that the Chinese would exploit the breakthrough at Chuncheonen to circle the entire Eighth Army. He also lacked confidence in the UN troops' ability to hold against the Chinese offensive. On the morning of January 3, after conferring with Major General Frank W. Milburn and Major General John B. Coulter, commanders of the US I and IX Corps, respectively, Ridgway ordered the evacuation of Seoul. With the collapse of the UN defenses at the 38th parallel, the retreat <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>started</b> on January 1. At 09:00 on January 1, Milburn ordered US I Corps to retreat to the Seoul Bridgehead line. Following his orders, the US 25th Infantry Division of I Corps took up position to the west of Koyang, while the British 29th Independent Infantry Brigade of I Corps had dug in to the east. To the east of I Corps, Coulter also ordered the withdrawal of the US IX Corps at 14:00 with the Anglo-Australian 27th British Commonwealth Brigade covering the rear. Some Chinese forces managed to trap the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade at Uijeongbu during their attacks against the ROK 6th Infantry Division, but the battalion escaped the trap with four wounded. By midnight on January 1, the US 24th Infantry Division of the IX Corps reached the Seoul Bridgehead line at the south of Uijeongbu, and the 27th Commonwealth Brigade was moved into the IX Corps rear as reserves.|$|E
