5|$|The condor soars with <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> held {{horizontally}} and {{its primary}} feathers bent upwards at the tips. The {{lack of a}} large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. Charles Darwin commented on having watched them {{for half an hour}} without once observing a flap of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap <b>its</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> infrequently. While in flight, <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are {{of equal}} length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their {{technique}} is to launch {{themselves in the}} air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> remain at a right angle, and when the termite is at rest, <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> remain parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|When perched {{or between}} bouts of {{foraging}} on the ground, the flame robin holds {{itself in a}} relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45° or less from the vertical, and <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> alternately when still. The flame robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.|$|E

5|$|Auditory {{defenses}} {{can also}} be used, which {{in the case of}} the Grizzled skipper refers to vibrations generated by the butterfly upon expanding <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> in an attempt to communicate with ant predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> are closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E
50|$|In aerodynamics, {{wing loading}} {{is the total}} mass of an {{aircraft}} divided by the area of <b>its</b> <b>wing.</b> The stalling speed of an aircraft in straight, level flight is partly determined by <b>its</b> <b>wing</b> loading. An aircraft with a low wing loading has a larger wing area relative to its mass, as compared to an aircraft with a high wing loading.|$|R

5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} perches in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often flicking <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide for extended periods with <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering {{display is}} seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers its head and tail, outstretches and quivers <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> and holds its beak open silently.|$|E

5|$|Secrets of Rætikon is a single-player, story-driven, open world sandbox action-adventure video game. The player-character takes {{form of a}} bird. The player {{controls}} the bird with three buttons: one that flaps <b>its</b> <b>wings,</b> another that takes items into the bird's beak, and another that makes bird sounds. While the game can be played through keyboard and mouse, the developers instead recommend a controller.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because <b>its</b> <b>wings</b> encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding <b>its</b> <b>wings,</b> and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
