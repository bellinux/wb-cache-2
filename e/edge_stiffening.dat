40|$|Results {{from recent}} NASA {{sponsored}} {{research on the}} structural dynamics, stability, and control characteristics of heliogyro solar sails are summarized. Specific areas under investigation include coupled nonlinear finite element analysis of heliogyro membrane blade with solar radiation pressure effects, system identification of spinning membrane structures, and solarelastic stability analysis of heliogyro solar sails, including stability during blade deployment. Recent results from terrestrial 1 -g blade dynamics and control experiments on "rope ladder" membrane blade analogs, and small-scale in vacuo system identification experiments with hanging and spinning high-aspect ratio membranes will also be presented. A low-cost, rideshare payload heliogyro technology demonstration mission concept {{is used as a}} mission context for these heliogyro structural dynamics and solarelasticity investigations, and is also described. Blade torsional dynamic response and control are also shown to be significantly improved through the use of <b>edge</b> <b>stiffening</b> structural features or inclusion of modest tip masses to increase centrifugal stiffening of the blade structure. An output-only system identification procedure suitable for on-orbit blade dynamics investigations is also developed and validated using ground tests of spinning sub-scale heliogyro blade models. Overall, analytical and experimental investigations to date indicate no intractable stability or control issues for the heliogyro solar sail concept...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cold {{formed steel}} members with <b>edge</b> <b>stiffened</b> holes {{are a new}} {{generation}} of cold formed members recently developed by the building industry. Very little research has been performed on such sections to determine their local and distortional buckling capacity. This article provides the numerical results of elastic local buckling analysis of cold-formed lipped channels with <b>edge</b> <b>stiffened</b> holes. For flexural elements values of critical buckling moments are calculated and the influence of hole spacing and diameter on elastic buckling capacity is determined...|$|R

50|$|The hooks {{were usually}} {{held in the}} slots by a steel clip that filled {{the part of the}} slot that is empty when the {{adjacent}} sheets are properly engaged. The holes were bent up at their edges so that the beveled <b>edge</b> <b>stiffened</b> the area around the hole. In some mats a T-shaped stake could be driven at intervals through the holes to keep the assembly in place on the ground. Sometimes the sheets were welded together.|$|R
40|$|This brief note {{discusses}} {{a change}} to the effective width determination for elements with intermediate stiffeners (e. g., the compression flange of deck sections) in local buckling. Current provisions (Section B 5. 1. 1 of AISI-S 100 - 07) can lead to erroneously conservative solutions, particularly for sections with a single stiffener located at mid-width of the element. The problem is easily rectified by using the more general expressions for local buckling already available in Specification section B 5. 1. 2. A ballot has been proposed to remedy the problem. The AISI Specification provisions for determining the effective width of elements with intermediate stiffeners have undergone significant revisions in recent editions. In 2001 entirely new provisions were adopted for <b>stiffened</b> and <b>edge</b> <b>stiffened</b> elements with multiple intermediate stiffeners {{based on the work}} of Schafer and Peköz (1998). In 2007 the provisions for single intermediate stiffeners were removed and the 2001 multiple intermediate stiffener provisions expanded to cover both single and multiple intermediate stiffeners in <b>stiffened</b> and <b>edge</b> <b>stiffened</b> elements {{based on the work of}} Yang and Schafer (2006). The basic basis of the current intermediate stiffener provisions is the determination of (a) plate sub-element local buckling, and (b) distortional buckling of the intermediately stiffened element as illustrated in the AISI commentary, reprinted here as Fig. 1. Once the plate buckling coefficient (i. e., the “k ” value) is determined for each of the modes, the smaller of the two is selected for effective width determination...|$|R
30|$|To {{simplify the}} model, the {{assumption}} was also {{made that the}} soundboard is simply supported when {{in fact it is}} probably somewhere between simply supported and clamped (Meirovitch 1996 b). Since clamped edges prevent rotation at the <b>edge,</b> local <b>stiffening</b> occurs. This leads to an increase in the natural frequencies.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{focuses on}} the {{determination}} of stress distribution at the <b>stiffened</b> <b>edges</b> of a thick curved flat bar using a new computational elasticity approach. The bar is rigidly fixed at its one end and the two opposing curved edges are subjected to circumferential stiffeners. The corresponding stress field of the curved bar is obtained from the finite-difference solution of an elliptic partial differential equation of equilibrium in polar coordinate system. The analysis is carried out for two different conditions of loading at the bar end. The effect of bar aspect ratio {{on the state of}} stresses at the <b>stiffened</b> <b>edges</b> is also included in the present analysis...|$|R
50|$|The furling {{system itself}} {{is very simple}} in concept. The {{leading edge of the}} sail (luff) to be furled is {{stiffened}} in some way, such as by attaching it to a length of plastic pipe or by sewing in a stiff material such as foam. This <b>stiffened</b> <b>edge</b> serves to spread the force of the furler {{along the edge of the}} sail, so that the sail will furl along its full length. This <b>stiffened</b> <b>edge</b> is then attached to the source of energy for furling, which may be a handle that is turned, a spool containing a line that is pulled, or a motor.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} tests on cold-formed channels with inclined simple edge stiffeners compressed between fixed ends. The simple edge stiffeners of the channel sections consist of simple lips. The new North American Specification and the Australian! New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures provide design rules for channels with inclined edge stiffeners. However, the design rules are mainly based on tests of sections having edge stiffeners perpendicular to the flanges. The provisions for inclined edge stiffeners are determined based on intuition without rigorous experimental evidence. Hence, it is important to obtain test data for sections with edge stiffeners not perpendicular to the flanges. A series of compression tests was performed on cold-formed channels with inclined edge stiffeners. The edge stiffeners of the channels were inclined at different angles for both outwards and inwards. The distortional buckling mode. where the flange and lip rotate about the flange-web junction restrained by the web, was observed in all tests. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification, the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification, and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. For the North American Specification and the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification, the distortional buckling mode is not explicitly accounted for in design. However, the Australian/New Zealand Standard has explicit design rules for distortional buckling in addition to the <b>edge</b> <b>stiffened</b> design rules which are the same as the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification...|$|R

50|$|The Leitner-Watts {{propellers}} were {{amongst the}} earliest {{with a thick}} metal aerodynamic profile. Watts was the aerodynamicist who determined the blade profile, Leitner the engineer who translated it into metal and designed hubs for two, three and four bladed propellers. The blades were produced in the Rubery Owen factory in Darlaston, Staffordshire. Each blade side or shell was made up from three laminations of steel sheet, shaped in a press. The outer layer formed the complete shell shape and the progressively shorter, Y-shaped inner laminations strengthened the bade towards the root. The laminations were riveted or spot-welded together and the two shells welded together at their <b>edges.</b> To <b>stiffen</b> the blade, small shouldered cylindrical struts were then inserted through the face and externally soldered at each end. The hubs allowed easy ground adjustment of pitch to any angle; if one blade was damaged, it could easily be replaced.|$|R
40|$|Curved arch bridges with curved deck {{supported}} by an inclined arch either through web members or without are studied. Reference to shell-supported bridges is first made. It {{must be taken}} into account that even if the deck is {{supported by}} a shell, its bottom free <b>edge</b> (usually <b>stiffened)</b> is described by a thrust line, so that the shell connects the curved deck (that is a horizontal arch) with an inclined 3 D funicular arch. A limit case is that the ring girder of the curved deck and the funicular arch merge dividing the shell into two parts, so that, if shell thickness tends to zero, no shell connects them. This is the case of curved bridges supported only at mid-span by an inclined arch. The efficiency of different arches is compared. Moreover, the deck can be supported not only at mid-span but also by web members connecting deck girder and inclined arch. In this latter case, the most appropriate form of the inclined arch is obtained...|$|R
50|$|Spanish engineer-architect Eduardo Torroja, with Manuel Sanchez, {{designed}} the Market Hall in Algeciras, Spain, {{with a thin}} shell concrete dome. Built from 1933 - 34, the shallow dome is 48 meters wide, 9 centimeters thick, and supported at points around its perimeter. Popularized by a 1955 article {{on the work of}} Félix Candela in Mexico, architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the finite element method of structural analysis. Notable examples of domes include the Kresge Auditorium at MIT, which has a spherical shell 49 meters wide and 89 millimeters thick, and the Palazzetto dello Sport, with a 59 meter wide dome designed by Pier Luigi Nervi. Early examples used a relatively thick bordering girder to stabilize exposed edges. Alternative stabilization techniques include adding a bend at these <b>edges</b> to <b>stiffen</b> them or increasing the thickness of the shell itself at the edges and near the supports.|$|R
40|$|The stress-distribution in a {{wedge-shaped}} {{plate with}} a stiffener upon one of the edges is considered. The stiffener is loaded by an axial force. The problem leads to the solution of a biharmonic equation with one mixed boundary condition. The problem is reduced to the standard problem of the stress-distribution in a wedge. The reduction has been executed by the solution of a difference equation for the transform of the shear-stress along the <b>stiffened</b> <b>edge.</b> For this solution we give two representations: one {{by means of an}} infinite product and one by means of an integral. Full discussion is given on asymptotic behaviour and on the numerical aspects...|$|R

For a given shell and all applied conditions there may be determined the deflections, secondary stresses, reactions, edge beam forces (moments, axial forces, and shears), and for each element in the shell, the maximum average stress, and the maximum shear.

40|$|A {{classical}} {{buckling analysis}} is developed for stiffened, flat plates {{composed of a}} series of linked flat plate and beam elements. Plates are idealized as multilayered orthotropic elements; structural beads and lips are idealized as beams. The loaded <b>edges</b> of the <b>stiffened</b> plate are simply supported and the conditions at the unloaded edges can be prescribed arbitrarily. The plate and beam elements are matched along their common junctions for displacement continuity and force equilibrium in an exact manner. Offsets between elements are considered in the analysis. Buckling under uniaxial compressive load for plates, sections and stiffened plates is investigated. Buckling loads are found as the lowest of all possible general and local failure modes and the mode shape is used to determine whether buckling is a local or general instability. Numerical correlations with existing analysis and test data for plates, sections and stiffened plates including boron-reinforced structures are discussed. In general, correlations are reasonably good...|$|R
40|$|Derailments of trains {{often occur}} {{due to the}} wheel-rail contact failure caused by {{the impact of the}} trains with road {{vehicles}} at road-rail crossings. Frontal collisions of passenger trains onto stuck road vehicles occur frequently at such road-rail crossings even where active warning systems are installed. Such collisions are often fatal and cause significant damages to vehicles and the infrastructure especially when they incur derailments. Innovations in passive railway infrastructure designs for mitigating the severity of collision induced derailments are rare. This paper presents a formulation for a passive road-rail crossing involving <b>stiffened</b> <b>edges</b> of the raised road pavement to minimise the risk of failure of wheel–rail contact using a nonlinear three-dimensional multibody dynamics model. Severe derailment scenarios of trains passing through the passive and normal road-rail crossings have been analysed and presented. The innovative design of the road-rail crossing with passive track structure presented in the paper is shown to reduce the failure of the wheel-rail contact and hence the train-truck frontal collision derailment potential...|$|R
40|$|Compression {{testing of}} large, thin, {{stiffened}} composite panels is complex {{due to the}} susceptibility of such panels to premature buckling and failure. Such failures are due to the artifacts of testing, such as, offset at load introduction edges, non-uniform distribution of loads, nature of lateral supports, crushing of panel edges etc. In this paper, a novel approach for compression loading of thin stiffened composite panels is proposed and validated from finite element analysis supported by tests. Compression loading of such panels (less than 2 mm thick) is challenging since the edges are susceptible to local crushing. To avoid this, loading edges of the panel were encased in mild steel casing blocks filled with finely grounded aluminium powder mixed with epoxy resin. Coupon level tests were conducted to measure mechanical properties of the interface between composite and casting mixture. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used in these tests to measure the full field strains and to validate numerical simulations. Further, finite element analysis of the actual composite test panel with end casting mixture was performed which indicated that interface shear stresses and compression stresses at maximum expected load are much lower than allowables obtained from specimen tests. Hence, the Aluminium-Epoxy cast mixture proposed in this study can be used safely to cast <b>edges</b> of large <b>stiffened</b> panels for axial compression tests...|$|R
40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the effect of}} unconstrained damping layers and an edge-supporting stiffener on the sound power radiated from a mechanically-driven honeycomb sandwich plate. The free wave equations of coupled flexural plate motion are first set up, {{taking into account the}} orthotropic core shear stiffness. Solutions of these equations have been found and computed wavespeed dispersion curves have been presented. The plate boundary conditions at an edge supported on a flexible beam have been established and the response of the plate to a point harmonic force on that beam has been analysed and computed. The sound power radiated from the baffled plate surface has been found from the pre-determined plate response by numerical evaluation of Rayleigh's integral. A computational study has shown that the orientation of the core principal axes of orthotropy relative to the edge beam can profoundly influence the level of the radiated sound power. The sound power reductions obtainable when unconstrained damping layers are added to the plate surface have been predicted and explained. Full account has been taken of the effect of the damping layers on the radiation efficiencies and total loss factors of the plates. Experiments to validate the theory have been conducted. A supporting rig for sandwich plates has been constructed which simulated three simply-supported and one <b>stiffened</b> <b>edge</b> condition. Response and radiated sound power measurements were made on three different plates. Tests were conducted with and without damping layers on the plates and the results compared favourably with those predicted from the theory and computer programmes. Measurements were made of the damping material properties from tests on solid plates. These properties led to accurate predictions of the natural frequencies of simple sandwich beams, but the measured flexural loss factors of the beams were considerably different from predicted values...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{experience}} in the ecuadorean scope on estimation of critical loads of structures formed by plates with reinforcements, this project sought to revise formulations to evaluate the mentioned parameter, and compare it with experimental results. The classic reference [7], describes four typical buckling modes for such structures: plate between 2 reinforcements, Flexural bending of stiffeners, torsion of stiffeners, and Total deflection of the panel. Formulations were implemented for each buckling mode. The reviewed formulae for estimating critical load for buckling of reinforced panels were implemented, and after varying the geometric parameters were set four panels, each of whom had at least the effort {{of one of the}} critical modes of buckling and described. Then, using stainless steel plate 1. 5 mm thick, were built two specimens of each type of panel, with a maximum length of 1. 20 m, considering the available equipment. Before developing the test, thickness and the resulting pre-deformation were measured. Thickness had little variation but pre-deformations were high, in the order of the thickness of the plate The experimental tests were conducted in the Universal Testing Machine of FIMCP, and determined the maximum force that bore the specimen. On the buckling of the plate between stiffeners, the experimental results are larger than the analytic, because the edges of the plate are welded to the reinforcements, while the analytical model considered simply supported. On the Flexural Buckling of longitudinal reinforcement, the theoretical results are higher than experimental ones, because of local failure between flange and web of the reinforcements, the distance between welds. In the torsional buckling, the plate twisted instead of the stiffeners, because side <b>edges</b> were not <b>stiffen</b> enough, and this substantially reduced the experimental effort critical. In total buckling of the panel, the longitudinal reinforcements flexes in parallel, since the edge stiffeners were not enough, resulting in a substantial difference between the results...|$|R
