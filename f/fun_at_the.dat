5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|Maya Lindholm {{was born}} in Hamburg on 20 December 1990. In 2004, she awoke one morning with severe back pain, and within hours {{she could no longer}} move her legs. Doctors {{diagnosed}} spinal cord inflammation. She is studying to be an occupational therapist at the BG Trauma Hospital in Hamburg Boberg. She began playing wheelchair basketball for <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hospital in 2005. In 2009, she was selected as part of the national team.|$|E
5|$|The IOC set {{a vision}} for the YOG to be an event {{comprising}} a balance of sports, culture and education. The objective of the Culture and Education Programme (CEP) that athletes participated in was to educate, engage and influence the athletes to develop true sportsmanship and to live by the Olympic values of excellence, respect and friendship, while having <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|E

5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> London lottery system and those who support it.|$|E
5|$|The {{expanded}} and altered version of The Welsh Opera, The Grub-Street Opera, was first rehearsed in May 1731, {{but it never}} ran on stage. It was printed and exists in a complete printed format, {{and it is possible}} that it was not performed because of government intervention. Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent, and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed. The plot focuses on a standard love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics. The title pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grub Street Journal and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.|$|E
5|$|Keate was {{followed}} by other romantic poets including William Sotheby (Ode, Netley Abbey, Midnight, 1790). Sotheby's view of the abbey was gothic; he peoples the ruins with spectral processions and ghostly Cistercians. Nor was he the only one; in 1795 Richard Warner wrote a potboiler entitled Netley Abbey, a Gothic Story in two volumes, featuring skullduggery at the abbey during the middle ages. Dark deeds before the Dissolution also appeared in the section of Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldsby Legends (1847) covering Netley. This complex satire pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> medieval church and the monks (whom he accuses of having walled up an erring nun {{in one of the}} vaults and ensuring God’s revenge upon them) and the tourists who crowded contemporary Netley, {{while at the same time}} showing appreciation of the beauty of the ruins.|$|E

5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E

25|$|The Gilbert and Sullivan {{operetta}} Patience pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Aesthetic movement, and {{the lead}} character of Reginald Bunthorne is often identified as a send-up of Oscar Wilde, though Bunthorne is more likely an amalgam of several prominent artists, writers, and Aesthetic figures. Bunthorne wears a monocle and has prominent white streaks in his dark hair, as did Whistler.|$|E
25|$|Another popular Danish {{theatrical}} {{tradition is}} the revue {{which has been}} thriving since the mid-19th century. Today revues are performed every summer to full houses in theatres across Denmark, poking <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> politics {{of the day and}} even the monarchy. Among the most popular are Circusrevyen in Copenhagen with Lisbet Dahl, and the Nykøbing Revy directed by Flemming Krøll in Nykøbing Falster.|$|E

He was examined at a hospital and released the same day. A rerun was aired that night, but O'Brien returned to work the following Monday and poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E
25|$|The Sesame Street Muppets {{characters}} Bert and Ernie {{share their}} names with the cop and the taxicab {{driver in the}} film. Longtime Muppets writer and puppeteer Jerry Juhl said he believed there was no connection {{and that this was}} a coincidence. The episode Elmo Saves Christmas (1996), which featured a clip from the film, pokes <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> persistent reports of a connection, having them look at each other in disbelief as George calls Bert and Ernie by name.|$|E
25|$|Following an August 2005 Sunday World {{article that}} poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{gambling}} losses {{of one of}} its leaders, the UDA banned the sale of the newspaper from shops in areas it controls. Shops that defy the ban have suffered arson attacks, and at least one newsagent was threatened with death. The Police Service of Northern Ireland began accompanying the paper's delivery vans. The UDA was also considered to have played an instrumental role in loyalist riots in Belfast in September 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{show was}} satirized in the October 2, 1993 {{episode of the}} sketch comedy show, Saturday Night Live. The episode, which was hosted by Shannen Doherty, {{featured}} a sketch depicting a Real World cast patterned after the Los Angeles cast, and poked <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discussions of racism, bigotry, and political differences {{that served as a}} recurring theme that season. Another SNL parody of The Real World came in a 1996 episode hosted by John Goodman in which Bob Dole (Norm Macdonald) is thrown out of the house.|$|E
25|$|In 1806, the {{pantomime}} clown Joseph Grimaldi (The Garrick of Clowns) {{had performed}} his greatest success in Harlequin and Mother Goose; or the Golden Egg at Covent Garden, {{and this was}} subsequently revived, at the new theatre. Grimaldi was an innovator: his performance as Joey introduced the clown to the world, building on the existing role of Harlequin derived from the Commedia dell'arte. His father had been ballet-master at Drury Lane, and his physical comedy, his ability to invent visual tricks and buffoonery, {{and his ability to}} poke <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> audience were extraordinary.|$|E
25|$|Scene II: At Lady Sneerwell's, the scandal-mongers {{have great}} <b>fun</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of friends not present.

He departs, the others retire {{to the next}} room, and Joseph seizes the {{opportunity}} to court Maria, who rejects him again. Lady Teazle returns and dismisses Maria, and it is revealed that she is seriously flirting with Joseph – who doesn't want her, but cannot afford to alienate her.|$|E
