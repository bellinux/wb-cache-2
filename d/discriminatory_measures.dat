The Red Summer of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities, such as the Chicago race riot of 1919 and the Omaha race riot of 1919. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans in Northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: The {{estimation}} of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) often relies {{on the assumption that}} the truly positive population tends to have higher marker results than the truly negative population. The authors propose a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>measure</b> to relax such an assumption and apply the measure to identify the appropriate set of markers for combination. Materials and Methods: The proposed measure is based on the maximum of the AUC and 1 -AUC. The existing methods are applied to estimate the measure. The subset of markers is selected using a combination method that maximizes a function of the proposed discriminatory score with the number of markers as a penalty in the function. Results: The properties of the estimators for the proposed measure were studied through large-scale simulation studies. The application was illustrated through a real example to identify the set of markers to combine. Conclusion: Simulation results showed excellent small-sample performance of the estimators for the proposed measure. The application in the example yielded a reasonable subset of markers for combination. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R

In In Silico Biol. 2, 0046 We wished to quantify the state-of-the-art of our understanding of clusters in microarray data. To do this we systematically compared the clusters produced on sets of microarray data using a representative set of clustering algorithms (hierarchical, k-means, and {{a modified version of}} QT_CLUST) with the annotation schemes MIPS, GeneOntology and GenProtEC. We assumed that if a cluster reflected known biology its members would share related ontological annotations. This assumption is the basis of 'guilt-by-association' and is commonly used to assign the putative function of proteins. To statistically measure the relationship between cluster and annotation we developed a new predictive <b>discriminatory</b> <b>measure.</b> We found that the clusters found in microarray data do not in general agree with functional annotation classes. Although many statistically significant relationships can be found, the majority of clusters are not related to known biology (as described in annotation ontologies). This implies that use of guilt-by-association is not supported by annotation ontologies. Depending on the estimate of the amount of noise in the data, our results suggest that bioinformatics has only codified a small proportion of the biological knowledge required to understand microarray data.

2500|$|In the 1870s and 1880s various legal <b>discriminatory</b> <b>measures</b> {{were taken}} against the Chinese. These laws, in {{particular}} the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China, although the laws were later repealed by the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. Another key piece of legislation was the Naturalization Act of 1870, which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization {{on the grounds that}} they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed alien land laws that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an [...] "unassimilable" [...] race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against Plessy v.

He then became the head of the Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, claiming that it would soften the hardships of occupation. Opposition to the German occupation of northern France and the collaborationist Vichy government was left to the French Resistance within France and the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle outside France.

40|$|Purpose: Reconstruction of DaTSCAN brain {{studies using}} OS-EM {{iterative}} reconstruction offers better image quality and more accurate quantification than filtered back-projection. However, reconstruction must proceed for {{a sufficient number}} of iterations to achieve stable and accurate data. This study assessed the impact of the number of iterations on the image quantification, comparing the results of the iterative reconstruction with filtered back-projection data. Methods: A striatal phantom filled with 123 I using striatal to background ratios between 2 : 1 and 10 : 1 was imaged on five different gamma camera systems. Data from each system were reconstructed using OS-EM (which included depth-independent resolution recovery) with various combinations of iterations and subsets to achieve up to 200 EM-equivalent iterations and with filtered back-projection. Using volume of interest analysis, the relationships between image reconstruction strategy and quantification of striatal uptake were assessed. Results: For phantom filling ratios of 5 : 1 or less, significant convergence of measured ratios occurred close to 100 EM-equivalent iterations, whereas for higher filling ratios, measured uptake ratios did not display a convergence pattern. Assessment of the count concentrations used to derive the measured uptake ratio showed that nonconvergence of low background count concentrations caused peaking in higher measured uptake ratios. Compared to filtered back-projection, OS-EM displayed larger uptake ratios because of the resolution recovery applied in the iterative algorithm. Conclusion: The number of EM-equivalent iterations used in OS-EM reconstruction influences the quantification of DaTSCAN studies because of incomplete convergence and possible bias in areas of low activity due to the nonnegativity constraint in OS-EM reconstruction. Nevertheless, OS-EM using 100 EM-equivalent iterations provides the best linear <b>discriminatory</b> <b>measure</b> to quantify the uptake in DaTSCAN studies. 13 page(s...|$|R

To remedy this defect, it is suggested that there are at least two practical alternative solutions. The first is that Parliament could incorporate a strict necessity test into the Equality Act. Alternatively, the courts could develop a ‘robust approach’ to proportionality.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the dose-response relationship of increasing doses of oxymetazoline compared with placebo in normal subjects, {{and to determine}} the sensitivities of rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry and symptoms in discriminating between differing doses of oxymetazoline in normal subjects. METHODS: The study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-response design. One hundred and twenty-five healthy volunteers with no nasal obstruction were randomized to administration of a single intra-nasal dose of oxymetazoline (6. 25 microg, 12. 5 microg, 25 microg or 50 microg) or placebo to each nasal cavity. Nasal airway resistance (NAR) was measured by active posterior rhinomanometry. Total minimum cross-sectional area (tMCA) and volume (tVOL) were measured by acoustic rhinometry. Symptoms of congestion (CON) were assessed on a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: The two highest doses of oxymetazoline produced {{a significant decrease in}} NAR compared with placebo (P = 0. 015) but not between placebo and 12. 5 microg or 6. 25 microg. There was a dose-response relationship for tVOL, which increased significantly after all doses compared with placebo (P < 0. 001) and showed differences between 6. 25 -microg and 25 -microg (P < 0. 014) and 12. 5 -microg and 50 -microg (P < 0. 05) doses. tMCA increased compared with placebo after all treatments (P = 0. 028), but {{there were no significant differences}} between any of the active doses. There were no significant changes in CON after any treatments compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: tVOL shows a clear dose-response relationship for the range of doses of oxymetazoline administered. tVOL provides a sensitive and <b>discriminatory</b> <b>measure</b> of small nasal changes after low doses of oxymetazoline. NAR is able to discriminate between doses, but is less sensitive than tVOL and tMCA, requiring a higher threshold dose before significant changes are seen in nasal patency.
