5|$|An {{elaborate}} and oppressive system of rules regulating {{every facet of}} Victoria's life, <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> her in reclusive isolation most of the time, {{with the goal of}} making her weak, compliant and utterly dependent upon her mother and Conroy. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.|$|E
5|$|Luxtons cabinet makers {{was founded}} in 1800 and grew until it {{employed}} 50 people, with workshops at Cockpit Hill and Duke Street. After World War I a retail shop was opened by the firm in Fore Street and <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> going doing retailing and repairs until the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} airline {{to fly into}} Port Columbus was TWA, and <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> a {{presence}} at Columbus over seventy years during the era of airline regulation. TWA offered a club for exclusive passengers up until 2000 when America West took over a gate held by TWA and the club itself due to financial problems.|$|E

5|$|During the battle's final phase, Vukovar's {{remaining}} inhabitants, {{including several}} thousand Serbs, {{took refuge in}} cellars and communal bomb shelters, which housed up to 700 people each. A crisis committee was established, operating from a nuclear bunker beneath the municipal hospital. The committee assumed control of the town's management and organised the delivery of food, water and medical supplies. <b>It</b> <b>kept</b> the number of civilians on the streets to a minimum and ensured that each shelter was guarded and {{had at least one}} doctor and nurse assigned to it.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial {{observations}} led to {{the belief}} it was larger than Earth, the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> its status until 2006.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of the train's famous dash, the {{original}} Zephyr was rechristened the Pioneer Zephyr to distinguish it as the first of the Burlington's growing Zephyr fleet. In 1938, car 525 was replaced by car number 500, a 40-seat buffet/lounge car, to provide light meals. Car number 505, the baggage-coach combine, was rebuilt at this time into a full baggage car, but <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> its original windows.|$|E

5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version {{was intended to be}} a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only a few different parts, so <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel {{as it had in}} the First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would contribute significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– more than in the First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E
5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. <b>It</b> <b>kept</b> periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E

50|$|The {{managing}} director of local shipping company Whiteways and Ball presented the Torquay Harbour Lifesaving Boat to the RNLI in 1917 on the understanding that <b>it</b> would be <b>kept</b> operational even if the lifeboat station at the Ladies Bathing Cove closed. For the first year it of its operation <b>it</b> was <b>kept</b> on davits on Beacon Quay but from 1918 <b>it</b> was <b>kept</b> afloat in the harbour until 1928.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, {{the only}} {{competing}} Providence-based daily, the Star-Tribune, went bankrupt and was sold. The Providence Journal company bought <b>it</b> and <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> running for four months, then shut it down.|$|R
5|$|In {{both the}} campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater {{as the central}} focus of French efforts, but in both {{instances}} the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> marching towards the Black Forest. Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Masséna would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Armée d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.|$|E
5|$|Laurie was {{supposed}} to wear a monocle as Lt. George, the character's second incarnation, but eventually decided against it after <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> falling out of his eye. Laurie reprised the role of Prince George in the Christmas special Blackadder's Christmas Carol, and portrayed a new character, Lord Pigmot, set in the distant future. He also appeared in the millennium special , playing the Roman Consul Georgius and the modern day Major George Bufton-Tufton, The Viscount Bufton-Tufton. Although no new series or specials were made, the creators of the series have commented on various proposals over the years; one possibility was a film in which the main characters return as a 1960s' rock band, with George playing the guitar and keyboard. Curtis later said Laurie's international success with House would make a new instalment difficult.|$|E
5|$|The film's animators {{had little}} {{experience}} with computer-animation and feature-length films, {{and had to}} be trained by the producers {{over the course of the}} film's production. Since none of the animators were specialists, they were not divided into specific teams, but instead each worked on all areas of the animating process. The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time. Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist Prana Studios in Mumbai, India to perform lighting and compositing.|$|E

5|$|Following the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, {{the heavy}} losses of front-line {{aircraft}} endured by the VVS {{together with the}} disruption of aircraft production resulted in I-5s being removed from training units and returned to combat service as ground-attack aircraft or night bombers until early 1942. Some I-5s were used by the 605th and 606th Fighter Regiments (Istrebitel'nyye Aviatsionyye Polki (IAP)) during the defence of Moscow as night bombers until re-equipping in February 1942. The 2nd Ground Attack Regiment (Shturmovoy Aviatsionyye Polki (ShAP)) was raised in September 1941 in the Crimea from reservists and the Kachin Flying School. By 10 October thirty-two I-5s were on hand, although attrition had reduced them to sixteen serviceable. They were down {{to a total of}} a dozen aircraft by 18 October. They served until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was withdrawn for conversion to Ilyushin Il-2s and redesignated as the 766th ShAP. The 11th ShAP was raised by the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet on 22 September 1941. On 18 October it mustered eighteen serviceable and fifteen unserviceable I-5s, although this was reduced to eleven serviceable and eight unserviceable aircraft by 7 November. <b>It</b> <b>kept</b> the I-5s in service until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|The {{documented}} {{history of}} Strandzha dates back several millennia. The oldest traces of human habitation are stone axes and ceramic fragments {{found in the}} Ahtopol peninsula and are dated from the Neolithic period (c. 6000—3000 BC). Since the mid-1st millennium BC the mountain was inhabited by the Thracian tribes Thyni and Asti and {{was part of the}} Odrysian kingdom. The Thracians of Strandzha were infamous for their pirate raids. By the 2nd century BC, the power of the Odrysian kingdom declined and it became a client state of the Roman Republic. However, <b>it</b> <b>kept</b> its independence until 46 BC, when it was annexed by the Roman Empire, forming the province of Thracia. The region remained part of the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. In Roman times, Strandzha was a centre of copper and iron ore mining and metallurgy. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries the Slavs settled in most of the Balkans, including Strandzha. The whole territory of the modern park was included in the Bulgarian Empire {{for the first time in}} the aftermath of the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896. Strandzha remained a contested region between Bulgaria and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) gave refuge to the Hesychastic monk Gregory of Sinai and provided funds for the construction of a monastery near Paroria, in the homonymous protected area in the modern park, which attracted clerics from Bulgaria, Byzantium and Serbia.|$|E
