2500|$|Springfield {{has its own}} local {{newspaper}}, The Springfield Shopper. [...] The {{newspaper is}} often isolated from mainstream media, so the characters {{do not seem to}} know of other ones. [...] Dave Shutton <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Springfield Shopper. [...] He became less used since the episode [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] and has been reduced to cameo appearances and appearances in crowd scenes. [...] Other newspapers are seldom mentioned on the show. [...] In his book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray discusses a scene from [...] "Homer Defined" [...] that shows Homer reading a USA Today with the cover story: [...] "America's Favorite Pencil– #2 is #1". Lisa sees this title and criticizes the newspaper as a [...] "flimsy hodge-podge of high-brass factoids and Larry King", to which Homer responds that it is [...] "the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine." [...] In the book, Gray says this scene is used by the show's producers to criticize [...] "how often the news is wholly toothless, sacrificing journalism for sales, and leaving us not with important public information, but with America's Favorite Pencil".|$|E
