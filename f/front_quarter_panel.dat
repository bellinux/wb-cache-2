5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers. The fuel filler neck was moved from inside the trunk to the right <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 {{the rear}} indicators, tail lights and brake lights were {{relocated}} to the bumper {{from the body}} to meet Australian Design Rules, however they stayed the same in European versions. In 1992 another set of indicators {{were placed on the}} <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Martini's first {{sponsorship}} program {{happened at}} the Daytona 3 hours in 1962 with two Alfa Romeo Giulietta SZ Coda Troncas, {{but they had no}} Martini stickers or logos on them, only [...] "Martini & Rossi Racing Team" [...] written along the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Australian-specification {{vehicles}} {{differ from}} cars {{delivered in the}} United States by following the Japanese models; primarily headlights, side indicators (on <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels),</b> rear tail lights, front and rear bumpers and a higher placing of the [...] "Outback" [...] badging {{on the front door}} bodywork (as opposed to being placed on the plastic cladding).|$|R
25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|On January 30, 2014, a new Chase system {{resembling}} the playoff systems {{used in other}} major league sports was announced at Media Day. On July 15, NASCAR announced various design changes to identify Chase drivers in the field: on these drivers, their cars' roof numbers, front splitters and fascia, and the windshield header are colored yellow, and the Chase logo on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Current patrol {{vehicles}} are painted black {{with a white}} hood, roof, and trunk. Traditionally, {{the top of the}} doors were also white, but this practice is being abandoned with newer vehicles. [...] "Texas Department Public Safety" [...] is printed on the front door over a brown silhouette of the state of Texas. Underneath, [...] "Texas Highway Patrol" [...] is written in white; [...] "State Trooper" [...] is written on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> and on the trunk.|$|E
5000|$|Each car was {{sequentially}} numbered on a badge on the driver-side <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> A [...] "Certificate of Authenticity" [...] {{with the}} same number came with each car, signed by Mazda President James E. Miller and dated 10 February 1999. On certain markets, a gift set was also included, consisting of a 1/24 scale diecast model, two Seiko-branded wristwatches (his and hers) with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo, and metal keychain {{in the form of}} the Miata logo, all encased in a luxury blue velvet box.|$|E
5000|$|The current main sheriff's office patrol {{vehicles}} are the Chevrolet Impala and the Chevrolet Tahoe. The vehicles' markings include a sheriff's office badge on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels,</b> [...] "SHERIFF" [...] {{on the doors}} and [...] "EAST BATON ROUGE" [...] on the bottom door panels. Green and yellow stripes run {{down the side of}} the vehicle and a unit number is displayed on the roof for air unit identification. The patrol {{vehicles are}} outfitted with LED light bars and have laptop computers for use by deputies. Other marked patrol vehicles currently used include Harley-Davidson motorcycles and the Chevrolet Caprice. Several other unmarked vehicles in various makes and models are also used for non-patrol purposes.|$|R
50|$|The six-cylinder {{was also}} {{available}} as the VDC, with Subaru's VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) system, which integrated stability control with traction control. The system was also mated to a previously used Japanese-market AWD system, called VTD, in which power was split 45/55 front-to-rear in normal conditions. When wheel spin is detected, the system cuts {{power to the}} spinning wheel and directs power to those that aren't. Only when necessary do the brakes slow the affected wheels, when the vehicle detects excessive oversteer or understeer. This package had more sound insulation than other trims, {{as well as those}} features found on the L.L. Bean, such as McIntosh stereo, OnStar, and leather interior. Its curb weight was just slightly higher than that of the standard L.L. Bean trim, and while the VDC badging was placed on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> only, the H6-3.0 and Outback markings were also applied as usual.|$|R
5000|$|The EXP {{was coming}} but Ford hadn't marketed it yet or decided {{what some of}} its details and options would be. A few EXPs were built just for {{conceptual}} design and advertisement. These extremely rare EXPs shared the body style of the EXPs and LN7s to come in 1982 but featured many things that would be available in every EXP or LN7. They were all painted in vibrant colors with black painted across the entire car under the door bumper-lines and had a round silver badge were Ford's blue oval would find itself in 1982. These models particularly stood out as they had dual vents towards {{the front of the}} hood instead of the vents to be later seen on the front bumper clips, lacked bumper strips on the doors, and the rear tai lights were completely red where all the EXPs produced had black around the reverse lights. An SS package and [...] "bubblebacks" [...] -like that of the LN7 and 2nd gen. EXPs- were optional along with black paint around the door windows later seen on 2nd gen. EXPs , aluminum oval-spoke wheels and [...] "1.6L" [...] badges on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b> At least 10 were made in Canada and were all featured in a rare catalog featuring only those cars and people with them. No sightings have been recorded since.|$|R
5000|$|The Fort Worth Police Department uses {{primarily}} sedans as patrol vehicles. All marked patrol {{units are}} painted {{in a traditional}} black-and-white color scheme. Older vehicles exhibit the word [...] "Police" [...] on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> and the rear doors, with the words [...] "Fort Worth" [...] printed in black over an orange-tan longhorn head (the city's logo) on the front doors; newer vehicles place the word [...] "Police" [...] below the longhorn on the front door, and across {{the hood of the}} car in white.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1993, he {{had made}} 21 career starts in NASCAR's Winston Cup (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) series. Running in mid-field during the second lap of the race, Booher's Chevrolet Beretta clipped the left <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> of Carl Horton's Pontiac and went out of control. He then tagged the wall and {{was hit in the}} right front by Rodney White. The {{accident}} caused a brief red flag period before the race was restarted 12 minutes later. White was in critical condition after suffering compression fractures of his vertebrae and was taken to Halifax Medical Center, but he survived and was not paralyzed. Horton was not hurt in the accident. After being taken to the same hospital, the 51-year-old Booher died of massive head and internal injuries.|$|E
50|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
50|$|Though the Mk II has a {{familiar}} look, every {{panel on the}} new car was changed from the previous model. New safety requirements resulted in the overall length increasing by 60 mm, the front end raised and the indicators being repositioned inside the headlight housings. The headlights themselves are now fixed to the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> rather than being integrated with the bonnet, {{so that they are}} not raised up with it when the bonnet opens. The car has a restyled grille and larger rear light clusters. The Cooper S retains the bonnet scoop in order to keep an association with the outgoing model — although the relocation of the intercooler {{to the front of the}} engine means that the scoop is now purely decorative. In addition, the Cooper S no longer has the battery located under the boot floor, instead being found in the more conventional location under the bonnet. The C-pillars are no longer encased in glass and have been shaped to improve aerodynamics and to reduce the tendency for dirt to accumulate on the back of the car. Much criticised for the lack of rear legroom, Mini added more space for rear passengers by creating sculpted cut-outs in the rear of the front seats. An engine start button replaces the conventional ignition key and, with the optional 'Comfort Access', the car may be unlocked with a button on the door handle when the key is brought close to the car.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2010 General Motors and the Indianapolis Motors Speedway {{announced}} limited {{production of}} the Pace Car that was introduced to pace the 2010 Indianapolis 500. The Indianapolis 500 Pace Car replica {{is based on the}} 2010 Camaro 2SS Automatic 400 hp 6.2L V8 model with RS package which includes the Inferno Orange exterior paint scheme with White Diamond rally stripes that run from front {{to the rear of the}} entire body of the car. The event and organization logos of the Indianapolis 500 Speedway are decaled on both driver and passenger doors with special badging placed underneath both <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> of the Camaro nameplate. Special event stitching of the 2010 event replaces the [...] "SS" [...] stitching on the headrests of the front interior seating, with special premium accented floor mats and Inferno Orange accented interior trim kit. The front grille is replaced with the heritage grille that was made available as an aftermarket accessory from GM, with the addition of an Inferno Orange trimmed engine cover. Production was limited to 294 units, the majority of which were produced in automatics and a few had manual transmissions (Mostly Canadian). Out of the 294 units, 50 were sent to the Indianapolis 500 event (Festival cars) which could be seen during Pole Day prior to the event with each darning a license plate reflecting its number from 1-50. 45 other units were sent to Canada and 199 were sent to the 186 top Camaro selling dealerships based upon retail sales in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970 {{model year}} brought new {{front and rear}} end looks to the basic 1968 body, and it {{would prove to be}} another success. Updates {{included}} a new grille, a cloth & vinyl bench seat, hood, <b>front</b> fenders, <b>quarter</b> <b>panels,</b> single-piston Kelsey-Hayes disc brakes (improved from the rather small-rotor Bendix 4 piston calipers of '68 - '69 [...] ), and even non-functional scoops in the rear quarters. The design and functionality of the Air Grabber option was changed. A switch below the dash actuated a vacuum servo to slowly raise the forward-facing scoop, exposing shark-like teeth on either side. [...] "High Impact" [...] colors, with names like In-Violet, Moulin Rouge, and Vitamin C, were options available for that year. The engine lineup was left unchanged although a heavy-duty three-speed manual became the standard transmission, relegating the four-speed to the option list along with the TorqueFlite automatic. This was to be the second and last year of the Road Runner convertible, with only 834 made. The new high-back bucket seats shared with other Chrysler products which featured built-in headrests.|$|R
5000|$|From 1963 to 1970 the Wildcat was its own series, {{no longer}} an Invicta subseries. The 1963 model had a large {{aluminum}} trim panel {{on the side of}} the body that seemed to compete directly with the Oldsmobile Starfire, another full-size [...] "sporty" [...] model by GM. Wildcats built in the 1964 model year did not have the traditional horizontal VentiPorts like other Buicks, but instead had vertically situated chrome hash-marks on the lower <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> directly behind the front wheel housings. After becoming its own full series in 1963, the Wildcat added a convertible and four-door hardtop sedan to the original two-door hardtop coupe introduced in 1962. In the four-door version, a bench seat was standard but the bucket seat and console interior used in the coupe and convertible were optional. In 1964, a pillared four-door sedan was added to the line and two levels of trim were available - standard and custom, with a mid-line deluxe subseries added for 1965 only. From 1966 to 1969, the base (with trim similar to the 1965 Wildcat deluxe) and custom trims were again the sole options.|$|E
5000|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers.

The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.The 1974 models brought further modifications. A 1.6l engine producing 44 HP SAE (50 PS DIN) replaced the previous 1.5l. The front fenders were enlarged, new front turn signals (identical to the ones on American spec Beetles) were added, and round, enlarged taillights were introduced, one year after their appearance on German Beetles (except the 1973 VW 1200). The engine cover remained unchanged, except it no longer had an emblem. Inside, the front seats were re-designed, and the interior colour was changed from gray to black. Also, the front hood release lever was relocated inside the glovebox, as on 1969 and later German Beetles.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 61. The third caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 62 for a two-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Chris Buescher got loose and tapped the left-rear corner of Dale Earnhardt Jr. He got loose, came across the nose of A. J. Allmendinger and sent them both into the wall. Earnhardt continued down the backstretch and spun down the track. Earnhardt said afterwards that he [...] "knew I {{was going to hit}} the wall. The No. 34 (Buescher) just drove into the left <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Oh, man. I don’t know; them restarts and all that. You’ve got a responsibility to try and take care of everybody out there even when you’re three-wide. I’m disappointed in that. But, we had a pretty good car and we were just kind of taking our time, there. And the car was great. So, it’s a shame.” When asked about the wreck from his point of view, Allmendinger said he wasn't “really sure. I think Junior got hit and I was on the outside of him and that was it. It was kind of weird back there. I’m not really sure what kind of car we had. I thought in clean air we weren’t too bad, but I guess a lot of people could say that. Just not a lot of fun racing there.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Marked cruisers are white, with hood, trunk lid, <b>front</b> {{and rear}} <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and bumpers painted navy blue. The words Waterloo Regional Police appear in white {{retroreflective}} text with a navy blue outline. A distinct solid red line curves from the front, {{through to the}} rear of the vehicle, with the motto [...] "People Helping People" [...] and [...] "911" [...] on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> A series of white horizontal stripes appear above and below the curved red stripe. The crest of the police service appears on the rear pillar as well. A Canadian flag in addition to any special designations for the vehicle, such as [...] "Supervisor", [...] "Traffic", [...] "Duty Officer" [...] are displayed on the front fender. On the rear of the cruiser, the text [...] "Waterloo Regional Police" [...] is displayed on the left side of the trunk lid, and the vehicle number and divisional designation (where applicable) on the right side. On the bumper appears the police service website (wrps.on.ca), along with the Crime Stoppers tip-line number encompassed by retroreflective chevrons. Affixed to the roof is a red and blue LED light bar, as well as several antennas for communication and GPS.|$|R
50|$|Ford {{planned to}} {{introduce}} another limited edition Torino {{to once again}} dominate at NASCAR. The result was the 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra. Like the Talladega, the King Cobra was modified with aerodynamics specifically in mind and looked very different from a typical 1970 Torino. It had a sloped front end with dual headlamps located in sugar scoop shaped cut-outs on the front fenders, similar in appearance to the Datsun 240Z. The King Cobra's grille was a large opening below the front bumper, much like the bottom breather design now used in some modern cars. Parking lamps were located between the headlamps, molded into the front fascia. The hoods had a blacked-out center portion, and a side stripe similar to 1968-69 Torino GTs ran from the <b>front</b> fender to <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Ford planned to offer covers for the headlight cutouts to NASCAR teams to improve aerodynamics even further. In actuality it is said the front end created too much down force. In addition to no rear down force creation this caused the car to become very loose in turns as per Musclecar Review.|$|R
2500|$|The Torino model line-up was {{the same}} as 1973, with two exceptions. The Gran Torino Sport no longer was {{available}} with the [...] "Sportsroof" [...] fastback roofline, and the new [...] "Gran Torino Elite" [...] was introduced. The Gran Torino Elite was developed by Ford to help respond to Chevrolet's ever popular Monte Carlo. The Elite, was designed as an entry level [...] "personal luxury" [...] vehicle, for those who couldn't afford a Thunderbird, and was in the same price range as the Monte Carlo. The Elite was described by Ford as [...] " [...] A totally new 2-door hardtop[...].with Thunderbird-inspired styling, solid engineering and personal luxury[...].plus mid-size economy." [...] The Elite wasn't totally new, as Ford described, but it did have a number of unique features. The Elite had unique front sheet metal, with styling that was indeed inspired by the Thunderbird. It had twin headlamps surrounded by chrome bezels and parking lamps on the outer edges of the pointed front fenders. Its grille was large and rectangular arching across the <b>front.</b> The <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and doors were shared with the Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar and did not have the sweeping body line like other Torinos. The tail light panel also featured larger tail lights that ran the full width of the car; the centre portion being non-functional. The Elite came standard with a 351-2V V8 engine, automatic transmission, and radial tires. It also featured standard luxury items such as a vinyl roof, opera windows, split bench seat, [...] "Westminster" [...] cloth upholstery, woodgrain trim, and complete instrumentation.|$|R
5000|$|The current primary Louisiana State Police patrol {{vehicle is}} the Chevrolet Tahoe. The agency began a {{conversion}} to the Tahoe in 2012. Previously, the agency used the Ford Crown Victoria [...] "Police Interceptor." [...] This vehicle {{was the main}} patrol vehicle used by the agency from 1997 to 2011, when it replaced the Chevrolet Caprice in 1996, and when the Crown Victoria was discontinued in 2011. The vehicle's markings include [...] "State Trooper" [...] written on each <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> a state badge {{on the center of}} each front door, the words [...] "Louisiana State Police" [...] written above and below the door badge, and the words [...] "State Police" [...] written on the trunk. Note that the markings on the Tahoe include a slight variation to the previously used designs. In 2012 the coloring on the door badge has been redesigned. It changed from a light blue to a darker blue, with a state seal done differently as well. It is completely different from the prior one used since 1964 except in dimension. The red [...] "LSP" [...] lettering also now has a small dark blue border around each letter. An [...] "ACE" [...] insignia, consisting of a blue State of Louisiana with a red lighting bolt, is awarded to troopers who recover five or more stolen vehicles within a year. Since approximately 2001, a majority of the marked patrol vehicles utilized by this agency have been equipped with onboard video cameras. Other 'marked' patrol vehicles currently used include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the Chevrolet Impala, the Chevrolet Camaro, the Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Caprice, Ford Taurus, and the Dodge Durango. Several other unmarked vehicles in various makes and models are also used for various non-patrol purposes. Police vehicles currently being tested and considered for use include the Dodge Charger. In August 2010, nearly all marked Chevrolet Impala vehicles in inventory were taken out of service, with only a few still in service.|$|E

50|$|A <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> (British English: rear wing) is {{the body}} panel (exterior surface) of an {{automobile}} between a rear door (or only door on each side for two-door models) and the trunk (boot) and typically wraps around the wheel well. The similar front section between {{the door and the}} hood (bonnet), is called a fender, but is sometimes incorrectly also referred to as a <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> <b>Quarter</b> <b>panels</b> are typically made of sheet metal, but are sometimes made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or fiber-reinforced plastic. A <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> is typically a welded-on component of the unibody structure. Replacement of a sheet metal <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded (or sometimes bonded) to the vehicle. Due to the high amount of specialized labor, a <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> may often be repaired rather than replaced by hammering the damaged area to a relatively flat surface and then applying a body filler to smooth out the damaged area to match the original surface. The panel is then usually painted and often clear coated.|$|R
50|$|In current US auto {{industry}} nomenclature, usually only the panels {{over the front}} wheels are called fenders. The {{auto industry}} changed from rear fenders bolted onto a <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> to an enlarged welded-on <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> that fulfilled both functions. This resulted in one piece where there had previously been two, and name of the larger welded piece, the <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> survived the consolidation. <b>Quarter</b> <b>panels</b> are at the rear, with an exception made for dual rear wheel trucks, where the panel at the rear is called a fender. For vehicles with a narrow car body that exposes the tire, the fender is an exposed curve {{over the top of}} the tire. For wide body vehicles that cover the tire, the fender forms the wheel well surrounding the tire, and is not directly visible from above the car body.|$|R
