Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, <b>gender</b> <b>issues,</b> cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} <b>gender</b> <b>issue</b> {{which has}} still become a global discourse within 21 st century. The discourse will always become an actual issue as it constantly emerges from women and community’s consciousness who find strategic discrepancy and injustice, in regard with {{the relation between}} men and women, in which they might lead to relational discrimination, subordination, stereotype, and inequality. The writer, at this point, attempts to bring about comparative analysis between two interpretation paradigms on <b>gender</b> <b>issue</b> promulgated by Nasr Hâmid Abû Zayd and Amina Wadud. Both people share a common academic apprehension when they observe backwardness of the Muslim women in many aspects of life (as a fully human agency) caused by patriarchy tradition, gender injustice, and problem of minority in the Muslim world. This has subsequently caused the two authors to reconstruct methodological paradigm of Quranic exegesis on <b>gender</b> <b>issue</b> in order to generate a just interpretation. They see {{the importance of having}} high social consciousness which properly considers women’s existence based on sacred values of humanity. However, this view faces obstacles from other Muslim scholars as they consider Zayd and Wadud heretics and have conducted what so-called “an intellectual shirk”. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to examine how Swedish newspapers portrayed Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump from a gender perspective during the 2016 {{presidential election}}. We also wanted to analyse how other common political news frames were used to portray Clinton and Trump.   This is a qualitative framing analysis of 14 strategically selected articles, seven that were published by Aftonbladet and seven by Dagens Nyheter. The results showed tendencies of several gendered stereotypes that are being retained by the frames the newspapers use. Frames such as gendered traits and <b>gendered</b> <b>issue</b> emphases, but also game frames were offered to the reader.   We discovered that Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter offered a more positive opinion of Clinton than of Trump. While Clinton was framed as an experienced, emotional and compassionate candidate, Trump was framed as an inexperienced, insensitive and aggressive candidate. Clinton was framed with <b>gendered</b> <b>issue</b> emphases in both the public and private sphere, while Trump was framed with <b>gendered</b> <b>issue</b> emphases in only the public sphere. Furthermore, game frames showed that the newspapers had a tendency of polarizing and personifying the candidates...|$|R

To change this dynamic the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating <b>gender</b> <b>issues</b> in the office to make everyone aware of possible discrimination.|$|E

Decision-making concerning gender in dynamic modeling design is a <b>gender</b> and ethical <b>issue</b> that is important to address regardless of the system in which the dynamic modeling is applied. There are many dynamic modeling tools that operationally include the female population, however, there is an important distinction between females and women; it is the difference between biological sex and the social construct of gender, which is fluid and changes over time and geography. The ethical oversight in failing to represent or misrepresenting gender in model design when it is relevant to the model purpose can have implications for model validity and policy model development. This paper highlights this <b>gender</b> <b>issue</b> in the context of feminist engineering ethics using a dynamic population model. Women are often represented in this type of model only in their biological capacity, while lacking their gender identity. This illustrative example also highlights how language, including the naming of variables and communication with decision-makers, plays a role in this <b>gender</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
