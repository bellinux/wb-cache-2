50|$|These were updated {{versions}} of the 200 type plans 5 & 7 but based on the 700 <b>type</b> <b>telephone.</b> It had a master station which was a 700 <b>type</b> <b>telephone</b> mounted on a plinth with buttons, 'The Planset 625'. The master station and the extension stations could call and {{speak to each other}} and also handle and transfer outside calls. The difference between a Plan 105 and Plan 107 was that the latter had only one extension; the former had two. On plans with the 'A' suffix, conversation between the extension and the exchange was private against the planset. On a Plan 107 both of the long buttons, {{on the front of the}} Planset 625, were connected together. Pressing either would 'buzz' the single extension.|$|R

50|$|This was a 746 <b>type</b> <b>telephone</b> {{which could}} {{transmit}} MF4 signalling, {{also known as}} DTMF touch tones. These telephones could only operate to exchanges that could deal with MF4 but they were used on PABX systems that used MF4 for internal calls from the 1970s. The TXE1 exchange could handle MF4 calls {{as early as the}} late 1960s. This was however a unique prototype exchange, which served customers in Leighton Buzzard: otherwise customers did not have access to MF4 capable exchanges until later models of the TXE4 system came into service in the late 1980s.|$|R

This study compared two attitude scales (a Likert type mail questionnaire and a Semantic Differential <b>type</b> <b>telephone</b> questionnaire) which can be used in the determination of an organisation's image. A comparison of the two scales produced significant results. These results indicate that a Semantic Differential type scale can be used successfully in telephone surveys...|$|R

The two dynamic workstations assessed were the Lifespan Treadmill Desk and the RightAngle LifeBalance Station, and the two conventional workstations assessed were a seated and a standing workstation.

50|$|Originally {{designed}} {{along with}} the panel <b>type</b> <b>telephone</b> office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to dial numbers in manual offices {{the same way they}} dialed numbers in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the manual office, where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware manual office reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of interoffice signaling, PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF push-button telephone services.|$|R
50|$|These were bell {{sets that}} could be used, either stand alone or {{attached}} {{to the base of}} a 232 <b>type</b> <b>telephone</b> or similar, to provide a complete telephone instrument, as Tele. 150s and Tele. 232s did not themselves have an integral telephone circuit or bell. For this reason, although mostly black, they were available in the full range of colours to complement a coloured instrument.All these bellsets appeared identical externally, with a contoured, moulded cover which looked stylish alone, but would dock firmly underneath a 232. They were all based upon the same baseplate but differed in the type of bell and whether this was alone or accompanied by a capacitor, and / or an induction coil and any other telephone circuit components and wiring.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) Injection <b>flushing</b> <b>type</b> control parameters on multi-performance optimization characteristics instead of single performance optimization using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) Method. The experimental control parameters were being optimized {{according to their}} various machining characteristics namely material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR) and surface roughness (SR) using copper as the tool and AISI 304 stainless steel as the workpiece. This parameters optimization was based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array (OA) combined with GRA. A grey relational grade (GRG) calculated based on GRA was used to optimize the EDM process with multiple performance characteristics and Taguchi’s L 18 OA was used to plan the experiments. The machining parameters selected are polarity, pulse on duration, discharge current, discharge voltage, machining depth, machining diameter and dielectric liquid pressure. Results shown that machining performance was improved effectively using this approach. The predicted responses at optimum parameter levels are in good agreement {{with the results of}} confirmation experiments conducted for verification tests...|$|R

50|$|The 5302 {{essentially}} was a 302 telephone {{under a new}} cover. The new {{shell design}} {{was based on the}} 500 design and accommodated the front-to-back shorter model 302 base. As the model 302 had the dial and hook switch mounted on the phone shell, the 5302 accommodated that design, in contrast to the model 500, which had all components mounted on the phone base. Like the 500, the dial also displayed the numbers and letters {{on the outside of the}} finger dial, however, the dial itself was actually the smaller 5H dial from the model 302, relabeled as 5M, or one of newer 6-series dials (6H).

This study aimed to detect and genotype E. bieneusi in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected persons. Stool specimens were collected from 463 HIV-infected patients and analyzed for E. bieneusi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer. E. bieneusi was detected in 77 HIV patients. CD 4 cell counts < 200 cells/µL was associated with E. bieneusi infection (P = 0. 09). E. bieneusi {{was significantly associated with}} weight loss (P < 0. 0001), diarrhea (P = 0. 006), fever (P < 0. 0001), not being married (P < 0. 0001), and <b>flush</b> <b>type</b> of toilet (P = 0. 0007). Six known genotypes of D, A, IV, CAF 2, EbpA, and Peru 8 in 31, 22, 14, 2, 1, and 1 patients, respectively, five novel genotypes of E. bieneusi, and one infection with mixed genotypes were observed in this study. Three of the novel genotypes were genetically distant to the genotypes commonly found in humans...|$|R
