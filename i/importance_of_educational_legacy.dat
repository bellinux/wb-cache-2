The first aspect takes into consideration the delicateness of the resources the management deals with- that is children and youth. This aspect complicates the process of management itself, aspects of art and style being widely spread, without harming though, the components of scientific management. The second peculiar aspect <b>of</b> the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Management refers to the estimation of failures. The features <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Management derive from the basic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>educational</b> activity. In the teaching process, more often {{than in any other}} fields, we deal with a combination of scientific data and information about art and culture. We can talk about a specific informational structure of the management decisions. The high level of complexity, the multifunctional educational activities result in the growth of risks, which requires increased carefulness on the behalf of the managers. Another feature <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> Management roots in the fact that not only teachers but managers as well deal with children (as growing personalities).
