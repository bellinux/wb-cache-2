40|$|Graduation date: 2014 People {{will spend}} {{a large amount}} of their {{lifetime}} indoors where the air is filled with both indoor and outdoor allergens. Exposure to allergens can have a range of effects on the health of building occupants. Textiles make up a vast majority of the surfaces, such as draperies, sofas, pillows, and carpeting that are found in an indoor space. Many of the textile surfaces are often covered by allergens due to their tendency to attract allergens which can exacerbate the symptoms of people suffering from allergies. The purposes of this study were to determine if there is a relationship between fabric parameters such as electrostatic charge and moisture regain on the attraction of timothy grass pollen and to determine if various fabric treatments affect their allergen attraction. Twelve fabrics were exposed to differing amounts of Timothy grass pollen and tested for electrostatic cling, and moisture regain. For the pollen exposure procedure, <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> were exposed to varying amounts of pollen by repeated turning of a glass cylinder. Fabric electrostatic cling was measured by following AATCC (115, 2005) Fabric to Metal cling test. Moisture regain for <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> was measured by following ASTM D 2495 - 07 (2009) and D 1576 - 90 (2008). Acidic acid (vinegar), basic (ammonia), and fabric softener, were used to determine if these treatments caused any changes of pollen counts on the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> tested. The results from this study showed that there was no consistent linear relationship between electrostatic charge or moisture regain with pollen count on any of the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> tested. Across all trials and treatments, the untreated group had the highest average pollen count followed by group that was treated with fabric softener, then basic (ammonia), and finally acidic acid (vinegar). When looking at individual fiber, wool <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> had the lowest pollen count across the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> while nylon <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> had the highest pollen counts in all the treatments with the exception of basic (ammonia) treated polyester <b>fabric</b> <b>samples.</b> As for the treatments, the acidic acid (vinegar) treatment on all <b>fabric</b> <b>samples</b> resulted in the least amount of pollen attached to the <b>fabric</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{problems}} encountered by clothing merchandisers in managing <b>fabric</b> <b>sample</b> resources, and analyses their expectations of and requirements for a desirable management solution. It then aims to consider the architectural design of an intelligent <b>fabric</b> <b>sample</b> management system prototype, and the development of a construction and implementation plan for a fashion enterprise to install the system. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage methodological approach is adopted. The first stage is a preliminary study using in-depth interviews with potential system users; the second involves the architectural design of a five-component system prototype; and the third develops a multi-phase construction and implementation plan using a case study. Findings: Four categories of problems in the management of <b>fabric</b> <b>sample</b> resources are identified, the system architecture is designed, and a construction and implementation plan is proposed. Managerial and theoretical implications are also discussed. Practical implications: The design process of the research and development (R&D) framework enables fashion enterprises to obtain a deeper understanding of their operations in managing fabric samples and to make wiser decisions in resource allocation. By taking the specific needs of system users into consideration, system solution developers are able to design tailor-made software packages that are intelligent, user-friendly and user-oriented. Originality/value: Through a logical and systematic process of designing the R&D framework, the paper identifies some "technological rules" which links up the practice of solving an industrial problem with the formulation of substantive theories.
