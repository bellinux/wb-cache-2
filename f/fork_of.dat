5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East <b>Fork</b> <b>of</b> the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Besides these distributions, {{there are}} some {{independent}} operating systems based on FreeBSD. DragonFly BSD is a fork from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy than the one chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some microkernel features. It does not aim to stay compatible with FreeBSD and has huge differences in the kernel and basic userland. MidnightBSD is a <b>fork</b> <b>of</b> FreeBSD 6.1 borrowing heavily from NeXTSTEP, particularly in the user interface department.|$|E

It intensified further into a violent EF4 in northeastern Walker County, as it completely leveled a site-built home and obliterated two nearby mobile homes.
