40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have suggested}} that flickering aurora is produced by a modulation of the field-aligned component of the electron flux within an auroral arc. It is proposed that {{a portion of the}} field-aligned electrons are of ionospheric origin and that these electrons are accelerated and their flux modulated by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves that occur below the main acceleration region on auroral arc field lines. A model of the electromagnetic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>wave</b> shows that the parallel phase velocity of the wave increase as the wave propagates toward the ionosphere. A test particle calculation shows that ionospheric electrons trapped or reflected by the wave are accelerated to energies of several keV and that their flux is modulated at the wave frequency. The relative amplitudes of the model wave electric fields are consistent with the observations of small-scale low-frequency ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields near auroral arcs of approximately 10 mV/m and 100 mV/m, respectively. The large-amplitude ion cyclotron waves also produce a ponderomotive force and a self-consistent ambipolar electric field.

30|$|The {{possible}} {{cause of the}} precipitation of energetic electrons is discussed as follows. The possible pitch angle scattering of energetic electrons >[*] 100  keV from the inner magnetosphere is generally attributed to either electromagnetic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> or chorus waves (e.g., Miyoshi et al. 2008, 2015). However, the Arase satellite did not observe electromagnetic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> or chorus waves. In general, electromagnetic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> should {{be found in the}} equatorial region. By contrast, the resonance energy of chorus waves depends on the off-equatorial magnetic latitude in the magnetosphere, and even MeV electrons can precipitate into the atmosphere when the chorus waves propagate at higher latitudes (Horne and Thorne 2003; Miyoshi et al. 2015). It is also possible that during this particular event the Arase satellite was not in the correct position to observe the chorus wave activity. Meredith et al. (2012) conducted a statistical survey of chorus waves using multiple satellites and found that between magnetic latitudes of 15 °– 30 ° on the nightside, chorus intensities drop off significantly compared to those in the equatorial region. Chorus waves that reach higher latitudes were found to be restricted to dayside.

40|$|During {{the grant}} period from August 1, 1994 to October 31, 1995 we have {{continued}} to investigate the effects of plasma wave instabilities on the early stage plasmaspheric refilling. Since ion beams are the primary feature of the interhemispheric plasma flows during the early stage refilling, ion-beam driven instabilities and associated waves are of primary interest. The major findings of this research are briefly summarized here. After a systematic examination of the relevant plasma instabilities, we realized that when the interhemispheric plasma flows begin to interpenetrate at the equator, the most relevant plasma instability is the electrostatic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>wave</b> instability. Only at later stages the ion-acoustic instability may be affecting the plasma flow. An interesting property of the electrostatic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>wave</b> is that it heats ions perpendicular to the magnetic field. When the ions in the field-aligned flows are transversely heated, they are trapped in the magnetic flux tube, thus affecting the refilling process. The eic wave instability is a microprocess with scale length {{of the order of}} ion Larmor radius and the corresponding time scale is the ion cyclotron period. We have attempted to tackle the problem for the plasmaspheric refilling by incorporating the effects of eic wave instability on the mesoscale plasma flow when the properties of the latter exceeds the critical conditions for the former.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we study impact of the photospheric 5 -minute {{oscillations}} on the <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> in the solar wind. We proceed from {{the assumption that the}} <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> in solar wind are experiencing modulation with a characteristic period of 5 minutes under the influence of Alfven waves driven by photospheric motions. The theory presented in our paper predicts a deep frequency modulation of the <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves.</b> The frequency modulation is expected mainly from variations in orientation of the IMF lines. In turn, the variations in orientation are caused by the Alfven waves, propagating from the Sun. To test the theoretical predictions we have analyzed records of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) geoelectromagnetic waves in order to find the permanent quasi-monochromatic oscillations of natural origin in the Pc 1 - 2 frequency band (0. 1 - 5 Hz), the carrier frequency of which varies with time in a wide range. As a result we found the so-called "serpentine emission" (SE), which was observed in Antarctic at the Vostok station near the South Geomagnetic Pole. The permanency, range of frequencies, and the deep frequency modulation of SE correspond to the qualitative properties of <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> in the solar wind. Clearly expressed 5 -minute modulation of the carrier frequency is particularly important feature of the SE {{in the context of this}} work.

It is found that Pc 1 pulsations having a patch-like structure were detected at Cambridge Bay in the cusp region near local noon, but were not observed at Fort Smith in the auroral region. On the other hand, during the period from 1300 to 1500 local time (LT) Pc 1 pulsations showing rising frequency with time appeared at Fort Smith in the sub-cleft region, while Pc 1 pulsations having rather stationary frequency were observed simultaneously at Cambridge Bay in the polar cusp region. After 1500 LT, the patch-like Pc 1 pulsations disappeared at Cambridge Bay.

The model also correctly reproduces the previous kinetic results in that only electrons are accelerated (along the background magnetic field), while ions do not accelerate substantially. We also investigate how E_|| generation is affected by the mass ratio and found that amplitude attained by E_|| decreases linearly as inverse of the mass ratio m_i/m_e, i. e. E_|| ∝ 1 /m_i. This result contradicts to the earlier suggestion by Genot et al (1999, 2004) that the cause of E_|| generation is the polarisation drift of the driving wave, which scales as ∝ m_i. Also, for realistic mass ratio of m_i/m_e= 1836 our empirical scaling law is producing E_||= 14 V/m (for solar coronal parameters). Comment: New J. Phys. (final, accepted version...|$|E
