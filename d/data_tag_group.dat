To enable reliable tag inventories, we put forward the concept of RFID <b>tag</b> <b>grouping,</b> i. e., logically coupling tags thus forming a consistent <b>group.</b> <b>Tag</b> <b>grouping</b> allows to identify missing tags by reading only {{a subset of the}} group, with no need to external information systems. In this paper, we introduce EraRFID, an erasure coding approach for RFID <b>tag</b> <b>grouping.</b> EraRFID models RFID tag inventorying as an erasure coding problem, and solves this problem using the well-known Reed Solomon (RS) codes. The efficiency of EraRFID in terms of timeliness and storage overhead is validated through experimental studies...|$|R

30|$|<b>Data</b> <b>tagging</b> {{is another}} way to semantically index the input data corpus. However, it should not be {{confused}} with semantic indexing as discussed in the prior section. In semantic indexing, the focus is on using the Deep Learning abstract representations directly for data indexing purposes. Here the abstract data representations are considered as features for performing the discriminative task of <b>data</b> <b>tagging.</b> This <b>tagging</b> on <b>data</b> can also be used for data indexing as well, but the primary idea here is that Deep Leaning makes it possible to tag massive amounts of data by applying simple linear modeling methods on complicated features that were extracted by Deep Learning algorithms. The remainder of this section focuses largely on some results from using Deep Leaning for discriminative tasks that involve <b>data</b> <b>tagging.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>Tags</b> are strings used in {{journals}} {{to indicate}} {{the origin of the}} archival data and to enable the reader to recover the data. The NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) has recently introduced a new approach to production of <b>data</b> <b>tags</b> and recovery of data from them. Many of the data access services at the IRSA return filtered data sets (such as subsets of source catalogs) and dynamically created products (such as image cutouts); these dynamically created products are not saved permanently at the archive. Rather than <b>tag</b> the <b>data</b> sets from which the query result sets are drawn, the archive tags the query that generates the results. A single tag can, then, encode a complex dynamic data set and simplifies the embedding of tags in manuscripts and journals. By logging user queries and all the parameters for those query as <b>Data</b> <b>Tags,</b> IRSA can re-create the query and rerun the IRSA service using the same search parameters used when the <b>Data</b> <b>Tag</b> was created. At the same time, the logs give a simple count of the actual numbers of queries made to the archive, a powerful metric of archive usage unobtainable from the Apache web server logs. Currently, IRSA creates tags for queries to more than 20 data sets, including the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) and Spitzer Space Telescope Legacy <b>Data</b> Sets. These <b>tags</b> are returned by the spatial query engine, Atlas. IRSA plans to create tags for queries to the rest of its services in late Spring 2007. The archive provides a simple web interface which recovers a data set that corresponds to the input <b>data</b> <b>tag.</b> Archived <b>data</b> sets may evolve in time due to improved calibrations or augmentations to the data set. IRSA’s query based approach guarantees that users always receive the best available data sets...|$|R

Using juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (range, 73 – 97 mm FL), we compared instantaneous growth rates and survival among three experimental groups: control, surgery with no tag, and surgery with tag.

Growth rate for the <b>tagged</b> <b>group</b> was lower for the first two 10 -d measurement intervals; however, during the third 10 -d interval, growth rates for tagged fish equaled or exceeded values for the other groups.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} two different sizes of surgically implanted transmitters on the buoyancy compensation of juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. We determined buoyancy by measuring the density of fish with a filled air bladder in graded salinity baths. In addition, we examined the effect of pressure changes on buoyancy by measuring the pressure reduction (P-R) at which fish became neutrally buoyant. We found {{no significant difference between}} the density of control and <b>tagged</b> <b>groups,</b> indicating that fish were able to compensate for the transmitter by filling their air bladders. However, both <b>groups</b> of <b>tagged</b> fish had significantly lower P-R than control fish. Regression analysis of fish density on P-R indicated that density of the <b>tagged</b> <b>groups</b> changed at a higher rate than that of the controls. As a result, tagged fish attained neutral buoyancy with less pressure reduction even though the <b>tagged</b> and control <b>groups</b> exhibited similar densities. This relation was confirmed by using Boyle 2 ̆ 7 s law to simulate buoyancy changes with change in depth. Although fish compensated for the transmitter, changes in depth affected the buoyancy of tagged fish more than that of untagged fish. Reduced buoyancy at depth may affect the behavior and physiology of tagged juvenile salmonids, and researchers should be aware of this potential bias in telemetry data. In addition, there was little difference in P-R or the slope of the density -P-R regression lines between <b>tagged</b> <b>groups.</b> This was caused by the small difference in excess mass (i. e., weight in water) of the two transmitters. Thus, although two transmitters may not weigh the same, their effects on buoyancy may be similar depending on the excess mass. [References: 28...|$|R
