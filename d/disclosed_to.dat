5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> us.|$|E

40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) {{experience}} significant discrimination within American society. As a result of discrimination, MSM are at elevated risk for a number of health problems, such as substance use. MSM do not always <b>disclose</b> sexual identity/behavior <b>to</b> health care providers. Non-disclosure to medical providers can negatively impact health for MSM, such as elevated risk for contracting HIV. Reasons for non-disclosure include fear of provider rejection and perceived provider discomfort with discussing sexuality. The purpose of the present study is to examine factors that influence disclosure to medical providers. Eighty-seven participants were recruited through social media and LGBT-friendly organizations. These participants completed a quasi-experimental study of factors that influence disclosure/non-disclosure. These participants endorsed <b>disclosing</b> <b>to</b> primary care physicians and not <b>disclosing</b> <b>to</b> dentists most frequently. In addition, participants who <b>disclose</b> <b>to</b> providers in general endorsed more reasons <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> than not <b>to</b> <b>disclose.</b> However, participants who did not disclose in general did not report more reasons <b>to</b> not <b>disclose</b> than <b>to</b> <b>disclose.</b> Across different types of providers, the majority of participants indicated they <b>disclosed</b> due <b>to</b> perceived need for the provider to know sexual orientation/same-sex behavior. These findings provide insight into multiple factors that influence disclosure and non-disclosure to different types of health care providers...|$|R

5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> the market issues with the rate of return {{it was going to}} achieve on some of its timber investments. During parliamentary committee inquiries, these allegations were extended to the possibility that the auditors had been misled. It was also noted that, at the time that difficulties were emerging for Great Southern, its CEO sold some of his shares {{at the top of the}} companies' fortunes for $32.6 million.|$|E
5|$|In Erdely's story, Jackie <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall the {{identity}} of her date to the fraternity party {{and said that he}} was the ringleader of the rape. Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were pictures taken from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.|$|E

Once these were completed, Friley brought in Harold V. Gaskill, the Dean of Science, as the Ames Project's administrator. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took control of the Manhattan Project in June 1942, and the Ames Project in late 1942.|$|E

Following the left-winged Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet's victory in the 2005 parliamentary election, the new Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, announced {{that there would be no}} more public tenders in the railway sector. The government stated that experience from Sweden and the United Kingdom showed that employees rights and safety was reduced after privatization was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} in {{the last}} week of August had <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> Eighth Army a large amount of North Korean activity behind the lines opposite the US 2nd and 25th Divisions {{in the southern part of}} the Pusan Perimeter. The North Koreans had built three new underwater bridges across the Nam River in front of the 35th Infantry in the 25th Division sector. Aerial bombing only temporarily and partially destroyed these bridges, and they were repaired overnight. Eighth Army intelligence credited the North Koreans with having moved one or two new divisions and about 20 tanks to the Hyopch'on area on the west side of the Naktong River opposite the US 2nd Division. However, the US intelligence overestimated the strength of these divisions. On August 28 the Eighth Army intelligence officer warned that a general offensive may be expected at any time along the 2nd Division and 25th Division front aimed at severing the Taegu-Pusan railroad and highway and capturing Masan.|$|E

5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during court proceedings, otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> the Gaming Board. Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} {{did not have a}} right to occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

40|$|Background: Though the {{prevalence}} of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) remains high in less developed countries, data suggest that these figures may represent an underestimation considering that many women are unwilling <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> abuse. This paper aims to determine women’s willingness to report abuse, factors determining willingness <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> IPV, and <b>to</b> whom such disclosure is made. Methods: A total of 911 women visiting reproductive health facility responded to the questionnaire, and the collected data was analyzed using multivariate analysis. Results: About 54 % (n= 443) of the participating women reported that would not disclose IPV. Among those willing <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> abuse, 68 % (n= 221) would opt <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> <b>to</b> close relatives in contrast to 37 % (n= 103) who would <b>disclose</b> <b>to</b> some form of institutions (i. e. religious leaders, law enforcement officers). Ethnicity, woman’s own use of alcohol and autonomy in decision making such as having a say on household purchases, money use and visitation, independently predicted willingness <b>to</b> <b>disclose</b> IPV...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be <b>disclosed</b> <b>to</b> an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E
