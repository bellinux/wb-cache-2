5|$|In 1972, Ochs {{was asked}} to write the theme song for the film Kansas City Bomber. The task proved <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> Ochs {{struggled}} to overcome his writer's block. Although his song was not used in the soundtrack, it was released as a single.|$|E
5|$|Raising six {{children}} by herself exhausted Shabazz. Providing for them was <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> well. Shabazz's {{share of the}} royalties from The Autobiography of MalcolmX was equivalent to an annual salary. In 1966, she sold the movie rights to the Autobiography to film-maker Marvin Worth. She began to authorize the publication of MalcolmX's speeches, which provided another source of income.|$|E
5|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the mushroom-forming genera (marked with * below) can be less obvious or absent in tropical species. Distinguishing between Lactarius and Lactifluus based on morphology alone is quite <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> clear synapomorphies for both genera {{have yet to be}} identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because Lactifluus is not yet recognised as a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|Technology plays a very {{important}} role in the strategy of the game. As a civilization progresses through the ages, technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them <b>difficult.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources can make the difference between victory and defeat.|$|E
5|$|The diets of {{the wealthy}} were rich in sugars, which {{promoted}} periodontal disease. Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies {{of many of the}} upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence. Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> about one-third of the population died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The least {{expensive}} anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around $5USD a year. The World Health Organization {{gives it a}} first-line recommendation {{in the developing world}} and it is commonly used there. Access however may be <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> some countries label it as a controlled drug.|$|E

5|$|Bramatyo {{cast his}} wife, Zaskia Adya Mecca, as Ahmad Dahlan's wife Siti Walidah— Mecca {{also served as}} casting director, in charge of auditioning the {{supporting}} cast. Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not {{know much about the}} couple. However, she found such research <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> the libraries did not have the information she needed.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> some of the route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E

5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli left {{much of the}} {{detailed}} work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using gunpowder to bring down the surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder was not easy to control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is <b>difficult,</b> <b>as</b> mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were as <b>difficult</b> <b>as</b> {{the most challenging}} roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E
