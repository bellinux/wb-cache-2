25|$|Doug Walters {{went to the}} wicket when Australia's total {{stood at}} 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of {{congratulations}} from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, {{was alone in the}} room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you doing}} back here? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get out tonight'...|$|E
500|$|Irataba {{was away}} at Fort Yuma during {{the attack on}} the settlers, and upon hearing of it he scolded the Mohave. Chooksa homar participated in the events and {{reported}} that Irataba told the warriors, [...] "I hear you fought, though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to.</b> And you will have war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [...] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." [...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, {{praying that}} Amahl {{not become a}} beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), {{there is a knock}} at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You A Real King?"; [...] "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, <b>I</b> <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>Not</b> <b>To</b> Be A Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying [...] "They kept asking me questions," [...] when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; [...] "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; [...] "Emily! Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E
60|$|RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> go with drunken goy ever. So {{you catch}} no money.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Vickers trembled with wrath. [...] "How {{dare you}} go into public-houses after <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to?" [...] she demanded, {{stamping}} her foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to," [...] said Steve. [...] "Let this be {{a warning}} to <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to try and teach lessons to people wot don’t want ’em." ...|$|R
60|$|I said I'd do my best, didn't I? And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> worry.|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{worry about}} me and George. I ran away from him once--I guess I won't {{have to do it}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Violets! Oh, and spring! Daren, it {{was good}} of you to gather them for me. I remember.... But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't. Before {{you came}} it was different. He {{used to make}} fun of the people--used to imitate Lagune and make me laugh. It seemed a sort of joke." [...] She stopped abruptly. [...] "Why did you ever come on with me? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to--you know <b>I</b> did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want any, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> before <b>not</b> {{to speak}} to me!" [...] {{she said in a}} low voice, and the tears almost came into her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "The water might last if {{all goes}} well," [...] the mate said, [...] "but {{if we were to}} get {{becalmed}} for some time, which is likely enough in these latitudes, we should be in an awkward fix. I shall keep a sharp look-out on shore, never fear. The distance to the spring is, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>not</b> above fifty yards, and I will keep half the men filling and the other half on guard. If they should mean mischief we will give it them hot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I believe,' she said, 'I {{was rude}} just now when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk. I am sorry for it; I shall know better next time.' ...|$|E
60|$|BEATRICE. To the Crossway Hotel, miles out--in my own name. They don't know me there. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hope, Michael. I've done my best; I swear it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't. You fell {{because you}} {{let go of}} my hand and bent too far forward. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do that. So that it was your own fault." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was <b>not</b> interested, and I beg you to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet, I {{believe that}} I had a mission, and that mission has been fulfilled. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not,</b> before; but <b>I</b> tell you now, for your comfort, what {{happened}} between me and Titus--but I wish not {{that it should be}} <b>told</b> to others. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> fought with him; and that, being wounded and insensible, I was carried into his tent--but that was not all. When we fought, although sorely wounded, I sprang upon him and we fell to the ground, I uppermost. I drew my knife, and would have slain him; when the Lord put a thought into my mind, and I called upon him to swear that he would spare the Temple.|$|R
60|$|Guess again. Perhaps it {{was there}} always, from the {{beginning}} of the world? My dear child, you have no proof of that either. Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> that Madam How had made the glen, but that she was making it, and as yet has only half finished. That is my first guess; and my next guess is that water is making the glen--water, and nothing else.|$|R
6000|$|She roused {{herself to}} her duties as nurse. [...] "What are you doing? Why {{are you trying to}} sit up? Sit down! Don't touch your bandages. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Taffy,' said Tegumai, 'how {{often have}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> use slang? [...] "Awful" [...] isn't a pretty word, {{but it could}} be a convenience, now you mention it, if we could write home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk to {{me about}} her, John: <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should {{associate}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Andre-Louis, with a grimace. [...] "You hurt me, monsieur. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to push against me." [...] He {{raised his}} voice that all might hear him, and once more impelled M. de Chabrillane back into the rain.|$|R
60|$|Aldo. Look you now, son Woodall, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was <b>not</b> mistaken; my rascal's in town, with {{a vengeance}} to him.|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA (cutting {{her short}} despotically). Have <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to deny things? You {{would spend the}} day calling your father's gods to witness to your virtues if I let you. Go take the bribe; and bring in Pothinus. (Ftatateeta is about to reply.) Don't answer me. Go.|$|R
6000|$|BEATRICE. I know. It's cruel--it's horrible. But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hope, Michael. I've done my best. All {{these months}} at Mentone, I've been {{wondering}} why I ever let you marry me--when that feeling wasn't dead! ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham had a woman's {{passion for}} fixing responsibility; {{she could not}} help saying, as soon as acquitted, [...] "I warned you against him, Silas. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let him get in any deeper with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary! Mary! come {{directly}} {{back into}} the path. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{go out of the}} path, and you are a very naughty child to disobey me. The next time you disobey me in that way I will send you directly home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to {{understand}} that you cannot come back here. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> wish to sell you a pistol, and that ought to be enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] Wrayson said, [...] "I {{may just}} as well warn you that I think {{you are going to}} be disappointed. I am almost certain that I know the {{contents}} of that packet. You will find that it consists, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> before, <b>not</b> of securities at all, but simply a few old letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently, when I {{had marked}} a Prayer Book for him, he said, [...] "And may I ask that the--the craving <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of may <b>not</b> come on so intolerably?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter," [...] {{a shrill}} voice cried {{from inside the}} house, [...] "how often have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be gossiping on public affairs with strangers? Your tongue will cost you your head presently, as I have told you a score of times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{things are}} not good for any thing, child," [...] said her mother. [...] "They are nothing but common weeds and trash. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> run about so much. Why can't you come and walk quietly along the path, like a {{sensible}} person?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's marked," [...] Ethel answered. [...] "But we are old friends, Andrew; {{follow your}} own bent, {{stick to your}} guns. Whatever plans you have {{determined}} on will be fair. Once before <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be daunted; but {{it strikes me that}} you need less encouragement now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How often," [...] said Mactavish, {{going up}} {{to him with a}} look of annoyance--"how often have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> Mr Somerville, <b>not</b> to leave an entry half {{finished}} on any account!" ...|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD (drily). <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> were <b>not</b> in {{a strong}} position, Captain Brassbound. (Looking implacably at him.) You are laid by the heels, my friend, as I said you would be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> he was <b>not</b> at {{the place}} of meeting,' De Stancy replied. And taking from his pocket the bag of ready money he placed it intact upon the table.|$|R
