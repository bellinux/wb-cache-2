5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the duel, Parlement awarded Carrouges a further six {{thousand}} livres <b>in</b> <b>gold</b> <b>and</b> a position within the Royal Household.

Count Pierre, who held the land, never forgave Carrouges the death of his favourite, and held the estates from him in court.|$|E
5|$|Born in Mühlheim am Main in the German Empire, Weissenberger, who {{had been}} a glider pilot in his youth, volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich in 1936. Following flight training, he was posted to the heavy fighter {{squadron}} of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing) in 1941. He claimed his first aerial victory over Norway on 24 October 1941. After 23 aerial victories as heavy fighter pilot, he received the German Cross <b>in</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>and</b> was then posted to Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG 5—5th Fighter Wing) in September 1942. There he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 13 November 1942 after 38 aerial victories.|$|E

5|$|The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, on the Ganges, {{is one of}} the 12 Jyotirlinga Shiva temples in Varanasi. The temple {{has been}} {{destroyed}} and rebuilt several times throughout its existence. The Gyanvapi Mosque, which is adjacent to the temple, is the original site of the temple. The temple, which is also known as the Golden Temple, was built in 1780 by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore. The two pinnacles of the temple are covered <b>in</b> <b>gold</b> <b>and</b> were donated in 1839 by Ranjit Singh, the ruler of Punjab. The dome is scheduled to receive gold plating through a proposed initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs of Uttar Pradesh. Numerous rituals, prayers, and aartis are held daily at the temple between 02:30 and 23:00.|$|E
5|$|With the patriation in 1988 of {{oversight}} of heraldry from the UK to Canada through the Canadian Heraldic Authority, {{the constitution of}} the Order of Canada was amended to include the entitlement of all inductees to petition the Chief Herald of Canada for personal armorial bearings (coats of arms), should they not already possess any. Companions may receive supporters, and all members may have the escutcheon (shield) of their arms encircled with a red ribbon bearing the order's motto <b>in</b> <b>gold,</b> <b>and</b> from which is suspended a rendition of the holder's Order of Canada badge. The Queen, Sovereign of the Order of Canada, approved the augmentation of her royal arms for Canada with the order's ribbon in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into {{articles}} by generation. All 805Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced {{at the time of their}} respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100species introduced <b>in</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>and</b> Silver in addition to the original 151species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is a notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokedex and is also uniquely numbered as number 0.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 he left Romania {{and joined}} the Waffen-SS as a SS-Standartenführer (colonel) under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. Seeing action on the Eastern Front as a regimental {{commander}} with the SS Motorised Division Wiking, he later raised and commanded the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, raised the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), and commanded the V SS Mountain Corps. Units under his command committed many crimes against the civilian population of the Independent State of Croatia, Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and Italian governorate of Montenegro. His final appointment was as plenipotentiary general in south Siebenbürgen and the Banat, during which he organised the evacuation of the Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) of Siebenbürgen to the Reich. In addition to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, Phleps was awarded the German Cross <b>in</b> <b>Gold,</b> <b>and</b> after {{he was killed in}} September 1944, he was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with a portrait of the emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only the topmost carved knots <b>in</b> <b>gold,</b> <b>and</b> the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: he carried the emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse when he left the palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E

5|$|Lochner is {{associated}} with three surviving books of hours; in Darmstadt, Berlin and Anholt. The extent of his association in each is debated; workshop members were probably heavily involved in their production. The most famous is the early 1450s Prayer book of Stephan Lochner now at Darmstadt; the others are the Berlin Book of Prayers of c. 1444, and the Anholt Prayerbook, completed in the 1450s. The manuscripts are very small (Berlin: 9.3cm x 7cm, Darmstadt: 10.7cm x 8cm, Anholt: 9cm x 8cm) and similar in layout and colourisation and are each extensively decorated <b>in</b> <b>gold</b> <b>and</b> blue. The borders are ornamented in bright colours and contain acanthus scrolls, gold foliage, flowers, berry-like fruits and round pods. The Darmstadt book includes a complete cycle of the Martyrdom of the Apostles. Its illustrations contain Lochner's characteristic application of deep blue, reminiscent of his Virgin in the Rose Garden.|$|E
5|$|Most {{taxes were}} due on {{each year on}} 1 September, and levied from {{individual}} landowners by decuriones (decurions). These decurions, analogous to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect. Diocletian's reforms also {{increased the number of}} financial officials in the provinces: more rationales and magistri privatae are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected taxes <b>in</b> <b>gold,</b> <b>and</b> the Imperial properties. Fluctuations {{in the value of the}} currency made collection of taxes in kind the norm, although these could be converted into coin. Rates shifted to take inflation into account. In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of capita and iuga.|$|E
5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. <b>In</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>and</b> Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
