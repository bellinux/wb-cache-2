5|$|Aristotle further {{noted that}} there are many bird forms within the bird kind – cranes, eagles, crows, bustards, sparrows, and so on, just as there are many forms of fishes within the fish kind. He {{sometimes}} called these atomon eidos, indivisible forms. <b>Human</b> <b>is</b> one of these indivisible forms: Socrates {{and the rest of us}} are all different individually, but we all have human form.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} <b>human</b> <b>is</b> 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

50|$|In the game, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> {{a fallen}} tribe. The lives of <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> not {{affluent}} and stable. As a result, {{they have no}} choice but to do whatever they can even if it means doing something immoral or illegal. <b>Humans</b> <b>are</b> described as smart, reckless, wicked and go-getting.|$|R
5|$|Yumemi is very {{adamant about}} {{protecting}} humans and is happiest {{when she is}} helping those she serves. When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing {{him or her to}} someone who can. Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no <b>human</b> <b>is</b> harmed when in her care.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one <b>human</b> <b>is</b> playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E

5000|$|Humans - Humans {{occur in}} all colors but occur {{predominantly}} {{in white and}} green.

This is the first set in which <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> treated as a tribe.|$|R
50|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>are</b> {{accidental}} hosts because adult worms cannot reach maturity in {{the heart}} or in the skin.

25|$|Examples of poor {{definition}} are {{the statements}} a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> an animal, {{combined with the}} statement that apes and reptiles are animals. If those statements are reversed, then animal is human, and so it is that the syllogism apes and reptiles are human results in a logical fallacy. A further example: if a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> a two-eyed animal, then a syllogism can result in the fallacy a buffalo is also human.|$|E
25|$|When endeavouring {{to solve}} a problem humans at an early age show {{determination}} while chimpanzees have no comparable facial expression.

25|$|Mitochondrial {{transcription}} in <b>Human</b> <b>is</b> initiated {{from three}} promoters, H1, H2, and L (heavy strand 1, heavy strand 2, and light strand promoters).

25|$|According to Ehrman, a more {{important}} difference among the Gospels is with the book of John. He argues that the concept that Jesus existed before his birth, was a divine being, and became <b>human</b> <b>is</b> only claimed in the Gospel of John. However, most scholars disagree, locating pre-existent and divine Christology within the Pauline epistles and synoptic gospels.|$|E
30|$|As {{outlined}} in Figure  1, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> {{an essential part}} of the urban water cycle and water treatment aims at avoiding or minimizing the exposure of humans to OMP via drinking water. However, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> exposed to chemicals in many ways, e.g. in their homes, at work or via food. Human biomonitoring by means of OMP measurements in urine samples provides information on the extent to which <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> exposed to chemicals. Monitoring of human urine also indicates to which extent <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> a source of OMP found in municipal wastewater. For <b>human</b> biomonitoring, it <b>is</b> essential to consider also metabolites of OMP as recently shown for trialkyl phosphates[48].|$|R

25|$|Theistic schools {{believe in}} cycles of creations where souls gravitate to {{specific}} bodies {{in accordance with}} karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a worm, insect, fish, bird, lion, boar, snake or a <b>human,</b> <b>is</b> determined by a person's deeds and knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Alphavirus {{infections are}} spread by insect vectors such as mosquitoes. Once a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> bitten by the {{infected}} mosquito, the virus can gain {{entry into the}} bloodstream, causing viremia. The alphavirus can also get into the CNS where {{it is able to}} grow and multiply within the neurones. This can lead to encephalitis, which can be fatal.|$|E
50|$|Except in {{rare cases}} where {{infected}} <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> eaten by canines, <b>humans</b> <b>are</b> a dead-end or incidental host (an intermediate host that does not allow transmission to the definitive host) for E. multilocularis.|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} {{appears to be a}} result of misapplying PVHO (pressure vessel for human occupancy) guidelines which prescribe a maximum ambient oxygen content of 25% when a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> sealed into a pressure vessel (chamber).

25|$|Jains {{believe that}} every <b>human</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} {{for his or her}} actions and all living beings have an eternal soul, jiva.

The Jain view of karma is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.|$|E
25|$|Another {{dangerous}} situation {{is when a}} <b>human</b> <b>is</b> faced with a hungry bear that has lost its natural fear of humans. With the decrease of hunting grounds and food crops such as berries and bark, bears often become more desperate and aggressive. However, this hunger has also triggered an unexpected reaction: bears began to follow gunfire because they associate it with dead animals that they can eat.|$|E
