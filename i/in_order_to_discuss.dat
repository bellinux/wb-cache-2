5|$|In September 1786, at the Annapolis Convention, {{delegates from}} five states {{called for a}} Constitutional Convention <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> {{possible}} improvements to the Articles of Confederation. The Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787. Rhode Island, fearing that the Convention would work to its disadvantage, boycotted the Convention and, when the Constitution was put to the states, initially refused to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E
5|$|The {{artillery}} fire progressively intensified until 23 June, while the RSK mobilised and counterattacked against the HV {{positions at the}} Miljevci Plateau. However, the mobilisation yielded only 227 additional troops, and the counterattack failed. An UNPROFOR assessment concluded the situation might deteriorate further and engulf all of the pink zones. To address the situation, UNPROFOR military commander Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar met with Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Milan Ramljak and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia General Anton Tus in Zagreb the same day, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the developments on the Miljevci Plateau. Skirmishes continued on 24 June, accompanied by some {{artillery fire}}. Morale of the RSK troops plummeted though, causing a TO garrison based in nearby Trbounj to abandon its barracks.|$|E

This represents a major development for the APPO's continuing attempts to develop alternative political proposals while still pushing for the removal of Ulises Ruiz.|$|E
25|$|It is to {{be noted}} that a topological {{manifold}} looks locally like a Euclidean space in a rather weak manner: while for each individual chart {{it is possible to}} distinguish differentiable functions or measure distances and angles, merely by virtue of being a topological manifold a space does not have any particular and consistent choice of such concepts. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> such properties for a manifold, one needs to specify further structure and consider differentiable manifolds and Riemannian manifolds discussed below. In particular, the same underlying topological manifold can have several mutually incompatible classes of differentiable functions and an infinite number of ways to specify distances and angles.|$|E

In January 2010, after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the requested information from the department, Wolf sought a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the Justice Department to provide Congress with the details of why it narrowed the case. In a vote along party lines, the resolution was defeated 15-14.|$|E
25|$|The forts {{failed to}} deter raids, {{and so in}} 1777, the Americans made {{preparations}} for an offensive expedition into the Ohio Country. In November, Cornstalk made a diplomatic visit to Fort Randolph <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the rumored expedition. Shawnees who followed Cornstalk wanted {{to stay out of}} the war, but Cornstalk warned the Americans that he would not be able to keep all of the tribe neutral. Although the proposed campaign had been cancelled because of a manpower shortage, Captain Arbuckle decided to detain Cornstalk and several other Shawnees as hostages in order to ensure that the Shawnees stayed neutral. When an American militiaman was killed outside the fort by Indians on November 10, his enraged companions charged into the fort and murdered Cornstalk and the other three Shawnee prisoners. Virginia's governor Patrick Henry brought the killers to trial, but they were acquitted because no one would testify against them.|$|E

Madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by Díaz.|$|E

500|$|After the {{delegation}} returned to Vilnius, a {{session of the}} Council was held on December 11 <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the Act. It was adopted without any further changes. Fifteen {{voted in favor of}} the Act, three voted against it, one member abstained, and one did not participate. It is not entirely clear whether every member of the Council signed this document. The Act was written in German, and apparently no official Lithuanian translation was prepared. Therefore, different sources provide slightly different translations. The Act of December 11 pronounced Lithuania's independence, but also asked German government for protection (clause 2) and called for [...] "a firm and permanent alliance" [...] with Germany. Since the Act specified that the alliance was to be formed based on conventions concerning military affairs, transportation, customs, and currency, many Lithuanians argued that the Council had overstepped its authority: the September resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference clearly demanded that a constituent assembly decide these crucial matters of state.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "New Rules" [...] was {{directed}} by Henry Scholfield, who also shot Lipa's previous visual, [...] "Lost in Your Light". The singer invited Scholfield {{for a cup of}} tea in London <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> her ideas for the clip. Lipa had saved a picture of model Naomi Campbell holding another woman in her back during a campaign in the 1980s as a [...] "reference point", explaining that, [...] "I loved the idea of girls looking after each other like that, holding each other, that sense of humility, that sense of strength." [...] Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered them a good representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that [...] "narrative of togetherness and empowerment" [...] into it. Barcelo also took inspiration from the flamingos' movements while planning the choreography. More than 200 women auditioned for the video, with eight being selected.|$|E
500|$|After Bucer's death, his {{writings}} {{continued to be}} translated, reprinted, and disseminated throughout Europe. No [...] "Buceran" [...] denomination, however, emerged from his ministry, probably because he never developed a systematic theology as Melanchthon had for the Lutheran church and Calvin for the Reformed churches. Several groups, including Anglicans, Puritans, Lutherans, and Calvinists, claimed {{him as one of}} their own. The adaptability of his theology to each confessional point-of-view also led polemicists to criticise it as too accommodating. His theology could be best summarised as being practical and pastoral rather than theoretical. Bucer was not so concerned about staking a doctrinal claim per se, but rather he took a standpoint <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> and to win over his opponents. At the same time his theological stand was grounded in the conditions of his time where he envisioned the ideal society to be one that was led by an enlightened, God-centred government with all the people united under Christian fellowship. Martin Bucer is chiefly remembered for his promotion of doctrinal unity, or ecumenism, and his lifelong struggle to create an inclusive church.|$|E
