40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{stability}} of the movement of the <b>journal</b> inside the <b>bushing</b> of the hydrodynamic plain bearings, which limits the operational range of rotor rotational speed. The purpose of active vibration control using piezoactuators is to increase the limit of the rotor rotation speed without onset of a whirl. It is also required maintaining the bearing journal position without vibration and reducing friction losses at the steady-state rotation. The main topic is the presentation {{of the results of the}} test of the journal bearing with the use of a test bench...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Foil {{bearings}} are {{a variety}} of slide bearings in which an additional set of foils is applied between <b>journal</b> and <b>bush,</b> in order to improve the selected static and dynamic properties. Engineers and researchers {{from all over the world}} investigate bearings of this type since many years – both from numerical as well as experimental point of view. Due to the complexity of construction, the reliable simulation models are all the time being searched for. This paper discusses the important stages of elaboration of the structural supporting layer nu-merical model of the foil bearing as well as results of verification tests. The main goal of the conducted study was assessment of reliability of the elaborated numerical model, in scope of dynamic properties. In the near future it will be used for elaboration of the numerical model of the entire foil bearing, which will take into account also phenomena in fluid-film layer. Those models will be used together to describe bearing system in operation...|$|R
40|$|During the {{operation}} of turbounit its bearings displace {{as a result of}} heat elongation of bearings supports. It changes the static deflection line of rotor determined during assembly of the turbounit, causing an increase in the stresses on the bearing edges and a decrease in the dynamic state of the machine. One of possibilities to avoid the edge stresses is to apply the bearings with variable axial profile, e. g. hyperboloidal, convex profile in the axial cross-section of bearing. Application of journal bearings with hyperboloidal profile allows to extend the bearing operation range without the stress concentration on the edges of bush. These bearings successfully carry the extreme load in conditions of misaligned axis of <b>journal</b> and the <b>bush</b> eliminating the necessity of using self-aligning bearings. Operating characteristics of bearing include the resulting force, attitude angle, oil film pressure and temperature distributions, minimum oil film thickness, maximum oil film temperature. In literature {{there is a lack of}} data on the operating characteristics of heavy loaded hyperboloidal journal bearings operating at the conditions of adiabatic oil film and static equilibrium position of the journal. For the hyperboloidal bearing the operating characteristics have been obtained. Different values of length to diameter ratio, assumed shape and inclination ratio coefficients have been assumed. Iterative solution of the Reynolds', energy and viscosity equations was applied. Adiabatic oil film, laminar flow in the bearing gap as well as aligned and misaligned orientation of <b>journal</b> in the <b>bush</b> were considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{composite}} which is PTFE as a matrix with PEEK and carbon fiber as fillers is developed to fabricate the <b>bush</b> of water-lubricated <b>journal</b> bearings. The <b>bush</b> is fabricated {{with a new}} structure that a relatively large straight groove is opened in its upper part. A water-lubricated journal bearing {{made up of the}} bush and a steel sleeve is studied using purposed-built test rig. It is shown that the test bearing operates under hydrodynamic lubrication for almost all of the given conditions. The composite developed in the work is a promising material for water-lubricated journal bearings, and the new structure can be well used in water-lubricated journal bearings...|$|R

40|$|Oil whirl {{instability}} is {{a serious}} problem in oil lubricated journal bearings. The phenomenon is characterized by a subsynchronous vibration of the <b>journal</b> within the <b>bush</b> and is particularly apparent in turbogenerators, aeroengines and electric motors. A review is presented of previous papers on the subject of oil whirl, and a simple theory is described which was used to aid the design of an oil whirl test rig. Predictions of the onset of oil whirl made by the theory presented were found to agree with those of previous researchers. They showed that increasing the shaft flexibility, or the lubricant viscosity, and decreasing the bearing radial clearance tended to reduce the oil whirl onset speed thus making the system more unstable...|$|R
40|$|Floating <b>bush</b> <b>journal</b> {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used to support small-sized high speed rotating machinery. The bearing shows the following peculiar phenomena when the supplied pressure is low. That is, the bush-to journal speed ratio decreases and {{the disappearance of the}} oil whip may be observed as the journal rotational speed increases These could be explained qualitatively when the model with the axial oil film rupture being considered is applied to the inner oil film of the bearing. However, the predictions are in quantitatively poor agreement with the measurements. This paper aims at predicting the bush driving torque of the inner oil film by utilizing the cubic interpolated pseudoparticle (CIP) method that has been developed in the numerical analysis of the multi-phase flow. It is found that the predicted torque is much smaller than the torque obtained from the previous model when the journal speed is high. This results from the incursion of the air into the film from the bearing side end. The effect of some design variables such as the surface tension, which cannot be incorporated in the previous model, on the torque is also shown...|$|R
40|$|Floating <b>bush</b> <b>journal</b> {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used to support small-sized high-speed rotating machinery. When　the supplied pressure is low, the bearing shows peculiar phenomena. As the shaft rotational speed increases, the bush rotational speed levels off and {{the disappearance of the}} oil whip is observed. They can be explained qualitatively by applying the hydrodynamic lubrication model with the axial oil film rupture being considered. However, the predictions are in quantitatively poor agreement with the measurements. This experimental report shows the effect of the circumferential oil groove and holes into the inner oil film and the slope of the bush inner side end, which are not considered in the theoretical model, on the bush rotational speed and the high-speed stability. It is found that the bush rotational speed levels off at a lower shaft rotational speed, resulting in the lower bush speed, and that the oil whip disappears at a lower shaft speed, when the supplied pressure is lower. The groove, the driving torque of which cannot be negligible, lowers the bush rotational speed and heightens largely the stability in high-speed region. The effect of the hole, the geometry in the groove and the slope is small...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{analysis}} of air bearing suitable for high speed micro gas turbine. Design {{has been carried out}} for a turbine rotor having symmetrical loading by mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of its dynamic motion. The rigid symmetrical rotor is supported in two air bearings and each bearing is of radial configuration with a cylindrical bush. The input parameters from the micro gas turbine design have been considered for the design of bearing to suit the rotor system. For the established shaft configuration, non-linear Reynolds equation is solved to get the air pressure distribution in the gap between the shaft and the bush. The load capacity of the bearing is calculated by integrating the pressure distribution obtained earlier. The displacements, velocities and dynamic components of load capacity with time are used to evaluate the damping and stiffness coefficients of air film between the <b>journal</b> and the <b>bush.</b> A non-linear equation of motion of the shaft is evolved using the above coefficients. The stability threshold is estimated from the linearized equations of motion. The stability threshold estimation leads to arrival of stability boundaries of rotor bearing system characterized by the required stiffness and damping coefficients of the bush support surrounding the air bearing. The required stiffness and damping coefficients of bush are achieved by providing an air ring around the bush. The complete mathematical procedure has been coded using MATLAB Software...|$|R
