40|$|Background & objectives: Appreciating how Yersinia pestis, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} plague, spreads amongblack-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies (BTPD), {{is vital to}} wildlife conservation programsin North American grasslands. A little-studied aspect {{of the system is}} the role of Y. pestis vectors, i. e. fleas,play in the spreading of plague in natural settings. We investigated the genetic structure and variability of acommon prairie <b>dog</b> <b>flea</b> (Oropsylla hirsuta) in BTPD colonies in order to examine dispersal patterns. Giventhat this research took place during a widespread plague epizootic, there was the added advantage of gaininginformation on the dynamics of sylvatic plague. Methods & Results: Oropsylla hirsuta were collected from BTPD burrows in nine colonies from May 2005 toJuly 2005, and eight polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to generate genotypic data from them. Gene flow estimates revealed low genetic differentiation among fleas sampled from different colonies. NestedPCR plague assays confirmed the presence of Y. pestis with the average Y. pestis prevalence across all ninecolonies at 12 %. No significant correlations were found between the genetic variability and gene flow of O. hirsuta and Y. pestis prevalence on a per-colony basis. Conclusion: Oropsylla hirsuta dispersal among BTPD colonies was high, potentially explaining the rapidspread of Y. pestis in our study area in 2005 and 2006...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Fleas are {{the most}} {{important}} ectoparasites of humans and domestic animals. Their bites are painful, usually accompanied with itching; in addition, they transmit diseases such as plague, tularemia, and endemic typhus. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify species of fleas in the rural areas and animal farms in Boyerahmad Materials and Methods: This study, conducted for 6 months, from April to September 2007, included 30 villages of the Boyerahmad District (30 ° 9 '- 31 ° 32 'N: 49 ° 57 '- 50 ° 42 '). To collect fleas, the common catch methods, such as fly paper, light trap, etc. were District, Kohgiloye-and-Boyerahmad Province, Iran. used. The samples collected were kept in 70 %-ethanol, and then, after clarifying and dehydration, were identified in the laboratory using valid keys. Results: A total of 2435 fleas (54 % males and 46 % females) belonging to two families (Placida and Ceratophylidae), 4 genera and 7 species were collected. The most common species was Xenopsylla buxtoni (24. 7 %), followed by the <b>dog</b> <b>flea,</b> Ctenocephalides canis (21. 4 %), the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis (18. 5 %), Xenopsylla astia (14. 5 %), Xenopsylla nuttalli (7. 6 %), Pulex irritans (7. 2 %), and N. fasciatus (6. 1 %). The fleas abundance (mean ± SE) in human and animal habitats was found to be 0. 7 ± 0. 06 and 3. 4 ± 0. 2, respectively. Conclusion: On the whole, the flea species are quite diverse and abundant in the rural areas of Boyerahmad District in human and, particularly, animal habitats. This is a serious problem.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Bartonellosis is an {{emerging}} vector-borne disease caused by different intracellular bacteria {{of the genus}} Bartonella (Rhizobiales: Bartonellaceae) that is transmitted primarily by blood-sucking arthropods such as sandflies, ticks and fleas. In Tunisia, there are no data available identifying the vectors of Bartonella spp. In our research, we used molecular methods to detect and characterize Bartonella species circulating in fleas collected from domestic animals {{in several of the}} country's bioclimatic areas. Results: A total of 2178 fleas were collected from 5 cats, 27 dogs, 34 sheep, and 41 goats at 22 sites located in Tunisia's five bioclimatic zones. The fleas were identified as: 1803 Ctenocephalides felis (83 %) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae), 266 C. canis (12 %) and 109 Pulex irritans (5 %) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae). Using conventional PCR, we screened the fleas for the presence of Bartonella spp., targeting the citrate synthase gene (gltA). Bartonella DNA was detected in 14 % (121 / 866) of the tested flea pools [estimated infection rate (EIR) per 2 specimens: 0. 072, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 060 – 0. 086]. The Bartonella infection rate per pool was broken down as follows: 55 % (65 / 118; EIR per 2 specimens: 0. 329, 95 % CI: 0. 262 – 0. 402) in C. canis; 23. 5 % (8 / 34; EIR per 2 specimens: 0. 125, 95 % CI: 0. 055 – 0. 233) in P. irritans and 6. 7 % (48 / 714; EIR per 2 specimens: 0. 032, 95 % CI: 0. 025 – 0. 045) in C. felis. Infection rates, which varied significantly by bioclimatic zone (P < 0. 0001), were highest in the humid areas. By sequencing, targeting the gltA gene and the 16 S– 23 S rRNA Intergenic Spacer Regions (ITS), we identified three Bartonella zoonotic species: B. elizabethae, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, as well as uncharacterized Bartonella genotypes. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that fleas in Tunisia have been shown to carry zoonotic species of Bartonella. The <b>dog</b> <b>flea,</b> Ctenocephalides canis, should be considered the main potential vector of Bartonella. Our study not only provides new information about this vector, but also offers a public health update: medical practitioners and farmers in Tunisia should be apprised of the presence of Bartonella in fleas and implement preventive measures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of orally administered afoxolaner against adult <b>dog</b> <b>fleas,</b> Ctenocephalides canis, was evaluated in a controlled, blinded study. A total of 32 dogs were infested with 100 adult unfed fleas approximately 24 h prior to treatment {{and then at}} weekly intervals for 5 weeks after treatment. Live fleas were counted upon removal at 12 h (for 16 dogs) and 24 h (for the remaining 16 dogs) after treatment (for counts performed the first week) or after infestation (for counts performed on subsequent weeks). In addition, flea eggs were collected from each pen and counted for the <b>dogs</b> with <b>flea</b> removal at 24 h. Dosing of individual dogs was achieved {{using a combination of}} the chewable tablets to be {{as close as possible to}} the minimum effective dose of 2. 5 mg/kg. The percent {{efficacy of}} the afoxolaner treatment was ≥ 99. 0 % for all 24 -h flea counts. For flea counts performed 12 h after treatment or infestations, the percent efficacy was ≥ 94. 1 % up to Day 21. After Day 1, no flea eggs were recovered from the afoxolaner treated group, providing 100 % reduction in numbers of flea eggs recovered versus untreated control group. This study confirmed that a single oral treatment with afoxolaner provided excellent efficacy against infestations by C. canis within 12 – 24 h after treatment, prevented re-infestations, and completely prevented egg production from new flea infestations for up to 5 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyJack F. Cully, Jr. Black-tailed {{prairie dogs}} (Cynomys ludovicianus) are {{epizootic}} hosts for plague (Yersinia pestis); however, alternate enzootic hosts {{are important for}} the maintenance of the pathogen. We determined small rodents and prairie dog associations and quantified rodent and flea relationships in the presence and absence of prairie dog colonies and plague. We identified potential alternate hosts and flea vectors for the maintenance and transmission of plague in the prairie ecosystem. This is the first multi-year study to investigate associations between prairie <b>dogs,</b> rodents and <b>fleas</b> across the range of the black-tailed prairie dog. Few rodent species associated with black-tailed prairie dogs and were found to be highly abundant on colonies. Rodent species implicated in plague were present at study areas with and without plague. Peromyscus maniculatus and Onychomus leucogaster, two widely occurring species, were more abundant in areas with a recent history of plague. Flea community characteristics varied within each study area in the presence and absence of prairie <b>dogs.</b> Based on <b>flea</b> diversity on rodents, and the role of rodents and fleas in plague, we identified P. maniculatus and O. leucogaster and their associated fleas, Aetheca wagneri, Malareus telchinus, Orchopeas leucopus, Peromyscopsylla hesperomys, and Pleochaetis exilis to be important for the dynamics of sylvatic plague in our study areas. Peromyscus maniculatus and O. leucogaster were consistently infected with Bartonella spp., another blood parasite.

40|$|The use of {{neonicotinoid}} insecticides {{has grown}} considerably since their introduction in 1990 s. They are used extensively {{for the control}} of agriculturally important crop pests {{and also in the}} control of cat and <b>dog</b> <b>fleas.</b> Imidacloprid exploited through an elaborated structural and substituent optimization of nithiazine was launched to market in 1990. The selectivity of neonicotinoid compounds for insect species has been attributed to their binding on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in which the negatively charged nitro- or cyano-groups of neonicotinoid compounds interact with a cationic subsite within insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The first example of a pest evolving resistance to field use of neonicotinoids was Bemisia tabaci. Resistance to neonicotinoids can arise either through nAChR subtypes expression, detoxification mechanisms and/or structural alterations of target-site proteins. Consequently, a number of derivatives and analogues of imidacloprid have been generated to date. In 1992, a new neonicotinoid using acetylcholine as the lead compound has been found. This was dinotefuran, which has a characteristic tetrahydro- 3 -furylmethyl group instead of the pyridine-like rings of others neonicotinoids...|$|R
