40|$|Background: White syndrome, a {{term for}} scleractinian coral disease with {{progressive}} tissue loss, is known to cause depressed growth and increased morality of coral reefs in the major oceans around the world, and the occurrence of this disease has been frequently reported {{in the past few}} decades. Investigations during April to September in both 2010 and 2011 identified widespread Porites andrewsi White syndrome (PAWS) in Xisha Archipelago, South China Sea. However, the causes and etiology of PAWS have been unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: A transmission experiment was performed on P. andrewsi in the Qilianyu Subgroup (QLY). The results showed that there was a significant (P <= 0. 05) difference between test and control groups after 28 days if the invalid replicates were excluded. Rates of tissue loss ranged from 0. 90 - 10. 76 cm(2) d(- 1) with a mean of 5. 40 +/- 3. 34 cm(2) d(- 1) (mean +/- SD). Bacterial strains were isolated from the PAWS corals at the <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> in QLY of the Xisha Archipelago, South China Sea, and included in laboratory-based infection trials to satisfy Koch's postulates for establishing causality. Following exposure to bacterial concentrations of 10 (5) cells mL(- 1), the infected colonies exhibited similar signs to those observed in the field. Using phylogenetic 16 S rRNA gene analysis, classical phenotypic trait comparison, Biolog automatic identification system, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and MALDI Biotyper method, two pathogenic strains were identified as Vibrio alginolyticus. Conclusion/Significance: This is the first report of V. alginolyticus as a pathogenic agent of PAWS in the South China Sea. Our results point out an urgent need to develop sensitive detection methods for V. alginolyticus virulence strains and robust diagnostics for coral disease caused by this and Vibrio pathogenic bacterium in the South China Sea.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 48 {{million cases}} of foodborne illness occur {{each year in}} the United States, resulting in approximately 128, 000 hospitalizations and 3, 000 deaths. Over half of all foodborne <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are associated with eating in restaurants or delicatessens. We reviewed data from restaurant-associated foodborne <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> to better understand the factors that contribute to these outbreaks. Data on restaurant-associated foodborne <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> reported by <b>sites</b> participating in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) were analyzed to characterize contributing factors reported in foodborne <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> and the levels of evidence used to identify these factors. Of 457 foodborne <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> reported in 2006 and 2007 by FoodNet sites, 300 (66 %) were restaurant associated, and of these 295 (98 %) had at least one reported contributing factor. One to nine (with a median of two) contributing factors were reported per outbreak. Of the 257 outbreaks with a single etiology reported, contributing factors associated with food worker health and hygiene were reported for 165 outbreaks (64 %), factors associated with food preparation practices within the establishment were reported for 88 outbreaks (34 %), and factors associated with contamination introduced before reaching the restaurant were reported for 56 outbreaks (22 %). The pronounced role of food workers in propagating outbreaks makes it clear that more work is needed to address prevention at the local level. Food workers should be instructed not to prepare food while ill to prevent the risk of transmitting pathogens.

40|$|The growing {{incidence}} of new tree pest and disease epidemics, {{many of them}} {{with the potential to}} radically reshape our native woodlands and forests, is closely linked to a significant upsurge in global trade and transportation in recent decades. At the same time, interventions designed to actually manage any pest and <b>disease</b> <b>outbreaks</b> that occur can reshape forest landscapes in a variety of ways. In this review-based paper we argue that disease-driven interactions between biology, public policy and human agency along pathways of introduction and at <b>outbreak</b> <b>sites</b> will become increasingly common in the Anthropocene, where the latter is understood as an era in which human influence over non-human nature is ever more pervasive.

To manage the scope and diversity of these diseases public health agencies rely on the use of protocols. Protocols can be effective tools for improving performance and reducing errors.
