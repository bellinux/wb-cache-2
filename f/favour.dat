Presentado el 3 de abril de 2014 en The 2014 Meeting of the European Public Choice Society, celebrado del 3 al 6 de abril de 2014 en Cambridge (Reino Unido) The paper {{analyses}} {{the problem}} of a committee chair using <b>favours</b> at her disposal to maximize the likelihood that her proposal gains committee support. The <b>favours</b> increase {{the probability of a}} given member approving the chair’s proposal via a smooth voting function. The decision-making protocol is any quota voting rule. The paper characterizes the optimal allocation of any given level of <b>favours</b> and the optimal expenditure minimizing level of <b>favours.</b> The optimal allocation divides <b>favours</b> uniformly among a coalition of the committee members. At a low level of <b>favours,</b> the coalition comprises all committee members. At a high level, it is the minimum winning coalition. The optimal expenditure level guarantees the chair certain support of the minimum winning coalition if <b>favours</b> are abundant and uncertain support of all committee members if <b>favours</b> are scarce; elitist or egalitarian committees are compatible with a strategic chair. The results are robust to changing the chair’s objectives and to alternative voting functionsPeer Reviewe...|$|R
