5|$|The {{question}} in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a superior intellect.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{for both}} {{pregnant}} and non-pregnant women is usually with metronidazole, by mouth once. Caution {{should be used}} in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Sexual partners, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no symptoms, should also be treated.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} of Liberia limits Liberian nationality to Negro people (see also Liberian nationality law). People of other racial origins, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lived {{for many years}} in Liberia, are thus precluded from becoming citizens of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|The major {{projects}} of the municipality {{do not yet}} concern the city centre, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the merit of addressing the three terraces which line the city: the first terrace concerns Valence-le-Haut (quarters of le Plan and Fontbarlettes), the second concerns the centre and the south, and the third {{the banks of the}} Rhône.|$|E
25|$|Some synthetases also mediate a editing {{reaction}} to ensure high fidelity of tRNA charging. If the incorrect tRNA is added (aka. the tRNA {{is found to}} be improperly charged), the aminoacyl-tRNA bond is hydrolyzed. This can happen when two amino acids have different properties <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> similar shapes—as is the case with Valine and Threonine.|$|E

25|$|In {{communicating}} with patients {{a major challenge}} in the campaign is the problem inherent in patient-centered care of giving patients some basis for understanding how {{to make decisions about}} their health care. Many recommendations in the campaign require clinical education to understand fully. Also many patients tend to follow the recommendations of their physicians without question, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> questions.|$|E

The Gueudet Group, {{one of the largest}} car dealers in France, was established at Amiens in 1918. The old textile tradition of the city remains with the factory of Lee Cooper France (122 employees).|$|E
25|$|Netball is a {{very popular}} women's sport in South Africa. While {{participation}} rates are high, {{there is no sense}} of collective identity by players as netballers and being part of a national netball community. In 2002, 40% of African girls rated netball as their favourite sport and 19% of coloured girls like netball best. Many African girls claim netball as their favourite sport <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never played it.|$|E

25|$|Applicants for {{permanent}} residence visas {{are required to}} submit their passport, birth certificate, marriage certificate (if applicable) and a police certificate of no criminal record, issued within the last 90 days. Starting in 2014, retirees with serious health problems have been denied visas <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a sufficient pension because some have abused Brazil's free and universal health care by coming to Brazil with a retirement visa {{for the sole purpose}} of obtaining health care.|$|E
25|$|In 2001,World Christian Encyclopedia, 2001, {{estimated}} 7.1 million Bahá'ís in {{the world}} in 2000, representing 218 countries. The same source estimated 5.7 million in 1990. Its definition of membership is broader than the official Bahá'í definition and would include people who attend Bahá'í gatherings regularly <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not declared their faith or persons who state they are Bahá'ís in government censuses as a result of reading about the religion or hearing about it on the radio.|$|E
25|$|Some {{policies}} cause reverse racism, {{in which}} Han Chinese or even ethnic minorities from other regions {{are treated as}} second-class citizens in the ethnic region. Similarly, there are wide-ranging preferential policies (affirmative action programs) in place to promote social and economic development for ethnic minorities, including preferential employment, political appointments, and business loans. Universities typically have quotas reserved for ethnic minorities, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lower admission test scores. Ethnic minorities are also more often exempt from the one-child policy, which targets the Han Chinese.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area is positive, in that all municipalities form a single conurbation. By contrast, the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico is considered a normative definition, in that it incorporates 18 additional strategic municipalities in the territorial administration of the region, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been fully integrated yet. Many urban projects, mostly related to the improvement of air quality and water sanitation, are coordinated for all constituent municipalities of this agglomeration. The {{majority of the population}} reports of urban areas in Mexico refer to this agglomeration, and not to the MCMA conurbation.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{because of}} the {{differences}} in language and culture, students are often placed in lower classes due to their lack of English proficiency. Students can also be made to repeat classes {{because of the}}ir lack of English proficiency, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> mastered the content of the class. When schools have the resources and are able to provide separate classes for refugee students to develop their English skills, it can take the average refugee students only three months to catch up with their peers. This was the case with Somali refugees at some primary schools in Nairobi.|$|E
25|$|The {{office is}} {{generally}} {{found only in}} older Catholic countries, and is now purely honorific, enjoying no effective powers under canon law —except for the Archbishop of Esztergom (Gran) in Hungary. Thus, e.g., the Primate of Poland holds no jurisdictional authority over other Polish bishops or their dioceses, but is durante munere {{a member of the}} standing committee of the episcopal conference and has honorary precedence among Polish bishops (e.g., in liturgical ceremonies). The Holy See has also granted Polish primates the privilege of wearing cardinal's crimson attire, except for the skullcap and biretta, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been made cardinals.|$|E
