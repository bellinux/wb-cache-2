5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

25|$|Pacific yew {{grows in}} varying types of environments; however, in drier environments {{it is mostly}} limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist environments <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> up onto slopes and ridgetops. Pacific yew is shade tolerant; however it can also grow in sun. The tree's shade {{tolerance}} allows it to form an understory, which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.|$|E

50|$|Crawford's gray shrew {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} desert mammals and one of the world's smallest homeotherms. When fully grown, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> only <b>grow</b> to a size of about 1.5 to 2 in long, half of which is the tail, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> only <b>grow</b> to a weight of about 3 to 5 g. It is gray-brown with light gray under parts. The long tail is gray with it being lighter underneath. It has small, but relatively prominent, ears.|$|R
25|$|In sunnier climates such as Southern Europe, the {{southern}} states of the U.S., the North Island of New Zealand, and Australia, basil will thrive when planted outside. It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States, but dies out when temperatures reach freezing point. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> back the next year if {{allowed to go to}} seed. It will need regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates.|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result of}} this {{overgrazing}} on the native plant ecology and grassland was catastrophic. [...] Animals selectively graze on plant species they co-evolved to consume. [...] If an invasive, non-native plant species is introduced into an environment {{where there is no}} competition from animals, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> unchecked. [...] This happened on a dramatic scale within the overgrazed preserve boundaries. [...] With no natural competition, autumn-olive, stilt grass, garlic mustard, ailanthus, Japanese barberry, and oriental bittersweet grew without control.|$|E

2500|$|The {{indigenous}} knowledge Pizarras has {{learned about the}} Philippine tarsier that he shares with the visitors at the Philippine Tarsier Research and Development Center are that it is useless and doubly cruel to keep the animal as a pet because {{it is capable of}} [...] "committing suicide" [...] in captivity. Just to get out, it will bang its head on the cage until it dies. Pizarras said that he has witnessed this many times. If you frequently hold it in your hands, it will be under such stress that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> stiff and eventually stop breathing. Thus, touching the [...] "sensitive" [...] tarsier is a no-no in the sanctuary. It is very inviting to do so, especially since even at daytime, the animal is not easily scared by approaching people and tends to rest on tree trunks and twigs at eye level.|$|E
