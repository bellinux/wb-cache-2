5|$|The U.S. 17th Airborne Division gained {{its fourth}} Medal of Honor {{in the days}} {{following}} the operation, when Technical Sergeant Clinton M. Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a fortified position by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February, Chase's columns {{pushed into}} the {{northern}} outskirts of Manila and seized a vital bridge over the Tuliahan River, which separated them from the city proper. Chase, controlling his columns by radio, suffered slight burns to his hands when a Japanese truck exploded. A squadron of the 8th Cavalry, guided by two Filipino guerrillas reached the sprawling campus of the University of Santo Tomas which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into an internment camp, liberating some 3,700 internees.|$|E

5|$|Despite that failure, in 1925 {{a similar}} bill passed both the House and Senate, which {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919. The NCPC was authorized to begin purchasing land occupied by the old forts, much of which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> over to private ownership following the war. Records indicate that the site of Fort Stanton was purchased for a total of $56,000 in 1926. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the project in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Early on 31 August, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} towards KB Mission, with 'D' Company {{leading the way}} and {{struggling}} through muddy conditions along the track, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion's position, at around 9:00am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.|$|E
5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E

5|$|In 1931 an unexplained fire {{destroyed}} much of {{the interior}} of the house, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a cemetery chapel. The local fire brigade managed to stop the fire reaching the wooden stairs {{to the top of the}} tower. Prebendary F. E. Murphy, the rector of Walcot, established an appeal for funds of £300 for the restoration. By 1954 the stairs up the tower had become unsafe and a further appeal for public funds for the restoration was started. In 1970 the Church Commissioners declared the chapel redundant and plans drawn up by the new owners, Dr & Mrs Hilliard, to renovate the tower and create two flats. The Beckford Tower Trust and the museum were established in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In October 1918, Superb and {{her sister}} ship, , were {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet and Superb became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, upon her arrival at Mudros on 31 October. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked Superb to provide a crew for the , which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> over to the Allies by the Germans after the Armistice of 11 November. On 4 December, the ship conveyed Gough-Calthorpe to Odessa, Russia, to inspect the situation there; he made another such visit to Port Said, Egypt, in late March 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 2010, a {{military}} court convicted {{air traffic controller}} Sgt.

Santos will remain free pending the outcome of the appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Fleet sortied on the {{afternoon}} of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, Temeraire and her sister ship, , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe. They were part of the squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked Temeraire to provide a crew for the , which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> over to the Allies by the Germans after the Armistice of 11 November. The ship remained in the Black Sea and Ottoman waters until 3 April 1919, when she departed for home, having visited Sevastopol, Russia, and Haifa, Palestine, during her deployment.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} {{stories about the}} megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E
5|$|In Wendell, the two protagonists {{learn that}} Bogard {{and several other}} knights were {{instrumental}} in overthrowing the Vandole Empire twenty years prior, which had been abusing Mana, the source of magic. The hero states his intention to find the legendary Mana Sword in order to avenge his parents and the heroine reveals she has a pendant from her stepmother {{that is the key}} to the Mana Tree, the source of Mana. The unnamed man then reveals himself to be Julius and kidnaps the heroine for the pendant; during a failed rescue attempt the hero falls from an airship along with the pendant. After a side story resulting in the hero and heroine killing the Dark Lord's mother, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a monster, the pendant is stolen and given to the Dark Lord. The protagonists chase after him. After the two defeat the Dark Lord, Julius reveals himself to be the last survivor of the Vandole Empire. Once gaining the pendant he mind controlled the heroine to use the pendant to give him control the Mana Tree, which Vandole had attempted to do prior to being overthrown. Julius defeats the hero and heroine, and heads off to the Mana Tree.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after birth, he {{was taken}} from his cradle and adopted by his {{maternal}} uncle Kaihupaʻa to be raised in the Hawaiian custom of hānai, an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. His uncle had been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea {{was taken to the}} kingdom's capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a home for royal retainers and the kahu (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke his foot in the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, on 19 February 1942, the Japanese {{launched}} {{air raids}} on Australian soil, targeting {{the northern city}} of Darwin. Miller trained at flying schools at Cunderdin, Western Australia and Mallala, South Australia, just north of Adelaide and gained his wings in late 1942. He played only one match during the football season, playing in a combined West Adelaide and Glenelg Football Club team while posted in South Australia. His team lost. On 17 December he returned to Melbourne and was promoted to the rank of flight sergeant. On 15 January 1943, he embarked on the USS West Point at Port Melbourne, which was to take him to Europe in readiness for war combat. The journey included a stopover in February at a training camp in Boston in the United States. It was there that Miller met Peg Wagner, his future wife. They were engaged before Miller left for the United Kingdom. He arrived in Scotland on 18 March 1943 and was deployed to the southern English coastal town of Bournemouth. The once-popular tourist resort <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a military centre and was the target of frequent German air raids.|$|E
5|$|Survivalism and {{disaster}} preparation are prevalent {{themes in the}} novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country. For example, when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former CEO. The ultra-rich hid in their homes, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into fortified compounds, when they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, it became a mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster. Brooks described {{the large amount of}} research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that the U.S. likes the zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.|$|E

5|$|This {{invasion}} {{brought on}} the last great sortie of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Its plan for the Battle of Leyte Gulf included a feint by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through San Bernardino Strait. At {{the opening of the}} battle planes from the carriers guarded by New Jersey struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while New Jersey steamed south at flank speed to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> back in a stunning defeat when she arrived.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was a {{successful}} large-scale airborne operation. All of the objectives that the airborne troops of the 17th had been tasked with had been captured and held, usually within {{only a few hours}} of the operation's beginning. The bridges over the Issel had been successfully captured, although one later had to be destroyed to prevent its capture by counter-attacking German forces. The Diersfordter Forest had been cleared of enemy troops, and the roads along which the Germans might have moved reinforcements against the advance had been cut by airborne troops. By nightfall of the 24th, the British 15th Infantry Division had joined up with elements of the British 6th Airborne Division, and by midnight the first light bridge was across the Rhine. By the 27th, twelve bridges suitable for heavy armour had been installed over the Rhine and the Allies had fourteen divisions on the east bank of the river which had penetrated up to ten miles. The division also gained its fourth Medal of Honor in the days following Operation Varsity, when Technical Sergeant Clinton Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> into a fortified position by the Germans. In terms of casualties, the 17th Airborne Division suffered a total of 1,346 casualties in the space of five days, between 24 and 29 March, when Operation Plunder came to an end. After it had participated in Operation Varsity, the 17th Airborne Division continued to advance through Germany as a part of XVIII Airborne Corps, engaging German forces around Wesel, Essen and Münster. When Germany unconditionally surrendered on 7 May 1945, the division was conducting occupation duties in northern Germany.|$|E
