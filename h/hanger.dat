5|$|The road {{begins in}} Gunnersbury at the Chiswick flyover (junction 1 of the M4), {{from which the}} South Circular Road (A205) heads south over Kew Bridge. The first section runs along Gunnersbury Avenue through Gunnersbury Park to Ealing Common, where it becomes <b>Hanger</b> Lane. The road crosses the railway west of Paddington to the <b>Hanger</b> Lane gyratory system, a large {{roundabout}} {{on top of the}} Western Avenue (the A40) with <b>Hanger</b> Lane tube station. This is one of the busiest junctions in London, incorporating 10,000 vehicles an hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Clarisse {{has also been}} cited as a potential ancestral example of moe character design, a trend Miyazaki would later criticize as leading to the promotion of unhealthy lolicon fetishism. In 1983, TMS with Stern Electronics wanted {{to capitalize on the}} success of animated Laserdisc video games at the time. They released the arcade game, Cliff <b>Hanger,</b> which used footage from this film, along with the previous Lupin film The Mystery of Mamo. Even though the films themselves weren't available in North America at the time, the Cliff <b>Hanger</b> game was featured in an episode of the game show Starcade.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{began running}} in 2004 after a rugby knee injury {{which led to}} {{rehabilitation}} at the University of Pretoria's High Performance Centre with coach Ampie Louw. His first racing blades were fitted by South African prosthetist Francois Vanderwatt. Because {{he was unable to}} find suitable running blades in Pretoria, Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at <b>Hanger</b> Orthopedic Group. These quickly broke, and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter Brian Frasure to be fitted for carbon-fibre blades by Icelandic company Össur.|$|E

5|$|Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick - Unseen characters, {{they are}} often {{mentioned}} by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret dread having {{anything to do with}} them. Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat <b>hanger.</b>|$|E
5|$|The North Circular Road {{forms the}} {{northern}} part of a ring-road around Central London. It has seen substantially more investment than its counterpart, the South Circular Road, and consequently runs on more purpose-built road than urban streets, often coupled with demolition of existing houses and urban infrastructure. Although the route has alternative names at some points, it is generally referred to as the North Circular throughout for route planning purposes. The route is mostly grade-separated dual carriageway from the A40 at <b>Hanger</b> Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way/Brentfield Road junction, the Golders Green Road/Brent Street junction, Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes. In areas where improvements made slowest progress and upgrades are unlikely, the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used.|$|E
5|$|The first Lupin {{video game}} was a stealth game {{released}} to arcades in Japan by Taito in 1980 as Lupin III. A Laserdisc video game entitled Cliff <b>Hanger</b> was released to arcades in North America in 1983 by Stern. While it used footage from The Mystery of Mamo and The Castle of Cagliostro {{to provide a}} gaming experience similar to Dragon's Lair, it changes the characters' names and has an original plot. Since then Lupin video games have been released {{for a number of}} platforms including Family Computer, Super Famicom, Sony Playstation, Sony Playstation 2, Sega Saturn, Nintendo DS and Sega Naomi.|$|E
50|$|On October 25, 1928, the <b>Hangers</b> Certified Institution was launched. The new mental {{hospital}} {{was named for}} the three remaining aerodrome <b>hangers</b> on the site. The first patients were eight males who were put {{to the task of}} cleaning out the <b>hangers,</b> which were converted into wards for use by more patients. Soon eighty-six male patients lived and worked on the site. In 1929 construction of new buildings for both the Harperbury and Shenley sites began. The new buildings of the <b>Hangers</b> Institution were arranged along three loop roads. The administrative building was at the front, just off Harper Lane.|$|R
5000|$|The Hallway <b>Hangers</b> {{and their}} parents {{rejected}} the achievement ideology {{because they did not}} see job success through hard work to be a likely outcome in their situation, a situation in which few family members ever succeeded financially, where job opportunities were few and where hard work in school rarely influenced employability. Moreover, if the Hallway <b>Hangers</b> were to accept the achievement ideology, this would logically entail the belief that their parents had not succeeded financially because they were lazy or unintelligent. The Hallway <b>Hangers</b> knew this was not true. [...] Ironically, though the caucasian Hallway <b>Hangers</b> understood that the achievement ideology was false in their case, they were not able to understand that it was equally false in the case of African Americans. The Hallway <b>Hangers</b> were kept from this understanding by their belief in another powerful American ideology, that of racism and the intellectual inferiority of Blacks. Whereas the Hallway <b>Hangers</b> recognized that they failed to succeed financially because of their position in the lower class, they could not see that class exploitation was also responsible for the financial failure of African Americans. In addition to attributing inferiority to African Americans, the Hallway <b>Hangers</b> also scapegoated them, blaming them for taking all of the jobs that they, as white, believed they deserved.|$|R

5|$|Glenn was {{a backup}} pilot for Shepard and Grissom {{on the first}} two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions. Glenn was {{selected}} for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been. Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing <b>hanger</b> and altitude test, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{selected}} Chuck <b>Hanger</b> {{with their}} first pick, ninth overall in the 1948 BAA draft. The Lakers got their first overall draft pick in 1958 by choosing Elgin Baylor, {{who went on to}} be selected as the only NBA Rookie of the Year to be on the Lakers. The Lakers also drafted Magic Johnson in 1979 with their second first overall pick, who was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by ESPN in 2007. The Lakers had no first round draft picks in 1967, 1976, 1978, 1980, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The Lakers had no first or second round draft picks from 1983, 1987, and 2001. Throughout the years, the Lakers had traded away some of their picks as well as traded for other teams' picks. As a result of the various trades, the Los Angeles Lakers had five first and second round picks in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie <b>Hanger</b> for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E
50|$|The 'top hung' {{system is}} most often used. The door is hung by two trolley <b>hangers</b> {{at the top of}} the door running in a {{concealed}} track; all the weight is taken by the <b>hangers,</b> making the door easier to move.|$|R
5000|$|Wire is versatile, {{and wire}} clothes <b>hangers</b> {{are often used}} as cheap sources of semi-tough wire, more {{available}} than baling wire {{for all sorts of}} home projects. The use of wire clothes <b>hangers</b> for use as makeshift welding rod has been common for nearly 100 years. Similarly, many similar do-it-yourself and children's projects use wire <b>hangers</b> as holders of various types, from keeping a brake caliper from hanging by the brake line during auto repair work, to securing a gate on a bird cage. The much-loved 'Advent Crown' made for children's TV programme Blue Peter was made from four wire coathangers. Coathangers {{can be used to make}} dowsing rods. After sanding, wire <b>hangers</b> also find uses as conducting wire for uses as varied as hot wiring cars to games [...] to testing hand steadiness. They are commonly used to gain forcible entry into older automobiles whose locks and entry systems are not protected from such methods. There is a long history of using wire coat <b>hangers</b> as replacement car radio antennas. Clothes <b>hangers</b> are also commonly used as an implement for roasting marshmallows or hot dogs at camp-outs.|$|R

5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat <b>hanger</b> and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{office was}} moved to 2nd floor of the {{original}} Boise Air Terminal Building at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise terminal building at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal receiving equipment. The building {{was moved to}} the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport terminal building through 1969 though they were moved periodically to accommodate the growing airport. The wind instrument was moved several times through 1969 {{from the top of the}} United <b>Hanger</b> to the top of the terminal building to field northwest of the runway. The office remained on the 2nd floor of the terminal building until June 1969.|$|E
5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, {{bordering}} on the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles south-west of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The <b>Hanger.</b> The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} {{significant}} Confederate casualties. Both {{were treated with}} battlefield amputations, {{believed to be the}} first such operations of the war. One was a Virginia Military Institute cadet, Fauntleroy Daingerfield. The other Confederate was James E. <b>Hanger,</b> an 18-year-old college student. After recovering and being released, <b>Hanger</b> returned home to Virginia. He made an artificial leg from barrel staves with a hinge at the knee. His design worked so well that the Virginia State Legislature commissioned him to manufacture the “Hanger Limb” for other wounded soldiers. After the war, <b>Hanger</b> patented his prosthetic device and founded what is now the <b>Hanger</b> Orthopedic Group, Inc. As of 2007, <b>Hanger</b> Orthopedic Group is the United States market leader in the manufacture of artificial limbs.|$|E
