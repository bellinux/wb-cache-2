Instead of pair-wise coupling, an ensemble of oscillators coupled {{in a local}} region is used for grouping. We introduce a set of neighborhoods to generate dynamical coupling structures associated with a specific oscillator. Based on the proximity and similarity principles, two grouping rules are proposed to explicitly consider the distinct cases of whether an oscillator is inside a homogeneous image region or near a boundary between different regions. The use of dynamical coupling makes our segmentation network robust to noise on an image, and unlike image processing algorithms no <b>iterative</b> <b>operation</b> is needed for noise removal.
