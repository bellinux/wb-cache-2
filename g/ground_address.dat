40|$|This {{article is}} a {{conversation}} with Takehito Deguchi and Koji Yamamura, two distinct voices in animation practice and theory. Situated in Tokyo, Japan, the discussion follows a concept of expansion through decentralization, {{both in terms of}} the subject of animation and the place from where one speaks. Decentralization is considered in relation to how our understanding of the contemporary artwork, including animation, is formed, de- and re-formed through transforming and widening socio-political <b>grounds.</b> <b>Addressing</b> the complexity and hybridity for grasping the evolving layers in the field of anime, the dialogues with Deguchi and Yamamura gather questions and responses particularly about the status of experimental work, social change, the institutional and non-histories, seen as manifestations of incomplete historical understanding. Links are drawn between experimentation and time rupture, drawings and their shifting status in society, institutions and traditional statements, and social sentiments and animation’s intrinsic qualities. The text concludes with a summary of the conversations, including valuable statements that have been made, which open out the research subject for further debates...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the global}} justice {{movement}} has grabbed headlines and reshaped political imaginations worldwide. Surprisingly, however, feminism is largely absent from {{accounts of the}} movement—despite the fact that feminists are extensively involved on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Addressing</b> this significant gap in the literature, Eschle and Maiguashca shine a powerful light on what they term "feminist antiglobalization activism. " Drawing on their fieldwork at the World Social Forum and European Social Forum, 2003 – 2005, they begin by outlining the vital role of feminist antiglobalization activism in Forum processes and events while also emphasizing its diversity. The authors then trace the origins of this activism, the critiques and aspirations of those involved, their political practices beyond the Forum, and their efforts to forge a sense of solidarity among themselves and with others. Taking feminism seriously, Eschle and Maiguashca conclude, points us toward a richer and more theoretically nuanced understanding of the global justice movement and its struggle to create other possible worlds. Their book thus offers vital insights not only for feminists, but also for all those interested in contemporary social movements and in global governance and resistance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and {{evaluate}} a new matching sample comparison method, the industry size peer matching method. Design/methodology/approach – Based on archival financial data from Compustat and econometric methods, the paper first validates that such a method will result in firms being divided into more homogenous groups, making peer-performance comparison more meaningful. Then it compares this new peer matching method with previous methods through two resource-based related studies in the IT valuation context. Findings – The results show that the industry size matching method is a better method because: it is theoretically <b>grounded,</b> <b>addressing</b> industry, size, and random shock effects and, at the same time, avoids the selection bias caused by using a single firm as benchmark; and empirically such a technique results in more homogeneous groups and can explain more firm-level returns than the industry-only classification. Originality/value – Matched sample comparison group analysis is widely used in both academy and industry. The paper's theoretically grounds and empirically validated matching sample comparison method provides researchers and practitioners with a tool for their future research, performance evaluation, earning management detection, or compensation contract design, when selecting the right peers is called for.

40|$|Environmental {{innovation}} {{is a much}} discussed, highly prized yet often elusive objective of governance programmes. Despite this, there have been relatively few studies of the everyday realities of achieving innovation on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Addressing</b> this gap, the paper takes a specific {{example of how the}} EU's Urban Wastewater Directive sparks a pursuit of new environmental standards in wastewater practices in the north of England. We argue that to encourage innovation, we must first appreciate its contingent and complex character. We do this by adopting an approach to innovation influenced by actor‐network theory and conceive of it as being a highly contingent process of ‘translation’ through which actors’ interests and identities, their practices, even the Directive itself are re-represented and re-ordered through the construction of new actor-networks. From such a perspective, governance of the water sector is shown to be a highly contested, unpredictable business shaped by situationally specific negotiations and compromises. Crucially, our case study reveals the importance of organizations performing ‘intermediary’ roles: facilitating the production of knowledge and re-ordering of relations between actors. Working at the interfaces between a range of actors and the Directive, intermediaries become integral {{to the ways in which}} objects and practices are translated and innovation realized...|$|R
40|$|This article {{conducts a}} review of the {{principal}} tools used in English criminal law, from the early modern period to the present, to impose limits on free expression, particularly the freedom to exhibit ‗hate‘, in pursuit of social order and to police the boundaries at which the acceptable is segregated from the unacceptable. Against this historical backdrop, the article assesses the controversial Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, pointing to (dis) similarities with the preceding Bill and with the incitement to racial hatred measures on which the 2006 Act is modelled. The discussion also explores whether, in light of European and domestic human rights law, the English law of blasphemy should be abolished. It continues with an evaluation of how far existing public order legislation, regarding ‗racially or religiously aggravated‘ offences, are adequate to cover the <b>ground</b> <b>addressed</b> not only by the newly enacted incitement to religious hatred offences but also both the older incitement to racial hatred legislation and the common law as to blasphemy. It is argued that conflict over the mobilisation of criminal law to promote public civility is intrinsic not only to criminal law past and present but also to any pluralist polity committed to addressing social inequality...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed to}} analyze the effects of {{corporate}} governance practices on the credit rating assigned by Moody’s to open, non-financial companies with shares traded on the BM&FBOVESPA in the period 2008 - 2012. Analysis relied on theoretical <b>grounds</b> <b>addressed</b> by the Agency Theory (JENSEN; MECKLING, 1976), {{particularly with regard to}} the mechanisms of transparency and quality of assets that, as a consequence, may affect the performance indicators and credibility of firms (LARKER; TAYAN, 2011; BAKER, ANDERSON, 2011). To achieve the research purposes, ordered Probit regressions were used, having as dependent variable the credit rating of the companies, and, as independent variables, indicators of corporate governance and performance. Among the main results, it was possible to observe that there was a positive and significant relationship between the credit rating and the level of corporate governance and return on assets. Additionally, there was a negative relationship between rating and leverage firms. It was found also that {{during the height of the}} financial crisis of 2008, firms in the highest levels of governance were superior to those in lower levels. The main contributions of this study concern the ratification of existing evidence in the sense that there is a positive effect of corporate governance on the ratings assigned by Moody’s, suggesting that the level of governance should be considered in credit analysis, as well as evidence that better levels of governance resonated positively on business performance during a financial crisis...|$|R
