5|$|Although {{breakdown}} {{figures for}} each game species {{are not available}} in the 2006 National Survey from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> wild elk is most likely the primary economic impact.|$|E
5|$|The same {{mechanisms}} can {{be expected}} in humans, where researchers have studied behaviours including risk taking by young men, <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> large game animals, and costly religious rituals, finding that these appear to qualify as costly honest signals.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Scottish Witch <b>Hunt</b> <b>of</b> 1597 was {{a series}} of {{nationwide}} witch trials {{that took place in the}} whole of Scotland from March to October 1597. At least 400 people were put on trial for witchcraft and various forms of diabolism during the witch hunt. The exact number of those executed is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. The Great Scottish Witch <b>Hunt</b> <b>of</b> 1597 was the second of five nationwide witch hunts in Scottish history, the others being The Great Scottish Witch <b>Hunt</b> <b>of</b> 1590-91, The Great Scottish Witch <b>Hunt</b> <b>of</b> 1628-1631, The Great Scottish witch <b>hunt</b> <b>of</b> 1649-50 and The Great Scottish Witch <b>Hunt</b> <b>of</b> 1661-62.|$|R

5|$|In {{recent years}} only villages in South Malaita Island have {{continued}} to hunt dolphin. In 2010, the villages of Fanalei, Walende, and Bitamae signed a MoU with the non-governmental organization, Earth Island Institute, to stop hunting dolphin. However, in early 2013 the agreement broke down and some men in Fanalei resumed hunting. The <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> dolphin continued in early 2014.|$|E
5|$|Pingré also {{reported}} that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. Along with direct <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> the parrots, this likely led {{to a reduction in}} the population of Rodrigues parrots. Pingré's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, and it probably became extinct soon after.|$|E

5|$|Sealers and whalers {{founded the}} first European {{settlements}} {{in the early years}} of the 19th century, at which time the <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> marine mammals dominated European economic activity in New Zealand. A whaling station was established on the Tautuku Peninsula in 1839, with smaller stations at Waikawa and close to the mouth of the Clutha River.|$|E
5|$|Servals {{occur in}} several {{protected}} areas across its range. <b>Hunting</b> <b>of</b> servals is prohibited in Algeria, Botswana, Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Cape Province (South Africa), and Tunisia; regulations apply in Angola, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E

5|$|The International Whaling Commission (IWC) {{issued a}} {{moratorium}} on commercial <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> this whale, although Iceland and Costa Rica have resumed hunting.

5|$|The chapter {{ends with}} a {{discussion}} of animals that can change colour, including fish like the sole, the chameleon, the horned lizards and the tree frogs including the European species Hyla arborea. He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> insects).|$|E

5|$|The last sub-book of {{the text}} {{discusses}} recreation through horticulture {{and the art of}} creating gardens, painting, perfumery, architecture and the training and breeding of horses, elephants, lavakki (a type of quail), and other wildlife. A chapter is devoted to the royal sport of hunting deer or other wild game. It deals with 35 ways of game <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> deer, in addition to hunting with dogs, falconry and fishing.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|For others, {{although}} the <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> animal with hounds was made illegal by the Hunting Act 2004, the Exmoor hunts still meet in full regalia {{and there is}} a campaign to resurrect this rural sport. Nine hunts cover the area– the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and the Quantock Staghounds, the Exmoor, Dulverton West, Dulverton Farmers and West Somerset Foxhounds, the Minehead Harriers, the West Somerset Beagles and the North Devon Beagles. During the spring, amateur steeplechase meetings (point-to-points) are run by hunts at temporary courses such as Bratton Down and Holnicote. These, along with thoroughbred racing and pony racing, are an opportunity for farmers, hunt staff and the public to witness a day of traditional country entertainment.|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, Iceland's {{fisheries}} ministry {{authorized the}} <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> 9 fin whales through August 2007. In 2009 and 2010, Iceland caught 125 and 148 fin whales, respectively. An Icelandic company, Hvalur, caught {{over a hundred}} fin whales in 2014, and exported a record quantity of 2071 tonnes in a single shipment in 2014. Since 2006, Hvalur has caught more than 500 fin whales and exported more than 5000 tonnes of whale meat to Japan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting Killer Whales in Washington in 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the <b>hunting</b> <b>of</b> Killer Whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E
