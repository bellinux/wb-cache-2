Abrasive Suspension Jets (ASJ) {{is a new}} micro {{processing}} technique {{developed for}} micro processing of hard and brittle materials based on the traditional Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ). Based on drilling experiments of glass using MASJ technology, the dependence of material removal, the depth and {{the diameter of the}} machined holes on the process parameters, such as working pressure, processing time, standoff distance, incidence angle and concentration of abrasives were investigated. Experimental results show that the material removal is approximately proportional to working pressure, processing time and concentration of abrasives, except the standoff distance. It is founded that the processing time is the most remarkable influence factor on the material removal and the depth of the holes. But the working pressure doesn’t show obvious effects to the material removal and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> with lower pressure in MASJ.

40|$|Process {{capability}} {{analysis is}} {{a vital part of}} an overall quality improvement program. It is a technique that has application in many segments of the product cycle, including product and process design, vendor sourcing, production or manufacturing planning, and manufacturing. Frequently, a process capability study involves observing a quality characteristic of the product. Since this information usually pertains to the product rather than the process, this analysis should strictly speaking be called a product analysis study. A true process capability study in this context would involve collecting data that relates to process parameters so that remedial actions can be identified on a timely basis. The present study attempts to analyze performance of drilling, pressing, and reaming operations carried out for the manufacturing of two major lock components viz. handle and lever plate, at Gaurav International, Aligarh (India). The data collected for <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> on handle, central hole diameter, and key hole diameter are used to construct histogram. Next, the information available in frequency distribution table, the process mean, process capability from calculations and specification limits provided by the manufacturing concern are used with Taguchi technique. The data obtained from histogram and Taguchi technique combined are used to evaluate the performance of the manufacturing process. Results of this study indicated that the performance of all the processes used to produce <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> on handle, key hole diameter, and central hole diameter are potentially incapable as the process capability indices are found to be 0. 54, 0. 54 and 0. 76 respectively.

Because of these high costs, the Namibian Government has historically taken responsibility for the provision, operation and maintenance of rural water supply. However, {{in accordance with the}} principles advocated in the country's new Water and Sanitation Policy (WASP), an emphasis has been placed on shifting this responsibility to the communities utilising these water supplies (DWA, 1993). In April 1997, the Directorate of Rural Water Supply (DRWS) implemented a programme for the "Community Management of Rural Water Supply". This programme is to be phased in over nine years and during this time rural communities are expected to gradually take over full responsibility for the operation and maintenance costs of their water supply. In the final stage of this programme it is envisioned that these communities will be required to replace broken equipment, and provide new installations themselves (DR WS, 1996). Expecting rural communities to pay for the full cost recovery of their water supply will result in obvious socio-economic impacts on these communities (Sekhesa, 1997). However, the present reliance of many rural communities on groundwater resources gives them little alternative but to accept responsibility for the high costs associated with boreholes.

40|$|Drilling {{process is}} a {{material}} removal process to produce a hole. Any hole 10 times to its diameter is considered a deep hole. There {{are a lot of}} applications in industry that demand on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> to be drilled such as die, engines and aerospace industries. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> can minimize the operation and save money. Since the drilling process are move to the automated manufacturing environment nowadays. One of the primary issues in deep drilling technique is tool wear and failure which can affect the sustainability of the process. Therefore, based on collective data, classifying the tool wear mechanism and failure of deep drilling, the tool life stage can be identified and tool major fracture can be avoided. In this experiment, signal processing method was chosen to monitor the tool condition. By using the two sensors which is dynamometer and accelerometer, the signal data obtained was then being analyzed using three different signal processing techniques which are Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The SKD 61 material and the High Speed Steel (HSS) drill bit was used to carry out the experiment. There are 25 sets of experiments with different parameter used for each set. The parameter used was determined using Design of Experiment (DOE) method. Every sets of experiment were repeated three times to increase the accuracy of the signal data obtained. Based on classification data, the feedrate and cutting speed above 298. 8 mm/min and 1592 rpm will lead to tool failure; blunt or fracture. Time domain graph shows the force produced at z axis is the highest. Using FFT, there is no dominant frequency for the good tool condition. However there are some dominant frequencies for blunt and fracture tool. To differentiate between blunt and fracture, the amplitude of FFT gives the higher value when the tool is fracture. This is due to the tool bending and chip clogging. STFT was used to illustrate when is the high frequency region was occur. Then, the signal data was analyzed using HHT which decompose the time series into a set of components called intrinsic mode functions (IMF). IMF was used to detect tool failure by means of the energies of the characteristics IMF associated with characteristics frequencies of the drilling process. When the tool failure occurs, the energies of associated characteristics IMF change in opposite directions. Based on signal data and the tool condition, the type of tool failure was classified whether the tool is good, blunt or fracture. The optimization usage of machining parameter also influences the tool condition during the drilling process was perform. Since the time domain just can capture the time and force produced during the process, the FFT in needed to measure the frequency along the experiment. The FFT amplitude may control the tool life and failure. However, the STFT is used to capture the right time when the high frequency region was occur. Other than that, the time when tool failure occurs can be traced through the associated IMF characteristics generated using HHT methods. Consequently, the signal data processing is not only used to detect the tool failure, but {{it can be used to}} develop a system for online tool failure detection which can detect the failure and control the machine parameter to be optimized with the tool conditions...|$|E
40|$|In 1966, the Water Resources Research Center {{initiated}} a {{comprehensive study of}} electric well-logging and other geophysical well-logging techniques in Hawaii. The primary objectives {{of this study were}} to determine what results could be obtained by the use of conventional electric and geophysical well-logging methods under Hawaiian conditions and to collect as much basic geologic, hydrologic, and geometric information as possible from wells in Hawaiian aquifers. The functions logged include spontaneous potential, point resistivity, short and normal resistivity, lateral resistivity, water temperature, water conductivity, and caliper. Resistivity logging in Hawaii produced much important qualitative information and some quantitative information. Resistivity logs from wells in basaltic aquifers indicate the location, number, thickness, and total thicknesses of permeable and less permeable formations and are extremely useful as indicators of water-yielding zones. High resistivities generally are indicative of dense impermeable basalts and low resistivities are indicative of porous permeable zones most likely to contribute water to the borehole. The logs also provide a direct measurement of depth to water, depth of casing, and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>hole.</b> Spontaneous potential logs sometimes are inconsistent and unreliable and are used primarily for correlation with other logs. Conductivity and temperature logs provide a direct quantitative measure of water conductivity and water temperature and provide considerable insight into the depth, thickness, quality, and temperature of waters contained in the wells of Hawaii. Borehole conductivity and temperature data also aid in the interpretation of the complex dynamic Ghyben-Herzberg lens relationships. The caliper module, which provides a measure of the well diameter, has been subject to frequent mechanical breakdown, however, recent alterations of the caliper module's design should allow the device to perform to its expected capability. Borehole photography employed recently by the Board of Water Supply provides positive identification of most Hawaiian rock types. Correlation between the photologs and electric logs is very good.
