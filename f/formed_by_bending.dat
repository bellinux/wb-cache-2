5000|$|A {{standard}} channel letter is a three-dimensional graphic sign element. Its channel is fabricated from sheet metal, most often aluminum since {{it will not}} rust. A flat sheet of aluminum is typically cut on a table by a computer-controlled router, laser, or water jet, based on a vector-based art file (.cdr, [...]eps, [...]ai, [...]scv, [...]sci, or [...]fs). This creates {{the back of the}} channel and is the basis for the letter shape. The sides of the channel letter, called the returns, are then <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending</b> a 3 to 6 in [...] of aluminum sheet around the aluminum back. This return can be welded at the seam or flanged and riveted or, with a metal stitcher, can be fastened with galvanized or stainless wire to the back to create a solid can {{in the shape of the}} letter. The letter can is painted and fitted with any lighting components necessary such as neon gas tubes or light-emitting diode (LED) modules. A translucent plastic face usually of 3/16" [...] thick sheet acrylic fiber or polycarbonate is cut to fit the open face of the letter can. A [...] cap border is applied to its edges which gives the letter face a finished appearance and creates a fastening surface to attach it to the letter can. When illuminated at night, channel letters draw the eye of passers-by.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "Gothic" [...] for art was {{initially}} {{used as a}} synonym for [...] "Barbaric", and was therefore used pejoratively. Its critics saw this type of Medieval art as unrefined and too remote from the aesthetic proportions and shapes of Classical art. Renaissance authors believed that the Sack of Rome by the Gothic tribes in 410 had triggered {{the demise of the}} Classical world and all the values they held dear. In the 15th century, various Italian architects and writers complained that the new 'barbarian' styles filtering down from north of the Alps posed a similar threat to the classical revival promoted by the early Renaissance. The [...] "Gothic" [...] qualifier for this art was first used in Raphael's letter to Pope Leo X c. 1518 and was subsequently popularised by the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari, who used it as early as 1530, calling Gothic art a [...] "monstrous and barbarous" [...] "disorder". Raphael claimed that the pointed arches of northern architecture were an echo of the primitive huts the Germanic forest dwellers <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending</b> trees together - a myth which would resurface much later in a more positive sense in the writings of the German Romantic movement."Gothic art" [...] was strongly criticized by French authors such as Boileau, La Bruyère, Rousseau, before becoming a recognized form of art, and the wording becoming fixed.

With the step-shaped configuration of the shielding metal case, the coupling-free space for the RF components and battery can be provided not only below the antenna but also between the antenna and the top portion of the system ground plane. In addition, this structure has no protruded portions, thus allowing it very suitable to be concealed within the casing of the mobile device.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{reducing}} {{carbon dioxide}} is being demanded in terms of preventing global warming.

Although the Al-Mg-Si alloys have the advantage that they have hardenability during paint baking and do not cause stretcher strain patterns, poor formability is a crucial drawback. Bendability {{is one of the most}} important properties related to formability. However, there has been no assessing method having both speediness and quantitative reproducibility. In this study, we have developed a assessing method based on the electric resistance decrease arising from the decrease in conducting section when cracks are <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending.</b> Bendability was assessed by electrical resistance change as well as by crack density on the tension surface measured with an SEM. It was found that the new method have far greater speediness with the same quantitative reproducibility than the crack measurement method...|$|E
40|$|A {{low cost}} solar {{collector}} capable of operating at 150 - 200 C is described. An evacuated tube receiver {{is combined with}} asymmetric vee-trough concentrators. Peak efficiencies of about 40 % at 120 C and 30 % at 180 C are expected. Predicted future collector cost is $ 70 /sq m which yields an energy cost of $ 4. 20 /GJ at 120 C. During {{the development of the}} vee trough/evacuated tube collector both mathematical models to predict thermal and optical performance were developed and tests run to verify theory.

40|$|A {{developable}} surface can be <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending</b> or rolling a planar surface without stretch-ing or tearing; in other words, {{it can be}} developed or unrolled isometrically onto a plane. Developable surfaces are widely used in manufacturing with materials that are not amenable to stretching.

This thesis describes a new, user-friendly method of designing developable surfaces with a B-spline representation. First, it expands the work of Aumann in designing developable B-spline strip surfaces whose directrices lie on parallel planes. The computer program developed can assist in designing surfaces from curves of any degree with any number of segments, and includes a test for regularity. Second, a new method is developed which permits the design of developable surfaces with general three-dimensional space curves as directrices. The computer program permits design of degree (3 - 1) B-spline developable surfaces with two patches using a minimization process. The basis is provided to extend this to surfaces with more patches and higher degrees. A test is provided to ensure that th...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} tight bends (oroclines) are {{recognised}} in the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic southern New England Orogen between Brisbane and Newcastle, but their exact geometry and tectonic evolution are still debated. This contribution provides an outline of the different tectonic elements within the orogen and the relationships of these elements with the oroclinal structure. Pre-oroclinal tectonic elements were derived from a Devonian-Carboniferous subduction zone, and include forearc basin terranes and accretionary wedge rocks that are separated from each other by a narrow belt of serpentinites and high-pressure rocks. Rocks are predominantly steeply dipping and their map-view pattern delineates three bends: the Z-shaped Texas and Coifs Harbour oroclines {{in the north and}} the U-shaped Manning Orocline in the south. During the early Permian (298 - 288 Ma), the area was affected by widespread, mostly S-type, magmatism that heralded a period of crustal extension accompanied by the formation of sedimentary rift basins. The spatial distribution of early Permian granitoids mimics the shape of the oroclines, which further defines a fourth bend, the Nambucca Orocline. Whether these curvatures <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending</b> of a quasi-linear belt, or as primary early Permian arcuate features, is an unresolved question that warrants further paleomagnetic, geochronological and structural investigations...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for high precision metrology devices have increased rapidly in recent years. Furthermore, the applications are spreading to many new branches {{of science and}} technology. Hence new demands are appearing which are related not only to classical parameters such as precision and speed but also to other factors including {{the environment in which}} the measurements must be performed. In this paper we present a new device for measuring complex surface profiles of samples held under high vacuum conditions. The surface profile is obtained by scanning an optical sensor, held in air, across a standard view-port. The sensor has a lateral resolution of 25 View the &# 956; and a perpendicular distance resolution of 0. 12 View the &# 956; over a range of 3 mm. The maximum scanning area is a circle, 30 mm in diameter. The device was developed to characterize silicon wafers for use as mirrors for atom optical applications. The mirrors are <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending</b> the silicon under an applied electric field, which requires high vacuum conditions to prevent arc discharge.

40|$|We {{investigate}} energetics {{and structure}} of circular and polygonal single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using large scale molecular simulations on NAS SP 2, motivated by their unusual electronic and magnetic properties. The circular tori are <b>formed</b> <b>by</b> <b>bending</b> tube (n, n) whereas the polygonal tori are constructed by turning the joint of two tubes of (n, n), (n+ 1, n- 1) and (n+ 2, n- 2) with topological pentagon-heptagon defect, in which n= 5, 8 and 10. The strain energy of circular tori relative to straight tube decreases by 1 /D where D is torus diameter. As D increases, these tori change from buckling to an energetically stable state. The stable tori are perfect circular in both toroidal and tubular geometry with strain 10, 20 and 40 nm for torus (5, 5), (8, 8) and (10, 10). Polygonal tori, whose strain {{is proportional to the}} number of defects and 1 /D, are energetically stable even for D < 10 nm. However, their strain is higher than that of perfect circular tori. In addition, the local maxium strain of polygonal tori is much higher than that of perfect circulat tori. It is ~ 0. 03 eV/atom or less for perfect circular torus (5, 5), but 0. 13 and 0. 21 eV/atom for polygonal tori (6, 4) /(5, 5) and (7, 3) /(5, 5). Therefore, we conclude that the circular tori with no topological defects are more energetically stable and kinetically accessible than the polygonal tori containing the pentagon-heptagon defects for the laser-grown SWNTs and Fullerene crop circles. 1...|$|E
