5|$|The Klamath is {{the most}} {{important}} North American river south of the Columbia River for anadromous fish migration. Its salmon, steelhead and rainbow trout have adapted to unusually high water temperatures and acidity levels relative to other rivers in the Pacific Northwest. The numerous fish were a major source of food for Native Americans, who have inhabited the basin for at least 7,000years. The first Europeans to enter the Klamath River basin were fur trappers for the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1820s; they established the Siskiyou Trail along the Klamath and Trinity rivers into the Sacramento Valley. Within several decades of white settlement, native peoples were forced into reservations. During the latter days of the California Gold Rush, increasing numbers of miners began working the Klamath River and its tributaries, causing considerable <b>harm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Conflict and introduced diseases left indigenous tribes with only 10% of their original population.|$|E

In autumn of 1987, the Utne Reader published a letter by Murray Bookchin which claimed that Abbey, Garrett Hardin, and the members of Earth First! were racists and eco-terrorists. Abbey was extremely offended, and demanded a public apology, stating that he was neither racist nor a supporter of terrorism.

That version fails to indicate who must bear the cost of precaution; what constitutes a threat of harm; how much precaution is too much; and what should be done when environmental concerns and concern for human health pull in different directions. Whether this vagueness is a strength or weakness of the principle, depends on what purpose(s) the precautionary principle is supposed to serve. precautionary principle, cost-benefit analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{explosion}} of environmental statutes {{over the past}} forty years, giving rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field of environmental law, has created a critical and evolving question in our legal system as to how this comparatively new field of law intersects with the common law of torts. Defining {{the proper role of}} tort law in remedying environmental injuries is an important matter of public policy; the answer will determine what the tort system can and cannot achieve, inform what it should and should not achieve, and clarify which common law enforcement areas are actually voids. This information assists the judiciary on its role in addressing alleged injuries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> and guides <b>the</b> legislative and executive branches as to whether and when action is required to fashion a legal remedy. Tort law has historically provided the principal mechanism for remedying <b>harms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> <b>The</b> complexities of many modern environmental harms and the actual or perceived inadequacies of the common law, however, have led policy makers such as Congress to enact wide-ranging laws that provide legal remedies.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{there has been a}} minor renaissance in the use of common law actions, {{especially}} public and private nuisance, to address environmental problems not being adequately addressed by public law, such as climate change and natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. Ever since the explosion of public law in response to environmental problems in the 1970 s, the common law has provided remedies for personal injury and property damage that are not available under public law, and avenues of relief for problems that were ignored by public law. The common law and public law should not, however, be viewed as alternatives for addressing environmental problems, but as complements. There is an Escheresque quality <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relationship between public law and common law, in that public law continues to evolve in light of developments in the common law, while the common law is influenced, in turn, by developments in public law.
