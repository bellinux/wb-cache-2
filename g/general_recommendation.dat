The Commission currently works with six countries, all in Africa. In 2013 the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women’s participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas. Also in 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), a UN women’s rights committee, said in a <b>general</b> <b>recommendation</b> that states that have ratified the UN Women’s Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women’s rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} the growing medium is [...] to provide support and to store water, oxygen and {{dissolved}} minerals to feed the plant. In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium, [...] "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless growing medium, one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, {{with the addition of}} soil from earthworm castings. The <b>general</b> <b>recommendation</b> of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) [...] "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium.|$|E

[...] Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening. For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25.

2500|$|There are {{different}} views on {{where it is}} appropriate to differentiate between women and men, and one view is that the act of sexual intercourse is an act where this difference must be acknowledged, both due to the increased physical risks for the woman, and due to the historical context of women being systematically subjected to forced sexual intercourse while in a socially subordinated position (particularly within marriage and during war). States must also differentiate with regard to healthcare by ensuring that women's health - particularly with regard to reproductive health such as pregnancy and childbirth - is not neglected. According to the World Health Organization [...] "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women." [...] The refusal of states to acknowledge the specific needs of women, such as the necessity [...] of specific policies like the strong investment of states in reducing maternal mortality can be a form of discrimination. In this regard treating women and men similarly does not work because certain biological aspects such as menstruation, pregnancy, labor, childbirth, breastfeeding, as well as certain medical conditions, only affect women. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stipulates in its <b>General</b> <b>recommendation</b> No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating <b>general</b> <b>recommendation</b> No. 19 that states should [...] "Examine [...] gender neutral [...] laws [...] and [...] policies [...] to [...] ensure [...] that [...] they [...] do [...] not [...] create [...] or ...|$|E
2500|$|Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination says [...] "States Parties {{particularly}} condemn {{racial segregation}} and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices {{of this nature}} in territories under their jurisdiction." [...] A review of Israel's country report by the experts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination took issue {{with the establishment of}} Jewish-only settlements and stated [...] "The status of the settlements was clearly inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention which, as noted in the Committee's <b>General</b> <b>Recommendation</b> XIX, prohibited all forms of racial segregation in all countries. There was a consensus among publicists that the prohibition of racial discrimination, irrespective of territories, was an imperative norm of international law.|$|E
2500|$|As to the {{frequency}} of cleaning, research on this matter is inconclusive. That is, it has neither been shown that more frequent cleaning leads to better outcomes nor that it does not. A review of the research literature on the question concluded [...] "he research evidence is not of sufficient quality to reach any conclusions regarding the beneficial and adverse effects of routine scaling and polishing for periodontal health and regarding the effects of providing this intervention at different time intervals". Thus, any <b>general</b> <b>recommendation</b> for a frequency of routine cleaning (e.g. every six months, every year) has no empirical basis. Moreover, as economists have pointed out, private dentists (or other dental professionals) have an economic incentive to recommend frequent cleaning, because it increases their revenues.|$|E

It was my intention to have given a few specimens from those of the ancients; but I have already I fear taken up too much of the Reader's time. I have not animadverted upon such, alas! far too numerous, as are reprehensible from the want of moral rectitude in those who have composed them or given it to be understood that they should he so composed; boastful and haughty panegyrics ludicrously contradicting the solid remembrance of those who knew the deceased; shocking the common sense of mankind by their extravagance, and affronting the very altar with their impious falsehood.

6000|$|Some {{people do}} not like the word [...] "dogma." [...] Fortunately they are free, and there is an {{alternative}} for them. There are two things, and two things only, for the human mind, a dogma and a prejudice. The Middle Ages were a rational epoch, an age of doctrine. Our age is, at its best, a poetical epoch, an age of prejudice. A doctrine is a definite point; a prejudice is a direction. That an ox may be eaten, while a man should not be eaten, is a doctrine. That as little as possible of anything should be eaten is a prejudice; which is also sometimes called an ideal. Now a direction is always far more fantastic than a plan. I would rather have the most archaic map of the road to Brighton than a <b>general</b> <b>recommendation</b> to turn to the left. Straight lines that are not parallel must meet at last; but curves may recoil forever.
