You have {{to hand it to}} the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant,</b> Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't remember the last time I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E

60|$|Dorothy sat down, {{the light}} {{lingering}} in her eyes. She had revealed more of herself <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> than {{in all her}} life before.|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant's</b> {{confrontation}} {{he forgot}} {{all that had}} brought him homeward. He stared at her as one stares at a stranger whom one has greeted in mistake for an intimate friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't mind my asking these questions? And just in exchange, you solemn thing, I'll {{tell you}} a secret. It will be like {{shutting}} {{it up in the}} delightfullest, delicatest little rosebud of a box!" [...] <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant's</b> pause, {{it was as if a}} dream had passed swiftly, entrancingly, across the grave, smiling face.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> look <b>in</b> Rachel's eyes {{remained}} with me. My mind had flashed very rapidly from {{the realization of}} its significance to the thought that if one could be sure of that, then indeed one could pitch oneself high. Rachel, I felt, had something for me that I needed profoundly, without ever having known before that I needed it. She had the supreme gifts of belief and devotion; <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant's</b> gleam it seemed she held them out to me.|$|R
6000|$|A loud knock that echoed ominously {{through the}} mean chamber, fell <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> upon the door. And with it came a panting cry of-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> {{the clouds}} parted {{overhead}} {{and the sun}} {{came out in a}} blaze of golden glory. High above Gonzaga's head a lark burst into song.|$|E

60|$|The taunt {{performed}} its deadly work. For {{just one}} instant Lionel was carried {{off his feet}} by the luxury of his genuine indignation, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> one <b>instant</b> he was lost.|$|R
60|$|The Testimony of Anna.--Anna, a prophetess, one 'of a great age,--which {{departed}} {{not from}} the temple, but served God with fasting and prayers night and day. And she, coming <b>in</b> at <b>that</b> <b>instant,</b> gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem' (Luke 2:36-38).|$|R
60|$|His hand {{clutched}} her arm. For one instant she resisted his strength; and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant,</b> the flesh crushed under his fingers, {{she realized the}} fullness of his strength.|$|E
60|$|The flares held on high {{streamed}} {{right up}} without swaying, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> of profound calm the {{shadows on the}} brig's deck became as still as the men.|$|E
60|$|Cavalcanti {{took a step}} forward, {{his face}} purple with anger that this tipstaff ruffian should take such a tone with him. But <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> I seized his arm.|$|E
60|$|The utter {{hopelessness}} <b>that</b> {{was reflected}} <b>in</b> his face {{must have been}} the counterpart of what I myself felt, but <b>in</b> <b>that</b> brief <b>instant</b> I determined to hide my own misgivings that I might bolster up the courage of the others.|$|R
60|$|Nothing escaped him. He saw <b>in</b> an <b>instant,</b> <b>that</b> she {{was another}} slight of Mr Dombey's on his wife.|$|R
60|$|That {{last word}} lingered on his lips; it was uttered {{in a tone}} at once mournful and sweet, and her hand was unconsciously {{retained}} {{for a moment in}} his; but for a moment; and yet <b>in</b> <b>that</b> brief <b>instant</b> a thousand thoughts seemed to course through his brain.|$|R
60|$|He rose, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> {{of dignity}} I foresaw what {{was never to}} be--lawn sleeves {{encasing}} those loose, black arms. He had somehow wafted {{me back to my}} Confirmation.|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not notice}} when Tito left the room, or {{know how long it}} was before the door opened to admit Monna Brigida. But <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> she started up and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{crash of}} the thunder-clap {{followed}} the flash and seemed a part of it, {{so that it is}} hard to say whether Bert was the rather deafened or blinded <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b>|$|E
60|$|Three now faced me, but {{the girl}} was working {{her way to a}} point that would soon permit her to reduce the number by one at least.

60|$|Raoul made {{no reply}} to this, but stood {{watching}} {{the movement in}} silence. The reader will readily enough understand that Ithuel's remark was elicited {{by the appearance of}} the boats, which, five <b>in</b> number, at <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> pulled off from the frigate's side and proceeded steadily toward the felucca.|$|R
60|$|When I {{caught his}} eye I {{realized}} <b>in</b> an <b>instant</b> <b>that</b> the long deferred action, {{the beginning of our}} real fight was at hand.|$|R
60|$|La Boulaye's breath seemed <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> to forsake {{him and he}} grew paler than Nature and the writer's desk had {{fashioned}} him. Awkwardly {{he turned}} and made her a deep bow.|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> Euphrasia, {{with the}} {{instinct}} which love lends to her sex, had gone farther; indignation seized her--and the blame fell upon the woman. Austen's words, unconsciously, were {{an answer to}} her thoughts.|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{his arms}} relaxed, and gently and reverently he lowered Joan de Tany to the ground. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> Norman of Torn {{had learned the}} {{difference}} between friendship and love, and love and passion.|$|E
50|$|Ellsworth {{bicycles}} {{are unique}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> they use <b>Instant</b> Center Tracking technology, an Ellsworth-specific technology. Tony Ellsworth, {{founder of the}} company, holds nine patents related to ICT technology.|$|R
6000|$|... "Farewell," [...] he said, and as {{he again}} kissed her hand he bent his knee {{to the ground in}} reverence. Then he rose to go, {{pressing}} a little packet into her palm. Their eyes met, and the man saw, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> brief <b>instant,</b> deep <b>in</b> the azure depths of the girl's that which tumbled the structure of his new-found complacency about his ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wrath you {{not for the}} matter," [...] {{said the}} damsel; [...] "I will show you <b>in</b> an <b>instant</b> <b>that</b> I know more of you than you do of yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not answer}} that. Our eyes met, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> for me there was neither joy nor sorrow, {{sickness}} nor death, nor time nor space nor universe. It was she who turned away.|$|E
6000|$|<b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> flare {{she saw a}} man's face, young, smooth, {{with dark}} eyes gleaming beneath a broad hat. He stood like a figure of bronze while his match was burning, then exclaimed in breathless wonder: ...|$|E
6000|$|The sad {{blue eyes}} {{looked at him}} in patient sorrow; the low sweet voice answered--"Yes." [...] Only a look and a word--only the {{influence}} of an instant--and, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant,</b> Rufus's last doubts of her vanished! ...|$|E
50|$|He arrives {{late for}} dinner with Roberta and her friends. When she {{questions}} him, {{he admits to}} being with Julie, but he reassures her that Julie is very sick <b>in</b> bed. At <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> Julie shows up looking glamorous. Fed up, Roberta leaves, but Michael insists on staying because he has {{to keep an eye}} on the earrings.|$|R
6000|$|That brought Charlie to his feet, pale with {{something}} deeper than anger, for the recoil told him more plainly than the words {{how much he}} had fallen in her regard since yesterday. The memory of the happy moment when she gave the rose with <b>that</b> new softness <b>in</b> her eyes, the shy color, the sweet [...] "for my sake" [...] came back with sudden vividness, contrasting sharply with the now averted face, the hand outstretched to put him back, the shrinking figure, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>instant's</b> silence, poor Charlie realized what he had lost, for a girl's first thought of love is as delicate a thing as the rosy morning glory, which a breath of air can shatter. Only a hint of evil, only an hour's debasement for him, a moment's glimpse for her of the coarser pleasures men know, and the innocent heart, just opening to bless and to be blessed, closed again like a sensitive plant and shut him out perhaps forever.|$|R
6000|$|Just imagine {{with what}} terrible anxiety and eagerness Reddy looked towards that gate as he dashed {{out of the}} open door.

He was free! free! free! ...|$|R
