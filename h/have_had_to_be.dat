5|$|A crisis erupted {{over the}} writs of {{assistance}} on December 27, 1760, {{when the news}} of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All writs automatically expired {{six months after the}} death of the King, and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain valid.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} provide enough {{capacity}} for the line, the GG would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken off of the Queens Boulevard Line, and a turnback was necessary to provide a new terminal for the line. When the 63rd Street Connection opened in 2001, the Court Square station was rebuilt to provide a turnback facility for the line, which by then was renamed to G.|$|E
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant {{for more than just}} protection.|$|E
50|$|A strong {{assumption}} <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made, however, <b>to</b> justify use {{of expression}} (2). It <b>has</b> been {{assumed that the}} sample of detected pairs {{is representative of the}} pairs emitted by the source. That this assumption may not be true comprises the fair sampling loophole.|$|R
50|$|As use {{of mobile}} radio {{equipment}} <b>has</b> virtually exploded, channel spacing <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> narrowed again <b>to</b> 12.5-15 kHz with modulation deviation dropping to plus-or-minus 2.5 kilohertz. In order {{to fit into}} smaller, more economical vehicles, today's radios are trending toward radically smaller sizes than their tube-type ancestors.|$|R
25|$|On 12 April 1787 John Pile {{became her}} master. Joseph Humble {{replaced}} him in 1792, but Pile again assumed command on 14 March 1793. Lloyd's List reported on 29 April 1794 that Achilles, Pile, master, <b>had</b> run aground while leaving Liverpool for Quebec and <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unloaded <b>to</b> effect repairs.|$|R
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rebuilt {{if it were}} leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings {{removed and}} the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its {{attention back to the}} Main Street subway extension.|$|E
50|$|Alić {{subsequently}} {{described to}} the Bosnian television programme 60 minuta how his condition was {{brought about by}} the internal injuries he suffered in the brutal treatment he experienced in the death camp at Keraterm. He also described how he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smuggled out of the camp disguised as a woman.|$|R
50|$|Court of Appeal {{held there}} was no {{infringement}} of Insolvency Act 1986 section 4(4). If payment <b>had</b> reduced the price, there would <b>have,</b> because then in substance, funds would <b>have</b> come from the company, and the CVA would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> revoked.|$|R
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose <b>had</b> {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their design <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as <b>having</b> three decks in both castles. Although speculative, this layout {{is supported by}} the illustration in the Anthony Roll and the gun inventories.|$|R
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, {{and would have been}} connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Entrance 2's {{escalator}} entrance was to {{be located}} inside the Yorkshire Towers apartment building at 305 East 86th Street, on {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 86th Street. In 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found this to be unfeasible, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) revised the plan to two separate sidewalk entrances in front of the building. During the planning process, it was determined that building a new entrance within the Yorkshire Towers would be too expensive and logistically unfeasible. The apartments directly above the entrance's location would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> structurally underpinned during construction, and the Food Emporium supermarket location would have had to close {{to make way for the}} new entrance. Of the three alternatives presented for moving the entrance, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be two new escalator entrances on the north side of 86th Street, both flanking the semicircular driveway of Yorkshire Towers and facing away from the driveway. There was also a proposal to move the sidewalk escalator entrances to the south side of the street, as well as another proposal to build a new structure containing five elevators at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 86th Street, in a manner similar to Entrance 3 of the adjacent 72nd Street station.|$|E
50|$|Billabong Pro Mundaka {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tests of the ASP World Tour. It is celebrated in Mundaka from the beginning of October until mid October. In eight years the event <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suspended twice. First, in 2001, due to the 9/11 attacks in New York. Second, in 2005 by the hand of the man.|$|R
40|$|Advanced interventional {{laparoscopy}} <b>has</b> necessitated {{the development}} of a vast array of new equipment, but inevitably some of this equipment <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adapted <b>to</b> specific patient needs. Standard laparoscopic ports may be too short for use in obese patients. We describe a technique using a Portex endotracheal tube as an over-tube, which will overcome this problem...|$|R
25|$|By April {{the three}} {{warships}} were at Pulo Aura awaiting four East Indiamen coming from China. On 6 April Blenheim grounded on a sandbank in the Straits of Malacca. It took {{four days before}} she could <b>be</b> righted <b>to</b> enable her to return to Penang. Sir Edward Hughes took off her stores, though the heaviest <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrown overboard.|$|R
5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often with little regard for legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E
5|$|The IRT Pelham Line {{would be}} rebuilt to {{accommodate}} the wider BMT-IND cars to operate via the Second Avenue Line. The connection would provide the Pelham Line with direct service to Sixth Avenue, Second Avenue and Brooklyn. The station platforms, and third rail would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adjusted as they {{were put in place}} for the narrower IRT trains. However, the line was built with this conversion in mind. Westchester Yard would have been expanded {{to accommodate the}} additional trains added to the line. Since trains to the Pelham Line would no longer use the Lexington Avenue Line, there would be additional capacity for trains to run via the IRT White Plains Road Line and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. Improved service on the Pelham Line was project to stimulate growth in the East Bronx areas served by the line. This area of the East Bronx was seen to have great potential for industrial growth and other areas suitable for development as residential and recreational areas.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cold-blooded {{in order to get}} more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{nephew of}} the artist, Edouard Vibert (1867–1899) {{finished}} {{shortly before his}} death a series of copies of various Manet paintings for Madame Manet as mementos of the paintings that <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold after the death of the artist. Around the turn of the 20th century a copy of the Self-Portrait with Palette was attested that <b>was</b> ascribed <b>to</b> Vibert.|$|R
50|$|A {{medallion}} portrait was engraved for Threads {{from the}} Life of John Mills (1899). A collection of Ireland's books {{was presented in}} 1895 to the Manchester Free Reference Library by Thomas Read Wilkinson, and a catalogue was issued in 1898. Ireland <b>had</b> possessed a fine library, rich in editions of the Anatomy of Melancholy; but much of it <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold.|$|R

25|$|Taylor and Wiles’s proof {{relies on}} 20th-century techniques. Fermat's proof would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{elementary}} by comparison, given the mathematical {{knowledge of his}} time.|$|E
25|$|According to Deutsche Bahn, {{the already}} built {{structures}} {{have already been}} included in the regular maintenance program in order to ensure their functionality {{at the opening of the}} line. Early operations on the section between Erfurt and Ilmenau and further modifications of the project were proposed. Deutsche Bahn rejected early operations on the line. On the one hand, such regional services had not been ordered by the State of Thuringia; on the other hand, the safety and control technology that would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> installed would have become obsolete when the entire line was opened and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. The costs would have exceeded the benefits.|$|E
25|$|To {{comply with}} the {{regulations}} of the European Aviation Safety Agency, all gliders <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> registered and marked externally in the G-xxxx sequence since 2008, except for {{a small group of}} specified vintage types known by the name of the EASA document, Annex 2.|$|E
50|$|Also, the professor's usually {{faithful}} Irish Wolfhound <b>has</b> taken <b>to</b> attacking him on occasion, and <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chained up outside.

Holmes does not mention it aloud at the time, but these are intervals of nine days.|$|R
2500|$|The {{separate}} {{medical schools}} in Indiana <b>had</b> now been consolidated, marking the [...] "second founding" [...] of the Indiana University School of Medicine.

25|$|Wallops Island is {{currently}} experiencing beach erosion of 10 to 22 feet (3 to 7 meters) a year, {{due in part}} to the current sea level rise; some access roads and parking lots <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rebuilt several times over the past five years. NASA has responded by continually fortifying the shoreline with sand.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} and locations where {{the university has}} activities or which are significantly connected to its history are listed below.

25|$|Throughout his railway {{building}} career, but {{particularly on the}} South Devon and Cornwall Railways where economy was needed {{and there were many}} valleys to cross, Brunel made extensive use of wood for the construction of substantial viaducts; these <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced over the years as their primary material, Kyanised Baltic Pine, became uneconomical to obtain.|$|E
50|$|Above this, Obnorsky <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{translator}} and interpreter {{in a newly}} forming elite 7th Airborne brigade of the General Staff of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, {{to take part in}} the near-boundary clashes of southerners with the northerners (the way to the unification of Yemen was entirely complex) as well as between government forces and murtazaks, southern local armed opposition men, coming from abrod.|$|R
25|$|The {{state of}} North Carolina owns the North Carolina Railroad Company, {{which owns the}} land and the bridge.
