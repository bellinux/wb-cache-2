40|$|Effective {{reproduction}} {{is essential for}} species survival. Sexual reproduction depends upon functional gonads and reproductive ducts. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular model organism, but the genetic basis of zebrafish sex determination, gonad development, and reproductive tract development are not fully understood, and understanding this basis could inform about the evolutionary conservation of these genes {{and the use of}} zebrafish to investigate and treat reproductive diseases. In chapter I, I give a overview of sex determination systems, gonad development, and reproductive duct development in mammals and fish, and ask how sex is determined and how reproductive ducts develop in zebrafish. In chapter II, I used genome wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate if the genetic basis of sex determination in a variety of zebrafish strains [...] two ‘wild-type’ strains cultured for about 30 years in the lab, and four ‘natural’ strains, wild-type strains isolated directly or recently from nature in India [...] and identified a sex-associated region on zebrafish chromosome 4 in natural zebrafish strains that was lacking in the lab strains. In chapter III, I investigated whether or not wnt 4 a is important for zebrafish ovarian development, and found that wnt 4 a is expressed in the early bipotential gonad and that loss of wnt 4 a results in male-biased sex ratios, indicating that wnt 4 a is important for zebrafish ovarian development. In chapter IV, I investigated whether or not wnt 4 a is important for male reproductive duct development, and found that loss of wnt 4 a slows the formation of male reproductive ducts and prevents the male fused <b>ducti</b> <b>deferens</b> from connecting to the genital orifice in zebrafish males. Results further showed that wnt 4 a is expressed in tissue around the site where this connection should occur before and after the connection is formed, revealing a novel wnt 4 a phenotype in zebrafish that hasn’t been seen thus far, and indicating that wnt 4 a is necessary for proper male reproductive duct development in zebrafish.

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies were {{conducted}} to determine if high and low ejaculate volumes were as-sociated with differences in testicular weight and <b>ductus</b> (d.) <b>deferens</b> semen volumes. Mature male breeder turkeys were classified as low (=S. 22 ml) or high (>. 30 ml) semen producers. One week after or immediately after the last semen collection the turkeys were killed, testes weighed, and d. deferens and ejaculate semen volumes and sperm concentrations determined. Comparisons of low (LSP) and high (HSP) semen producers showed no differences in testes weights and sperm con-centration in d. deferens. However, LSP turkeys had a lower volume of semen in the d. deferens and ejaculated a lower percentage of that volume than did HSP turkeys (P<. 05). Although the sperm concentrations of HSP and LSP were the same, {{the total number of}} sperm in the ejaculate of LSP was less than the HSP and was also less when calculated {{as a percentage of the}} sperm in the ejaculate plus d. deferens. These studies indicate that both a decreased reservoir of semen in the d. deferens and a lower efficiency of removal of semen from the d. deferens contribute to the de-creased ejaculate volume of LSP...|$|R

5000|$|Ductuli Aberrantes.—A long narrow tube, the ductulus aberrans {{inferior}} (vas aberrans of Haller), is occasionally found {{connected with}} {{the lower part of}} the canal of the epididymis, or with the commencement of the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two {{or three}} of these {{accompany}} the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens,</b> and supply the epididymis, anastomosing with the artery of the ductus deferens; others pierce the back part of the tunica albuginea, and supply {{the substance of the}} testis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{peritoneum}} of {{the anterior}} pelvic wall covers the superior {{surface of the}} bladder, and {{on either side of}} this viscus forms a depression, termed the paravesical fossa, which is limited laterally by the fold of peritoneum covering the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Juvenile {{males have}} soft, small claspers and undeveloped testes with straight, thread-like ampullae <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens.</b> Adolescents' testes have {{increased}} weight and claspers are extended and calcified, but were still flexible.

50|$|The spermatic cord is the cord-like {{structure}} in males {{formed by the}} vas deferens (<b>ductus</b> <b>deferens)</b> and surrounding tissue that runs from the deep inguinal ring down to each testicle. Its serosal covering, the tunica vaginalis, {{is an extension of}} the peritoneum that passes through the transversalis fascia.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} {{branched}} tubular glands lined by simple columnar epithelium is an {{enlargement of the}} <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> in its terminal portion. These are typical tubular glands in ruminants, horses and dogs; absent in the cat and poorly developed in boars. The function of the white serous secretion is not known.|$|E
50|$|The artery {{arises from}} the {{superior}} vesical artery or the inferior vesical artery, which in turn {{arises from the}} anterior branch of the internal iliac artery. It accompanies the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> into the testis, where it anastomoses with the testicular artery. In this way it also supplies blood to the testis and epididymis.|$|E
5000|$|The veins {{emerge from}} the back of the testis, and receive tributaries from the epididymis; they unite and form a {{convoluted}} plexus, called the pampiniform plexus, which constitutes the greater mass of the spermatic cord; the vessels composing this plexus are very numerous, and ascend along the cord, in front of the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{vas deferens}} (Latin: [...] "carrying-away vessel"; plural: vasa deferentia), also called <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> (Latin: [...] "carrying-away duct"; plural: ductus deferentes), {{is part of}} the male {{reproductive}} system of many vertebrates; these vasa transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in anticipation of ejaculation. It is a partially coiled tube which ascends into the abdomen through the inguinal canal.|$|E
50|$|The testis has {{collateral}} {{blood supply}} from 1. the cremasteric artery (a {{branch of the}} inferior epigastric artery, which is {{a branch of the}} external iliac artery), and 2. the artery to the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{that are}} 46, XY {{and have been}} tested {{positive}} for mutations in their AMH or AMH receptor genes {{have been known to}} exhibit features typical of that which are exhibited in persistent müllerian duct syndrome {{due to the fact that}} the paramesonephric ducts fail to regress. When this happens the individuals develop structures that are derived from the paramesonephric duct, and also structures that are derived from the mesonephric duct. A male that has persistent müllerian duct syndrome may have an upper vagina, uterus, and uterine tubes as well as <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> along with male external genitalia. The female organs are in the correct anatomical position but the position of the testis varies. 60% to 70% of detected cases, both testes will lie in the normal position for the ovaries; about 20% to 30% of the time, one of the testis will lie within the inguinal hernial sac while in other cases both testes will lie within the same inguinal hernia sac. However whenever an individual exhibits persistent müllerian duct syndrome, the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> will run along the lateral sides of the uterus.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{umbilical}} fold is {{an important}} reference site with regards to hernia classification. A direct hernia occurs medial to the lateral umbilical fold, whereas an indirect hernia originates lateral to the fold. This later case {{is due to the}} placement of the opening of the deep inguinal ring in the space lateral to the lateral umbilical fold, which allows the passage of the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens,</b> testicular artery, and other components of the spermatic cord in men, or the round ligament of the uterus in women.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrocelectomy with Excision of the Hydrocele Sac: Incision of the {{hydrocele}} sac after complete {{mobilization of}} the hydrocele. Partial resection of the hydrocele sac, leaving {{a margin of}} 1-2 cm. Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis or <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens.</b> The edge of the hydrocele sac is oversewn for hemostasis (von Bergmann's technique) or the edges are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann's or Jaboulay's technique). Hydrocele surgery with excision of the hydrocele sac is useful for large or thick-walled hydroceles and multilocular hydroceles.|$|E
50|$|Each {{seminal vesicle}} {{consists}} of a single tube, coiled upon itself, and giving off several irregular cecal diverticula; the separate coils, {{as well as the}} diverticula, are connected together by fibrous tissue. When uncoiled, the tube is about the diameter of a quill, and varies in length from 10 to 15 cm.; it ends posteriorly in a cul-de-sac; its anterior extremity becomes constricted into a narrow straight duct called the excretory duct of seminal gland (or duct of the seminal vesicle), which joins with the corresponding <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> to form the ejaculatory duct.|$|E
50|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
50|$|The {{umbilical}} artery regresses after birth. A portion obliterates {{to become}} the medial umbilical ligament (be careful not to confuse this with the median umbilical ligament, a different structure that represents the remnant of the embryonic urachus). A portion remains open as {{a branch of the}} anterior division of the internal iliac artery. The umbilical artery is found in the pelvis, and gives rise to the superior vesical arteries. In males, it may also give rise to the artery to the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens</b> which can be supplied by the inferior vesical artery in some individuals.|$|E
50|$|At nine weeks, male {{differentiation}} of the gonads and the testes is well underway. Internal changes include {{the formation of}} the tubular seminar Chris tubules in the Rete testis from the primary sex cord. Developing on the outside surface of each testis is a Phibro muscular cord called the gubernaculum. This structure attaches to the inferior portion of the testis and extends to the labial sacral fold of the same side at the same time, a portion of the embryonic mesonephric duct adjacent to the testis becomes attached and convoluted informs the epididymis. Another portion of the mesonephretic duct becomes the <b>ductus</b> <b>deferens.</b>|$|E
