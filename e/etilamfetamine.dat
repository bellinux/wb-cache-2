50|$|<b>Etilamfetamine</b> (Apetinil, Adiparthrol), {{also known}} as N-ethylamphetamine, is a {{stimulant}} drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It was invented in the early 20th century and was subsequently used as an anorectic or appetite suppressant in the 1950s, but was not as commonly used as other amphetamines such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and benzphetamine, and was largely discontinued once newer drugs such as phenmetrazine were introduced.|$|E
