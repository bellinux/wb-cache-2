2500|$|The law {{relating}} to insolvency, bankruptcy and liquidation is {{regulated by the}} Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. [...] The act is broadly based upon the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom (without the changes brought into effect by the UK's Enterprise Act 2002), but modified in certain specific regards {{in relation to the}} jurisdiction's role as an offshore centre. [...] The Insolvency Act is [...] "predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights". [...] The legislation includes the ISDA model netting laws to facilitate set-off upon a credit event in <b>derivatives</b> <b>transactions.</b> [...] It also contains specific [...] "safe harbour" [...] provisions {{relating to}} vulnerable transactions (principally undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and voidable floating charges) on an insolvency, to protect structured finance transactions.|$|E
2500|$|An {{examination}} of the scale {{and nature of the}} various payments and <b>derivatives</b> <b>transactions</b> and the likely elasticity of response led [...] to conclude that attempts to raise a significant percentage of gross domestic product in revenue from a broad-based financial transactions tax are likely to fail both by raising much less revenue than expected and by generating far-reaching changes in economic behavior. They point out that, although the side effects would include a sizable restructuring of financial sector activity, this would not occur in ways corrective of the particular forms of financial overtrading that were most conspicuous in contributing to the ongoing financial crisis. Accordingly, such taxes likely deliver both less revenue and less efficiency benefits than have sometimes been claimed by some. On the other hand, they observe that such taxes may be less damaging than feared by others.|$|E

Depending on how the default contingency is accounted for, we list a total of ten different structuring styles. These include bi-partite structures between a bank and a counterparty, tri-partite structures with one margin lender in addition, quadripartite structures with two margin lenders and, most importantly, configurations where all <b>derivative</b> <b>transactions</b> are cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). We compare the various structuring styles under a number of criteria including consistency from an accounting standpoint, counterparty risk hedgeability, numerical complexity, transaction portability upon default, induced behaviour and macro-economic impact of the implied wealth allocation...|$|R

40|$|Using a hand-collected dataset of over 300 {{observations}} of large U.

Over {{half of our}} sample entities engage in <b>derivative</b> <b>transactions</b> and {{a vast majority of}} these transactions are intended to manage interest rate risk. Swaps, by far, are the most popular derivative instrument. In terms of the determinants of derivative usage, we find that the propensity to use derivatives as well as the extent of derivative usage is higher for municipalities that are larger and more financially constrained. We do not find growth to be related to municipal derivative usage. Contrary to suggestions made in the popular press, we fail to find managerial opportunism to be a significant factor in municipal derivative usage. We also find that more sophisticated managers of large municipalities and less sophisticated managers of small municipalities are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>derivative</b> <b>transactions...</b>|$|R
