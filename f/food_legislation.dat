40|$|Protecting {{human health}} in today's global food market is an {{important}} challenge and one which must be addressed through internationally recognized food safety systems. The overall responsibility for food safety is shared by all segments of the food system, including the various industry sectors, government regulatory agencies and consumers in general. Any threat to the food supply, whether by intentional or unintentional contamination could result in danger to health, considerable cost to food chain suppliers and could also affect trade. This paper will highlight some food safety management initiatives of three countries [...] Trinidad and Tobago; the Philippines, and Bangladesh in protecting the food supply from hazards. The initiatives of some non-governmental organizations in Trinidad and Tobago are presented. In the Philippines {{both the public and}} private sector are active in encouraging strict adherence to the <b>food</b> <b>legislations.</b> A non-government agency has successfully used inventions and innovative training kits under the “ 4 -in- 1 Food Safety Training system: 5 S, GAP (Good Agricultural Practice), GMP (Good Management Practices) and HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) in the last decade to help the food industries meet the safety and quality requirements of national and international trade.

A good example of this situation can be illustrated with baobab (Adansonia digitata).

50|$|For the Southern farmer a chief {{concrete}} evil was the crop-lien system, mortgages {{on their}} future crops for furnished supplies by which cotton farmers fell into debt to country merchants. In the North the farmer attacked {{a wide range}} of capitalistic legislation that hurt him, he believed, for the benefit of other classes, notably legislation sought by railways. Practically all the great organizations demanded the abolition of national banks, the free coinage of silver, a sufficient issue of government paper money, tariff revision, and a secret ballot (the last was soon realized). Only less commonly demanded were an income tax, taxation of evidence of debt, and government loans on lands. All of these were principles of the two great Alliances (the Northern and the Southern), as were also pure <b>food</b> <b>legislation,</b> abolition of landholding by aliens, reclamation of unused or unearned land grants (to railways, e.g.), and either rigid federal regulation of railways and other means of communication or government ownership thereof. The Southern Alliance put in the forefront a subtreasury scheme according to which cheap loans should be made by government from local sub-treasuries on non-perishable farm products (such as grain and cotton) stored in government warehouses; while the Northern Alliance demanded restriction of the liquor traffic and for (a short time) woman suffrage. Still other issues were a modification of the patent laws (e.g., to prevent the purchase of patents to stifle competition), postal currency exchange, the eight-hour day, inequitable taxation, the single tax on land, trusts, educational qualification for suffrage, direct popular election of federal judges, of senators, and of the president, special-interest lobbying.|$|E
