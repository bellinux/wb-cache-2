40|$|Driving {{simulators}} {{are practical}} simulation tools in studying vehicle behavior and driver reaction {{in a safe}} and controllable condition. The development of a real time driving simulator evolves into complex highly integrated and interdependent systems that require vast amount of computer memory and computational time. This paper provides a study of employing approximation techniques in optimizing the computationally expensive simulation systems. Using the approximation techniques, a surrogate model can be constructed and used <b>in</b> the <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> original codes. It can obviate the computational cost of highly integrated systems. A variety of approximation techniques {{can be used to}} simplify multidisciplinary simulations. In this paper, some well-known approximation techniques were reviewed including design of experiments, polynomial response surfaces, Kriging models and neural networks. A thorough review and study of various types of approximation techniques were made to construct efficient surrogate models for simulation subsystems. A surrogate assisted driving simulator (SADS) framework is then proposed that can significantly reduce the computational burden and achieve reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|We adapt an axiomatically derived {{measure of}} {{polarization}} due to Esteban and Ray (1994) to measure polarization of political preferences. Previous work used different {{measures such as}} variance, kurtosis, Cronbach's alpha, median distance to median and the mean distance between groups. Yet, none of these measures are theoretically connected to a notion of polarization. Although the initiation of the current one is <b>in</b> the <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> income inequality measurement, it is conceptually suitable for preferential polarization as well. This paper offers a methodology for that purpose. The second contribution of the paper is that we use the Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling to correct for differential-item functioning in estimating ideal points of the individuals. We use the American National Election Survey Data for years between 1984 - 2008 to implement the theory offered in the paper. Our findings {{suggest that there is}} not a statistically significant increasing trend in polarization in this time period in many issue dimensions but there is an upward trend in the latent ideology dimension which is significant during the 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} my {{dissertation}} thesis is "Venetian Legal Italian in the Modern Ages in Commissio ducis for Alvise Bragadin, 1589. " This theme has been chosen <b>in</b> the <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> the discovery at the State Archives of Tachov was found an original manuscript 194 which {{deserves to be}} known {{in the sphere of}} historians of Italian language as well as in academia in general. The original manuscript is entitled the Ducal commission for Alvise Bragadin, 1589, the only source of Venetian law in the Czech lands. It is a register of laws from the 15 th and 16 th centuries, with which the Doge Pasquale Cicogna nominates the patrician Alvise Bragadin to the office of rector of the city of Feltre, a town in Dominium of mainland, which belongs to the trevisian province. The legal register has two hundred double pages, contains 278 provisions partially written in medieval Latin and partially in regional Italian (va/gare). This work deals with Venetian register from a point of linguistic view: it describes the formation from legal Italian of 16 th century and its evolution while describing morphological components concerning this issue. ln the first section the aspect and the characteristics of the constitutional system of the Venetian Republic of the 15 th century are depicted.
