25|$|Some {{programming}} languages, like Pascal, use the ASCII apostrophe {{to delimit}} string literal. In JavaScript (and ECMAScript, which is nearly identical), Perl, PHP, and Python, {{and many other}} languages either the apostrophe or the double quote may be used, allowing string literals to contain the other character (but not to contain both without using an <b>escape</b> <b>character).</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{method has}} gained {{influence}} within North America, as most common computer filesystems make {{the use of}} slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \ and / as directory separators, but / {{is also used to}} introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an <b>escape</b> <b>character.</b> Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard American representation.|$|E
500|$|Strings {{delimited by}} single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks {{function}} identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\) as an <b>escape</b> <b>character.</b> String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as [...] "formatted string literals".|$|E

50|$|In {{computing}} and telecommunication, an <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> is {{a character}} which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> is a particular case of metacharacters. Generally, the judgment of whether something is an <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> or not depends on context.|$|E
50|$|The {{apostrophe}} (') is the <b>escape</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One {{method for}} {{avoiding}} delimiter collision {{is to use}} <b>escape</b> <b>characters.</b> From a language design standpoint, these are adequate, but they have drawbacks: ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} popular in USENET networks, {{which in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s, {{generally}} did not allow transmission of 8-bit <b>characters</b> or <b>escape</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Usual ways to <b>escape</b> <b>characters</b> in regex {{is using}} the {{backslash}} symbol (\). Another way is a double hyphen (--) which makes a total escaping of a row.|$|R

5000|$|Among other things, {{it must be}} {{possible}} to encode the character that normally terminates the string constant, plus {{there must be some}} way to specify the <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> itself. Escape sequences are not always pretty or easy to use, so many compilers also offer other means of solving the common problems. Escape sequences, however, solve every delimiter problem and most compilers interpret escape sequences. When an <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> is inside a string literal, it means [...] "this is the start of the escape sequence". Every escape sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an escape sequence varies. The <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> is on the top/left of the keyboard, but the editor will translate it, therefore it is not directly tapeable into a string. The backslash is used to represent the <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> in a string literal.|$|E

5000|$|In many {{programming}} languages, strings are delimited using quotes. In some cases, <b>escape</b> <b>characters</b> (and other methods) {{are used}} to avoid delimiter collision. Example : [...] "He said : \"Hello\"".|$|R
50|$|This {{encoding}} scheme allows the easy mixing of 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit Japanese {{without the need}} for the <b>escape</b> <b>characters</b> employed by ISO-2022-JP, which is based on the same character set standards.|$|R

50|$|Escape {{characters}} {{are part of}} the syntax for many programming languages, data formats, and communication protocols. For a given alphabet an escape character's purpose is to start character sequences (so named escape sequences), which have to be interpreted differently from the same characters occurring without the prefixed <b>escape</b> <b>character.</b> An <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> may not have its own meaning, so all escape sequences are of two or more characters.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, leaning toothpick syndrome (LTS) is {{the situation}} in which a quoted expression becomes unreadable because it contains a large number of <b>escape</b> <b>characters,</b> usually backslashes ("\"), to avoid delimiter collision.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to escape sequences and <b>escape</b> <b>characters,</b> padding delimiters provide yet {{another way to}} avoid delimiter collision. Visual Basic, for example, uses double quotes as delimiters. This is similar to escaping the delimiter.|$|R

50|$|XES is {{sometimes}} known as UDK, from User Defined Key, the character which introduces the printer command, usually the <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> (ESC).|$|E
50|$|Some {{programming}} languages {{also provide}} {{other ways to}} represent special characters in literals, without requiring an <b>escape</b> <b>character</b> (see e.g. delimiter collision).|$|E
50|$|A control {{character}} is a character that, in isolation, has some control function, such as carriage return (CR). Escape sequences, by contrast, consist {{of one or more}} <b>escape</b> <b>characters</b> which change the interpretation of subsequent characters.|$|R

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of Ascii85 is that encoded data may contain <b>escape</b> <b>characters</b> such as backslash and quote, which have special meaning in many programming languages {{and in some}} text-based protocols.
