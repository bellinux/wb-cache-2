6000|$|From the Strand {{he crossed}} Trafalgar Square into Pall Mall, {{and up the}} Haymarket into Piccadilly. He was very soon aware that he had wandered into a world whose ways were not his ways and {{with whom he had}} no kinship. Yet he set himself sedulously to observe them, {{conscious}} that what he saw represented a very large side of life. From the first he was aware of a certain difference in himself and his ways. The careless glance of a lounger on the pavement of Pall Mall filled him with a sudden anger. The man was wearing gloves, an article of dress which Trent ignored, and smoking a cigarette, which he loathed. Trent was carelessly dressed in a tweed suit and red tie, his critic wore a silk hat and frock coat, patent-leather boots, and a dark tie of <b>invisible</b> <b>pattern.</b> Yet Trent knew that he was a type of that class which would look upon him as an outsider, and a black sheep, until he had bought his standing. They would expect him to conform to their type, to learn to speak their jargon, to think with their puny brains and to see with their short-sighted eyes. At the [...] "Criterion" [...] he turned in and had a drink, and, bolder for the wine which he had swallowed at a gulp, he told himself that he would do nothing of the sort. He would not alter a jot. They must take him as he was, or leave him. He suffered his thoughts to dwell for a moment upon his wealth, on the years which had gone to the winning of it, on a certain nameless day, the memory of which even now sent sometimes the blood running colder through his veins, on the weaker men who had gone under that he might prosper. Now that it was his, he wanted the best possible value for it; it was the natural desire of the man to be uppermost in the bargain. The delights of the world behind, {{it seemed to him that}} he had already drained. The crushing of his rivals, the homage of his less successful competitors, the grosser pleasures of wine, the music-halls, and the unlimited spending of money amongst people whom he despised had long since palled upon him. He had a keen, strong desire to escape once and for ever from his surroundings. He lounged along, smoking a large cigar, keen-eyed and observant, laying up for himself a store of impressions, unconsciously irritated at every step by a sense of ostracism, of being in some indefinable manner without kinship and wholly apart from this world, in which it seemed natural now that he should find some place. He gazed at the great houses without respect or envy, at the men with a fierce contempt, at the women with a sore feeling that if by chance he should be brought into contact with any of them they would regard him as a sort of wild animal, to be humoured or avoided purely as a matter of self-interest. The very brightness and brilliancy of their toilettes, the rustling of their dresses, the trim elegance and daintiness which he was able to appreciate without being able to understand, only served to deepen his consciousness of the gulf which lay between him and them. They were of a world to which, even if he were permitted to enter it, he could not possibly belong. He returned such glances as fell upon him with fierce insolence; he was indeed somewhat of a strange figure in his ill-fitting and inappropriate clothes amongst a gathering of smart people. A lady looking at him through raised lorgnettes turned and whispered something with a smile to her companion--once before he had heard an audible titter from a little group of loiterers. He returned the glance with a lightning-like look of diabolical fierceness, and, turning round, stood upon the curbstone and called a hansom.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{determination}} of animal form {{depends on the}} coordination of events {{that lead to the}} morphological patterning of cells. This epigenetic view of development suggests that embryonic structures arise as a consequence of environmental influences acting on the properties of cells, rather than an unfolding of a completely genetically specified and preexisting <b>invisible</b> <b>pattern.</b> Specialized cells of developing multicellular organisms are surrounded by a complex extracellular matrix (ECM), comprised largely of different collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to augment live video based on the {{tracking}} of natural features, and the online estimation of the trinocular geometry. Previous without-marker approaches require the computation of camera pose to render virtual objects. The strength of our proposed method is that it doesn’t require tracking of camera pose, and exploits the usual advantages of marker-based approaches for a fast implementation. A 3 -view AR system is used to demonstrate our approach. It consists of an uncalibrated camera that moves freely inside the scene of interest, and of three reference frames taken {{at the time of}} system initialization. As the camera is moving, image features taken from an initial triplet set are tracked throughout the video sequence. And the trifocal tensor associated with each frame is estimated online. With this tensor, the square pattern that was visible in the reference frames is transferred to the video. This <b>invisible</b> <b>pattern</b> is then used by the ARToolkit to embed virtual objects. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel scheme to embed an {{invisible}} signature into an image to check image integrity and measure its distortion. The technique {{is based on}} the pseudo noise sequences and visual masking effects. The values of an image are modified by a pseudo noise signature which is shaped by the perceptual thresholds from masking effects. The method is robust and can gauge errors accurately up to half of the perceptual thresholds. It also readily identifies large image distortion. Experimental results after applying JPEG and white noise to the image are also reported. 1. INTRODUCTION We introduce a robust scheme to embed into an image an <b>invisible</b> <b>pattern</b> which is used to verify image integrity. Furthermore, the technique provides a distortion measurement indicating the amount of damage incurred upon an image. By exploiting limitations of the human visual system, the energy of the embedded pattern is maximized for robustness and yet is guaranteed to be perceptually invisible. Using mask [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When {{preparing}} {{a revision of}} the genus Babylonia for "Indo-Pacific Mollusca", edited by Dr. R. Tucker Abbott, we tried ultraviolet light to see {{the outline of the}} colour-pattern of some fossil species. Later on we saw the same method described by Mrs. Katherine Krueger (1971). Dr. H. E. Coomans of the Institute for Taxonomic Zoology (Zoological Museum), Amsterdam, called our attention to this method. We used an ultraviolet lamp UVSL- 15 of Ultra-Violet Products Inc., San Gabriel, California. Mr. Chr. Hoorn, photographer of our museum, found a method to photograph the normally <b>invisible</b> <b>pattern.</b> He used an orthochromatic film, Copex Ortho, Agfa-Gevaert, 120 din, in combination with a yellow filter. After having found a suitable specimen by previous examination with the lamp in a dark room, that shell was exposed to short and long wave ultraviolet together from four sides, each time during five minutes. As this resulted in some good photographs, these will be published here. We first show a recent and a fossil specimen of Babylonia spirata (L.) (pl. 1 figs. 1, 2). The recent one is from the Bay of Djakarta; the other is from the Young Neogene at Benkulen, Sumatra. There is general conformity in the colour-pattern of these two specimens, but also some differences are apparent. The spots along the sutural canal are relatively large in the fossil specimen and the other spots are conspicuously rounded and rather constant in size. The recent B. spirata, however, shows a great variability in the colour-pattern. The figured shell is the one in our collection which comes nearest to the fossil specimen. In Babylonia pangkaensis (Martin) 1) (pl. 1 figs. 3, 4) the colour-patter...|$|E

30|$|I {{will start}} with the {{evolving}} diversity of migration. Kymlicka refers to Vertovec’s (2007) notion of super-diversity. Since the 1980 s of the previous century, Vertovec argues, {{there has been a}} proliferation of migrant flows that are smaller in size, but which originate from a multitude of countries. The migrants settling in Western countries in the 21 st century {{come from all over the}} world, differ significantly in respect of socio-economic status, in motives for migration and in residence status. In addition, Western countries and cities are being confronted more and more with floating populations that stay temporarily, including highly skilled and low skilled labour migrants, asylum seekers, and irregular migrants (Goldin, Cameron, & Balarajan, 2011). Patterns of liquid migration are also becoming apparent within Europe. These flexible and partly <b>invisible</b> <b>patterns</b> of migration often go hand in hand with non-registration in the population register. Liquid migration is a typical form of European post-accession regular labour migration that is the consequence of open borders within the European Union, flexible labour markets, looser family relationships and cheap means of travel and communication (Engbersen & Snel, 2013). Liquid migration is characterized by non-permanent settlement. Migrants move back and forth from their source country to receiving countries or to multiple destination countries. The transnational migration field in which they strategically operate, generates a specific migratory habitus of ‘intentional unpredictability’ (Eade, Drinkwater, & Garapich, 2006; Engbersen, Leerkes, Grabowska-Lusińska, Snel, & Burgers, 2013).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{target of}} the Fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG- 4) {{is to reduce the}} rate of un-der-five {{mortality}} by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Despite substantial progress towards achieving the {{target of the}} MDG- 4 in Iran at the national level, differences at the sub-national levels should be taken into consideration. METHODS: The under-five mortality data available from the Deputy of Public Health, Kermanshah Universi-ty of Medical Sciences, was used in order to perform a time series analysis of the monthly under-five mortality rate (U 5 MR) from 2005 to 2012 in Kermanshah province in the west of Iran. After primary analysis, a season-al auto-regressive integrated moving average model was chosen as the best fitting model based on model se-lection criteria. RESULTS: The model was assessed and proved to be adequate in describing variations in the data. However, the unexpected presence of a stochastic increasing trend and a seasonal component with a periodicity of six months in the fitted model are very likely to be consequences of poor quality of data collection and reporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: The present work is the first attempt at time series modeling of the U 5 MR in Iran, and re-veals that improvement of under-five mortality data collection in health facilities and their corresponding sys-tems is a major challenge to fully achieving the MGD- 4 in Iran. Studies similar to the present work can en-hance the understanding of the <b>invisible</b> <b>patterns</b> in U 5 MR, monitor progress towards the MGD- 4, and predict the impact of future variations on the U 5 MR...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{question}} of the untranslatability of legal concepts and traditional examples of translations, such as contract / contrat / contratto / Vertrag and property / proprietà / propriété / Eigentum. It aims also at pointing out that while within the Western Legal Tradition it is customary to think of law primarily in written terms, in other legal traditions, such as in China or in Africa, this might not be the case, as the unwritten character of customary rules may prevail in the law in action. Furthermore, legal rules, whether oral or written, might be profoundly influenced by <b>invisible</b> <b>patterns</b> of ordering that need to be revealed before the rules are translated. Hence a necessary task in each legal translation process is to understand the culture in which the rules to be translated are rooted, an understanding that in some cases may prove of extreme importance. Lastly, the article looks at the myth of equivalence, a myth that seems to become “a chimera when legal translation has to face the numerous issues and challenges connected with European multilingualism”. Pozzo concludes by pointing out that in the European legal context, English is used as a “neutral or descriptive language” associated with a classic civil law background; it has reached the status of a lingua francaat the cost of becoming a Continental legal English which differs from British legal English. In the near future a new translation task could then prove necessary: translating EU-English into British English...|$|R
