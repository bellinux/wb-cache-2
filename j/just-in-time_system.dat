In February the company {{for the first time}} took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. McFlurry desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. McDonald's that same month said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new <b>just-in-time</b> <b>system,</b> dubbed [...] "Made for You", was in development {{for a number of years}} and aimed to deliver to customers [...] "fresher, hotter food"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to find how far the <b>Just-in-Time</b> <b>system</b> is being implemented by Portuguese manufacturing firms, as well as assessing its perception and its potential benefits by managers. First, several studies about the implementation of the <b>Just-in-Time</b> <b>system</b> in various countries over the past 25 years are reviewed, and then the descriptive survey research is reported. Data were collected from a mail questionnaire sent to a few hundred firms in Portugal. The findings show that the surveyed firms view the <b>Just-in-Time</b> <b>system</b> as a way to reduce inventories, to increase quality, and to eliminate waste. Despite this good perception, less than 6 % of the surveyed firms have the necessary conditions to successfully implement a <b>Just-in-Time</b> <b>system.</b> A significant practical implication of this study is that Portuguese firms should use Just-in-Time as a philosophy rather than as a solution for operations-related problems. Another contribution is to point out the most common difficulties for its implementation, so that Portuguese firms that want to do it can be prepared to overcome those difficulties...|$|E

Simultaneously, Japanese firms had the sense of urgency to rebuild its economy through export of manufactured goods.

Many western firms visited Japan to benchmark Japanese CWQC, Toyota’s <b>just-in-time</b> <b>system</b> (e.g., quality at the source and quick response systems), and bottom-up management systems (e.g., quality circles). Based on this new knowledge, U. S. firms developed the concept of total quality management (TQM) [10]. Many new innovative quality programs have since developed, such as Motorola’s Six Sigma, ISO 9000 series, Toyota’s Lean Management, and the like [11]. Thus, quality became not simply the concern of the manufacturing process (Little q) but the strategic imperative for the entire organization (Big Q) [5].|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study an {{unreliable}} bottleneck production/inventory {{system with a}} constant production and demand rate that is subject to random disruptions. We assume that the restoration times are constant, the time between breakdowns is exponential, the production setup cost and/or setup time is positive, and excess demand is backordered. We propose an (s, S) production policy for such systems and develop expressions for the operating characteristics of the system. The properties of the policy parameters that minimize the expected total cost rate are investigated and a procedure for finding their optimal values is developed. In addition, we devise and test a simple heuristic procedure for finding near optimal production policies. The results of a numerical experiment suggest that (i) setup cost reduction is more effective in reducing total operating cost when the production system is more reliable, (ii) setup cost reduction in unreliable production systems results in higher optimal safety stock level, and (iii) proper determination of the safety stock levels is extremely important in <b>Just-in-Time</b> <b>systems,</b> which are susceptible to disruptions. production inventory systems, random disruptions, operating characteristics, stocking policies...|$|R
