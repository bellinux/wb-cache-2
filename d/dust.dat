The negative effects of <b>dust</b> exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon <b>dust</b> cloud exists {{around the}} Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon <b>dust</b> above the Moon. The <b>dust</b> stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of <b>dust</b> are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The <b>dust</b> measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar <b>Dust</b> EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon <b>dust</b> particle each minute. <b>Dust</b> particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris.

5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of <b>dust.</b> This <b>dust</b> {{is likely to be the}} result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System.

5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} <b>dust</b> around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with <b>dust</b> particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this <b>dust</b> is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the <b>dust</b> would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the <b>dust</b> is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E

The sources {{of both the}} <b>dust</b> and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The <b>dust</b> is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and <b>dust</b> from the troposphere are also possibilities.

5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to <b>dust</b> storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight <b>dust</b> storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to <b>dust</b> storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. <b>Dust</b> storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. <b>Dust</b> storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These <b>dust</b> storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during <b>dust</b> storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, <b>dust</b> storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When <b>dust</b> from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African <b>dust</b> that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, <b>dust</b> outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the <b>dust</b> transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. <b>Dust</b> events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar <b>dust</b> plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E
40|$|The metal <b>dusting</b> {{behavior}} of three ferrous alloys with varying Cr content (2. 3 %, 8. 6 %, and 20. 1 % by weight) {{has been studied}} in carbonaceous atmospheres where the activity of carbon is greater than 1. Failures due to metal <b>dusting</b> {{have been reported in}} petrochemical, chemical industries, nuclear reactors and solid oxide fuel cells. It is estimated that financial losses in hydrogen industry alone due to metal <b>dusting</b> related maintenance problems is estimated to be around $ 300 million annually. Two atmospheres with varying water vapor contents (23 and 2. 3 %) have been used for the study to understand the role of vapor during metal <b>dusting.</b> ^ Low Cr alloy, T 22, showed extensive surface degradation and pitting, while increasing Cr content showed improved resistance to metal <b>dusting</b> for T 91 (medium Cr) and 800 (high Cr) alloys due to the formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal <b>dusting.</b> Resistance to metal <b>dusting</b> also improved in atmosphere with higher vapor content. Presence of high vapor content in the atmosphere favors the formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal <b>dusting</b> and these scales not only delay the ingress of carbon into the alloy matrix but also offer resistance to carbon diffusion thus improving the overall resistance of the alloys against metal <b>dusting.</b> ^ A combination of high Cr content in the alloy and high vapor content in the atmosphere is favorable for formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal <b>dusting</b> and this improves the resistance of the alloys to metal <b>dusting</b> corrosion. ...|$|R
40|$|Toxic {{potency of}} quartz-containing <b>dusts,</b> {{including}} coal mine <b>dusts,</b> is usually inhibited by protective clay mineral layers {{on the surface}} of quartz particles. This investigation of 11 <b>dusts</b> recovered from lungs of coal miners with different silicosis grade shows that such layers persist during longterm contact with human lung tissues. On the other hand, the results suggest that an apparently preferential release of iron occurred in lungs with massive fibrosis.

5|$|<b>Dust</b> and {{possibly}} water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a {{process by which}} stellar radiation causes <b>dust</b> grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson effect. At the same time, these <b>dust</b> particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale {{for all of the}} <b>dust</b> in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current <b>dust</b> disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal <b>dust</b> may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This <b>dust</b> is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the <b>dust</b> grains are taken into account, the <b>dust</b> will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate <b>dust</b> is assumed. Inside this radius, the <b>dust</b> must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E

5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic <b>dust.</b> The first, the zodiacal <b>dust</b> cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light.

The second <b>dust</b> cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>dust</b> bands is less problematic. The <b>dust</b> has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while the <b>dust</b> reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create <b>dust</b> bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, the <b>dust</b> bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams of}} <b>dust</b> and gas each {{form their own}} {{distinct}} tail, pointing in slightly different directions.

At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is <b>dust,</b> following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and <b>dust</b> tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E
