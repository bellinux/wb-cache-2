40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 The dull, silvery <b>doors</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rush, whereupon I was {{attacked}} by the rank brine forcing its way up my nostrils; the stench clinging to and burying itself {{in the folds of}} my clothes. Recoiling to no avail I inexorably moved forward, finding myself involuntarily at the forefront of a mass of bodies cramming themselves into an already overstuffed car. Fortunately I was pushed toward an open seat, its hard and unforgiving surface giving a welcome reprieve to weary, aching limbs as I plopped down exhausted. 2 ̆...|$|E
60|$|Upon this {{pleasant}} conference Cliff Belden unexpectedly burst. Pushing the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slam, he confronted Berrie {{with dark}} and angry face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Voila!' she darts {{down at the}} ring, and flings the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crash, in her goblin energy, {{though it}} is no light weight. 'Voila les oubliettes! Voila les oubliettes! Subterranean! Frightful! Black! Terrible! Deadly! Les oubliettes de l'Inquisition!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad," [...] he called, {{tapping on}} the window. Then {{he saw his}} mother and Alice. They had started up from packing. One glance at the {{suffering}} expressed in his mother's face was enough to steady Pan. The <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> jerk.|$|R
60|$|After {{leaving them}} Frank {{drove to the}} {{residence}} of Sir James Ruthven in Eaton Square. Frank sent in his name and was shown up to the drawing room. A minute later the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crash and his old schoolfellow rushed in.|$|R
60|$|Jeff did {{not feel}} quite so sure on that point, for he had counted on <b>a</b> long tete-a-tete <b>with</b> his old friend. He took care, however, to conceal his disappointment, and before {{he had time to}} reply, the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crash.|$|R
50|$|In this Halloween special, Sunshine girl, Kat and Nolan visit {{a haunted}} house. When they arrive, {{they find the}} <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> note {{indicating}} that the owner have fled from the house. They go inside anyway and look around, {{which turns out to}} be a bad idea, especially for Nolan.|$|R
60|$|He left her. The {{sound of}} her frightened snivel aged him. He tiptoed to the barn door, eying a light in the farm-house. He reached far up to the latch of the broad door {{and pulled out the}} wooden pin. The latch slipped noisily from its staple. The <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> groaning creek and banged against the barn.|$|R
50|$|In {{a dynamic}} entry situation, {{a team of}} special police (such as SWAT) try to clear a room quickly and decisively. For example, one member would smash the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{battering}} ram, then step aside as the first team member wielding the shield entered the room and protected the door. The other team members would enter behind him and {{take control of the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lewson's face brightened in an instant; {{she threw}} the <b>door</b> wide <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glad cry of recognition.|$|R
60|$|The hall <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single sweep. Blinky stood framed there, wild eyed. And {{the next}} instant Dick Hardman {{staggered}} from that closet. He had both hands pressed to his abdomen. Blood poured out in a stream. Pan heard strange watery sounds. Hardman reeled out into the hall, groaning. He slipped along the wall. Pan leaped, to see him slide down into a widening pool of blood.|$|R
6000|$|An eloquent sort {{of silence}} {{filled the room}} for a moment, and a ray of {{sunshine}} glanced from the silver tankard to the bright head bent over the chest, as if to gild {{the first page of}} the romance which is as fresh and sweet to-day as when the stately George wooed his beloved Martha. A shrill voice suddenly broke that delicious pause, exclaiming, as <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How stupid of me; it is {{the head}} of a screw.' Whatever mysterious {{contrivance}} had originally existed for opening the puny cupboard of the cabinet, it had at some time been broken, and this rough substitute provided. Stimulated curiosity would not allow her to recede now. She fetched a screwdriver, withdrew the screw, pulled the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> penknife, and found inside a cavity about ten inches square. The cavity contained-- ...|$|R
60|$|Another hour went by, {{and once}} more the street <b>door</b> was <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> key, to be {{carefully}} shut when the visitor had entered.|$|R
60|$|For {{several seconds}} there was silence, then Dick {{walked down the}} last step of the {{companionway}} and threw the <b>door</b> below <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang.|$|R
60|$|She {{had a way}} {{of passing}} her hands over and under one another as she spoke, that was not only tidy but propitiatory; so I asked her if I might look at her little sitting-room? She willingly replied Yes, and we went into it together: she leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eye as I {{understood}} to the social proprieties. The door opening at once into the room without any intervening entry, even scandal must have been silenced by the precaution.|$|R
6000|$|The new-comers were {{received}} with universal approbation, and Mr Bonney bustled {{up to the}} top of the table, took off his hat, ran his fingers through his hair, and knocked a hackney-coachman's knock on the table <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little hammer: whereat several gentlemen cried 'Hear!' and nodded slightly to each other, as much as to say what spirited conduct that was. Just at this moment, <b>a</b> waiter, feverish <b>with</b> agitation, tore into the room, and throwing the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crash, shouted 'Sir Matthew Pupker!' ...|$|R
60|$|The cellar <b>door</b> flew <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> booming sound, {{and then}} he heard the noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming {{straight}} towards his door.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> was flung <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crash, and <b>a</b> hearty youth <b>with</b> glowing eyes strode in.|$|R
6000|$|As {{she spoke}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong reek of tobacco, in came {{the two other}} gentlemen. [...] "Well, Rector, have you given in?" [...] asked the Captain. [...] "Is Lady Rosamond to mount the pulpit henceforth?" ...|$|R
60|$|Don Jose replied only <b>with</b> <b>a</b> melancholy smile, {{and then}} going to the <b>door,</b> <b>opened</b> it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bowed head and respectful courtesy. At the act, Polly plucked up courage again, and <b>with</b> it <b>a</b> slight dash of her old audacity.|$|R
50|$|Entering - The {{first task}} is to enter the rooms, which have all been boarded up on the outside. Whereas Matt enters easily by kicking the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> from behind the boards, Deen tries to prod the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hockey stick before {{changing}} gears and cutting the boards <b>with</b> <b>a</b> circular saw (as revealed in the following episode the show's crew stopped him halfway through when he {{was found to be}} holding his hand mere inches from the blade). Cory gets in by ripping all the wood apart <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chain saw. Simon and Angela both enter by undoing the screws holding the boards to the door frame, but Simon finishes much faster.|$|R
2500|$|A {{different}} {{variation of}} the action RPG formula was popularized by Diablo (1996), {{where the majority of}} commands—such as moving and attacking—are executed using mouse clicks rather than via menus, though learned spells can also be assigned to hotkeys. In many action RPGs, non-player characters serve only one purpose, be it to buy or sell items or upgrade the player's abilities, or issue them with combat-centric quests. Problems players face also often have an action-based solution, such as breaking <b>a</b> wooden <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> axe rather than finding the key needed to unlock it, though some games place greater emphasis on character attributes such as a [...] "lockpicking" [...] skill and puzzle-solving.|$|R
60|$|The key {{was turned}} noiselessly in the lock; {{he raised the}} latch, and the <b>door</b> swung <b>open</b> <b>with</b> never <b>a</b> creak.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>door</b> flew <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bounce, and two hot, wild-locked boys, dust {{everywhere}} {{except in}} their merry blue eyes, burst in, and tumbled on their chairs. 'I say--isn't it a horrid sell? we ain't {{to have a}} holiday for Squire's wedding.--Come, Fee, give us some grub.' ...|$|R
60|$|The boy {{knocked at}} a door, and the <b>door</b> {{promptly}} <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spring and a click. A parlour door within a small entry stood open, and disclosed a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting {{on a little}} low old-fashioned arm-chair, which {{had a kind of}} little working bench before it.|$|R
60|$|The boy stood, for a moment, really bereft, by the {{apprehension}} he had conjured up, of {{the power}} to move. The footsteps drew nearer, the <b>door</b> was <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hasty hand, and the child herself, pale and breathless, and hastily wrapped in a few disordered garments, hurried into the room.|$|R
500|$|Tony, Carmela, and AJ {{meet for}} dinner, while the Journey song [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...] {{plays in the}} background. The camera cuts away from the Soprano family and {{presents}} vignettes of other diners. As the tension increases, Meadow is shown struggling with parking then crossing {{the street to the}} restaurant. A man, who had been previously shown at the counter specifically taking notice of Tony, is shown entering the restroom, the door of which is directly facing and approximately 90 degrees to the table at which Tony and his family are sitting. As Meadow walks up to the door, the screen goes to Tony. The diner <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bell ringing, Tony looks up and the show smash cuts to black and after a few seconds the credits roll in silence.|$|R
60|$|She {{remembered that}} her train started exactly at that hour. The <b>door</b> was <b>opened,</b> and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little {{wave of the}} hand she disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} very freshly {{the mood}} of our departure from London, the platform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock overhead, the bustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of newsboys and boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends seeing travellers off by the boat train. Isabel sat very quiet and still in the compartment, and I stood upon the platform <b>with</b> the <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> curious reluctance to take the last step that should sever me from London's ground. I showed our tickets, and bought a handful of red roses for her. At last came the guards crying: [...] "Take your seats," [...] and I got in {{and closed the door}} on me. We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to ourselves. I let down the window and stared out.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} a {{prisoner}} in the closet, the door of which was an old fashioned one and thick. But by bracing his feet against the back wall, Dick got a firm hold and soon his shoulder on the barrier caused it to bend and creak. Then the lock gave way and the <b>door</b> flew <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> was <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rapidity {{that gave}} the {{impression}} that they had been watched, but it was by a very untidy-looking small maid, and the parlour into which they were turned had most manifestly been lately used as the family dining-room, and was redolent of a mixture of onion, cabbage, and other indescribable odours.|$|R
60|$|The Shipping-Master {{led the way}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mincing gait {{around the}} whole system of desks to a tall and important-looking <b>door,</b> which he <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deferential action of the arm.|$|R
60|$|At {{that stage}} <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> below <b>with</b> <b>a</b> certain emphasis, and Mr. Nicholson was seen solemnly to descend the stairs, and pass {{into his own}} apartment. Alexander followed, quaking inwardly, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steady face. He knocked, was bidden to enter, and found his father {{standing}} in front of the forced drawer, to which he pointed as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|Horrocks {{held the}} <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{ceremonial}} politeness unusual in him towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut's light footfall and her husband's heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage together. The front door slammed heavily. She {{went to the}} window, moving slowly, and stood watching, leaning forward. The two men appeared {{for a moment at}} the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know. Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her eyes-wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her attitude scarcely changed.|$|R
60|$|It brought Pedro in <b>with</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary, uncouth, primeval impetuosity. The <b>door</b> flew <b>open</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clatter, and {{the wild}} figure it {{disclosed}} seemed anxious to devastate the room in leaps and bounds; but Ricardo raised his open palm, and the creature came in quietly. His enormous half-closed paws swung to and fro a little {{in front of his}} bowed trunk as he walked. Ricardo looked on truculently.|$|R
