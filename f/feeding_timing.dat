40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{responses}} of insects to elevated carbon dioxide {{have been made}} using short-term exposures to treated food plants and have involved measurements of responses in growth, reproduction, food consumption and efficiencies of conversion at specific stages in the life cycle. These will be reviewed {{in the light of}} longer-term studies recently published where whole generations have been reared in chambers with simultaneous treatment of plants and where insects have been free to select their food and microenvironment. Factors such as seasonal change in plants, choice of food plant, mode of <b>feeding,</b> <b>timing</b> of exposure, temperature, the role of natural enemies are considered and the whole placed in the context of other aspects of climate change. It is concluded that in studies to date, the only feeding guild in which some species have shown increases in population density in elevated carbon dioxide are the phloem feeders. Chewing insects (both free-living,and mining) generally have shown no change or reduction in abundance, though relative abundance may be greatly affected. Compensatory feeding is common in these groups...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{research}} {{suggest that}} mothers are more child-oriented than fathers. Therefore, {{in the absence}} of fathers, mothers may use their increased autonomy to redirect household resources to their children. Since mothers who head their own households may differ from those who do not, I control for maternal selectivity by studying the behavior of women in communities with high rates of male migration. This research addresses two issues: whether there are gains in maternal autonomy associated with male migration, and whether such gains result in better child health. Survey and ethnographic data collected in a small Mexican rural community with high rates of male out-migration are used to answer the first question. To address the second one, I study differences in duration of breast <b>feeding,</b> <b>timing</b> of vaccinations, and food allocations between children of migrant and non-migrant fathers. Simultaneous equations techniques and fixed-effects procedures are used at the community and household levels to test the hypothesis that {{in the absence of}} fathers, children receive more health-related resources. The data used to address the second question were collected in 5 neighboring communities, including the small village used to study gains in maternal autonomy. The results indicate that mothers do gain some autonomy in the use of household resources as a result of male migration, and that those gains are enduring. However, such autonomy does not result in enhanced allocation of health-related resources to children. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{breast-feeding}} practices {{over the first}} 6 months of life among a cohort of urban poor infants in southern Brazil indicated that the median duration of breast-feeding was 18 weeks, and at 6 months 41 % of the infants were still being breast-fed. The duration of breast-feeding {{was significantly associated with}} the following: the infant's sex, mother's colour, type of first <b>feed,</b> <b>timing</b> of the first breast-feed, breast-feeding regimen and frequency of breast-feeding at 1 month, and the use of hormonal contraceptives by the mother. The following were significant risk factors for early termination of breast-feeding: the infant's sex, type of first feed, use of supplementary feeds, frequency of breast-feeding, feeding regimen, weight-for-age, and weight-for-age after controlling for birth weight. Dissatisfaction with their infant's growth rate was the most frequent reason given by mothers for supplementing the diets of infants who were exclusively breast-fed in the first 3 months of life. Also, the mothers' perception that their milk output was inadequate was the most frequent reason expressed for stopping breast-feeding in the first 4 months. The roles of health services and family support in providing favourable conditions for increasing the duration of breast-feeding in the study population are discussed, as well as the possibility of bias being introduced into studies of the relationship between infant feeding and growth by the effect of the infant's rate of growth on the mother's decision to continue breast-feeding...|$|R

The FPGA should contain the functionality of a TDC and should provide fast data links using multi-GBit/s transceivers. The TDC core that was developed provides 5 bit time measurements for 32 channels with a bin size of 780 ps. The TDC has the required time resolution of better than 1 ns. This was achieved by manually placing every logic element of the TDC channels and with an iterative procedure <b>feeding</b> <b>timing</b> measurements back to the Place&Route step of the router software. A transceiver and TDC card, and an adapter board for the existing readout electronics was developed. Both boards were used successfully to read out drift times from an Outer Tracker straw-tube module in a cosmic setup. To qualify the proposed electronics for the expected radiation levels an irradiation test with 22 MeV protons and two FPGA boards was performed up to a total ionization dose of 30 Mrad. Both chips sustained the irradiation expected for the full life time of the upgraded LHCb detector of up to 30 krad. After an irradiation dose of 150 krad the first deteriorations of the performance of the chips were observed. The proton cross section for configuration bit flips was determined to be 1. 6 * 10 ^ 16 cm^ 2 per bit.

40|$|The PREVASC study {{addresses}} the primary prevention of asthma in infants and small children. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate whether a multifaceted prenatally started intervention strategy in high-risk infants leads to a decrease in the occurrence of (severe) asthma and whether a refinement of the prevention strategy leads to an increase in the adherence to the prevention program. The primary prevention program includes house dust mite impermeable bed coverings, education on breast feeding, hypoallergenic <b>feeding,</b> <b>timing</b> of introduction of solid food and smoking cessation. A total of 888 infants were prenatally included. By the time of inclusion the mothers were 3 - 7 months pregnant. About 27 infants were excluded from the study and 18 dropped out. Of the remaining 843 infants 535 had a first-degree familial predisposition of asthma (high-risk group), whereas a reference group of 308 (162 boys) infants was not predisposed for asthma in the first-degree (low-risk group). To evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of the preventive intervention, 222 (118 boys) infants of the high-risk group allocated to the intervention group and 221 (112 boys) allocated to a control group are followed up. The low-risk infants served as controls to evaluate the predictive value of high risk (first-degree familial predisposition of asthma). The infants are followed from the prenatal stage until they reach the age of 6 yr. The remaining 92 high-risk infants were included in an optimized randomized-clinical adherence trial (RCAT).

40|$|Objectives: {{to examine}} breast feeding sell-efficacy and {{identify}} its predictors among expectant Chinese {{mothers in the}} antenatal period. Design and setting: a cross-sectional descriptive questionnaire survey was conducted in the antenatal clinics of three university hospitals in China between September and December 2011. Participants: expectant mothers planning to breast teed, and who were at least 18 years () rage, expecting a single, healthy, full-term baby, and competent in Mandarin (n= 201). Measurements: a socio-demographic data sheet, the Chinese version of the Breastfeeding Sell-Efficacy Scale, and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Findings: the expectant Chinese mothers reported moderate levels of breast feeding self-efficacy. Expectant mothers who had had previous experience in breast feeding, who had watched other mothers breast feed their infants, or {{who had made the}} decision to breast feed earlier reported higher breast feeding self-efficacy. Expectant mothers perceived social support, perceived attitude of significant others, including husband, mothers, and friends, towards breast feeding are correlated with breast feeding self-efficacy. The best-fit regression analysis revealed five variables that explained 34 % of the variance in breast feeding self-efficacy in the antenatal period: perceived social support, previous experience of breast feeding, previous experience of watching others breast <b>feed,</b> <b>timing</b> of maternal decision to breast feed, and perceived husband's attitude towards breast feeding. Conclusions: this study highlighted the importance of improving Chinese mothers' breast feeding self-efficacy by considering the main predictors found in this study. Implications for practice: health care professionals could develop strategies to promote breast feeding self-efficacy, such as providing opportunities for expectant mothers to learn from others' successful experience, adopt a family-centred approach in the provision of breast feeding education, provide breast feeding education at the beginning of pregnancy or even earlier, and rally comprehensive social support for expectant mothers.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the updated {{results of the}} preliminary reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) analysis of selected waste feed delivery (WFD) operations to be performed by the Tank Farm Contractor (TFC) during Phase I activities {{in support of the}} Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). For planning purposes, waste feed tanks are being divided into five classes in accordance with the type of waste in each tank and the activities required to retrieve, qualify, and transfer waste feed. This report reflects the baseline design and operating concept, as of the beginning of Fiscal Year 2000, for the delivery of feed from three of these classes, represented by source tanks 241 -AN- 102, 241 -AZ- 101 and 241 -AN- 105. The preliminary RAM analysis quantifies the potential schedule delay associated with operations and maintenance (OBM) field activities needed to accomplish these operations. The RAM analysis is preliminary because the system design, process definition, and activity planning {{are in a state of}} evolution. The results are being used to support the continuing development of an O&M Concept tailored to the unique requirements of the WFD Program, which is being documented in various volumes of the Waste Feed Delivery Technical Basis (Carlson. 1999, Rasmussen 1999, and Orme 2000). The waste feed provided to the WTP must: (1) meet limits for chemical and radioactive constituents based on pre-established compositional envelopes (i. e., feed quality); (2) be in acceptable quantities within a prescribed sequence to meet feed quantities; and (3) meet schedule requirements (i. e., <b>feed</b> <b>timing).</b> In the absence of new criteria related to acceptable schedule performance due to the termination of the TWRS Privatization Contract, the original criteria from the Tank Waste Remediation System (77443 s) Privatization Contract (DOE 1998) will continue to be used for this analysis...|$|R

40|$|Small {{intestinal}} {{function in}} critically ill patients should ideally be assessed {{in order to}} determine the preferred <b>feeding</b> route, <b>timing,</b> and composition of enteral nutrition. Additionally, evaluation of small bowel function may lead to new insights aimed to maintain enterocyte integrity. Critically ill patients are likely to have impaired enterocyte function mainly as a consequence of diminished splanchnic blood flow associated with mucosal hyperpermeability and bacterial translocation, a pathological state believed to be pivotal in the development of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). However, feasible and validated clinical tools to reliably assess enterocyte function are lacking. This explorative review discusses the promising role of citrulline, a nonprotein amino acid almost exclusively generated by the enterocyte, as a biomarker reflecting enterocyte function in critically ill patients. Citrulline metabolism, its potential as enterocyte biomarker, and literature on citrulline in critically illness will be discussed.

40|$|Feed and piglet are {{the largest}} {{variable}} cost items and important factors affecting the profitability of grow finish pork production in most pork producing countries world-wide. Although a pig's potential to utilize energy and protein depends on its weight, age and genetic line, grow finish pigs are typically fed with only 1 to 4 diets during the grow finish phases of production. The goal {{of this study is}} to examine whether there are differences in <b>feeding</b> patterns, the <b>timing</b> of slaughter and return on pig space unit between 1) multi-phase feeding in which the quantity and protein content of the <b>feed</b> and the <b>timing</b> of slaughter are optimized on a daily basis, and 2) two-phase feeding in which feed quantity and slaughter decision are optimized daily but feed composition is predetermined f or a given weight range. A stochastic dynamic programming model was used to evaluate different scenarios.

The bio-economic model explicitly characterizes the growth process of grow finish pigs and optimizes the timing of slaughter and daily amounts of protein and energy used in the feed. The growth of lipid mass and protein mass in the pig in a grow finish group are modelled separately.

30|$|We {{found some}} {{differences}} and deficits between physicians’ and nurses’ knowledge and practices around nutrition in PICU children. Difference {{in the education}} level may explain part of these knowledge differences. However, nurses and physicians also have different roles and responsibilities regarding nutritional care. Physicians {{are responsible for the}} nutrition plan (prescription of nutritional support: <b>feeding</b> initiation <b>timing,</b> type of <b>feed,</b> route, and mode of feed delivery, energy, fluid, and protein goals), nurses are responsible for feed administration and feeding tolerance monitoring. Although these roles may sometimes overlap, it is interesting in our study that nurses and physicians sometimes responded differently to the same questions. This may reflect physicians lack of awareness of nursing practices around nutrition. Similarly, nurses frequently lacked awareness of the nutritional strategy planned by physicians. Written guidelines, multiprofessional nutrition rounds, and the continual auditing of practices would help reduce these differences between nurses and physicians. Yet, collaboration between nurses, dietitians, and physicians is essential in the PICU if we are to improve nutritional practices. Training needs to target all three professional groups, but around different areas of knowledge deficiency that is appropriate to their role and responsibilities.|$|R
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{clock is}} an endogenous timekeeper that synchronises biological processes with daily external rhythms such as {{light and temperature}} cycles. It provides organisms with a competitive advantage by allowing anticipation of daily events. The circadian clock encompasses a network of transcription-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) that orchestrates rhythmic expression of {{a large part of}} the genome. This network is regulated at post-transcriptional and post-translational level. Post-translational regulation of clock proteins is essential to ensure stable rhythms and robust timekeeping. Unlike the genes in the TTFL network, modifiers of clock proteins at post-translational level are conserved across taxa. SUMO, a small ubiquitin-related post-translational modifier, regulates timekeeping in mammals through modification of the clock transcription factor BMAL. In this study, SUMO is shown to contribute to oscillator function in Arabidopsis plants. Methods have been developed to prove that mutant lines defective in SUMO machinery, including SUMO-ligase and -protease mutants, display long circadian rhythms. Additionally, sumoylation on the crucial plant clock transcription factor CCA 1 is observed in vivo. A fraction of the protein is sumoylated across the expression window of CCA 1, with the phase of peak sumoylation in advance of peak total CCA 1. The effect of sumoylation of CCA 1 was investigated with respect to localisation, stability and DNA binding affinity of the protein, as these are previously described possible effects of sumoylation. The subcellular location of CCA 1 -YFP fusions in protoplasts was not altered in mutant lines of the SUMO machinery. In vitro experiments show that sumoylation negatively affects the affinity of CCA 1 to its cognate promotor element, suggesting that SUMO could act as a reversible attenuator of CCA 1 activity. Furthermore, effects of SUMO machinery mutations appear to be differential across a range of physiologically relevant temperatures, implying that sumoylation could be involved in the response to or buffering against fluctuating ambient temperatures. There is an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that metabolic oscillations are not only driven by transcriptional outputs of the clock, but are to some extent self-sustained and can <b>feed</b> <b>timing</b> information back into the clock. Glutathione was investigated as a possible metabolic feedback signal. Expression of clock gene CCA 1 was found to be abolished in a mutant of the rate-limiting enzyme for glutathione synthesis (pad 2 - 1). Surprisingly however, the amount of glutathione was not found to oscillate. Combined, the results discussed in this thesis provide a substantial advance on our understanding of post-translational regulation and the integration of metabolic and environmental information into the plant circadian clock...|$|R

40|$|The {{supply for}} {{domestic}} beef has been decreasing sharply since Finland joined the European Union (EU) because profitability of beef production has been low. The {{goal of this}} study is to search for optimal beef management practices that increase returns on beef production in Finland. Numerical dynamic programming (DP) is used to simultaneously optimise <b>feeding</b> and <b>timing</b> of slaughtering. The DP-algorithm is solved under alternative subsidy, output price, and silage price scenarios. At 1998 prices and subsidies, the optimal carcass weight is estimated above 250 kg. The European Agenda 2000 reform is predicted to decrease the optimal carcass weight to 200 kg, which is 50 kg lower than under the 1998 prices and subsidies. This reform will increase farmer returns significantly and its income effect depends crucially on the price of silage. The results indicate also that the reform will result in adjustment of feeding. Particularly, farmers having high silage production costs will substitute feed concentrates for roughage in the diet. A farmer is entitled to a premium subsidy of FIM 200 (€ 33. 63), provided that the carcass weight of a culled animal exceeds 270 kg. But when the Agenda 2000 reform is fully implemented, this premium subsidy is not large enough to supply carcasses heavier than 270 kg. The results suggest that carcass weights of at least 270 kg would require a premium subsidy of FIM 400 – 800 (€ 67 – € 134). Rearing heavy animals will significantly increase production costs and, therefore, most of the subsidy will be taken away from the farm in terms of increased costs.

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of 17 sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus stranded in Scotland and Denmark during 1990 - 96 were analysed. All were sub-adult or adult males and stranded between November and March. They had presumably entered the North Sea during their southward migration from feeding grounds in Arctic waters. Other {{studies indicate that}} the majority of the whales were apparently healthy. The diet of these whales was found to consist almost entirely of cephalopods, principally squid of the genus Gonatus (hereafter 'Gonatus', but probably G. fabricii, an oceanic species characteristic of Arctic waters). The other prey species identified were also mostly oceanic cephalopods: the squids Histioteuthis bonnellii, Teuthowenia megalops and Todarodes sagittatus and the octopus Haliphron atlanticus. Although these results are consistent with other recent studies in the area based on single stranded whales, they differ from results of work on whales caught during commercial whaling operations in Icelandic waters (1960 s to 1980 s) in that little evidence of predation on fish was found in the present study. Remains of single individuals of the veined squid Loligo forbesi, the northern octopus Eledone cirrhosa and the saithe Pollachius virens provided the only possible evidence of feeding in the North Sea. We infer that sperm whales do not enter the North Sea to <b>feed.</b> The <b>timing,</b> and large and uniform sizes of the Gonatus species eaten (most had mantle lengths in the range 195 to 245 mm), as estimated from measurements of the lower beaks, and the seasonality of the strandings is consistent with the whales having fed on mature squid, possibly spawning concentrations [...] as has recently been reported for bottlenose whales. Assuming that the diet recorded in this study was representative of sperm whales during the feeding season, as much as 500000 t of Gonatus could be removed by sperm whales in Norwegian waters each year and up to 3 times that figure from the eastern North Atlantic as a whole.

They have poor knowledge regarding dangers of pre-lacteal <b>feeds</b> (45 %), <b>timing</b> of first bath after birth (60 %), umbilical cord care (60 %), and vaccination (36 %). About 32 % of them are practicing oil instillation into nostrils while 44 % of mothers were intended to use gripe water for infantile colic. Conclusion: The study highlights that there is vital need to improve the knowledge and awareness in the society regarding community-based newborn care. We should also strive toward helping removing myths and wrong practices, which are rampant in the community.

40|$|Some {{dairy cows}} display a {{pronounced}} reduction in first milk yield after estrus onset. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the usefulness of the pronounced reduction in milk yield as an indicator of the optimal time for artificial insemination (AI). We confirmed that the frequency of a pronounced reduction in first milk yield after estrus onset in our dairy cows was 21. 6 %. We subsequently examined the differences in estrus intensity, <b>feed</b> intake, the <b>timings</b> of ovulation and fertility between cows with (cows with milk reduction) and without (cows without milk reduction) a pronounced reduction in first milk yield after estrus onset. Compared to cows without milk reduction, the percentage of cows that were milked actually during estrus tended to be higher in cows with milk reduction. However, the dry matter intake 1 day before the first milking after estrus onset was similar in both the groups of cows. In cows with milk reduction, the percentage of cows that ovulated 22 - 24 hr after the first milking following estrus onset was higher than that in cows without milk reduction. The pregnancy rate in cows with milk reduction that were inseminated 3 - 8 hr after milking during which the pronounced reduction in milk yield was exhibited was significantly higher than that in cows with milk reduction inseminated during other periods. These results indicate that the optimal time for AI can be narrowed by detecting a pronounced reduction in first milk yield after estrus onset...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relation of}} infant feeding practice to childhood respiratory illness, growth, body composition, and blood pressure. DESIGN: Follow up study of a cohort of children (mean age 7. 3 years) who had detailed infant feeding and demographic data collected prospectively {{during the first two}} years of life. SETTING: Dundee. SUBJECTS: 674 infants, of whom 545 (81 %) were available for study. Data on respiratory illness were available for 545 children (mean age 7. 3 (range 6. 1 - 9. 9) years); height for 410 children; weight and body mass index for 412 children; body composition for 405 children; blood pressure for 301 children (mean age 7. 2 (range 6. 9 - 10. 0) years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respiratory illness, weight, height, body mass index, percentage body fat, and blood pressure in relation to duration of breast <b>feeding</b> and <b>timing</b> of introduction of solids. RESULTS: After adjustment for the significant confounding variables the estimated probability of ever having respiratory illness in children who received breast milk exclusively for at least 15 weeks was consistently lower (17. 0 % (95 % confidence interval 15. 9 % to 18. 1 %) for exclusive breast feeding, 31. 0 % (26. 8 % to 35. 2 %) for partial breast feeding, and 32. 2 % (30. 7 % to 33. 7 %) for bottle feeding. Solid feeding before 15 weeks was associated with an increased probability of wheeze during childhood (21. 0 % (19. 9 % to 22. 1 %) v 9. 7 % (8. 6 % to 10. 8 %)). It was also associated with increased percentage body fat and weight in childhood (mean body fat 18. 5 % (18. 2 % to 18. 8 %) v 16. 5 % (16. 0 % to 17. 0 %); weight standard deviation score 0. 02 (- 0. 02 to 0. 06) v - 0. 09 (- 0. 16 to 0. 02). Systolic blood pressure was raised significantly in children who were exclusively bottle fed compared with children who received breast milk (mean 94. 2 (93. 5 to 94. 9) mm Hg v 90. 7 (89. 9 to 91. 7) mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of respiratory illness occurring at any time during childhood is significantly reduced if the child is fed exclusively breast milk for 15 weeks and no solid foods are introduced during this time. Breast feeding and the late introduction of solids may have a beneficial effect on childhood health and subsequent adult disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although dual-energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) {{is considered}} the most accurate measure of adiposity in children, it has rarely been {{used to examine the}} relation between infant feeding and adiposity during childhood. Objective: The objective was to ascertain whether adiposity at age 5 y was related to breastfeeding, to the timing of the introduction of complementary foods during infancy, or to both. Design: Body composition was measured in 313 children at age 5 y by using DXA. Data on breastfeeding, formula <b>feeding,</b> and the <b>timing</b> of the introduction of complementary foods were obtained from the mothers when the children were 3 y old. Regression analysis was used to examine the relation between infant feeding and fat mass after adjustment for lean body mass, sex, birth weight, maternal obesity, race, and other sociodemographic variables. Results: Fifty-three percent of the children were boys, 80 % were white, and 20 % were black. There {{was no significant difference in}} adjusted fat mass between those ever breastfed and those never breastfed (x SE: 4. 48 0. 09 and 4. 76 0. 17 kg, respectively; P 0. 17). Children who were breastfed for a longer duration and those who were breastfed without concurrent formula feeding did not have significantly lower fat mass than did those children who were never breastfed. Children did not differ significantly in fat mass if they were introduced to complementary foods before or after 4 mo of age (4. 49 0. 12 and 4. 63 0. 12 kg, respectively; P 0. 42). Conclusion: Neither breastfeeding nor the timing of the introduc-tion of complementary foods was associated with adiposity at ag...|$|R
40|$|In fishes {{that employ}} suction <b>feeding,</b> {{coordinating}} the <b>timing</b> of peak flow velocity with mouth opening {{is likely to}} be an important feature of prey capture success because this will allow the highest forces to be exerted on prey items when the jaws are fully extended and the flow field is at its largest. Although it has long been known that kinematics of buccal expansion in feeding fishes are characterized by an anterior-to-posterior wave of expansion, this pattern has not been incorporated in most previous computational models of suction feeding. As a consequence, these models have failed to correctly predict the timing of peak flow velocity, which according to the currently available empirical data should occur around the time of peak gape. In this study, we use a simple fluid dynamic model to demonstrate that the inclusion of an anterior-to-posterior wave of buccal expansion can correctly reproduce the empirically determined flow velocity profile, although only under very constrained conditions, whereas models that do not allow this wave of expansion inevitably predict peak velocity earlier in the strike, when the gape is less than half of its maximum. The conditions that are required to produce a realistic velocity profile are as follows: (i) a relatively long time lag between mouth opening and expansion of the more posterior parts of the mouth, (ii) a short anterior portion of the mouth relative to more posterior sections, and (iii) a pattern of movement that begins slowly and then rapidly accelerates. Greater maximum velocities were generated in simulations without the anterior-to-posterior wave of expansion, suggesting a trade-off between maximizing fluid speed and coordination of peak fluid speed with peak gape...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{simulation model}} {{was used to}} assist 5 farmers in developing design criteria for inclusion of robotic milking systems in each farm situation. The barn layout influences arrivals of cows to the milking robot {{as well as other}} cow traffic and must be carefully planned. Each farmer had individual objectives and consequently unique design criteria that determined the optimal solution. Planning factors addressed by simulations on these farms included: 1) optimal cow cooling locations; 2) optimal facility allocation in expanding dairies; 3) concentrate feeder locations and feeding management; 4) number of feeders—based on expected rations; 5) use of a robot in an open cowshed without free stalls; 6) number of robots needed, currently and in the future; 7) eight robots working in harmony; 8) robot locations that allow for expansion; 9) floor space needed in each barn section including maternity and veterinary treatment areas; 10) location of bottlenecks that limit efficiency or expansion; and 11) cow traffic routine as affected by management practices, feed allocation, and farm layout. The simulation allowed farmers to receive a course in managing a “virtual robotic milking farm ” before installation of the barn. Therefore, each could be more confident that his future barn would work properly under his unique local conditions and management practices. One farm checked 2 yr after construction achieved an average daily robot utilization of 84 %, nearly matching the 85 % projected before the barn was built. Important variables considered in the simulations were facility allocation, cow space needed in each farm area, robot utilization, number of cows, milk yield, milk flow rate, <b>feeding</b> method and <b>timing,</b> robot location and orientation, and farm physical layout.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether there exists a critical period during rearing when restricted feeding of broiler breeder hens can be most beneficial on subsequent egg production. Broiler breeder pullets were subjected to combinations of either ad libitum or restricted feeding during three periods before sexual maturity. Body weight gain, feed intake, and egg production were recorded. Ovary and oviduct weights were noted at age of first oviposition. At 15 and 18 wk of age and at age of first oviposition, chicken luteinizing hormone releasing hormone-I (cLHRH-I) in the median eminence and the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the pituitary and plasma were determined. The results demonstrated that alternation between ad libitum and restricted feeding during rearing changed the growth curves of the birds. Feed restriction from 7 to 15 wk followed by either ad libitum or restricted feeding led to improved reproductive performance, suggesting that long-term feed restriction may not be necessary to attain good reproductive performance. The birds restricted from 7 to 15 wk of age had higher proportional weights of ovary (> or = 1. 7 %) and oviduct (> or = 1. 58 %) at age of sexual maturity. The cLHRH-I levels in the median eminence and gonadotrophin contents in the pituitary followed that of growth in response to <b>feeding</b> levels and <b>timing</b> of <b>feeding</b> and could be related to the timing of the onset of lay. At age of first egg, all groups had similar levels of cLHRH-I, LH, and FSH. However, no clear effect of level of feed intake or time period of restriction could be observed for plasma LH or FSH concentrations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{complementary}} {{feeding period}} {{is an important}} stage of child development. The study aim was to develop an index reflecting the degree of adherence to complementary feeding guidelines, evaluate its convergent validity, and explore associations with socio-demographic factors and dietary pattern scores in childhood. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 6065) using parent-completed dietary questionnaires at 6 mo of age, sociodemographic information, and dietary patterns derived by principal component analysis at age 3 y. The Complementary Feeding Utility Index (CFUI) consists of 14 components: breastfeeding duration, <b>feeding</b> to appetite, <b>timing</b> of introduction to solids, exposure to iron-rich cereals, fruit and vegetable intake, exposure to high-fat/-salt/-sugar foods including sugary drinks, food texture, and meal/snack frequency. Regression analyses were undertaken to investigate associations between index scores, socio-demographic factors, food and nutrient intakes, and dietary pattern scores at age 3 y. Milk and food intake at 6 mo and nutrient intake at 8 mo of age varied across quintiles of index score in largely the expected directions. Associations were found among index score, maternal age, education, social class, maternal smoking history, and prepregnancy BMI. After adjustment for socio-demographic factors, the index score was associated with “processed“ [b = 20. 234 (95 % CI = 20. 260, – 0. 209) ] and “healthy” [b = 0. 185 (95 % CI = 0. 155, 0. 215) ] dietary pattern scores at age 3 y. The CFUI is able to discriminate across food intake, nutrient intake, and socio-demographic factors and is associated with later dietary patterns. Rebecca K. Golley, Lisa G. Smithers, Murthy N.
