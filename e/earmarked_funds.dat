500|$|One of {{the most}} generous {{donations}} came from Pinchas Rosenberg, the Imperial Court tailor of Saint Petersburg. In the diary of Rabbi Chaim ha-Levy, the emissary who had been sent from Jerusalem to collect funds for the synagogue, Rosenberg set out in details what his money was intended for. Among the items that were bought with his money were two big bronze candelabras; a silver menorah that [...] "arrived miraculously on the 1st Tevet [...] precisely in time to light the last eight Hanukah candles" [...] and an iron door made under the holy ark for safe-keeping of the candlestick. He also <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> towards the building of an [...] "artistically wrought iron fence around the roof under the upper windows so {{that there be a}} veranda on which may stand all our brethren who go up in pilgrimage to behold our desolate Temple, and also a partition for the womenfolk on the Feast of Tabernacles and Simchat Torah".|$|E
500|$|Tourism {{is now an}} {{important}} source of income for the region, amounting in Concepci√≥n Municipio alone to US$296,140, or 7.2% of the annual gross production. An additional US$40,000 or 1% comes from crafts. According to a report published by the [...] "Coordinadora Interinstitucional de la Provincia Velasco" [...] in 2007, 17,381 people visited San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the region, as tourists in 2006. About 30% of them came from outside of Bolivia. The main attraction for tourists are the nearby missions of San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco. Tourism to San Ignacio de Velasco generated 7,821,450 Bolivianos in income in 2006. Tourism income is ostensibly translated to improvements in the infrastructure, although there has been criticism that <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> do not always reach their intended destinations. Other than cultural tourism to the missionary circuit and musical festivals, the region offers many natural attractions like rivers, lagoons, hot springs, caves and waterfalls, although there is no infrastructure to support tourism in this regard.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} rapid transit proposal came {{as part of}} the Forward Thrust initiatives of the late 1960s, which was centered around a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue. The subway would be fed by lines from Ballard, Lake City, the University District, Capitol Hill, Bellevue, and Renton, combining for a planned minimum headway of [...] minutes at rush hour, [...] minutes during midday, and five minutes at all other times. The stations on 3rd Avenue were to be situated at South Jackson Street and 5th Avenue South, James and Cherry streets, Seneca and Spring streets, and Pike and Pine streets, all planned to open by 1985 and operated by the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle. Seattle voters were asked to provide $385 million (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars), to supplement a $765 million grant (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), during a municipal election on February 13, 1968, narrowly passing the bond by 50.8%, but falling short of the required 60 percent supermajority. A second attempt on May 19, 1970, with an adjusted $440 million local contribution (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) and $881 million federal grant (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars), failed to pass with only 46% approval amid a local recession caused by layoffs at Boeing; the <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> intended for the Forward Thrust rapid transit project were instead allocated to Atlanta, to build its rapid transit system.|$|E

Rigga {{said that if the}} murals had been removed from the columns, [...] "much of their magic would be lost". The City of Portland's Office of Transportation <b>earmarked</b> <b>funds</b> to remove ten columns; an ad hoc committee called Friends of the Columns was formed to raise money for their storage, restoration and public display, which was estimated to cost $460,000. City Commissioner Charlie Hales said, [...] "Saving the Lovejoy columns and the artwork provides a real bridge between the rich history of this industrial area and its future as a residential neighborhood. I am pleased that we are able to save these columns and look forward to them being placed on some of the park spaces in the River District." [...] According to the James M. Harrison Art and Design Studio, [...] "Extracting the columns both captured the space created by Tom and preserved a ruin that would continue to tell a story. The fragile paintings preserved the mighty concrete." [...] During the next five years, attempts by the city, and non-profit and entrepreneurial groups to restore the columns were unsuccessful. Boora Architects' Northwest Marshall Street Pedestrian Bridge Feasibility Study (2001), funded by the Portland Development Commission, proposed installing the columns at the intersection of Northwest 9th Avenue and Naito Parkway.|$|E

40|$|For {{twenty years}} {{universities}} {{have been able}} to bypass peer-reviewed research competition for federal funding and seek a direct appropriation of funding from Congress. Proponents of this earmarking claim that this funding helps the university build the infrastructure needed to be able to compete for peer-reviewed funding. Opponents claim this funding is used poorly and is less than productive than peer-reviewed funding. This paper attempts to answer this question by examining whether <b>earmarked</b> <b>funding,</b> when treated as a stock of capital, increases the number of academic articles published and/or the number of citations per article published. Using two panel data sets that span 1980 to 1998, incorporating university and year fixed effects, and using an instrumental variables estimation, this paper shows that while the number of articles published increase, the number of citations per article decrease. Depending on the data set used the annual increase in articles ranges, on average, between 8 and 14 percent. The annual decrease in citations per article ranges between 9 and 57 percent. If we concentrate only on earmarks for agriculture, earmarks that often are for small discrete projects, the results suggest the effect from an increase in <b>earmarked</b> <b>funding</b> is not statistically different from zero for both publications and citations per publication. These results suggest that <b>earmarked</b> <b>funding</b> may increase the quantity of publications but decreases the quality of the publications and the performance of <b>earmarked</b> <b>funding</b> is lower than that from using peer-reviewed <b>funding.</b> congressional <b>earmarking,</b> research <b>funding,</b> universities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether legislators <b>earmark</b> <b>funds</b> {{in order}} to constrain the spending of future legislators with different preferences. Specifically, panel data is used to estimate the probability a new environmental earmarking law is passed {{as a function of}} Democrats holding and subsequently losing majority control of the government. The results of this study do not support this hypothesis. In fact, Democrats with a large majority who subsequently lose this majority power following the next election are found to be less likely to <b>earmark</b> <b>funds</b> for the environment. One possible explanation for this finding may be that competing forces {{make it more difficult for}} Democrats to pass legislation <b>earmarking</b> <b>funds</b> for the environment in the years before losing power, even if they have an increased incentive to do so. However, further results of this paper do not support this hypothesis. Rather, the evidence suggests Democrats do not earmark strategically. public finance, earmarking, environment...|$|R
