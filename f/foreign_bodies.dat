5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies,</b> tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies,</b> fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E

5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of <b>foreign</b> <b>bodies</b> and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E

30|$|The high {{resolution}} of AS-OCT {{is ideal for}} evaluating the depth of corneal injury due to a <b>foreign</b> <b>body.</b> The location of an intracorneal <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> {{and the status of}} the surrounding ocular structure dictate the optimal surgical technique to be employed (Hersh et al. 1995). Removal of a corneal <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> via a lamellar corneal pocket was described by Au et al. (1996) in cases in which the entry wound caused by a <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> had healed and epithelized. A lamellar dissection was extended centrally toward the corneal <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> and the corneal wound was closed with a circumferential mattress suture of 10 - 0 nylon. In the presented case this technique was not indicated because the <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> did not completely penetrate the cornea and there was a break in the corneal epithelial layer; instead, we simply grasped the corneal <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> by its free posterior edge that was protruding outwards and removed it via its route of entry. The AS-OCT findings helped us choose the most appropriate technique for corneal <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> removal.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTI ON: <b>Foreign</b> <b>body</b> {{aspiration}} in pediatrics is {{a potentially}} fatal accident which will continue until children explore their surroundings with their hand and mouth. Pediatric aspirations will persist until mankind exists. Not all <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> aspirations are witnessed hence chances of delay in diagnosing an aspiration are high. Delay in diagnosis depends on site {{and character of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> aspirated. The chest x - ray findings and type of <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> extracted {{vary depending on the}} duration the <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> remains in airway. OBJECTIVE: To study the X - ray finding in pediatric airway aspiration and its relation to time lapse, the type and site of lodgment of <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> extracted via bronchoscopy. The type of <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> in relation to time lapse in aspiration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective study done in Bapuji child health institute and research center, JJM Medical College, Davangere. History and pre bronchoscopy x - Ray finding were noted for 65 children who were posted for suspicious bronchoscopy from August 2011 to September 2013. 11 children were excluded from study as they showed no <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> on bronchoscopy. Time lapse in aspir ation and seeking medical care was noted. The bronchoscopic findings regarding site of <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> lodgment and type of <b>foreign</b> <b>body</b> were recorded.
