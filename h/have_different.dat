5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues <b>have</b> <b>different</b> patterns of gene expression and therefore <b>have</b> <b>different</b> sets of enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides {{a mechanism for}} regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|The vocalizations of {{killer whales}} {{in other parts}} of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to <b>have</b> <b>different</b> vocalizations for {{activities}} like hunting and traveling.|$|E
5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might <b>have</b> <b>different</b> norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they <b>have</b> <b>different</b> roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E

5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles <b>have</b> <b>different</b> sizes, so they are not all congruent to each other.|$|E
5|$|Although each race {{is unique}} in its composition, no race has an innate {{advantage}} over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they <b>have</b> <b>different</b> strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.|$|E
50|$|A chimera can <b>have</b> two <b>different</b> colored {{eyes just}} like any two {{siblings}} can—because each cell <b>has</b> <b>different</b> eye color genes. A mosaic can <b>have</b> two <b>different</b> colored eyes if the DNA difference {{happens to be in}} an eye-color gene.|$|R

5|$|Although this is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} theory for how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each <b>have</b> <b>different</b> mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.|$|E
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may <b>have</b> <b>different</b> fathers.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular variable star, indicating that some periodicity is noticeable in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may <b>have</b> <b>different</b> lengths, {{and there may be}} standstills or periods of irregularity. It is placed in subgroup SRc; these are pulsating red supergiants with amplitudes around one magnitude and periods from tens to hundreds of days.|$|E

50|$|Another {{factor was}} that every agency <b>had</b> <b>different</b> {{timeframes}} and formats for submittal of Concept Papers. The agencies also <b>had</b> <b>different</b> requirements for environmental compliance, such as NEPA and other regulations.

5|$|Fractal-like {{patterns}} {{work because}} the human visual system efficiently discriminates images which <b>have</b> <b>different</b> fractal dimension or other second-order statistics like Fourier spatial amplitude spectra; objects simply appear to pop {{out from the}} background. Timothy O'Neill helped the Marine Corps to develop first a digital pattern for vehicles, then fabric for uniforms, which had two colour schemes, one designed for woodland, one for desert.|$|E

These factions <b>have</b> <b>different</b> names in the American, European, and Japanese versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{inertial}} effect, {{the lighter}} alveolar tissue is sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in head injury. It results {{from the fact that}} different tissues <b>have</b> <b>different</b> densities, and therefore different rates of acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|Individual benzodiazepines may <b>have</b> <b>different</b> {{interactions}} with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines {{can be divided}} roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for {{interactions with}} other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
