60|$|Hunter {{laughed as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his hard brown hands and dusty attire.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his {{unfinished}} breakfast. He had {{the air of}} one who is {{a little}} bored.|$|E
60|$|After pronouncing {{these words}} with immense assurance, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, {{and at once}} fell a prey to distress, incertitude, and fear.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>he</b> merely <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the cigar}} {{for a moment}} and then {{conveyed}} it to his lips.|$|R
60|$|Gerald {{listened with}} quick impatience. <b>He</b> kept <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Birkin, as if looking for {{something}} from the other man.|$|R
500|$|When Liz learns from Kenneth that NBC {{will have}} Green Week, she says [...] "Oh brother, are they {{actually}} {{going to do something}} this year or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock {{in the corner of the}} screen?", a reference to the NBC peacock symbol having a green logo design during Green Week. As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the logo.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his horse's quivering sides. Back {{as far as}} {{one could}} see there was that regular line of hoof marks.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid the}} extreme {{tips of her}} fingers upon his coat sleeve. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them for a moment. Her {{reluctance}} was evident.|$|E
60|$|Laura hesitated, puzzled. Just {{then the}} Professor came cantering {{in with a}} bundle of grass in his hand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Chinaman.|$|E
6000|$|But he was courtly to Carol. He {{stooped to}} examine the furnace flues; <b>he</b> straightened, <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, and hemmed, [...] "Got to fix your furnace, no matter what else I do." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ford {{said this}} {{with such an}} air of {{conviction}} and such a sober face that the Captain smiled. And {{at the same time}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> nervously <b>at</b> the new line of buttons on his chest.|$|R
5000|$|Gabriel is {{repairing}} another {{pocket watch}} at his shop when Brian Davis enters, explaining that someone called him. Gabriel {{tells him that}} he made the call. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the watch {{on the table and}} sees the name [...] "Sylar" [...] on the face and introduces himself to Brian Davis as [...] "Gabriel Sylar." [...] Brian stares at a mug on Gabriel's desk and manages to slide it across the desk telekinetically, then asking if Gabriel can make it go away, surprising him. Brian tells him he does not know what the ability is, but he doesn't want it. Gabriel then picks up a crystal from the table and kills Brian.|$|R
60|$|Wheeler, who {{had heard}} {{something}} from Gordon, {{looked at him with}} grave sympathy, but Nasmyth made an expressive gesture as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his attire.|$|E
6000|$|... "The patient man {{lifted his}} head and looked at the flour-strewn walls. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the floor, but drew back with a slight tremor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "you {{certainly}} could." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her hands. [...] "Those are unusually pretty gloves {{you have}} on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy {{will sit}} still, I know," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{me with the}} same serene goodness, the same repose of {{firmness}} that I have seen in him when sitting at his side amid the secure peace of his mother's hearth. Yes, thus adjured, I think I would have sat still under a rocking crag: but, indeed, to sit still in actual circumstances was my instinct; and {{at the price of}} my very life, I would not have moved to give him trouble, thwart his will, or make demands on his attention. We were in the stalls, and for a few minutes there was a most terrible, ruthless pressure about us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Killed him in {{his sleep}} for a hundred dollars," [...] said another man, glancing over the reader's shoulder, but Miss Deringham was not {{interested}} in the murder she remembered having heard about. She was, however, a trifle astonished to see that her father was watching the gathering group with a serious look in his eyes, but <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> somewhat hastily <b>at</b> his papers when he met her gaze. Then the voices grew less distinct, and that of the man dictating broke monotonously through them until a steward approached her father with an envelope in his hand.|$|R
60|$|The {{police were}} {{struggling}} to clear a passage. The driver of the coal waggon, a big man in shirt sleeves, lighted a pipe and sat smoking. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> complacently <b>at</b> a captain of police who was raving and cursing at him, and his only acknowledgment was a shrug of the shoulders. From the rear arose the rat-rat-tat of clubs on heads and a pandemonium of cursing, yelling, and shouting. A violent accession of noise proclaimed that the mob had broken through and was dragging a scab from a waggon. The police captain reinforced from his vanguard, and the mob at the rear was repelled. Meanwhile, window after window in the high office building on the right had been opened, and the class-conscious clerks were raining a shower of office furniture down on the heads of police and scabs. Waste-baskets, ink-bottles, paper-weights, type-writers--anything and everything that came to hand was filling the air.|$|R
60|$|The {{red edge}} of his Baedeker still {{projected}} from the lawyer's pocket, for {{it had not been}} worth their captor's while to take it. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{panorama}} below, with its odd jumble of hideous buildings, softened {{here and there}} with wreaths of sunstained smoke, its great blots of ugliness irredeemable, insistent.|$|E
60|$|While {{doing this}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bed {{on which he}} had not slept that night. The hollow in the pillow made {{by the weight of}} Haldin's head was very noticeable.|$|E
60|$|At first I was for refusing. Then I nodded. He {{led the way}} silently {{around by}} the front; and after he had turned the lock he stepped aside with a bow to let me pass in ahead of him. Once more I was in the {{familiar}} hall with the stairs dividing at the back. It was cool after the heat, and musty, {{and a touch of}} death hung in the prisoned air. We paused for a moment on the landing, beside the high, triple-arched window which the branches tapped on windy winter days, while Grafton took down the bunch of keys from beside the clock. I thought of my dear grandfather winding it every Sunday, and his ruddy face and large figure as <b>he</b> stood <b>glancing</b> sidewise <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me. Then the sound of Grafton's feet upon the bare steps recalled the present.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{paused and}} <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> the table <b>at</b> Leblanc, and then re-opened at his former antagonist.|$|R
60|$|The Duke groaned. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> {{the table}} {{to be sure that}} Prince Terniloff was out of hearing.|$|R
60|$|Appleby set {{his lips}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the white face, {{and felt that}} this was true. Then his eyes grew a trifle dim as he laid his hand on Tonyâ€™s arm.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} white steamer lying in the inlet below. [...] "That's {{one of my own}} {{particular}} toys. You're coming up the coast with us next week for the salmon-trolling?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy was, fortunately, one of {{the slow}} men who usually keep their heads, and while <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{twinkling}} fuses in the dark pit beneath him, he swung up a warning hand.|$|E
60|$|David's teeth came together. There was {{lightning}} in {{his eyes}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> through the trees towards Vont's little cottage.|$|R
60|$|Sarah {{shook her}} head regretfully, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her muslin gown.|$|R
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her high-necked {{gown and}} avoided Helen's anxious eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop right there! I can't stand too much--and there's Eleanor," [...] he said, {{and broke}} into a harsh laugh as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the pen. [...] "In one way, it's {{significant}} that I've broken the--thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alarmed, Reinhart {{hurried out}} of his office and down the corridor. He found Kaplan {{standing}} in front of the SRB machines. [...] "What's the story?" [...] Reinhart demanded. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the reading. It was unchanged.|$|E
60|$|I {{bought a}} special edition, which a newsboy was brandishing in our faces, and, turning down the leading article, {{passed it on}} to my father. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> it and then looked up at me in blank amazement.|$|E
60|$|George <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his soaked clothes. It {{had been}} a nice suit once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! It never {{occurred}} to me. I suppose I seemed as odd to them as you did to me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down.</b> [...] "And my feet. You have hoofs like a hippogriff." ...|$|R
60|$|At last John woke up also. He {{stretched}} his arms yawning, {{and for the}} first time became aware of the weight upon his breast. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> and saw dimly at first--then more clearly.|$|R
