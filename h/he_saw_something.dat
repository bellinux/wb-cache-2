2500|$|To {{judge the}} success of the Libby Prison escape solely by the number of men who crossed Federal lines would be a mistake. [...] Richmond was deeply {{affected}} by the break, and Libby Prison itself was thrown into chaos, much to the satisfaction and raised morale of the remaining prisoners. [...] Lieutenant Colonel Cavada recorded some of the more humorous effects of the escape inside the prison. [...] On one occasion, the entire camp was roused {{in the middle of the}} night for a roll call because a sentry thought <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> down in a sewer. [...] It turned out to be his own shadow. [...] Even the Confederate warden, Major Thomas P. Turner, was visibly shaken. [...] Cavada commented, [...] "Really, when our distracted little Commandant now comes into our rooms, he keeps his knees well together, it is necessary to be very cautious, some of us might slip out between his legs!" ...|$|E
60|$|She sighed, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> in {{her eyes}} which haunted him for long afterwards.|$|E
60|$|Little was heart-sick. He {{dared not}} follow them. But {{an hour later}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> which filled his heart with bliss unspeakable.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} Mr. Allen arrived. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> unusual had taken place.|$|R
60|$|They {{stood with}} hands locked together, the boy breathless with surprise. Then <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> was wrong.|$|R
60|$|As if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> painful lurked {{under the}} remembrance {{of the time}} for Lemuel the editor desisted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be naughty, then, ma chère enfant" [...] whispered he; for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> about Elsley's face {{which gave}} him a painful suspicion.|$|E
60|$|The captain did not answer. He {{was staring}} {{straight}} before him, as if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> invisible in eyes forever closed in death.|$|E
60|$|Strickland did {{not speak}} for a long time, but his eyes shone strangely, as though <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> that kindled his soul to ecstasy.|$|E
60|$|When 'e {{came back}} {{it was all}} quiet and {{everybody}} was staring their 'ardest at little Dicky Weed, the tailor, who was sitting with {{his head in his}} 'ands, thinking, {{and every now and then}} taking them away and looking up at the ceiling, or else leaning forward with a start and looking as if <b>'e</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> crawling on the wall.|$|R
5|$|Being an idealist, Kanō had broad {{aims for}} judo, which <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as <b>something</b> that {{simultaneously}} encompassed self-defense, physical culture, and moral behavior.|$|R
60|$|But as <b>he</b> moved she <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> else. She leaned forward, {{pointing}} to the empty sheath at his girdle.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{just before}} the time that Hardwick usually went out for lunch, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> which he thought rather odd, {{although}} of no great importance.|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand to him, unnaturally thin and white, covered with jewels. Again <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> in her eyes which stirred him vaguely.|$|E
60|$|Just as Dave sat up <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> that startled him. A dark {{figure was}} {{moving at a}} {{distance}} from the camp, coming closer slowly.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{with awe}} into its face, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a <b>something</b> reigning there: a lofty something, {{undefined}} and indistinct, {{which made it}} hardly more than a remembrance of that child—as yonder figure might be—yet it was the same: the same: and wore the dress.|$|R
60|$|The Professor rose hastily to his feet. As {{he turned}} around, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> French concealing <b>something</b> in his hands. He shivered.|$|R
60|$|When Sam peeped {{out through}} the shutter <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> {{was going to be}} done. Nunez was sitting smoking a cigarette, with a look of savage {{pleasure}} in his face, while the men heaped up a large fire in front of the trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "What have I {{done with}} my fairy treasure?" [...] cried Randal, jumping up. Then he stood still quite suddenly, as if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> strange.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} her {{gratitude}} upon him. For {{the first time}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> in her face--heard it in her tone, which made his heart beat. After all she was human.|$|E
60|$|Before Captain Eli {{reached his}} house <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> which pleased him. He saw the sea-going stranger, {{with his back}} toward him, walking rapidly in the {{direction}} of the village store.|$|E
60|$|I saw Mr. Hardinge's countenance {{suddenly}} change. The {{expression of}} joy instantly deserted it, and it wore {{an air of}} uncertainty and sadness. A less observant man than the good divine, in all the ordinary concerns of life, did not exist; but {{it was apparent that}} <b>he</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> to trouble him.|$|R
60|$|What the mucker beard of that {{conversation}} made him prick up his ears. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> after {{his own heart}} was doing--something crooked, and he wondered that so pusillanimous a thing as Divine could have a hand in it. It almost changed his estimate of the passenger of the Halfmoon.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} instant the shock of a sudden and heavy halberd laid the King stunned or dead. In the wild visions of {{vanishing}} consciousness, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> again <b>something</b> that belonged to an utterly forgotten time, something {{that he had seen}} somewhere long ago in a restaurant. <b>He</b> <b>saw,</b> with his swimming eyes, red and yellow, the colours of Nicaragua.|$|R
60|$|By and by, {{happening}} to {{look across the}} snow-covered Green Meadows, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> that made his heart jump. It was Farmer Brown's boy coming straight over towards the dear Old Briar-patch.|$|E
60|$|But {{he never}} pulled. Something {{attracted}} his attention. He looked. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something.</b> The beast in him became human--the madness changed to rationality--the devil to a craven! His ashen lips uttered a low, terrible cry.|$|E
60|$|He {{took up his}} burden again, and {{returned}} upstairs, looking about him and trying {{to account for the}} blood-spot. On the landing <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> and stopped astonished. The door-handle of his own room was blood-stained.|$|E
60|$|Two {{or three}} loafers, seeing her gesticulate, {{stopped on the}} walk outside and looked in at the door. Sanford was annoyed, but he {{remained}} calm and persuasive. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> had caused a panic in the good, simple old woman. He wished for Lincoln as one wishes for a policeman sometimes.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kit, {{who felt}} annoyed because <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Janet {{suspected}} <b>something.</b> [...] "I {{went down to}} watch the sledge {{and see if we}} had hit the best track." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> <b>something</b> in {{the lives}} [...] Of those who'd ceased to live That sphered them with a majesty [...] Which living failed to give.|$|R
60|$|Dan had {{scarcely}} {{come up to}} {{the first}} row of pines when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> moving over to his left. Satisfied that it was Stiger, he sped in the direction. The half-breed saw him, and ran on.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph {{had just}} crossed the tracks, when {{happening}} to glance toward an old shed in the vicinity, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> which {{filled him with}} astonishment. Emerging from the place were two men, and they were Martin and Toglet! ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{not gone}} over a rod when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> dark moving ahead. The object looked {{like a pair of}} Indians, coming slowly toward him, and his heart leaped into his throat. He raised his gun and pointed it.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then their}} glances met, {{and in the}} clear {{moonlight}} Aziel saw a wave of doubt sweep over his companion's dark and beautiful eyes, and a faint flush appear upon her brow. <b>He</b> <b>saw,</b> and <b>something</b> stirred at his heart that till this hour he had never felt, something which even now {{he knew it would}} trouble him greatly to escape.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} in the man's voice as he said it that caused D'Arnot to look up sharply at his friend. What <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> in the set jaw and the cold, gray eyes made the young Frenchman very apprehensive for this great child, who could recognize no law mightier than his own mighty physical prowess. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>something</b> must be done to set Tarzan right with the police before another encounter was possible.|$|R
6000|$|As {{she spoke}} the fearful Godfrey {{in his corner}} saw {{the door of the}} glass case fly open, also as he thought, {{probably}} erroneously, that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the mummy move, lifting its stiff legs and champing its iron jaws so that the yellow, ancient teeth caught the light as they moved. Then <b>he</b> heard and <b>saw</b> <b>something</b> else. Suddenly the Pasteur in tones that rang like a trumpet, cried out: ...|$|R
