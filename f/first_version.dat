5|$|M-103 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state trunkline in 1932. The <b>first</b> <b>version</b> ran from SR13 at the state line northerly to the junction with US112 and US 131 in White Pigeon. At the time, US131 turned westerly along US112 before turning south to connect with SR15. This <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of M-103 was completed paved by 1934. The routings of US131 and M-103 were swapped south of US12 (successor to US112) by 1960. Since that time, M-103 has been routed between US12 and SR15 in western Mottville Township and US131 has run due south of White Pigeon to SR13.|$|E

Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting.|$|E

5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of the Chronicon {{was written}} in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E

5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> but {{believed that it was}} necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who was known for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E
5|$|Henry Cameron's platinotype {{reproductions of}} the <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of Hope had {{circulated}} since the painting's exhibition, but {{were slow to}} produce and expensive to buy. From the early 1890s photographer Frederick Hollyer produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers {{around the country and}} directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E
