5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in the dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E

5|$|However, the Ngô {{brothers}} were not therethey had escaped from Gia Long Palace via a secret tunnel to a safehouse in Cholon the previous night. Diệm and Nhu had communicated with the generals via a direct phone link from the safehouse to the palace, giving the false {{impression that they}} were still besieged. Having been informed of Diệm and Nhu’s whereabouts, Minh dispatched a group of officers and troopswhich included Nhungto arrest them. He was aware that the brothers had left the safehouse to go to St. Francis Xavier's Church. Led by General Mai Hữu Xuân, the officers took an M113 armored personnel carrier (APC), four jeeps, and several soldiers to Cholon. As they left, Minh <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> Nhung with two fingers, taken to be an order to shoot the brothers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Miller {{came in at}} 2/121—O'Reilly {{believed}} that Bradman was trying to force the pace and had promoted Miller above Lindsay Hassett, the usual number four batsman—and was dismissed for a duck; he failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on instead of turning in, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich. After Australia finished at 509 {{on the third day}} to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged hook shot. Washbrook was displeased with the decision and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> a red mark on his shirt, indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.|$|E

25|$|The {{series against}} Sri Lanka had started in Perth with {{speculation}} regarding Waugh's four consecutive Test ducks. After four hours, Waugh reached his century {{and ended with}} 111 to end his run of ducks. On reaching his century, he <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> {{a section of the}} crowd who had been heckling him. Australia won by an innings and Waugh then scored 61 in another innings victory in the Second Test at Melbourne. He was batting when off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was repeatedly no-balled for throwing by Darrell Hair, before being bowled by the spinner. Waugh scored 71 in the Third Test and ended with 255 runs at 63.75 in a series clean sweep.|$|E
25|$|His {{enthusiastic}} and aggressive approach {{on the field}} also gets him into trouble and he was notably brought before the match referee for making offensive facial gestures to Chris Gayle and subsequently fined half of his match fee. He is also known to be verbally aggressive towards batsmen. This behaviour came back to bite him during India's First Test on their 2006 tour of South Africa, when he verbally admonished Sreesanth, an Indian bowler, after Sreesanth had trouble evading a delivery targeted at his upper-body. Nel <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> his heart, indicating that he felt Sreesanth lacked courage. Nel's next delivery was hit for a six over long off by Sreesanth who broke into a wild dance after the shot, clearly mocking Nel.|$|E

This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. During the journey, the brothers were killed in the APC, with Nhung riddling their bodies with many bullets. An investigation by Đôn later determined that Nghĩa and Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing them. When the corpses arrived at military headquarters, the generals were shocked. Đôn ordered another general to tell reporters that the brothers had died in an accident and went to confront Minh in his office.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Grand Prix, Senna {{retained}} the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings soon became interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned because of the consequential drop in tyre pressures on the Formula One cars. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra and <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> the driver, Max Angelelli, to increase his speed. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} design study that {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} Enacted Reading Comprehension (ERC), an intervention designed to teach 3 rd and 4 th grade students (n = 40 and 25, respectively) <b>to</b> use <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> understand an increasingly abstract set of texts. Students were taught <b>to</b> use <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> understand the idea of "opposing forces" in a concrete setting-the forces at play as tectonic plates move past each other-and then taught <b>to</b> use the <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> understand opposing forces in more abstract situations. For example, students were taught <b>to</b> use <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> understand the opposing sides of an argument, and to understand the internal conflicts that arise as individuals are faced with moral dilemmas. The results of our design study suggest that ERC has promise as a method for introducing students {{to the idea of}} using <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> understand text content, and to employ this strategy in a range of reading contexts...|$|R

30|$|But, was the {{information}} in the teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the equations actually more redundant than {{the information}} in the teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the graphs? Perhaps so. As noted above, the teacher's speech referred quite unambiguously to the digits in the equations (e.g., pointing to the “ 2 ” in the equation while saying “ 2 ”), and in this sense, her gestures were redundant with her speech. The information expressed in <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the graph was also redundant with speech (e.g., the teacher said, “we go over to the 2 on the x-axis” while tracing along the x-axis from the origin to (0, 2)). However, there are inherent differences in how verbal and visuospatial representations present information; Schnotz (2002) characterized this difference in terms of the distinction between descriptive representations (such as text or equations), which represent content via convention, and depictive representations (visual displays, such as diagrams or graphs), which represent content via common structural features that are either concrete or abstract. One potential consequence of these differences is that <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> visuospatial representations may be inherently less redundant with speech about those representations than are <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> symbolic representations that occur with speech about those representations. If this is the case, then <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> equations, by virtue of being more redundant with speech, should be more likely than <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs to evoke extraneous processing that can be detrimental to performance.|$|R
25|$|However, Mannerheim and {{his guests}} {{chose to go}} to a car that did not have a {{microphone}} in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows to a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's SS bodyguards spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be immediately destroyed; but YLE was allowed to keep the reel, after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to YLE. It was made available to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.|$|E
25|$|Then, on lap 8, Pierluigi Martini {{spun off}} into the wall and his front wing, which {{separated}} from his car, was hit by Patrese and got stuck in Patrese's undertray. At the front, Mansell was no longer attacking Senna but Senna was unable to pull away. The conditions became better but after another seven laps, the weather started to become worse and more drivers began to spin off, including Mansell who smashed into a wall- which allowed McLaren to win the Constructors' Championship. Berger also spun off twice on the next lap as Senna <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> the marshals {{to try to get}} the race stopped. Patrese followed suit and finally it was stopped after Senna had finished lap 16. However, the officials had decided to count the results back 2 laps to lap 14 which meant that Senna won from Mansell, Berger, Piquet, Patrese and Morbidelli. Only half points were awarded because the race was stopped before 75% of the distance was over. This particular Grand Prix set a record (that still stands as of today) as the shortest Grand Prix ever run.|$|E

30|$|All of {{the lessons}} made {{connections}} between equations and graphs in speech; the lessons varied only in which representations the teacher referred <b>to</b> using <b>gestures.</b> We varied whether the teacher referred to the equations in gestures (or not), and whether the teacher referred to the graphs in gesture (or not), yielding four conditions: teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> both equations and graphs, teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> equations only, teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> graphs only, and teacher <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> neither equations nor graphs. To assess learning, we developed assessment items that required students to understand connections among representations – that is, to generate a graph given an equation and/or a story, or to generate an equation given a graph and/or a story. We evaluated students’ success at representing both slope and intercept in the equations and graphs that they constructed. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} beneficial effects of referring to the equations in gestures, as well as beneficial effects of referring to the graphs in gestures. Moreover, we expected that these effects would be additive, such that <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> both representations would be better than <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> one representation only. We also considered the possibility that these effects might be interactive, with the combination leading to enhanced performance above and beyond the added effects of <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> each representation on its own. Thus, we predicted that students would show the greatest learning in the condition in which the teacher referred to both the equations and the graphs with gestures and speech.|$|R
