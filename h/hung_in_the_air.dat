25|$|Blake {{deployed}} {{his army}} facing generally north {{with his right}} wing on the coast, his right-center in Valencia, his left-center at Mislata, and his left at Manises. The divisions of Obispo and Villacampa, which had performed poorly at the Battle of Sagunto, held the left flank. To their right stood Creagh's brigade. Next in line were the good-quality divisions of Lardizabal and Zayas. Miranda's division occupied Valencia while some irregulars held {{the gap between the}} city and the coast. Blake posted his cavalry at Aldaia and Torrent, behind his left flank. Though the line as far as Manises was fortified and protected by canals and ditches, the left flank <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{threat of}} {{violence}} <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> One envisioned Corinth's pictures torn to shreds with chair legs. But {{in the end it}} didn't come to that. As [...] Raoul Hausmann shouted his programmatic plans for dadaist painting into the noise of the crowd, the manager of the sezession gallery turned the lights out on him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My dear généralissime, Hartmann is boiling as Boris boiled—sounds {{and ideas}} <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> I am gulping and overeating, and can barely manage to scribble them on paper. I am writing the4thNo.—the {{transitions}} are good (on the 'promenade'). I {{want to work}} more quickly and steadily. My physiognomy {{can be seen in}} the interludes. So far Ithink it's well turned..." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned up}} from the water among the trees, where the incense of <b>the</b> may-flowers <b>hung</b> heavy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|Their {{conversation}} <b>hung</b> comatose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> switched up by Bechamel. They listened together. His feet stopped. Turned. Went {{out of the}} diningroom. Down {{the passage}} to the bedroom. Stopped again.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{advanced}} noiselessly {{and then}} halted beside the bed. The room was pleasantly warm, {{and the smell}} of disinfectants, of medicines, and of lavender water <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air--the <b>air</b> of a sick room, oppressive and enervating.|$|R
2500|$|IR 93, 8th Division, {{held the}} defences from [...] Redoubt {{and part of}} [...] to the east edge of Thiepval, with {{supports}} in [...] and [...] IR 165 continued the line west along [...] (Mouquet Trench) to the Thiepval–Pozières road, with a company in Mouquet Farm and the support battalions in [...] (Green Redoubt), (Midway Line) [...] and [...] and IR 153 held [...] from the Pozières road to the east edge of Thiepval with the supports in [...] and [...] The defence of IR 153 {{on the outskirts of}} Thiepval collapsed when three tanks appeared, proving to be immune to machine-gun fire and hand-grenades. All [...] battalions of German troops in the area of [...] (Big Trench) and , were overrun by British infantry, hardly any escaping. Dust and smoke from the artillery <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> during the afternoon and shrouded the British infantry advance to , where two reserve companies held them up.|$|E
2500|$|J. M. Barrie, {{the author}} of the Peter Pan stories, may have had sleep paralysis. He said of himself ‘In my early boyhood it was a sheet that tried to choke me in the night.’ He also {{described}} several incidents in the Peter Pan stories that indicate that he was familiar with an awareness of a loss of muscle tone whilst in a dream-like state. For example, Maimie is asleep but calls out ‘What was that....It is coming nearer! It is feeling your bed with its horns-it is boring for [...] you’. and when the Darling children were dreaming of flying, [...] Barrie says ‘Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.’ Barrie describes many parasomnias and neurological symptoms in his books and uses them to explore the nature of consciousness from an experiential point of view.|$|E
2500|$|The Greco-Etruscan {{form of the}} {{practice}} {{seems to be the}} most common in Europe, historically. But the rites of {{the practice}} varied widely even into the early Renaissance. In The Works of Rabelais, Book III (published in 1693), Sir Thomas Urquhart claimed that the ashes and soot must be allowed to rise naturally from the fire. The ashes were interpreted as they rose. Ashes which dispersed quickly were a positive sign, but ashes which <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> were not. Another tradition indicates that spodomancy may also be practiced by writing a question or message {{on a piece of paper}} and then burning it. [...] The burned ashes and soot of the burned message were then examined for omens and interpretation. In Slavonia, only women were permitted to practice spodomancy. A woman would scratch in the ashes. An even number of scratches meant a positive outcome, while an odd number meant bad luck. In Poland, too, only women could practice the art. Ashes would be spread around the bed of a sick person, and the signs which appeared in the ashes were interpreted to indicate whether the person would become healthy again or not. The practice of spodomancy continues to evolve even today. For example, modern Wiccans argue that the fire used by the spodomancer must be a sacred one.|$|E
60|$|They {{took their}} seats amidst {{a crowd of}} watchers. The tulip-beds across the road flamed like {{throbbing}} rings of fire. A white dust, tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed, <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> panting <b>air.</b> <b>The</b> brightly-coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.|$|R
60|$|They descended cautiously. The {{ground was}} singed and burned clean. Clouds of smoke <b>hung</b> heavily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Occasional fires still flickered here and there. Reinhart coughed {{and bent over}} to see. Dixon flashed on a pocket flare and set it beside the body.|$|R
60|$|That {{there was}} {{something}} radically wrong with the flier was evident from its lack of buoyancy, and the further fact that though Thurid had turned twice to the starting lever the boat still <b>hung</b> motionless <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> except for a slight drifting with a low breeze from the north.|$|R
6000|$|If a fixed fire <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> [...] To warm {{me one day}} through, If {{deep green}} hair grew on great hills, [...] I know what I should do.|$|E
60|$|October came. In {{the early}} morning and late {{afternoon}} a keen cold breath <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Slingerland talked of a good prospect for fur. He chopped great stores of wood. Larry climbed the hills with his rifle. Neale walked the trails {{hand in hand with}} Allie.|$|E
6000|$|Curs'd was the deed, {{even before}} the sweat of the {{clutching}} hand [...] grew dry; [...] And darkness frown'd upon the seller of the like of God, [...] Where, as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from her, [...] and heaven refused him, [...] He <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> self-slaughter'd.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was enough}} to make anyone say [...] "Hullo!" [...] The impossible, the incredible, was visible to them all. <b>The</b> lamp <b>hung</b> {{inverted}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> burning quietly with its flame pointing down. It was as solid, as indisputable as ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the Long Dragon bar.|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{and above}} the wall glistened the white dome of a zowia, flanked by a spear-like minaret and the tall heads of a few date palms whose long leaves <b>hung</b> {{motionless}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot <b>air.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A wild deed {{has been}} {{described}} as a deed [...] "executed by a stranger to the record title <b>hung</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> like Mahomet's coffin." [...] Mahomet is an archaic spelling of Muhammad. There is a legend that the Prophet Muhammad's coffin was suspended without visible supports, from the ceiling of his tomb, just as a wild deed just hangs there, not touching the chain of title.|$|R
6000|$|He pointed resolutely to his {{candle and}} {{collected}} his mind, though {{he felt he}} did a foolish thing. [...] "Be raised up," [...] he said. But in a second that feeling vanished. The candle was raised, <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> one giddy moment, and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash on his toilet-table, leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick.|$|E
60|$|Snatching {{the rifle}} from Hans, I loaded it myself; nothing must {{be trusted to}} another. As I put on the cap a vulture made its last circle. It <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> just as the others had done, and oh! its tail was towards me. I lifted, I aimed between the gathered-up legs, I pressed and shut my eyes, for I did not dare to look.|$|E
60|$|Kitty was a {{beautiful}} creature, long, slender, glossy, with white belly and black-tipped ears and tail. She did not resemble the heavy, grim-faced brute that always <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> of my dreams. A low, brooding menacing murmur, {{that was not a}} snarl nor a growl, came from her. She watched the dogs with bright, steady eyes, and never so much as looked at us.|$|E
60|$|The larches that {{sheltered}} {{the house}} had been in full leaf when he came, but now they were getting bare. One could see the hills through a fine network of twigs, dotted with minute tassels of gold. The beeches and oaks looked solid yet, but the former shone warm brown and red against the others' fading green. Withered leaves fluttered down, and the smell of a burning heap <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> damp <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Coggan {{poured the}} liquor with unstinted liberality at the {{suffering}} Cain's circular mouth; {{half of it}} running {{down the side of}} the flagon, and half of what reached his mouth running down outside his throat, and half of what ran <b>in</b> going <b>the</b> wrong way, and being coughed and sneezed around the persons of <b>the</b> gathered reapers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a cider fog, which for a moment <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunny <b>air</b> like a small exhalation.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> basins {{between the}} ridges, to {{right and left}} along the floor of low plains the mirage glistened, wavered, faded, vanished--lakes and trees and clouds. Inverted {{mountains}} <b>hung</b> suspended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lilac <b>air</b> and faint tracery of white-walled cities.|$|R
60|$|After {{a little}} he slowly {{made his way}} back to the other end of the shell, and now his eyes became {{somewhat}} accustomed to the great radiance about him. He thought he could perceive here and there faint indications of long, nearly horizontal lines--lines of different shades of light. Above him, as if it <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> was the round, dark hole through which he had descended.|$|E
60|$|He {{postponed}} {{till the}} morrow {{his attempt to}} examine the deserted edifice, and {{turned his attention to}} the noise. It was compounded of steam barrel- organs, the clanging of gongs, the ringing of hand-bells, the clack of rattles, and the undistinguishable shouts of men. A lurid light <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> in the direction of the tumult. Thitherward he went, passing under the arched gateway, along a straight street, and into the square.|$|E
60|$|The Power of Evil sat {{looking down}} upon them, huger than {{a rock in}} the sea, or an alp with forked summits. A certain horrible majesty {{augmented}} the terrors of his aspect. His eyes reddened; his poisonous look <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> like a comet; the mouth, as it opened {{in the midst of}} clouds of beard, seemed an abyss of darkness and blood; and out of it, as from a volcano, issued fires, and vapours, and disgust.|$|E
6000|$|Partridges {{could be}} heard {{drumming}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowlands. Mosquitoes were developing by the millions, and cooking had become almost impossible without protection. The [...] "varments" [...] came in relays. A small gray variety took hold of us while it was warm, and when it became too cold for them, the big, black, [...] "sticky" [...] fellows appeared mysteriously, and <b>hung</b> around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> uttering deep, bass notes like lazy flies. The little gray fellows were singularly ferocious and insistent in their attentions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As I passed {{across the}} court two veiled women looked {{down from a}} balcony and cursed me. The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang upon the {{polished}} floor. They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I found myself in a watered garden of seven terraces. It was planted with tulip-cups and moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes. Like a slim reed of crystal a fountain <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dusky <b>air.</b> <b>The</b> cypress-trees were like burnt-out torches. From {{one of them a}} nightingale was singing.|$|R
6000|$|In {{another moment}} a blue pigeon was {{fluttering}} round {{the room and}} making Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him. [...] "Stop there, will you," [...] said Mr. Fotheringay; and <b>the</b> pigeon <b>hung</b> motionless <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> [...] "I could change it back to a bowl of flowers," [...] he said, and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle. [...] "I expect you will want your pipe in a bit," [...] he said, and restored the tobacco-jar.|$|R
60|$|All nature at {{this hour}} seemed to invite to repose rather than to labor, and as the heat {{increased}} I longed with wordless fervor for the green woods of the Cedar River. At times the gentle wind hardly moved the bended heads of the barley, and the hawks <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> like trout sleeping in deep pools. The sunlight was a golden, silent, scorching cataract--yet each of us must strain his tired muscles and bend his aching back to the harvest.|$|E
60|$|Ten {{days later}} the {{thermometer}} went down with a rush, dropping from fifty-six to but twenty above zero. Going down to the gulch, they found the stream covered with ice, which was half an inch thick. By the next day there was no water to be found, only ice, and even the piles of sand, gravel, and dirt were frozen stiff. A heavy dulness, which oppressed them greatly, <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Winter had come, and gold washing for that season was {{a thing of the}} past.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} every one seemed running away. A woman, {{carrying}} a shawl-wrapped child, blundered into me, {{and sent me}} reeling back. Every one thought of firearms, but, {{as a matter of}} fact, something had gone wrong with the motor, what in those old-fashioned contrivances was called a backfire. A thin puff of bluish smoke <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> behind the thing. The majority of the people scattered back in a disorderly fashion, and left a clear space about the struggle that centered upon the motor-car.|$|E
60|$|And {{everywhere}} {{the world}} was awake that night, and throughout Christendom a sombre murmur <b>hung</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> keen <b>air</b> over <b>the</b> country-side like the belling of bees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heather, and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities. It was the tolling of <b>the</b> bells <b>in</b> a million belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people to sleep no more, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches and pray. And overhead, growing larger and brighter, as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed, rose the dazzling star.|$|R
500|$|This lila is a {{constant}} theme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts {{as if he were}} playing a game. This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-lila and Janmashtami, where Hindus in some regions such as Maharashtra playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open handis (clay pots) <b>hung</b> high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> to [...] "steal" [...] butter or buttermilk, spilling it all over the group.|$|R
60|$|Thurston {{showed his}} {{pleasure}} almost too openly. They chatted lightly on many subjects {{as they walked}} together, knee-deep, at times, among scarlet wine-berries, and the delicate green and ebony of maidenhair fern. The scents and essence of summer <b>hung</b> heavy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Shafts of golden sunlight, piercing the somber canopy of the forest isles, touched, and, it seemed to Geoffrey, etherealized, his companion. The completeness of his enjoyment troubled the man, and presently he lapsed into silence. All this appeared too good, too pleasant, he feared, to last.|$|R
