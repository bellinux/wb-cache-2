5|$|Since {{this was}} to be a {{full-scale}} invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. It was decided that Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges were to be set up to allow his army to cross the Hellespont to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.|$|E

5|$|The helmet is {{an example}} of a three-piece Roman {{ceremonial}} cavalry helmet, made of sheet iron covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with gold leaf. Such helmets were worn by Roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as hippika gymnasia and may also have been worn in battle, despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration. Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

5|$|Before the First World War, {{having seen}} the cavalry <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> mounted Boers during the Second Boer War, Britain {{increased}} its cavalry reserves. Smaller Cleveland Bays were used to carry British troopers, and larger members of the breed pulled artillery; the British War Office offered premiums on Cleveland Bay stallions. Although the First World War was not the cavalry war the British expected, large numbers of horses were used to pull artillery and losses were high. Because the war caused a depletion in stock, in 1920 and 1921, the British society opened a special register for previously unregistered mares of Cleveland Bay type, including some already registered with the Yorkshire Coach Horse (a Cleveland/Thoroughbred cross) registry, after they had passed an inspection that certified them to be of proper breed type. The subsequent foals of these mares were eligible for registration into the main British Cleveland Bay stud book, and were also eligible to compete in competitions reserved for breed members. Some of this progeny was bred and owned by King George V.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.|$|E

In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.|$|E
5|$|By 1779, Haider Ali had {{captured}} parts of modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south, extending the Kingdom's area to about 80,000mi² (205,000km²). In 1780, he befriended the French and {{made peace with}} the Marathas and the Nizam. However, Haider Ali was betrayed by the Marathas and the Nizam, who made treaties with the British as well. In July 1779 Haider Ali headed an army of 80,000, mostly cavalry, descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages, before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot starting the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Haider Ali had some initial successes against the British notably at Pollilur, the worst defeat the British suffered in India until Chillianwala, and Arcot, until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote, when {{the fortunes of the}} British began to change. On 1 June 1781 Sir Eyre Coote struck the first heavy blow against Haider Ali in the decisive Battle of Porto Novo. The battle was won by Sir Eyre Coote against odds of five to one, and is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest <b>feats</b> <b>of</b> the British in India. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (the scene of an earlier triumph of Haider Ali over a British force) on 27 August, in which the British won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at Sholinghur a month later. Haider Ali died on 7 December 1782, even as fighting continued with the British. He was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who continued hostilities against the British by recapturing Baidanur and Mangalore.|$|E
