25|$|On {{the second}} day they {{achieved}} this, reaching 201 thanks to half-centuries from Eoin Morgan and Peter Gillespie, {{but it was never}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> against Yorkshire. Half-centuries from Ian Harvey, Michael Vaughan and Phil Jaques saw the visitors home with 15 balls to spare as they made 202 for 4.|$|E
25|$|Lancashire Lightning eased to a {{comfortable}} win against Northamptonshire Steelbacks to go {{third in the}} table, two points behind leaders Middlesex Crusaders. Northamptonshire won the toss and batted, but 215 for 7 was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> on a fine Old Trafford pitch, where Lancashire's Mal Loye smashed 94 not out with ten fours and three sixes. There were good news for England fans as well - Test all-rounder Andrew Flintoff bowled 9 overs for Lancashire without complain from his recently operated ankle, taking the wicket of England prospect Bilal Shafayat in the process.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less {{than they would have}} wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough,</b> however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E

25|$|The {{initial budget}} was $8 million but during pre-production, {{it became obvious}} that this was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> Darkman was also a {{financial}} success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so Army of Darkness became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget. However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer Robert Tapert to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars. Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from Victor Fleming's film Joan of Arc that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in Army of Darkness. A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the Joan of Arc storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.|$|E
500|$|Nightcrawler {{was filmed}} {{on a budget}} of $8.5 million, most of which was financed by Bold Films. Part of the budget came from the $2.3 million {{allocation}} from the California Film Tax Credit program, which rewards directors for producing films in California. Tony Gilroy noted the budget was extremely low, and should have [...] "easily cost twice that amount". In {{order to make the}} most out of the budget, Elswit built [...] "efficiencies" [...] into each day of the film schedule, a role that all three Gilroy brothers described as instrumental to the completion of the film. Before the filming for Nightcrawler began, the production crew spent two days location scouting across Los Angeles. Some crew members did not believe there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> time to film every scene, and that at least fifteen pages of the script would have to be cut; Gilroy took these comments as a personal challenge. Principal photography began on October 6, 2013 in Los Angeles and lasted 27 days. Filming was a challenging and busy process, as eighty locations were used, and there were many times in which the crew had to move to multiple locations each night. Gilroy remarked that there was never a day that filming was not completed minutes before sunrise.|$|E

Sussex overhauled their modest target with 31.3 overs to go - almost two thirds of their allotted quota.|$|E
