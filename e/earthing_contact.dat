She created her first projects for exhibitions with the artists of Gruppe K (Group K) to be seen at the Haus der Kunst (House of Arts) Munich, called the optical-acoustic collage for piano and speakers and together with her husband she created vibrational objects from 1971 onwards. In 1972, she created her first [...] "sprechende Kästen" [...] (speaking boxes) on the themes of loneliness, first love and war. All of these objects needed a lot of detailed technical attention. Führer-Wolkenstein, who also invented an <b>earthing</b> <b>contact</b> tester, was the perfect partner for those technical art projects. Further, he was cautious, thoughtful and intense, while she wasvery spontaneous with an intensive willingness and strong impulse for herdecisions. Both were complementary to each other'stemper. On 25 November 1976 Führer-Wolkenstein died. Hünerfauth built a funerary monument forhim at the cemetery of Pullach (Munich) created out of scrap metal. Then, as her husband's technicalrefinement proved to be irreplaceable, Hünerfauth started to specialize in so called [...] "Artist's PrayerBooks" [...] in the 80s and 90s, which she created from micro-electronic scrap. The use of thesematerials {{as well as the}} construction of the so-called [...] "speaking boxes" [...] were unique anddistinguished her from other object artists of that time.In 1990 Hünerfauth was awarded with the Schwabinger Kunstpreis in Munich. On 12 November1998 she died in Kreuth (Tegernsee).|$|E

Many such sockets also lack the cavity required to prevent users from touching the pins whilst inserting the plug.The CEE 7/7 plug is a hybrid which includes both side earthing strips, as in CEE 7/4 Schuko, and an earthing socket, as in the CEE 7/6 plug.

25|$|German Schuko {{socket outlets}} were once widely used {{alongside}} the British standard BS546 round pin plugs (both 3-pin and 2-pin varieties). However, {{both of these}} systems were replaced by BS 1363, standardised as Irish Standard IS 401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). This standard eliminated incompatibilities between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and was chosen as it was completely incompatible with both the old Schuko or BS 546 installations and encouraged people to rewire their homes {{to comply with the}} new standard.

This harmonisation occurred before the advent of pre-fitted 2-pin plugs on appliances destined for the European 220-volt market, which might have led to a different outcome. Until UK and Irish voltages were standardised at 230 volts in the 1990s, it was common for such plugs to be pre-fitted on appliances destined for the Irish market, although they were prohibited on appliances destined for the United Kingdom market. Both countries now require the pre-fitting of BS 1363 plugs on domestic appliances.|$|R
