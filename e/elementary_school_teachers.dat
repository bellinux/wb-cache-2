5|$|This was {{followed}} by a period of building further education infrastructure. To help <b>elementary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> further their studies, Soeman took part in establishing a private junior high school in 1953. The following year he helped establish the Setia Dharma Senior High School, the first senior high school in Riau. Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony, where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared that the people of Riau had been treated like stepchildren. He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma. Though Yamin objected to Soeman's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma, he did arrange for a state senior high school to be opened in Riau.|$|E

25|$|However, {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training.

25|$|While {{the term}} Polish culture refers {{primarily}} to the Polish-language culture in Poland, the Second Polish Republic also had numerous vibrant national minorities, most notably Jewish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian and German. It was a multicultural society whose ethno-cultural makeup was shaped {{over a period of}} centuries. In 1921 according to the first-ever national census, the Catholic Poles constituted 69.2% of the population, the Ukrainians 14.3%, the Jews 7.8%, the Belarusians 3.9% and the Germans 3.9%. The minorities amounted to 30.8% of the total. The rise of new intelligentsia resulted {{in the development of a}} record number of political parties, lobbies and societies. In a dozen or so years the newspaper readership doubled. In 1919, new universities opened in Poznań, Wilno, and Lublin. Universities in Kraków and Lwów were polonized already five years earlier. The <b>Elementary</b> <b>School</b> <b>Teachers</b> Union was formed in 1919. In the first ten years of Poland's redevelopment, the total number of schools increased by almost 10,000 thanks to the official decree on public education. By the time of the Nazi-Soviet invasion of 1939, some 90% of children were in schools across the country, the number limited only by the shortage of qualified staff and lack of adequate locales especially in the villages.|$|E
25|$|Hubbard {{first began}} {{interested}} {{in the idea of}} training teachers after the editor of John Bull, who had been impressed by her writings about the deaconess movement, asked her to contribute a letter on the subject. She responded by writing several letters advocating the creation of schools to train women as teachers. These were later re-published as a pamphlet. The Elementary Education Act 1870 created a great demand for school teachers. Hubbard sought to train women to fill these roles, and worked to establish Otter College in Chichester in 1873 to train women as <b>elementary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers.</b> The idea of opening this school was first suggested to her by Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth. Hubbard promoted to idea in several venues and attempted to win public support for the venue. Otter College had been established in 1849 as a school for male teachers, but the school had ceased operations several years previous. Hubbard felt that many girls were unused to the type of academic discipline that was required to become a teacher. She continued writing about the importance of educating women and published two works in 1878 and 1880 that were meant to convince parents to educate their daughters. She also sought to establish a school for girls age 15 to 18, but was unable to do so {{due to a lack of}} funding.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to its {{campaign}} pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts {{at the elementary}} and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of <b>elementary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a priority area, with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers’ positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the Bac C) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had {{come to be known as}} a “royal road into élitist schools and careers.” The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation, and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country’s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem. They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones.|$|E
