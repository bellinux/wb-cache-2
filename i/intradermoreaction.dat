40|$|A severe exudative-crustous and proliferous {{dermatitis}} in a 2 {{year old}} sheep caused by Dermatophilus congolensis (observed {{for the first}} time in Italy), is reported. The disease was reproduced experimentally in sheep, goats, rabbits and guinea pigs, whose skin was treated in different ways before infection. E. L. I. S. A. and Immunoblotting tests carried out in experimentally infected sheep, showed the antigenic complexity of the pathogen and the existence of cross-immunity to the protein components. <b>Intradermoreaction</b> tests were carried out in all animals. The development of a positive reaction only in rabbits and guinea pigs, confirmed that these animals have a cellular immunity against Dermatophilus congolensis...|$|E
40|$|De um total de 353 crianças menores de 10 anos, submetidas à intradermo-reação no Distrito de Capitão Andrade, município de Itanhomi, em Minas Gerais, 121 mostraram-se negativas. Repetidas as intradermo-reações com intervalo de 1 ano, verificou-se a "viragem" da reação em 10 % das 121 crianças estudadas. Valorizou-se também a incidência de 10, 4 % baseada na positivação anual de exames de fezes na faixa etária de 0 a 10 anos.

40|$|After {{the mention}} of {{traditional}} laboratory pathways historically (and still presently) followed for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, the most recent changes to such traditional methods are taken into consideration. The contribution of the microscopic examination with its pros and cons, the bacterial cultures and the advantages deriving from the last generation mediums, the (growing in importance) diagnosis of bacterial resistances and, last not least, the most recent technologies {{in the field of}} molecular diagnosis, from polymerase chain reaction to the use of nucleic acid probes, from the molecular typisation of the mycobacterium to the genotypic methods to test antitubercular drug resistances. Particular attention has been put on novel immunologic tests, perhaps yet to be perfectioned but already important and to be considered in the present panel of diagnostic tools, mainly for their relevance in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis: in this sense both such tests, QuantiFERON-TB GOLD as well as T SPOT-TB (based on the interferon gamma identification) are discussed and compared with the classic Mantoux <b>intradermoreaction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background An early {{diagnostic}} test for detecting infection in leprosy is fundamental for reducing patients’ sequelae. The currently used lepromin is not adequate for disease diagnosis and, so far, no antigen {{to be used}} in <b>intradermoreaction</b> has proved to be sensitive and specific for that purpose. Aiming at identifying new reagents {{to be used in}} skin tests, candidate antigens were investigated. Methods Random peptide phage display libraries were screened by using antibodies from leprosy patients in order to identify peptides as diagnostic reagents. Results Seven different phage clones were identified using purified antibodies pooled from sera of leprosy patients. When the clones were tested with serum samples by ELISA, three of them, 5 A, 6 A and 1 B, allowed detecting a larger number of leprosy patients when compared to controls. The corresponding peptides expressed by selected phage clones were chemically synthesized. A pilot study was undertaken to assess the use of peptides in skin tests. The intradermal challenge with peptides in animals previously sensitized with Mycobacterium leprae induced a delayed-type hypersensitivity with peptide 5 A (2 / 5) and peptide 1 B (1 / 5). In positive controls, there was a 3 / 5 reactivity for lepromin and a 4 / 5 reactivity of the sensitized animals with soluble extract of M. leprae. Conclusions The preliminary data suggest that may be possible to develop reagents with diagnostic potential based on peptide mimotopes selected by phage display using polyclonal human antibodies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Para avaliar a resposta a sucessivas aplicações da intradermorreação de Montenegro (IDRM), repetimos quatro vezes o teste em moradores de uma área endêmica de calazar que tiveram o exame negativo há 3 - 4 anos. Inicialmente, repetimos três IDRM nos que permaneceram negativos, com intervalo de 60 dias entre elas. Na segunda etapa, realizamos uma última reação em todos participantes do estudo. Do total de 49 indivíduos com IDRM prévia negativa, 19 (38, 8 %) positivaram o teste em alguma das vezes, 17 (34, 7 %) abandonaram o estudo e 13 (26, 5 %) permaneceram com resultado negativo em todas as aplicações. Na segunda etapa, a repetição da IDRM mostrou que dos 14 que eram positivos em algum dos testes, 8 assim permaneceram e 6 tornaram-se negativos. Nossos resultados confirmam a possibilidade de indução de hipersensibilidade tardia em alguns indivíduos pela aplicação da IDRM. With {{the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} the response of sequential applications of Montenegro <b>intradermoreaction</b> (IDRM), we have repeated four times the test in the inhabitants of an endemic area for kala-azar, that resulted negative 3 - 4 years ago. Firstly, we have repeated three IDRM in those who remained negative, with a 60 -day interval among them. In the second stage, we have performed a last reaction in all participants of the study. From the total of 49 individuals with prior negative IDRM, 19 (38. 8 %) have positivated the test {{in some of the}} times, 17 (34. 7 %) have given up the study and 13 (26. 5 %) remained with a negative result in all the applications. In the second stage, the repetition of IDRM has shown that from the 14 positive in some of the tests, 8 remained like this and 6 have become negative. Our results confirm the possibility of late hypersensitivity induction in some individuals as a consequence of IDRM application...|$|E
