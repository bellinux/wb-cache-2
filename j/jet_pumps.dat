40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through a tapered cylindrical tube section (<b>jet</b> <b>pump)</b> placed in a larger outer tube. Due {{to the shape of}} the <b>jet</b> <b>pump,</b> an asymmetry in the hydrodynamic end effects will exist which will cause a time-averaged pressure drop to occur {{that can be used to}} cancel Gedeon streaming in a closed-loop thermoacoustic device. The performance of two <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries with different taper angles is investigated. A specific time-domain impedance boundary condition is implemented in order to simulate traveling acoustic wave conditions. It is shown that by scaling the acoustic displacement amplitude to the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> dimensions, similar minor losses are observed independent of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometry. Four different flow regimes are distinguished and the observed flow phenomena are related to the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance.

40|$|The {{effect of}} flow {{separation}} and turbulence {{on the performance}} of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> in oscillatory flows is investigated. A <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> is a static device whose shape induces asymmetric hydrodynamic end effects when placed in an oscillatory flow. This will result in a time-averaged pressure drop which can be used to suppress acoustic streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. An experimental setup is used to measure the time-averaged pressure drop as well as the acoustic power dissipation across two different <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries in a pure oscillatory flow. The results are compared against published numerical results where flow separation was found to {{have a negative effect on}} the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance in a laminar flow. Using hot-wire anemometry the onset of flow separation is determined experimentally and the applicability of a critical Reynolds number for oscillatory pipe flows is confirmed for <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> applications. It is found that turbulence can lead to a reduction of flow separation and hence, to an improvement in <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance compared to laminar oscillatory flows...|$|R

30|$|In an oil field, {{when the}} crude cannot {{come to the}} surface on its own due to either low {{pressure}} differential or the fluid properties like high viscosity, artificial lift technology has to be used. The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> {{is one of the}} artificial lift techniques considered to be better than other lift systems because of no moving parts and simple working principle. This makes it easy to monitor and regulate. It works on the fluid power hence it can be placed at greater depths and at varying angles with respect to the horizontal. In a field, some wells are deeper than the others, while some are deviated. The performance of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> is different for different cases as the parameters affecting it are the depth and the angle of placement. These aspects with respect to the working of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> need to be investigated and demonstrated. Hence, an effort has been made in this paper to design an experimental setup by which the pump efficiency with respect to depths and angles of placement can be easily determined. The experimental setup uses a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> driven by an electric motor of 2.5  kW along with a measurement setup. The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> was mounted on a hinged fixture and injection fluid from a centrifugal pump was used. The gate valve was used to throttle the flow for injection and create resistance across the delivery line of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> as a measure of increasing depth. These flow rates were used to characterize the performance of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

50|$|Deep well {{pumps are}} those in which the jet {{is located at the}} bottom of the well. The maximum depth for deep well pumps is {{determined}} by the inside diameter of and the velocity through the jet. The major advantage of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> for deep well installations is the ability to situate all mechanical parts (e.g., electric/petrol motor, rotating impellers) at the ground surface for easy maintenance. The advent of the electrical submersible pump has partly replaced the need for jet type well pumps, except for driven point wells or surface water intakes.|$|E
50|$|The RPV and Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal recirculation pumps are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal recirculation pumps eliminate all of the <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> in the RPV, all of the large external recirculation loop pumps and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|E

50|$|Eductors or eductor-jet {{pumps are}} {{an example of}} entrainment. They are used onboard many ships to pump out flooded compartments: {{in the event of}} an accident, {{seawater}} is pumped to the eductor and forced through a jet, and any fluid at the inlet of the eductor is carried along to the outlet and up and out of the compartment. Eductors can pump out whatever can flow through them, including water, oil, and small pieces of wood.

50|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{commonly}} used to extract water from water wells. The main pump, often a centrifugal pump, is powered and installed at ground level. Its discharge is split, with {{the greater part of}} the flow leaving the system, while a portion of the flow is returned to the jet pump installed below ground in the well. This recirculated part of the pumped fluid is used to power the jet. At the jet pump, the high-energy, low-mass returned flow drives more fluid from the well, becoming a low-energy, high-mass flow which is then piped to the inlet of the main pump.|$|E
