2500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{compared}} {{the film to}} other horror sequels and recently released slasher films of the early 1980s {{rather than to the}} original. [...] "By the standards of most recent horror films, this—like its predecessor—is a class act." [...] She notes that there [...] "is some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is more likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones." [...] Maslin applauded the performance of the cast and Rosenthal and concluded, [...] "That may not be much to ask of a horror film, but it's more than many of them offer." [...] David Pirie's review in Time Out magazine gave Rosenthal's film positive marks, stating, [...] "Rosenthal is no Carpenter, but he makes a fair job of emulating the latter's visual style in this sequel." [...] He wrote that the Myers character had evolved since the first film to become [...] "an agent of Absolute Evil." [...] Film historian Jim Harper suggests, [...] "Time <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fairer to the film" [...] than original critics. In retrospect, [...] "many critics have come to recognise that it's considerably better than the slew of imitation slashers that swamped the genre in the eighties." ...|$|E

My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

2500|$|The release {{coincided with}} a wave of renewed {{interest}} in the Beatles' work, sparked by EMI/Capitol Records reissuing the band's catalog following the demise of Apple. Music critics praised Thirty Three & 1/3 as Harrison's finest album since All Things Must Pass, and wrote approvingly of the more subtle tone of his spiritual message compared with the perceived preachiness of Living in the Material World (1973) and Dark Horse (1974).

3000|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{simulator}} was to facilitate learner visualization and simulation of the behaviour of the problem system and identifying the qualitative relationships between various parameters, since we conjectured that learners will have difficulty doing this via mental simulation. Learners recognized these benefits of the simulator; the simulator provided a visualization of the effect of different parameters on the behaviour of different parts of the system as mentioned by S 10, “Like for such cases, I feel {{that we need to have}} some visualization about it, like in this we got a simulator, by which I was able to visualize how it is changing the different parameters, so, same way for solving a problem, we need to have a visualization or some factor that helps you that my this parameter is being affected by so and so parameters, so, it helps you to establish some relationships between the two.” Further, learners also reported that initially, they had only thought of the mechanical power and the factors that affected it, but after interacting with the simulator, they realized how the mechanical parameters are related to the electrical parameters. Articulating this, S 5 reported, “That would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> difficult to identify as in you are saying that current correlation with torque and that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> difficult to identify because we don’t have any prior experience, working with motors, that much.” [...]...|$|R
