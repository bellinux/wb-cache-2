50|$|Solvent {{extraction}} and electrowinning (SX/EW) is a two-stage <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> {{that first}} extracts and upgrades copper ions from low-grade leach solutions into a solvent containing a chemical that selectively reacts with and binds the copper in the solvent.

50|$|In 1992, renewed {{interest}} by Canadian investors {{led to the}} establishment of a new mining claim. Subsequent exploration established that vast amounts of copper ore, as well as commercial quantities of cobalt, zinc, and manganese still existed on the site. Over a fifteen year period, two test mining programs, two process pilot campaigns, and a +38,000 metre in-fill drill program were carried out, culminating in a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). The DFS was completed in 2007 by the current lease holder - Minera y Metallurgica del Boleo - and followed by a Technical Report update issued in March 2010. Boleo is expected to yield copper-cobalt-zinc-manganese and is fully permitted. However, the old metallurgical process used by previous operators is unfit for the recovery of these values. Small scale testing has established that a <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> can effectively recover all four metals, with competitive economics. The <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process,</b> and the lack of fresh water at the site requires the construction of a desalination plant.|$|E
50|$|Metal {{recovery}} {{is the final}} step in a <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process.</b> Metals suitable for sale as raw materials are often directly produced in the metal recovery step. Sometimes, however, further refining is required if ultra-high purity metals are to be produced. The primary types of metal recovery processes are electrolysis, gaseous reduction, and precipitation. For example, a major target of hydrometallurgy is copper, which is conveniently obtained by electrolysis. Cu2+ ions reduce at mild potentials, leaving behind other contaminating metals such as Fe2+ and Zn2+.|$|E

In the method according to the invention, a <b>hydrometallurgical</b> breakdown <b>process</b> is performed, in which acid is added, while the volumetric flow rate of hydrogen released during the <b>hydrometallurgical</b> breakdown <b>process</b> or the entire released hydrogen volume is simultaneously determined.

50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1962, a new {{facility}} was started in Plant 8 {{for the production of}} UF4 by an aqueous precipitation technique known as the Winlo process. The Winlo process was developed for the low-cost chemical conversion of relatively pure uranium concentrates to green salt by a <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process.</b> The feed to the plant Winlo system was made up of a combination of black oxide (U3O8) generated by burning metallic residues, uranyl chloride solutions generated by dissolving massive metal residues in hydrochloric acid, and UAP produced from low-grade residues in the hydrometallurgical recovery system.|$|E
50|$|The Long Harbour Nikel Processing Plant {{was built}} on a {{partially}} brownfield site near the port of Long Harbour. The facility consists of a wharf for offloading nickel ore concentrate from bulk carriers, crushing and grinding facilities, a main processing plant approximately 2 km south of the port, a pipeline to supply process water, an effluent discharge pipe and diffuser, and a residue pipeline to a nearby disposal area. The <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> in the plant will pressure-leach the nickel ore concentrate in acidic solutions to separate iron, sulfur and other impurities from nickel, copper and cobalt.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the Anglo-Saxon {{method for}} cupellation, the Chinese {{employed}} {{the use of}} a base metal to extract the target metal from its impurities. First, the base metal, iron, is hammered into thin sheets. The sheets are then placed into a trough filled with “vitriol water” i.e., copper mining water which is then left to steep for several day. The mining water contains copper salts in the form of copper sulfate [...] The iron then reacts with the copper, displacing it from the sulfate ions, causing the copper to precipitate onto the iron sheets, forming a [...] "wet" [...] powder. Finally, the precipitated copper is collected and refined further through the traditional smelting process. This is the first large-scale use of a <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electrometallurgy {{involves}} metallurgical {{processes that}} take place in some form of electrolytic cell. The most common types of electrometallurgical processes are electrowinning and electro-refining. Electrowinning is an electrolysis process used to recover metals in aqueous solution, usually as the result of an ore having undergone one or more <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>processes.</b> The metal of interest is plated onto the cathode, while the anode is an inert electrical conductor. Electro-refining is used to dissolve an impure metallic anode (typically from a smelting process) and produce a high purity cathode. Fused salt electrolysis is another electrometallurgical process whereby the valuable metal has been dissolved into a molten salt which acts as the electrolyte, and the valuable metal collects on the cathode of the cell. The fused salt electrolysis process is conducted at temperatures sufficient to keep both the electrolyte and the metal being produced in the molten state. The scope of electrometallurgy has significant overlap with the areas of hydrometallurgy and (in the case of fused salt electrolysis) pyrometallurgy. Additionally, electrochemical phenomena play a considerable role in many mineral processing and <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|R

However, even high-grade, costly manufactured magnets are not recycled on an industrial scale today. The metallurgical and hydrogen-based recycling processes described here are based on a materials recycling approach, i. e., they aim at regaining the permanent magnet alloy. Both approaches are comparatively energy-efficient compared to traditional <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Hydrometallurgy is {{concerned}} with processes involving aqueous solutions to extract metals from ores. The {{first step in the}} <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> is leaching, which involves dissolution of the valuable metals into the aqueous solution and/or a suitable solvent. After the solution is separated from the ore solids, the extract is often subjected to various processes of purification and concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic state or as a chemical compound. This may include precipitation, distillation, adsorption, and solvent extraction. The final recovery step may involve precipitation, cementation, or an electrometallurgical process. Sometimes, hydrometallurgical processes may be carried out directly on the ore material without any pretreatment steps. More often, the ore must be pretreated by various mineral processing steps, and sometimes by pyrometallurgical processes.|$|E
50|$|Goro Nickel Plant, {{is one of}} {{the largest}} <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> plants constructed, {{estimated}} to cost $3.2bn, with a design capacity of 60,000 tonnes of nickel per annum. The nickel is extracted from laterite, with proven reserves of 120 million tonnes. Cobalt is also being produced here from saprolite deposits. Opencast extraction to depths of 50-60 m is being employed (the shallower layers have no commercial value). The major share in the Plant is held by a consortium with Vale Inco (of Brazil) holding a 69% share and a joint company called Sumic Nickel Netherlands, Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Ltd., and Mitsui Co. Ltd., holding 21%.share. The three provinces of New Caledonia hold the balance 10% share. The project was stalled for a while as the local community of Kanak people stiffly opposed the project, particularly of laying the offshore line. As of 2014 pollution into the lagoon was a problem and there were shutdowns.|$|E
50|$|The Sherritt {{process is}} a <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>process</b> named for Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. (now Sherritt International) of Sherridon and Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada, based on the older Forward process {{developed}} by Dr. Frank Forward for the recovery of copper and nickel from those same mines. Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, {{or they may be}} treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an ammoniacal solution to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to precipitate nickel powder (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)6(SO4)2). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO4)•((NH4)2SO4)•6H2O) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered. The solution is then further reduced with more sulfuric acid and cobalt metal powder is added to aid in the nucleation of precipitants (seeding). Addition of hydrogen gas to saturation precipitates cobalt powder with a purity of approximately 99.6%.|$|E

Another hydrometallurgical routes is the Caron process, which consists of roasting followed by ammonia leaching and precipitation as nickel carbonate. Additionally, ferronickel is produced by the rotary kiln - electric furnace (RKEF) process.|$|R
40|$|While pyrometallurgical {{processes}} are old technology {{and were the}} dominant and logical route used to treat sulfide concentrates they are now challenged by new <b>hydrometallurgical</b> <b>processes.</b> In these new processes there have been attempts {{in the past few}} years to avoid using autoclaves in the treatment of concentrates of zinc, copper, and nickel.
