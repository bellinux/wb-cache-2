5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E
25|$|The Peoples Temple {{also worked}} to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> vote in precincts where Moscone {{received}} a 12 to 1 vote margin over Barbagelata. After Peoples Temple's work and votes by Temple members {{were instrumental in}} delivering a close victory for Moscone, Moscone appointed Temple leader Jim Jones as Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Commission.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 a {{by-election}} set {{the model}} for future NDP campaigns. Under the campaign management of Gerald Caplan, Stephen Lewis, and Marjorie Pinney the NDP canvassed every household three times, identified all their supporters, and then they got out the vote. This strategy {{is also known as}} PIG, Persuade, Identify, <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> vote. Lawyer Jim Renwick won with 7,287 votes compared to 5,774 votes for the Conservatives and 5,771 votes for the Liberals.|$|E

25|$|If a wicket falls {{near the}} end of a day's play, {{especially}} if the light is failing, or if the bowlers seem particularly confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman. If the nightwatchman does not get out before the end of that day's play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman does <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> cost of losing a late wicket will have been minimised, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat.|$|E
25|$|Once the Union battery at Venus Point was disclosed, Confederate gunboats {{engaged in}} gunnery duels, {{but they were}} driven off. Over the next week, the besiegers {{completely}} surrounded the Fort. Federals built another battery on the Savannah River across from Venus Point. They threw a boom across Tybee Creek and cut the telegraph line between Savannah and Cockspur Island. Two infantry companies entrenched nearby to ward off Confederate raiding activity and a gunboat was detailed to patrol the channel and support the infantry. By late February 1862, no supplies or reinforcements could get in; the Confederate garrison could not <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> last link of communications was a weekly swamp swimming courier.|$|E
25|$|Cunningham {{directed}} the LWV's 1924 <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>The</b> Vote Campaign, {{for which she}} toured several states. The campaign was her final act as an officer of LWV. Cunningham accepted Eleanor Roosevelt's invitation to join Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair Emily Newell Blair's Democratic Women's Advisory Committee (DWAC). It was authorized by DNC chair Cordell Hull and met in 1924 in New York City. Eleanor Roosevelt was the committee chair. The DNC platform committee refused {{to meet with the}} DWAC, but Cunningham was able to meet with the platform committee as part of the LWV. Watching the platform committee undermine her presentations became a learning curve for Cunningham, who was beginning to believe women needed more involvement in partisan politics.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} from abroad in 1988, Brown {{announced}} that he would stand as a candidate to become chairman of the California Democratic Party, and won against investment banker Steve Westly. Although Brown greatly expanded the party's donor base and enlarged its coffers, with a focus on grassroots organizing and <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> vote drives, he was criticized for not spending enough money on TV ads, which was felt to have contributed to Democratic losses in several close races in 1990. In early 1991, Brown abruptly resigned his post and {{announced that he would}} run for the Senate seat held by the retiring Alan Cranston. Although Brown consistently led in the polls for both the nomination and the general election, he abandoned the campaign, deciding instead to run for the presidency for the third time.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} {{elections}} also varies between nations. In the United States, negative campaigning and character attacks {{are more common}} than elsewhere, potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> vote efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties. Countries where multiparty systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts. Nations with a party specifically geared towards the working class will tend to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have only big tent parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from.|$|E
25|$|Rosenstone and Hansen {{contend that}} the decline in turnout in the United States {{is the product of}} a change in campaigning {{strategies}} as a result of the so-called new media. Before the introduction of television, almost all of a party's resources would be directed towards intensive local campaigning and <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> vote initiatives. In the modern era, these resources have been redirected to expensive media campaigns in which the potential voter is a passive participant. During the same period, negative campaigning has become ubiquitous in the United States and elsewhere and has been shown to impact voter turnout. Attack ads and smear campaigns give voters a negative impression of the entire political process. The evidence for this is mixed: elections involving highly unpopular incumbents generally have high turnout; some studies have found that mudslinging and character attacks reduce turnout, but that substantive attacks on a party's record can increase it.|$|E

25|$|Ole Miss {{took the}} opening {{possession}} and drove 82 {{yards and scored}} the games first touchdown on a 27-yard end-around by Mico McSwain. Auburn answered with their scoring drive ending in 13-yard TD pass from Brandon Cox to wide receiver Rodgeriqus Smith. Auburn held Ole Miss on the next possession and drove down the field before Brandon Cox was intercepted by Charles Clark at the Ole Miss 12. Under quarterback Brent Schaeffer, the Rebels moved down the field to the Auburn 41 before stalling and being forced to punt and pinning Auburn on their own 2-yardline to start the drive. The Tigers opened up throwing to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> shadows of their own goalposts and, continuing on the accurate passing of Cox, were able {{to move to the}} Rebels 40 before tailback Brad Lester fumbled {{at the end of a}} 6-yard run and the Rebels recovered but with only 45 seconds left in the half.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Aquino {{declared}} {{that the presence of}} U.S. military forces in the Philippines was an affront to national sovereignty. She ordered the United States military to vacate U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and Clark Air Base. The United States objected, pointing that they had leased the property and the leases were still in effect. Also, thousands of Filipinos worked at these military facilities and they would lose their jobs and the Filipino economy would suffer if the U.S. military moved out. The United States stated that the facilities at Subic Bay were unequaled anywhere in Southeast Asia and a U.S. pullout could make all of that region of the world vulnerable to an incursion by the Soviet Union or by a resurgent Japan. She refused to back down and insisted that the United States <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> matter was still being debated when Mount Pinatubo erupted in June 1991, covering the entire area with volcanic ash.
