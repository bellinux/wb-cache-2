50|$|Because <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> {{is easily}} hydrolyzed, it cannot be handled in air. One method used to {{overcome}} this problem is to convert it to a less reactive bis(dimethylamino)silane.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1930s, {{the demand}} for {{silicones}} increased due {{to the need for}} better insulators for electric motors and sealing materials for aircraft engines, and with it the need for a more efficient synthesis of <b>dimethyldichlorosilane.</b> To solve the problem, General Electric, Corning Glass Works, and Dow Chemical Company began a partnership that ultimately became the Dow Corning Company. During 1941-1942, Eugene G. Rochow, a chemist from General Electric, and Richard Müller, working independently in Germany, found an alternate synthesis of <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> that allowed it to be produced on an industrial scale. [...] This Direct Synthesis, or Direct process, which is used in today’s industry, involves the reaction of elemental silicon with methyl chloride {{in the presence of a}} copper catalyst.|$|E
5000|$|TMSCl is {{prepared}} {{on a large}} scale by the Direct process, the reaction of methyl chloride with a silicon-copper alloy.

The relevant reactions are (Me = CH3): ...|$|E
5000|$|While this {{reaction}} {{is the standard}} in industrial silicone production and is nearly identical to the first direct synthesis of methyltrichlorosilane, the overall process is inefficient with respect to methyltrichlorosilane. [...] Even though <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> is usually the major product, if methyltrichlorosilane is needed, the amount of metal catalyst is reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Rochow’s {{synthesis}} involved passing {{methyl chloride}} through a heated tube packed with ground silicon and copper(I) chloride. [...] The current industrial method places finely ground silicon in a fluidized bed reactor at about 300 °C. The catalyst is applied as Cu2O. Methyl chloride is then {{passed through the}} reactor to produce mainly <b>dimethyldichlorosilane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Polymeric {{forms of}} the group IV {{elements}} are well known. The premier materials are polysilanes, which are analogous to polyethylene and related organic polymers.

50|$|<b>Dimethyldichlorosilane</b> hydrolyzes to form linear and cyclic silicones, {{compounds}} containing Si-O backbones.

The reaction medium can be varied further to maximize the yield of a specific product.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} formula for PDMS is CH3Si(CH3)2OnSi(CH3)3, where n {{is the number}} of repeating monomer SiO(CH3)2 units. Industrial synthesis can begin from <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> and water by the following net reaction:The polymerization reaction evolves hydrochloric acid. For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the chlorine atoms in the silane precursor were replaced with acetate groups. In this case, the polymerization produces acetic acid, which is less chemically aggressive than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone caulk and adhesives.|$|E
50|$|The Direct Process, {{also called}} the Direct Synthesis, Rochow Process, and Müller-Rochow Process {{is the most common}} {{technology}} for preparing organosilicon compounds on an industrial scale. It was first reported independently by Eugene G. Rochow and Richard Müller in the 1940s. The reaction involves a copper-catalyzed reaction of alkyl halides with silicon metal, which takes place in a fluidized bed reactor. Although theoretically possible with any type of alkyl halide, the best results in terms of selectivity and yield occur with methyl chloride. Typical conditions are 300 °C and 2-5 bar. These conditions allow for 90-98% conversion for silicon and 30-90% for chloromethane. Approximately 1.4 Mton of <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> (Me2SiCl2) is produced annually using this process.|$|E

However the synthesis of silicones (scheme 1) and almost all organosilicon chemistry is only accessible through elemental silicon.

Then, the silicon is reacted with methyl chloride to give a mixture of methylchlorosilanes catalyzed by cooper containing a variety of tract metals such as tin, zinc etc. The so-called direct process was first discovered at GE in 1940.

40|$|Nowadays, how {{to achieve}} both high <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> {{selectivity}} and silicon conversion in the Rochow reaction still remains a major challenge in the organosilane industry, in which silicon and chloromethane are converted into methylchlorosilanes on Cu-based catalysts mixed with ZnO promoter. Therefore, this calls {{for the development of}} outstanding catalysts with both high activity and selectivity for the Rochow reaction and also for a deep fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanism. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of copper oxide-zinc oxide catalysts ((CuO) (x) ZnO (0 <= x <= 49)) with a distinct porous hollow spherical structure for the reaction. These porous hollow spherical catalysts composed of CuO and ZnO nanoparticles were prepared through co-adsorption of Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + in the interior and outer surfaces of the hydrothermally synthesized carbonaceous spheres, followed by a new hydrothermal treatment and calcination in air. The catalytic properties of the (CuO) (x) ZnO hollow spheres for <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> synthesis via the Rochow reaction was investigated, and {{a deeper understanding of the}} catalytic mechanism was obtained. As compared to pure CuO hollow spheres, the prepared (CuO) (19) ZnO hollow spheres exhibited much higher <b>dimethyldichlorosilane</b> selectivity and silicon conversion, which are clearly related to the synergistic electronic effect between Cu and ZnO and to the distinct catalyst structures which allow intimate contact of the reactant molecules with the active component and the efficient transport of the molecules.
