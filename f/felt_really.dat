5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> disappointed, I {{believed in}} the record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
500|$|... {{was a fun}} song to do. Mariah {{brought me}} 'Genius of Love' and I laid some strings on {{it and put it}} into a groove I <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> fit and {{highlighted}} her voice. And that song didn't take us but a minute to do, because she really busted that out within two days. We did a rough copy and let Tommy Mottola hear it and he loved it, so all we had to do was bring it back in and mix it.|$|E

I kept {{stressing}} to Jermaine , ‘I {{got to do something}} for the kids.’ I had talked about it on the last album – and there was a song that I had, and it wasn’t quite completed. And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> badly about that. So he just handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E

I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their lasting {{influence}} on modern music, the band {{has attempted to}} disassociate themselves {{with many of the}} bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise." [...] He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining [...] "the problem is most of [...] aren't very good." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} former {{poet laureate}} Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky {{was chosen to}} guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa, [...] and because they knew that Pinsky was {{a fan of the}} show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he [...] "admired the writing" [...] of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was [...] "stranded" [...] there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; [...] "Ian [...] and The Simpsons people were very nice to me," [...] he said. [...] "... One of the things they did for me is they invited me to a table-read of another episode Thursday the 13th I remember everybody laughed like hell It <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> good. People just went to work and everybody laughed a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He wrote that although [...] "Welcome Wagon" [...] was designed to appeal to new viewers, that {{it was still a}} good episode. [...] "'Welcome Wagon', written by Thomas, proves the show is as clever and witty as ever. [...] The more exposition-heavy aspects of the premiere mean the episode isn't a true standout for the series, but that's understandable, given what it's trying to accomplish." [...] He went on to state that the episode featured more [...] "lighthearted" [...] content before what he predicted would be a return to more dramatic elements. Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a positive review, stating, [...] "Great first episode back…There was a lot to accomplish in setting up the new environment and characters, but it still <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> organic to the series as a whole." [...] While criticizing the fact that the rape victims experienced a backlash against them, he enjoyed the characterization of Piz.|$|E
500|$|HAL Laboratory {{developed}} Super Smash Bros. Melee, with Masahiro Sakurai as {{the head}} of production. The game {{was one of the first}} games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening FMV sequence that would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screen shots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor. The game was in development for 13 months, and Sakurai called his lifestyle during this period [...] "destructive" [...] with no holidays and short weekends. Unlike the experimental first Super Smash Bros., he felt great pressure to deliver a quality sequel, claiming it was the [...] "biggest project I had ever led up to that point". Despite the painful development cycle, Sakurai proudly called it [...] "the sharpest game in the series... it just <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> good to play", even compared to its successor, Super Smash Bros. Brawl.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I think because I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E
500|$|According to showrunner Ronald D. Moore, {{the concept}} of Ellen and Saul Tigh's {{relationship}} being more than an average husband-and-wife relationship {{went back to the}} pilot mini-series for Battlestar Galactica but was not made part of the story arc for the two characters until the middle of Season 3. As writing progressed on the episode [...] "Torn," [...] the writing staff needed to explain why Baltar would not see all 12 Cylon models aboard the base star. Moore came up with {{the concept of}} five Cylon models that had yet to be revealed. Later, during writing sessions for the episode [...] "Rapture," [...] D'Anna Biers has a vision in which she confronts the Final Five Cylons in the opera house, and apologizes to one of them. Although Moore and the writing team had yet to formally settle on Ellen Tigh as one of the Final Five, Moore says it was his intention for the Cylon to be Ellen. When one of the final four Cylons was revealed to be Saul Tigh in the episode [...] "Crossroads," [...] Moore finally decided to make Ellen the fifth Cylon because [...] "Tigh being revealed as a Cylon was such a profound shift in that character, such a big leap for the show, that it <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> natural that she was also a Cylon." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{began as}} a single {{stand-alone}} animated short titled [...] "Adventure Time", which ran for seven minutes. It aired in January 2007 and again as part of Frederator Studios' Random! Cartoons on December 7, 2008. After its release, the short video became a viral hit on the internet. Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network, but the network passed on it twice. The studio approached Cartoon Network, which {{said it would be}} willing to produce a series if Ward could prove the short could be expanded into a full series while maintaining elements of the original's pilot. Rob Sorcher, the chief content officer at Cartoon Network, was influential in getting the network {{to take a chance on}} the show; he recognized the series as [...] "something that <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> indie...comic book-y [...] really new". Ward quickly rethought the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than be characterized by the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that permeated the original film. Ward's college friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto helped him produce a rough storyboard that featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. Cartoon Network was not happy with this story and asked for another. Ward then created a storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original Nicktoons short. Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] was the first episode to enter into production.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the release}} of the first album was delayed, they had already written most of Morningrise when Orchid was released.

2500|$|Writing funny but factual {{magazine}} articles was Cuppy's real talent. He enjoyed a brief success in 1933 with a humorous talk show on NBC radio with actress and gourmet cook Jeanne Owen, but he flopped on the lecture circuit. Basically shy, Cuppy was happiest {{when he was}} rummaging through scholarly journals prizing out facts to copy out on his note cards. According to Feldkamp, one of Cuppy's favorite places was the Bronx Zoo, [...] "where he <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> relaxed." ...|$|E

[...] A few days later, Robyn spoke to MTV News about the performance, saying, [...] "usually, awards shows can be so strange, but [...] <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> real.

I <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> wanted. It was really amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.... I <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Assisting 2K Marin were {{artists from}} 2K Australia, 2K China, Digital Extremes, and Arkane Studios. Character modeler Brendan George {{recalled}} that the modelers {{would have to}} think about how the concept art would be animated, not directly copying from the concept art to avoid animation issues and the uncanny valley. Character concept artist Colin Fix recalled that while the teams researched the time period for era-appropriate influences, costumes would need regular adjustment.
