40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} investigate the role of posterior neocortex (areas 17, 18 and 18 a) in the maintenance of performance on the radial maze. Following training to criterion on the 8 -arm radial maze, rats received either sham operations, bilateral eye <b>enucleations,</b> lesions of posterior neocortex, or combined <b>enucleations</b> and lesions of posterior neocortex. While the enucleated animals with intact brains showed a slight, but significant performance decrement relative to the sham-operated group, the other two groups, with lesions of areas 17, 18 and 18 a, each showed a massive deficit. This large deficit was observed even in the group in which both the eyes and neocortex had been removed. These {{results suggest that the}} visual projection areas of cortex not only {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of accurate radial-maze performance in sighted animals, but that the integrity of these areas is necessary for the maintenance of criterion performance in blind animals...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To examine implant {{extrusion}} rates after evisceration with immediate or delayed implants {{in patients}} with culture-proven endophthalmitis. To compare postevisceration and postenucleation pain. Methods: This prospective, nonrandomized interventional case series included four groups of patients: group 1, 25 endophthalmitis patients undergoing evisceration with immediate implants; group 2, 15 endophthalmitis patients undergoing evisceration with delayed implants; group 3, 31 patients without endophthalmitis undergoing evisceration with immediate implants; and group 4, eight patients undergoing <b>enucleations</b> with implants. Standardized techniques and follow-up schedules were used. Postoperative pain was assessed by weighted frequency of pain medications used during two 48 -hour periods. Statistical analysis was performed. Retrospective review of two series of patients undergoing evisceration was performed. Results: No cases of implant extrusion occurred during an average follow-up of 37. 9 months. Average implant size was 19. 0 mm. Conjunctival dehiscence occurred in one patient. Average total pain scores were 20. 8 in endophthalmitis patients with immediate implants; 22. 1 in endophthalmitis patients with delayed implants; 20. 3 {{in patients with}}out endophthalmitis and with immediate implants; and 23. 1 in patients with <b>enucleations</b> and immediate implant insertions. Retrospective review suggested possible causes of implant extrusion. Conclusion: Both immediate and delayed implant techniques appear safe in patients with endophthalmitis, with the former being simpler, more cost-effective, and perhaps less painful. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and smaller implants may render {{a false sense of}} security against implant extrusion; good surgical technique and meticulous postoperative wound care are essential.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{report of}} 2 cases {{describes}} the diagnostic procedures {{used to identify}} 2 Stafne's bone cavities (SBC) found in unusually anterior locations in the mandible, both mimicking periapical lesions of endodontic origin. METHODS: In the first patient, a 47 -year-old man, an SBC was diagnosed {{in the area of}} teeth # 27, 28, and 29. In the second patient, a 62 -year-old man, the SBC was a fortuitous finding, because this patient was referred for dental implant therapy. RESULTS: In both cases, the final diagnosis was achieved by using limited cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In both patients, the lingual bone cavity was found to be occupied by accessory salivary gland tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CBCT and MRI as noninvasive diagnostic techniques seems ideal to avoid surgical explorations, incisional biopsies, or <b>enucleations</b> of the lesion for diagnostic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Prostatic intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} (PIN) {{has been}} considered as a precursor of prostatic cancer.

The PIN status of tissue specimens from 789 men without prostate cancer was determined in 508 transurethral resections and 281 transvesical prostatic <b>enucleations.</b> All slides were reviewed blind and independently by two pathologists. The patients were followed for an average of 11 years, and the incidence of subsequent cancer and cause-specific survival were analysed. Thirty-six cases of clinical prostatic cancer occurred among the cohort of 789 men through follow-up. No association between the presence of PIN in the transition/central zone and subsequent cancer development was found. There was also no difference in survival related to PIN status among the subsequent cancer patients...|$|R
25|$|An {{elective}} secondary {{procedure is}} required to place the coupling peg or post in those patients who desire improved prosthetic motility. That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after <b>enucleation</b> to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, {{but they have been}} used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion. Under local anesthesia, a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.|$|E
25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, {{the concern is that}} imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of <b>enucleation</b> is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there has}} been {{numerous}} successes with cloning animals, questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum. Despite many attempts, success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited. There lies {{a problem in the}} human cell's ability to form a blastocyst; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development. This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development. These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success. A research group from the Oregon Health & Science University demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully reprogrammed skin cells into stem cells. The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II (MII) of the cell cycle. Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states. When the ovum's nucleus is removed, the cell loses its genetic information. This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability. It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes, <b>enucleation</b> negatively affects these factors. Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast, affecting reprogramming ability. Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells. In May 2013, the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT, using fetal and infant donor cells. Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure, human clone embryos were successfully produced. These embryos were of poor quality, lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed trophectoderm. The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC. The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum's nucleus and injection of the somatic nucleus improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation. The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas, expressed pluripotent transcription factors, and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype, indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC-like. This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells. This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Worldwide {{experience}} with laparoscopic pancreatic resection remains limited. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the feasibility, safety and outcome of laparoscopic pancreatic resection. Methodology: 15 consecutive patients suffering from benign cystic pancreatic (n= 6), neuroendocrine tumors (n= 8) or pancreatic metastasis from renal carcinoma (n= 1) undergoing laparoscopic pancreatic resection were retrospectively collected from 5 academic hospitals. Results: Laparoscopic procedure was completed in 10 patients, including 7 distal pancreatectomies (with 5 spleen preservation), 2 tumor <b>enucleations</b> and 1 partial cystic resection. Conversion was due to inappropriate operative finding for laparoscopic approach in 2 patients and for uncontrollable bleeding in 3 patients. Postoperative pancreatic-related complications included pancreatic fistula in 20 % and peripancreatic collection in 13 % of the patients. Conclusions: Laparoscopic pancreatic resection is feasible for distal pancreatic tumors.

40|$|Research into visual {{prosthetics}} {{is expected}} to revolutionize the treatment of blind patients with incurable outer retinal degenerative disease. Substantial evidence shows that useful visual sensations can be produced by controlled electrical stimulation of the optic nerve. To make the optic nerve visual prosthesis more acceptable, implantation techniques safer and less invasive than those previously used have been developed. A medial transconjunctival approach is now used to implant a stimulating electrode around the intraorbital section of the optic nerve. This new technique allows sufficient exposure of the nerve after detaching only one rectus muscle and performing a lateral canthotomy. Previously, an electrode was implanted in the intracranial part of the optic nerve, which required more invasive surgery. The new technique was first developed in cadavers and in patients undergoing eye <b>enucleations.</b> Finally, a 68 -year-old blind man suffering from retinitis pigmentosa underwent long-term implantation.

We have examined the distribution and the number of retrogradely labelled ganglion cells that project to {{the same side of the}} brain from the surviving eyes shortly after the uncrossed pathway is first formed in normal development (postnatal days 14 to 28). Even at these early stages of development the surviving uncrossed pathway shows no significant reduction, confirming earlier observations of adult marsupials and showing that at no stage in development is there any evidence that the crossed pathway from one eye influences the navigation of axons that will form the uncrossed pathway from the other eye. This is in sharp contrast to observations of mice, rats and ferrets and is in accord with expectations based on the difference of the chiasmatic structure in marsupials as compared with eutherians...|$|R

In almost all patients the diagnosis was suggested by an imaging procedure. In the 12 nonoperated patients the average size of the tumor was 4. 7 cm (range: 3 - 8 cm). No problems related to the tumor occurred during the follow-up period. The average size of the resected lesion was 10 cm (range: 4 - 32 cm).

Five lobectomies, five left lateral segmentectomies, two trisegmentectomies, two segmentectomies, and two <b>enucleations</b> were performed. There were no postoperative deaths. Review of the literature indicates that although rapid growth of the lesion occurred during pregnancy in one patient, the effects of pregnancy or contraceptive drugs on growth are inconsistent. Spontaneous rupture occurs infrequently, and the potential for rupture should not constitute an indication for resection, which should be performed selectively.
