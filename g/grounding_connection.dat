5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a bootleg {{ground is}} an electrical ground that is wired from the neutral {{side of a}} receptacle or light fixture in an older 2-wire home. This essentially connects the neutral side of the receptacle to the casing of an appliance or lamp. It can be a hazard because the neutral wire is a current-carrying conductor, which means the casing can become energized. In addition, a fault condition to a bootleg ground will not trip a GFCI breaker or a receptacle that is wired from the load side of a GFCI receptacle. Bootleg grounding is illegal and against code in many places. A safer alternative Sec. 406.4(D)(2)(b) if a <b>grounding</b> <b>connection</b> is not practicable (where a local electrical code allows it) is to install a GFCI and leave the grounding terminal screw unconnected, then place a label that says [...] "No Equipment Ground" [...] on the GFCI and a marking that states “GFCI Protected” and “No Equipment Ground” on all downstream receptacles.|$|E
5000|$|ITT Interconnect Solutions is a {{globally}} diversified connector and {{connector assembly}} manufacturing company. Founded in 1915 as Cannon (company) by James H. Cannon, the company developed {{some of the}} first equipment for sound films {{in the early years of}} the movie industry, including a synchronous motor drive to remotely operate a motion picture projector together with a phonograph. The first [...] "Cannon plug", the M-1 connector, was initially designed as a quick <b>grounding</b> <b>connection</b> for the electrical motor on a portable meat grinder and was adapted for movie sound equipment, enabling the new electrical camera to move freely about while “shooting” a scene. Cannon's M-1 connector was incorporated into the sound equipment used to make the first [...] "talking" [...] motion picture, The Jazz Singer. Cannon continued to develop connectors for the entertainment industry, including the “P” Series audio connectors developed for Paramount Studios, as well as connectors used in the first radio microphones, the first black-and-white television cameras, and the first color television equipment.|$|E

25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> G2 must be connected and also <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|R

40|$|When a {{converter}} {{is used to}} interface an ac distribution system and a low voltage (LV) dc micro-grid, several combined options for ac and for dc grounding can be used. According to the selected grounding scheme, zero-sequence dc or high frequency currents may flow in specific sections of the circuit. These, in turn, can cause EMC issues, unwanted protection trips and other problems. In the present article a dc micro-grid in which the neutral point of the MV/LV transformer is directly grounded and the dc micro-grid is floating (i. e., there is no <b>grounding</b> <b>connection)</b> is analysed. When a ground fault occurs, potentially harmful fault currents flow through the front-end converter, depending on the fault resistance and on the load conditions. The methodology proposed in this work protects the front-end converter while the task of feeding the dc-side loads is committed to storage systems. The calculation of the minimum fault resistance that the front-end converter can tolerate is provided {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed methodology is tested by means of numerical simulations...|$|E

40|$|For {{practical}} reasons, {{the chimney}} of a cyclotron's internal ion source often has RF grounds at only one end, despite {{the desire for}} an axially symmetric electric field throughout the cyclotron. It is generally impractical or impossible to measure {{the shape of the}} electric fields around the chimney, but one of the authors (H. Blosser of Michigan State University) has observed that in three cyclotrons of similar design built at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the machine with the least axial oscillation of the beam was the only one designed with median plane symmetry in its RF grounding. Based on this he suggests that RF currents in an asymmetrically grounded chimney give the beam an initial vertical kick which starts a coherent oscillation about the median plane. This hypothesis is being tested in the Ion Beam Applications C 235 proton therapy cyclotron which uses an internal hot-cathode PIG ion source that is normally grounded only at the bottom. The test uses an insert which can be temporarily installed in the upper yoke hole of the cyclotron in order to make an RF <b>grounding</b> <b>connection</b> {{to the top of the}} chimney. A scintillation probe is then used to study the axial beam position on successive turns with and without the symmetric RF grounding. Anglai...|$|E

This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The ground pin is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the safety <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> is made first when making a connection.|$|R
