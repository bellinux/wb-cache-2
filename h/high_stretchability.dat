Here we introduce a new family of sensors composed of a laser-engraved carbon nanotube paper embedded in an elastomer. A roll-to-roll pressing of these sensors activates a pre-defined fragmentation process, which results in a well-controlled, fragmented microstructure. Such sensors are reproducible and durable and can attain ultrahigh sensitivity and <b>high</b> <b>stretchability</b> (with a gauge factor of over 4. 2 × 10 (4) at 150 % strain).

40|$|Protein-based hydrogels {{usually do}} not exhibit <b>high</b> <b>stretchability</b> or toughness, {{significantly}} limiting the scope of their potential biomedical applications. Here we report the engineering of a chemically crosslinked, highly elastic and tough protein hydrogel using a mechanically extremely labile, de novo designed protein that assumes the classical ferredoxin-like fold structure. Due to the low mechanical stability of the ferredoxin-like fold structure, swelling of hydrogels causes a significant fraction of the fold structure domains to unfold. Subsequent collapse and aggregation of unfolded ferredoxin-like fold structure domains leads to intertwining of physically and chemically crosslinked networks, entailing hydrogels with unusual physical and mechanical properties: a negative swelling ratio, <b>high</b> <b>stretchability</b> and toughness. These hydrogels can withstand an average strain of 450 % before breaking and show massive energy dissipation. Upon relaxation, refolding of the ferredoxin-like fold structure domains enables the hydrogel to recover its massive hysteresis.

We show that the electrical and mechanical properties of the composite fibres were strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the filler and the interaction between the filler and the elastomer. The high aspect ratio SWCNT filler resulted in fibres with the highest electrical properties and reinforcement, while the fibres produced from the low aspect ratio CB had the <b>highest</b> <b>stretchability.</b> Furthermore, PU/SWCNT fibres presented the largest sensing range (up to 60 % applied strain) and the most consistent and stable cyclic sensing behaviour.

Strain can be utilised to control the band structures of materials and can even be utilised to induce a topological phase transition, driving the normal insulators to topological non-trivial materials with non-zero Chern number or Z 2 number. Here, we propose a new two-dimensional topological material with ultra-high mechanical stretchability - the ditch-like 2 D arsenic.

Although many respectable methods have been reported, it is still a challenge to fabricate stretchable conductors with a large elastic limit, high conductivity and excellent reliability in rapid, effective and economic ways. Herein, a facile method is offered to fabricate high-performance stretchable tubular conductors (TCs) based on a macro-confined structure of expanded graphite (EG) in rubber tubing by simply physical packing. The maximum original electrical conductivity of TC reached a high value of 160. 6 S/cm. Meanwhile, TCs showed more insensitive response of conductivity to increasing tensile strain compared to tubular conductors encapsulated with liquid metal or ionic liquid. The conductivity and effective stretchability of TCs can be adjusted by varying the packing density of EG. A low gauge factor below 3 was reached even under 400 % stretching for TC with a packing density of 1. 233 g/cm 3. The excellent resilience and good stability of conductivity of TC during dynamic stretching-releasing cycles are attributed to stable and rapid reconstruction of the percolation network of EG particles.

A silver nanoparticle precursor is absorbed in electrospun poly (styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (SBS) rubber fibres and then converted into silver nanoparticles directly in the fibre mat.

Here we explore self-organization of nanomaterials in solid-state for discovering fundamental understandings of mechanisms and dynamics for various engineering applications. An example of excellent stretchable conductors from self-organization of nanoparticles (NPs) was first demonstrated. Free-standing stretchable conductors were prepared using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly and vacuum-assisted flocculation (VAF). Different properties of LBL and VAF were understood from the perspective of structure and property relations. <b>High</b> conductivity and <b>stretchability</b> were observed from both composites, and the properties originated from dynamic self-organization of NPs. Modified percolation theory allowed incorporation of the self-organization and provided an excellent match with experimental data. Stretchable and conductive composites under voltage application provided an additional practical aspect of the composites, damping of vibrations. Another self-organization of NPs first demonstrated chiroptical nanocomposites for applications of photonic material devices and optoelectronics. They were also LBL assembled, from plasmonic NPs and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). A straightforward sample preparation method, conformal deposition of plasmonic materials on pre-twisted substrates, is a distinctive advantage when producing macroscale photonic materials. Chiroptical activities can be increased up to ten fold and were reversibly tunable. S-like 3 D nano-assemblies were responsible for the optical activities and this was confirmed by computational simulations. Universality of the method was confirmed by introducing polymeric fluorescence beads and SWNTs. Deposition of SWNTs expanded the wavelength regimes from UV to near-IR.

To suppress the dark current in the device channel, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were selected to serve as the trapping layer [58]. Recently, researchers designed a programmable memory device based on a vertically stacked MoS 2 /hBN/graphene heterostructure with graphene as the floating-gate [61] (Fig.  8 c) which has ultrahigh on/off ratio and a <b>high</b> <b>stretchability</b> (>[*] 19 %). With the dielectric layer of hBN having an appropriate thickness, the on/off ratio over 109 has been obtained. Figure  8 d shows the memory cycles realized by repeated voltage pulses as programming (1), reading (2), erasing (3), and reading (4) operations. Such functions can also be demonstrated in the hysteresis behavior in the Ids[*]−[*]Vds plot (Fig.  8 e) and are originated from the tunneling effect through hBN and the asymmetric potential drop caused by the highly resistivity of MoS 2.

40|$|Department of Materials Science and EngineeringWidespread energy harvesting, {{generating}} self-sufficient {{power from}} the surrounding environment, such as wind, solar and geothermal, have attracted increasing attention {{in the past decade}} due to the energy crisis and global warming. Among them, many technological devices converting mechanical energy into other forms of energy or vice versa have been proposed and investigated because of an extended life time, no recharging procedures, and their scalability. Generally, mechanical energy converted into electricity, namely, by using electromagnetic, electrostatic, and piezoelectric effects. Among many technologies, energy harvesting technologies based on the piezoelectric effect, named as piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG), have been extensively investigated because of an extended life time, no recharging procedures, and scalability. A <b>high</b> flexibility or <b>stretchability</b> is essential in generating high-power continuous electric output signals. The high flexibility can provide an opportunity applicable to a target object without any limitation of its shape and movement. Most recently, a new type of power generating device, named as triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on triboelectric effects coupled with electrostatic effects have been demonstrated as powerful means of harvesting mechanical energy from living environment. In traditional TENGs, the two materials were chosen according to the difference in surface potentials, e. g., the polymer material (i. e. Teflon) terminated with the most electronegative functional group as the negative side and the low work function material (i. e. Al metal) as the positive side, apart from each other (named as airgap). When the two materials are contacted, the polymer material at the negative side tends to gain electrons from Al metal, resulting in being negative compared with Al. Thus, a key approach to improve the electrical output performance of the TENGs from the materials aspect is to increase the triboelectric surface charge density through material modification and surface functionalization. In this study, we introduce highly-ordered embossed thin films with hollow hemispheres as one of promising structures for nanogenerators and pressure sensors, as well as extremely stable and directional anisotropic power generation in the composite-type piezoelectric nanogenerators without any treatment of electrical poling. For triboelectric nanogenerators, the material modifications such as the dielectric constant, the compressibility, and the surface potential in TENGs have focused. Additionally, the increased density of surface charges primary determined by the intrinsic properties of the specific materials and the effective means to enhance the output power of TENGs have proposed, which are critically important for improving the output performance of TENGs. ope...|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2015 WangFxxiii, 209 pages :color illustrationsWith more {{upcoming}} aging societies, {{the need}} for surgery robots in hospitals, {{and the demand for}} automated assembly lines, reliable and soft tactile sensing technologies have become imperative for human-machine interactions in robotics, biomedicine and health-care, etc. During the past decades, substantial effort has been made to create a touch-sensitive artificial skin. Such endeavors produced diverse tactile sensors with distinctive traits analogous to or even outperforming that of the human skin. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to produce a tactile sensor with sufficiently <b>high</b> sensitivity, <b>stretchability,</b> softness and three-axial force mapping capability, especially in the low pressure regime (< 10 kPa). This challenge is mostly due to the limited study on elastomeric conductive composites with sufficiently low time-dependency, an effective structural design, reliable and stretchable conductors compatible to elastomeric materials, and the processing techniques of relevant soft materials. To address these issues, a systematic research has been conducted in this thesis towards all-elastomer sensor technology for three-axial contact force measurement. Inspired by the skin of a toad, cell-structured pressure sensors were designed and fabricated by injecting corn oil between two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers and printing carbon/silicone strain gauges. When being evaluated on an electromechanically coupled testing device, the sensor demonstrated a high sensitivity of 0. 643 kPa- 1 in a low pressure regime (0. 1 - 7 kPa) with the lowest hysteresis around 7. 7 %, which is on a par with reported flexible pressure sensors. But unlike flexible sensors, this sensor was exceptionally soft since it was mainly composed of elastomeric materials and liquid. Critical issues examined include hysteresis, liquid/PDMS compatibility and elastic conductive tracks. Previous research on hysteresis has attributed to time-dependency of the carbon/silicone composite. However, this study revealed a geometrical effect, that is, the hysteresis is related to the printing thickness and aspect ratio, of which optimized values were 50 µm and 3. 2 : 1 respectively by using a central composite design method. Among the liquids considered, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 was more compatible with the PDMS used, achieving a shelf life of over 4 months. To address the problems on stretchable conductors, a new kind of printable, stretchable and conductive silver/silicone composite has been explored, of which the conduction development mechanism was experimentally investigated with consideration of heating temperature and time. The silver/silicone mixture was thermally sintered within 20 seconds, achieving a conductivity as high as 4000 S/cm. Such a fast fabrication method is comparable with photonic and microwave sintering of conductive inks thereby potentially enabling roll-to-roll industrial production. When serpentine structures were employed, the printed connectors selected by a comparative study demonstrated a fatigue resistance of over 10 000 cycles at 40 % maximum strain, which is among the best in reported printable connectors. Based on the above studies, a biomimetic all-elastomer sensor array for three-axial contact force measurement was fabricated by injecting PEG 400 between two PDMS layers with stencil printed carbon/silicone strain gauges and silver/silicone conductive interconnects. Being composed exclusively of elastomeric materials and liquid, the sensor array exhibited a stretchability and elastic modulus approaching those of a human skin, which marks substantial progress of tactile sensors in this regard. The sensor was tested on an electromechanically coupled setup with a pulley to redirect loading. A sensitivity of 0. 097 N⁻¹ to normal forces below 1. 62 N and an excellent sensitivity of 0. 337 N⁻¹ to shear forces below 1. 3 N (with a normal force at 0. 4 N) have been achieved, exceeding the best reported flexible 3 D force sensors, especially for small shear forces below 0. 5 N. Such a soft shear force sensor can be used in gait analysis, slippage detection and dexterous manipulation of robots, etc, where friction measurement is of utmost importance. A geometric model on deformation of the sensor under compression further confirmed the arrangement of strain gauges on sensors. Moreover, another design of soft pressure sensor (SPS) as proposed in the preliminary study was concretized for smart protective clothing against impact loadings. Both pressure measuring range and sensitivity of the SPS are tunable. Dynamic calibration and evaluation of the sensors were carried out by using a drop-tower impact method. The SPS demonstrated a large workable pressure range (0 - 8 MPa), a high sensitivity (100 % /MPa), an excellent repeatability (lowest non-repeatability ± 2. 4 % from 0. 8 to 8 MPa) as well as a good shelf stability (the lowest drift in 6 months was 2. 6 %), which is by far the best reported result for soft pressure sensors against impact loadings. Additional quasi-static compression tests revealed strain rate effect of the SPS. Numerical analysis based on Finite Element method illustrated that the cylinder height/diameter ratio of 0. 5 would be the best in terms of both electrical response and shear resistance. Smart clothing equipped with such SPS will provide spatial and temporal pressure distributions on a human body during contact sports, traffic accidents or occupational accidents, thereby greatly shortening the detection time of rescue, reducing injury and saving more lives.
