In a cohort of 69 patients with HCL entered in a protocol using IFN as the primary treatment, and followed thereafter for a median of 91 months (range, 0. 2 to 109 months), 13 patients (19 %) developed a second neoplasm. Six neoplasms were of hema-topoietic origin, whereas the remaining seven were adeno-carcinomas. The expected number of second tumors in this cohort is three (based on calculations from the National Can-cer Institute’s SEER data), so the <b>excess</b> <b>frequency</b> (ob-servedexpected) is 4. 33.

Models of terrestrial planet formation indicate that rocky planets are likely to achieve their final masses at around 10 - 30 Myr, and thus this cluster is at an interesting epoch for planet formation. We find 21 B-F 5 type stars and 14 F 6 -K 9 type stars which have 24 um excess emission, and thus determine that > 30 % of B-F 5 type stars and > 23 % of F 6 -K 9 type stars in this cluster have 24 um excess emission.

The quality of studies was graded and eligible trials were evaluated in the meta-analysis. Results: Nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone.
