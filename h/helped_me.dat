25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E
25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> survive my years as a POW.|$|E

25|$|My illness <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to {{see that}} what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes.

But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

That really impressed me as a kid, and it has <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> as an actor. [...] The way that I view the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing.
