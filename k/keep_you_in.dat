500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music". Analyzing the song, the BBC's Fraser McAlpine {{questioned}} why [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{leaves a}} [...] "positive impression" [...] on the listener despite its arrogant, domineering tone. Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss {{at the heart}} of this song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There is simply too much pressure being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five. James Dolan gave the song two-and-a-half stars out of five in Rolling Stone, writing that [...] "the trance beat won't <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the club unless someone else is paying for the drinks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become of that little girl...

5000|$|Asked why {{he creates}} {{cartoons}} and puzzles, two apparently {{different kinds of}} work, Leighton replied: [...] "I think a puzzle is like a cartoon, like a joke, because the puzzle is the setup and the solution is the punch line.
