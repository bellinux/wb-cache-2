5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault <b>Fluence</b> Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{majority}} of port-wine stain (PWS) patients {{treated with the}} pulsed dye laser (PDL) do not achieve complete blanching. Safe administration of higher <b>fluences</b> has been proposed {{as a means of}} improving treatment efficacy. OBJECTIVE. To determine the safety and efficacy of PWS treatment with the 1. 5 -msec PDL at high <b>fluences</b> in conjunction with cryogen spray cooling. METHODS. Twenty PWS patients were treated with the PDL in combination with cryogen spray cooling utilizing a 7 or 10 mm spot size and <b>fluences</b> ranging from 6 to 15 J/cm 2. Before and after treatment photographs were compared on a blinded basis. RESULTS. No scarring or skin textural changes occurred. Blanching scores were as follows: 20 % of patients achieved 75 % or greater blanching after an average of 3. 3 treatments, 30 % achieved 50 - 74 % blanching, 20 % achieved 25 - 49 % blanching, and 30 % achieved less than 25 % blanching. CONCLUSION. In conjunction with cryogen spray cooling, the PDL can be safely used at high <b>fluences.</b> At this time {{it is not clear that}} the use of higher <b>fluences</b> improves treatment efficacy; however, as other aspects of PWS laser treatment are optimized, safe administration of higher <b>fluences</b> is likely to be advantageous...|$|R

5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater <b>fluence</b> of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E

This last new material was developed by covalently bonding pyrene molecules to PMMA side-chains.
