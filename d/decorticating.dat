2500|$|In ancient China, {{the trip}} hammer evolved {{out of the}} use of the mortar and pestle, which in turn gave rise to the treadle-operated tilt-hammer (Chinese: 碓 Pinyin: dui; Wade-Giles: tui). The latter was a simple device {{employing}} a lever and fulcrum (operated by pressure applied by the weight of one's foot to one end), which featured a series of catches or lugs on the main revolving shaft as well. This device enabled the labor of pounding, often in the <b>decorticating</b> and polishing of grain, and avoided manual use of pounding with hand and arm. Although historians assert that its origins may span {{as far back as the}} Zhou Dynasty (1050 BC–221 BC), the earliest texts to describe the device are the Jijiupian dictionary of 40 BC, Yang Xiong's text known as the Fangyan of 15 BC, as well as the Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about 20 AD (during the usurpation of Wang Mang). The latter book states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar (which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device).

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{evaluate the}} role of the neocortex in rodent spatial learning. In Experiment 1, perinatally <b>decorticated</b> rats and sham-operated controls began ten training sessions at day 200 on an 8 -arm radial maze. <b>Decorticated</b> rats made more errors than controls, but showed improvement by the tenth session. In the second experiment, training was extended to determine whether <b>decorticates</b> could eventually match control performance levels if given sufficient training. Spontaneous activity levels were also recorded and compared to maze performance to investigate the relationship between poor performance on the radial maze and activity. More than half of the <b>decorticates</b> reached criterion performance. <b>Decorticates</b> had significantly elevated spontaneous activity levels when compared to controls, and the magnitude of this hyperactivity was related to performance deficits on the radial maze. These results suggest that with extended training <b>decorticates</b> can learn a spatial task. Performance deficits may reflect the hyperactive tendency of <b>decorticates</b> rather than a specific impairment of spatial learning abilities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Decorticate</b> {{rigidity}} {{is a type}} {{of abnormal}} posturing that can make it difficult to move a patient and to change the patient’s position to prevent a decubitus ulcer. This condition poses a latent risk of bed sores. To prevent those complications, we used electroacupuncutre for <b>decorticate</b> rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. A 51 -year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in <b>decorticate</b> rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his <b>decorticate</b> rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale and passive ROM of the elbow joints also improved. We report the observed effects of electroacupuncture for <b>decorticate</b> rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage.

The author made studies on its effects on leukocyte count and body temperature in <b>decorticated</b> animals. The results are summarized as follows : (1) The administration of chlorpromazine to normal animals resulted in a decrease in leukocyte count and a fall in body temperature. This action of chlorpromazine was potentized when phenobarbital was administered in combination with chlorpromazine. (2) The state of violent sham rage was induced,in. rabbits in a few hours following decortication, with the result that the <b>decorticated</b> rabbits could not survive long. The administration of chlorpromazine relieved this state. (3) Leukocyte count and body temperature of rabbits have remained normal even after they were <b>decorticated.</b> (4) Studies have been performed on <b>decorticated</b> cats {{over a long period of}} time. The state of sham rage was induced by the administration of physiologic saline 3 to 7 hours after decortication. An increase in leukocyte count occurred simultaneously.

40|$|The {{south-western}} subspecies of the Crested Shrike-tit (Falcunculus frontatus leucogaster) is uncommon {{and declining}} in abundance. Moreover, populations fail {{to persist in}} even large remnants of native vegetation within agricultural areas. Reasons for the scarcity of Shrike-tits in south-western Australia, their decline, and their failure to survive in fragmented habitats are unclear, but are possibly related to the scarcity of persistent <b>decorticating</b> bark on south-western Australian eucalypts relative to eucalypts in habitats where the species is abundant in eastern Australia. At two widely separated areas of eucalypt forest and woodland in eastern Australia, where Shrike-tits have been studied and appear relatively abundant, they take most of their prey from bark, particularly loose and <b>decorticating</b> bark. By contrast, in woodlands of south-western Australia, most prey appears to be obtained by foliage gleaning. I suggest that bark substrates provide a richer food resource for Shrike-tits than foliage, and that Shrike-tits in south-western Australia must forage over much larger areas to obtain adequate food than {{those that have been}} studied in the east. Other studies have shown that canopy arthropods are less abundant on eucalypts in south-western than in eastern Australia. Thus, as a result of both differences in foraging substrate availability and lower arthropod abundances, Shrike-tit population densities are lower in south-western Australia than much of eastern Australia. Low population densities and the need for large home-ranges typify organisms sensitive to habitat fragmentation. It is therefore hypothesised that both low numbers and a failure to persist in habitat fragments by Shrike-tits in south-western Australia are a consequence of the limited abundance of suitable bark substrates for foraging, a reliance on foliage gleaning, and lower arthropod abundances. Conservation of this species in south-western Australia therefore requires protection of large contiguous areas of eucalypt woodlands and forests...|$|E

This machine consists of 3 phase ac motor which is directly coupled to driven shaft.
