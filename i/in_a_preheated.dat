40|$|International audienceThe {{current work}} {{focuses on the}} large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) of combustion instability <b>in</b> <b>a</b> laboratory-scale swirl burner. Air and fuel are injected at ambient conditions. Heat conduction from the combustion chamber to the plenums results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>preheating</b> {{of the air and}} fuel flows above ambient conditions. The paper compares two computations: In the first computation, the temperature of the injected reactants is 300 K (equivalent to the experiment) and the combustor walls are treated as adiabatic. The frequency of the unstable mode (635 Hz) deviates significantly from the measured frequency (750 Hz). In the second computation, the preheating effect observed in the experiment and the heat losses at the combustion chamber walls are taken into account. The frequency (725 Hz) of the unstable mode agrees well with the experiment. These results illustrate the impor- tance of accounting for heat transfer/losses when applying LES for the prediction of com- bustion instabilities. Uncertainties caused by unsuitable modeling strategies when using computational fluid dynamics for the prediction of combustion instabilities can lead to an improper design of passive control methods (such as Helmholtz resonators) as these are often only effective <b>in</b> <b>a</b> limited frequency range...|$|R

40|$|Abridged) We {{revisit the}} scaling {{relationships}} between the dark matter mass and observed X-ray luminosity and temperature of galaxy clusters and groups in the local Universe. Specifically, we compare recent observations with analytic models of the intracluster medium in which the gas entropy distribution has been shifted by a variable amount, K 0, to investigate {{the origin of the}} scatter in these scaling relations, and its influence on the luminosity and temperature functions. We find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch (which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) are insufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation. Instead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately 50 keV sq. cm to 700 keV sq. cm, is required to match the data. This range is likely related to the variance in heating and/or cooling efficiency from halo to halo. We demonstrate that these models are consistent with the observed temperature and luminosity functions of clusters, if scatter in the mass-luminosity relation is accounted for. Finally, we present predictions for the redshift evolution of these scaling relations and luminosity/temperature functions. Comparison with recent data at z< 0. 7 shows reasonable agreement with a model that assumes a median entropy floor of K 0 = 200 keV sq. cm. When observations are extended to group scales (kT < 1 keV), this evolution will have the potential to discriminate between an entropy floor that is independent of redshift (for example, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>preheating</b> scenario) and one that depends on the cooling time of the halo.
