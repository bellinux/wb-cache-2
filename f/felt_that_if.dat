5|$|The {{episode was}} written {{as a way}} to signal Mulder's exit from the FBI. The {{producers}} and writers <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> Mulder's character was given a clean exit, the show could more easily focus on the characters of John Doggett and Monica Reyes in the following season. Former series star and recurring actor David Duchovny later declared that he had been happy to see his character depart in this manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has also}} {{been referred to as}} Nevesta ("The Bride"), Kite mladu ("The Bride is Being Decorated") and Oprema mlade ("Bridal Trousseau"). The artist did not assign titles to his works, as he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a painting was well composed viewers would be able to deduce the title themselves. As such, the majority of his paintings are referred to by a number of different titles.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not {{disagree with the}} party's position but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would {{get a chance to}} make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral issues about the {{national}} flag. Conservatives <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they might {{have a chance to}} propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the Hinomaru {{on the day of the}} Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff without reservations brought success to the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović did not assign titles to his works, as he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a {{painting}} was well composed viewers {{would be able}} to deduce the title themselves. Thus, the majority of the artist's works are referred to by a number of different titles. The Wounded Montenegrin also appears under the titles The Wounded Herzegovinian (Ranjeni Hercegovac), The Wounded Bosnian (Ranjeni Bosanac), Sad Encounter (Žalosni susret), Sad Farewell (Žalosni rastanak) and Unsuccessful Banditry (Neuspelo razbojništvo).|$|E
5|$|To {{reassure the}} Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague {{recommended that the}} plan be redesigned primarily {{as a means of}} deterrence. Hague <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
60|$|This was the turning-point in his illness. He {{began to}} mend a little, but so slowly, that he almost lost heart once or twice; and <b>felt</b> {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he did not}} make {{an attempt to get}} out of the unhealthy region, he should never regain strength.|$|R
60|$|Rollo wished {{very much}} that these {{visitors}} would leave him alone. He made very little reply to them, only saying {{that he did not}} wish for any dinner. In fact, he <b>felt</b> sure <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> he were to go to the table, he could not eat any thing.|$|R
60|$|The {{noise of}} the combat sounded almost {{deafening}} to Teddy, who was {{doing his best to}} listen for any unusual disturbance among the foliage outside, and he <b>felt</b> confident <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the enemy was anywhere in the vicinity the secret of their hiding place would soon be discovered.|$|R
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E
5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> their animations were motion captured, enemies would look like a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E

60|$|Archie stole softly {{from the}} table. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his presence, <b>if</b> {{it had ever}} been {{required}}, was required no longer. Looking back, {{he could see his}} father-in-law patting Mr. Connolly affectionately on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She {{could see}} <b>that</b> now. She <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{she told him}} she did not wish ever to see him again he would never appear before her. But what would he do? She was not in the least afraid of him, but his fierce earnestness frightened her, not for herself, but for him. Suddenly a thought struck her.|$|R
5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} alone a subtle change {{in his face and}} manner {{convinced}} her that he also had been taking notes, and had arrived at a favorable decision regarding herself. Women are quick at making such discoveries; and, even while she talked with him as a stranger, she <b>felt</b> assured <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> she chose, she might make him again her lover.|$|R

50|$|A {{fundamental}} {{mission of}} the city was to build infrastructure that would be for the long term and available to all residents. The incumbent regulated carriers had communicated to the city that the Provo market was low on priority lists for receiving a fiber network. The city <b>felt</b> confident <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a municipally owned network was not built {{that it would be a}} number of years before fiber technology would be available to Provo.|$|R
5|$|Nomura {{placed a}} secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts {{in hopes that}} fans would want a sequel. He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they did not, {{then it would be}} best to leave certain events in the first game unexplained. After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed, {{development}} for Kingdom Hearts II began. There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more; Mickey's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed. Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system.|$|E
5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest}} of his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever think this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E

60|$|Everybody said {{he never}} would get married; that it was absurd to suppose he ever would {{remember}} the day, the church, and the girl, all in one morning; <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did get {{as far as the}} altar he would forget what he had come for, and would give the bride away to his own best man. Hallyard had an idea that he was already married, but that the fact had slipped his memory. I myself <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he did marry he would forget all about it the next day.|$|R
25|$|The church <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{the king}} and the Tutsi ruling class of Rwanda were converted, {{the rest of the}} {{population}} would automatically accept the Catholic faith, so they focused their effort on the Tutsis.|$|E
25|$|However, in the {{following}} years of Smith's rule, the sanctions against the country meant that obtaining the rights to perform became increasingly difficult.

25|$|Schneerson's {{supporters}} {{have claimed that}} many Jews <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there was indeed a person worthy of such stature, it was Schneerson. Although Schneerson constantly objected to any talk {{that he could be}} the Messiah, this notion sparked controversy, particularly among those who were unfamiliar with these traditional teachings.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the boys}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the matter, <b>if</b> brought before an English court of justice, {{might not be}} favorably considered, their sympathies were so {{thoroughly}} with the count, {{that they did not}} hesitate to say that they thought he could not have acted otherwise than he had done, and that the life of the traitor was most justly forfeited.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, {{another part}} of the Big Ten's {{rationale}} for its latest round of expansion was revealed by Barry Alvarez, athletic director of conference charter member Wisconsin. As reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Alvarez told the school's athletics board,Jim Delany <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> someday, <b>if</b> we didn’t have anyone else in that corridor Northeast Corridor, someday it wouldn’t make sense maybe for Penn State to be in our league. That they would go into a league somewhere on the east coast. By doing that Maryland and Rutgers, it keeps us in the northeast corridor.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} she walked round the house as though looking at it {{critically}} for some after-purpose. After the wreck Stephen had suggested to Trinity House {{that there should be}} a lighthouse on the point; and offered to bear the expense of building it. She was awaiting the answer of the Brethren; and of course nothing would be done in clearing the ground for any purpose till the answer had come. She <b>felt</b> now <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> reply was negative, she would herself build there a pleasure-house of her own.|$|R
