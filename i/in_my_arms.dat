I was three stories up, walking along {{scaffolding}} with a bucket of clip-ties <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> when I happened to step on a plank that went only halfway between two platforms. I woke up a few moments later, sixty feet below, lying on the concrete floor. I had landed on the bucket, which cracked three ribs, but that and the hard hat I was wearing saved my life.|$|E

No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Deathcore {{also began}} to gain {{moderate}} popularity in the late 2000s (specifically 2006 and 2007). Notable bands that brought the genre in the highlight include Bring Me the Horizon and Suicide Silence. Suicide Silence's No Time to Bleed peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, number 12 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 6 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart, while their album The Black Crown peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200, number 7 on the Rock Albums Chart and number 3 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart. After its release, Whitechapel's album This Is Exile sold 5,900 in copies, which made it enter the Billboard 200 chart at position 118. Their self-titled album peaked at number 65 on the Canadian Albums Chart and also at number 47 on the Billboard 200. Their third album A New Era of Corruption sold about 10,600 copies in the United States in its first week of being released and peaked at position number 43 on the Billboard 200 chart. Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon won the 2006 Kerrang! Awards for Best British Newcomer after they released their 2006 debut record Count Your Blessings. However, Bring Me the Horizon abandoned the deathcore genre {{after the release of}} this album. San Diego natives Carnifex, witnessed success with their first album Dead <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> selling 5,000 copies with little publicity. On top of their non-stop touring and methodical songwriting resulted in Carnifex quickly getting signed to label Victory Records. Lastly, Australian deathcore band Thy Art Is Murder debuted at number 35 on the ARIA Charts with their album Hate (2012) making them the first metal band to ever reach the Top 40 of this chart.|$|E

In the interview, Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and: [...] "they slept <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> every single night since birth. I never touched them." [...] On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details. The document, titled Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed, was eventually released by the FBI. It is about stopping schizophrenics from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.|$|E
500|$|Prince Carol {{sparked a}} dynastic crisis when he officially renounced his rights to succeed Ferdinand on 5 January 1926, {{simultaneously}} waiving all parental rights over Prince Michael, {{who had been}} proclaimed heir apparent. A Provisional Regency Bill was passed, creating a regency council composed of Prince Nicholas; the Orthodox Patriarch, Miron Cristea; and Gheorghe Buzdugan, {{the president of the}} Court of Cassation. However, both Marie and Ferdinand were reluctant to leave the country {{in the hands of a}} five-year-old boy, even overseen by a regency, for fear that the lands gained during World War I would be reclaimed by neighbouring countries and that political disturbances might lead to civil unrest. Nevertheless, when Marie returned from America, Ferdinand's death seemed imminent. He was suffering from intestinal cancer, and by April 1927 had come so close to death as to be given the last rites of the Catholic Church. He died on 20 July, in Marie's arms. She later wrote: [...] "'I am so tired' were his last words and when he lay so quiet <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> one hour later, I knew that I must thank God for him at least. This was rest indeed." ...|$|E

The most specific such sources mentions that his life ended at a penal facility located in Bucharest's Ghencea district. Scientist Claudiu Mătasă, who shared his cell there, recalled: [...] "His stomach ill, [...] basically died <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> with me taking as much care of him as circumstances would allow..." [...] Barbu Cioculescu gives a more complex account: [...] "In very old age [...] was arrested, not for being a right-wing man, as he had not in fact been one, but for having served as a city councilor. A spinal cancer sufferer, he died in detention [...] not long after having been sentenced". According to historian of journalism Marin Petcu, Batzaria's confinement was effectively a political assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Gayle {{released}} {{two more}} studio albums during the 1990s: Ain't Gonna Worry (1990) produced by Allen Reynolds and Three Good Reasons (1992). Both albums failed to chart and their singles all failed to reestablish Gayle at country radio, which {{by this point}} had abandoned older artists of all kinds. Gayle subsequently recorded several specialty projects. She released two gospel albums – Someday (1995) and He Is Beautiful (1997). In 1999, she released the tribute album, Crystal Gayle Sings the Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael. [...] Gayle released a children's album, <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> in 2000.

2500|$|Chesney's second major-label album Me and You was {{released}} in 1996.

Me and You was Chesney's first gold-certified album. A cover of Mac McAnally's 1990 single [...] "Back Where I Come From" [...] was also included on this album. Though Chesney's version was never released as a single, {{it has become a}} song regularly played during his concerts. In recognition of his successful year, Chesney was honored with the 1997 Academy of Country Music's New Male Vocalist of the Year award.|$|E

[...] "I have formed a high opinion of her," [...] Queen Victoria reported, impressed with [...] "her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper – her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind – so entirely free from everything fast – and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion. Everyone must like her." [...] The queen also noted that Marie was [...] "not a bit afraid of Affie and I hope will have the very best influence upon him." ...|$|E

It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside.
