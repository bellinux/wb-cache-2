25|$|E: As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> that night, I overheard {{the three}} doctors {{tell my parents}} {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Gaga {{released}} {{a preview of}} [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] prior to her performance of September 1, 2013 at the iTunes Festival in London. In the video, she sings [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> I touch myself and I think of you". The video then shows Gaga rehearsing for the festival and displays in pink font, [...] "We wanna give you #sexdreams'". Gaga also promoted the song on social media by posting song lyrics ("Last night damn, you were in my #SexDreams doing really nasty things"), and encouraging use of a hashtag containing lyrics (#whenilayinbeditouchmyselfandthinkofyou).|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried to find somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E

6000|$|I too lived--Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine; I too {{walked the}} streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the waters [...] around it; I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me; In the day, among crowds of people, {{sometimes}} they came upon me, In my walks home late at night, or as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> my <b>bed,</b> they came upon me.|$|R

60|$|It was odd {{to wake up}} {{and realize}} that I was in London. Years seemed to have passed since I had left it.

6000|$|At length the eventful Thursday came, {{and about}} midday--for <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> late {{that morning and}} did not shoot--I drove, or, rather, was driven, in a Cape cart with two horses to the place known as Groote Kloof or Great Gully.

6000|$|Dear Reynolds! as {{last night}} <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> [...] There came {{before my eyes}} that wonted thread [...] Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances, [...] That every other minute vex and please: [...] Things all disjointed come from north and south,-- [...] Two Witch's eyes above a Cherub's mouth, [...] Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon, [...] And Alexander with his nightcap on; [...] Old Socrates a-tying his cravat, [...] And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat; [...] And Junius Brutus, pretty well so so, [...] Making the best of's way towards Soho.|$|E
60|$|But {{through all}} the {{confusion}} and lowness of spirits in which we had been, so unexpectedly to me, involved, I plainly discerned that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber and their family were going away from London, and that a parting between us was near at hand.

60|$|CHRIST. Why, I {{will tell}} you.

60|$|It {{was very}} interesting, {{but still a}} little cheerless, and when <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> that night I thought of Nettie and the queer {{modifications}} of preference she had made, and among other things and in a way, I prayed. I prayed that night, let me confess it, to an image I had set up in my heart, an image that still serves with me as a symbol for things inconceivable, to a Master Artificer, the unseen captain of all who go about {{the building of the}} world, the making of mankind.|$|E
60|$|To-day I {{have been}} a mere wretch. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> till past eleven, {{thinking}} {{to get rid of}} the rheumatism; then I walked as far as Turnagain with much pain, and since that time I have just roasted myself like a potato by the fireside in my study, slumbering away my precious time, and unable to keep my eyes open or my mind intent on anything, if I would have given my life for it. I seemed to sleep tolerably, too, last night, but I suppose Nature had not her dues properly paid; neither has she for some time.|$|E
6000|$|For my own part, {{the moment}} I learned the {{wonderful}} stories and strange suppositions connected with my apartment, {{it became an}} imaginary realm to me.

The great figures in the tapestry, also, were almost animated by the workings of my imagination, and the Vandyke portraits of the cavalier and lady that looked down with pale aspects from the wall, had almost a spectral effect, from their immovable gaze and silent companionship-- ...|$|E

60|$|The rest of {{that night}} <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> awake <b>in</b> my <b>bed,</b> the scene <b>in</b> the {{verandah}} by the big blue-gum-trees haunting me all the time, much as in earlier days the Picture of the murder had pursued and haunted me.

I am a humbug; I do not know Gaelic, but I mean to work away at my drama for all that. This kind of shock against the realities of life sobers a fellow.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> {{for a day}} or two, {{during which}} time I was dimly aware of much commotion going on here and there in the house; and the doctor came night and morning, and tended me carefully. I suppose I may call him the doctor now, though at the time I didn't call him so--I knew him merely as a visible figure. I don't believe I THOUGHT at all during those {{earliest}} days, or gave things names in any known language. They rather passed before me dreamily in long procession, like a vague panorama. When people spoke to me, it was like the sound of a foreign tongue. I attached no more importance to anything they said than to the cawing of the rooks in the trees by the rectory.|$|E
60|$|Tuesday.--The sun {{is shining}} to-day, {{which is a great}} matter, and {{altogether}} the gale having blown off again, I live in a precarious lull. On the whole I am not displeased with last night; I kept my eyes open through it all, and, I think, not only avoided saying anything that could make matters worse in the future, but said something that may do good. But a little better or a little worse is a trifle. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> this morning awake, for I was tired and cold and in no special hurry to rise, and heard my father go out for the papers; and then I lay and wished--O, if he would only whistle when he comes in again! But of course he did not. I have stopped that pipe.|$|E
6000|$|That night I {{never thought}} to sleep; but a slumber fell on {{me as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>I</b> was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: <b>I</b> dreamt <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind {{impressed}} with strange fears. The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart-- ...|$|R
