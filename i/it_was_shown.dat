40|$|AbstractTight {{connections}} between leaf languages and strings compressed by straight-line programs (SLPs) <b>are</b> established. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that the compressed membership {{problem for a}} language L is complete for the leaf language class defined by L via logspace machines. A more difficult variant of the compressed membership problem for L <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> to <b>be</b> complete for the leaf language class defined by L via polynomial time machines. As a corollary, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that there exists a fixed linear visibly pushdown language for which the compressed membership problem is PSPACE-complete. For XML languages, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that the compressed membership problem <b>is</b> coNP-complete.

5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse spider. In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> that host Adam Savage survived a bite from the spider.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with most of his works, Etty did not give the {{painting}} a title. It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The Bevy of Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> at the International Exhibition, it had acquired its present title.|$|E
5|$|At Westhay Moor in {{the early}} 19thcentury, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> how peat bogs could be {{successfully}} drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding, creating a very rich soil. The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of King's Sedgemoor Drain.|$|E
40|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that {{a linear}} second-order system with {{arbitrary}} damping cannot {{be reduced to}} Hessenberg-triangular form by means of orthogonal transformations. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also <b>shown</b> that such an orthogonal reduction is always possible for the modal damping commonly assumed for models of flexible structures. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that modally damped models can be orthogonally reduced to a new triangular second-order Schur form...|$|R

5|$|Bowers {{does not}} cite any trade {{publication}} reviews for this film, making {{it unlikely that}} the film was given attention in The New York Dramatic Mirror, The Moving Picture World or The Moving Picture News publications. The film was apparently a success at the Province Theater when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> in Vancouver. It is possible that non-advertisement reviews of the film may exist in other publications.|$|E
5|$|Bringing up Baby was a {{commercial}} flop upon its release, although it eventually {{made a small}} profit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film's premiere, Hepburn was infamously labeled box-office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America and would not regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later. The film's reputation began to grow during the 1950s, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> on television.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, {{he did not}} do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.|$|E
40|$|The many {{connections}} between the methods of Computational Logic and Integer Programming (IP) <b>are</b> surveyed. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> how computational problems arising in formal logic can be solved by IP. Also <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> how the methods of logic are applicable both to modelling and solving IP models. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> how Fourier-Motzkin elimination for Linear Programming, when specialised to 0 – 1 IP models {{gives rise to the}} logic method of Resolution. Finally conventional IP methods are applied to solving logical inference problems...|$|R
40|$|Markov random {{processes}} and general random processes <b>are</b> considered. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that continuous-time, continuous-valued, wide-sense stationary, Markov random processes that have absolutely continuous second order distributions <b>are</b> not bandlimited. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>shown</b> that when these processes are strictly stationary and continuous almost surely, they cannot be recovered without error from their quantized versions. Further, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that continuous-time, discrete-valued Markov random processes, which are uniformly bounded and satisfy an additional condition, can be recovered with zero average distortion from an appropriate set of samples {{for a general}} distortion measure. A similar result <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> for general continuous-time random processes with rth power distortion measure. Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that under a milder condition on the Markov {{processes and}} a different condition on the sampling times (e. g., uniform sampling), such processes cannot be recovered with zero average distortion. Finally, the notion of information-singularity is extended to continuous-time random processes, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> that both continuous- and discrete-time Markov processes are not information-singular...|$|R
