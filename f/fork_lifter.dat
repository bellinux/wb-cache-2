5000|$|Philipp Schaer is {{the current}} CEO of MiGFlug. He Co-founded the company in 2004, along with another Student at University of Zurich. The company is {{headquartered}} in Zurich, Switzerland, and registered in the commercial register of Lucerne. MiGFlug’s main business is offering flights in military fighter jets for Civilians, including supersonic flights. It started with jet flights in Ramenskoye Airport, Russia. MiGFlug has been shown on Lonely Planet’s “Year of Adventures” with Ben Fogle, broadcast on BBC, and is regularly on Top of Bucket Lists. A number of notable passengers {{have been on a}} fighter jet offered by the company, including Anthony Bourdain, Zoltán Báthory, Joel Kinnaman, Josh Cartu, [...] "Evil" [...] Jared Hasselhoff, Jake Paul, Klaas Heufer-Umlauf, Joko Winterscheidt and Pauline Nordin. Several of MiGFlug's jets and pilots appeared in movies, in TV and in commercial productions. For example an L-39 appeared in 1997 James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies in the opening scene with 007 hijacking an L-39 Albatros and flying away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed. MiGFlug has produced several Galileo episodes for ProSieben, as well as a Zero Gravity flight for the Joko gegen Klaas show. Porsche, Mercedes-Benz Diesel, OnePlus and Swiss diary company Emmi AG produced advertisements or advertorials with MiGFlug.MiGFlug also runs the subsidiary GoAviator, a specialist for vintage flights, like historic Warbird and biplane flights.Since 2015, MiGFlug offers formation jet flights with passengers. Up to 6 passengers can fly {{at the same time in}} close formation in an L-39.MiGFlug also offers flights to customers in wheelchairs in certain locations. Customers in wheelchairs can climb in the L-39 jets with the help of a <b>fork</b> <b>lifter.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>fork</b> <b>lifter</b> chipper {{truck is}} a concept which has been {{developed}} for harvest and transport of bio fuel. The system consists of one <b>fork</b> <b>lifter</b> chipper truck and 1, 2 or 3 transport lorries, usually two, which serves the <b>fork</b> <b>lifter</b> chipper truck. The system {{is driven by the}} <b>fork</b> <b>lifter</b> chipper truck that produces chipped material into a container on the truck. When the container has been filled the truck drives to the landing site where it’s offloaded. From the landing site the containers are being transported to industry by <b>fork</b> <b>lifter</b> trucks. The aim of the study was: - To measure the productivity of the system during various conditions considering distance of transportation, the quality of the windrow, mix of tree species and weight of the loads - To identify parameters within the system that could be improved - To compare the system to a similar system, tractor chipper and a truck equipped with a dipper Within the final thesis a time study has been carried out which have made it possible to estimate the productivity of the system and the time consumption of each work element. These data have then been used to analyze the system to show differences in productivity depending on different conditions on the site and constellation of vehicles. During the time study 50 % of the container chipper truck’s work time was consumed by chipping, which means that the utilization of the chipper is relatively low. The utilization of the chipper could be increased by reducing the distance between the windrow and the landing site, because the workelement container switch consumed 18 % of the worktime. Data were collected from SDC and Åkarewebben, which data showed that logging residues that have been extracted during summer and with a high share of pine had low moisture content when measured at industry. At the same time it was discovered that a dryer material took longer to chip because it was harder. During the time study of the system it was discovered that with a transport distance of 85 km one way, there were no waiting time when using one transport lorry. For two transport vehicles the optimal transport distance was 165 km one way. This means that at 85 km transport distance one transport vehicle should be used and at 165 km should two transport vehicles be used...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} for optical vehicle positioning (e. g. <b>fork</b> <b>lifters).</b> Our approach {{is motivated by}} planar marker detection systems like ARTag or ARToolkit, in which poses of planarmarkers relative to the camera can be determined. In contrast to existing optical positioning systems(e. g. SkyTrax), we mount cameras on the ceiling and passive (non-electronic) planar markers {{on the top of}} the vehicles. The absence of complexelectronic components on the high stressed vehicles enables rapid process integration, which is particularly important for rental vehicles. We have evaluated our method keeping the most important user requirements coverage, costs and accuracy under consideration for three intra-logistic scenarios a) zone monitoring with zone precise positioning, b) storage aisle monitoring with storage place precise positioning and, c) complete driving range monitoring with maximum precision...|$|R
40|$|Telescopic {{systems of}} {{structural}} members with clearance {{are found in}} many applications, e. g., mobile cranes, rack feeders, <b>fork</b> <b>lifters,</b> stacker cranes (see Figure 1). Operating these machines, undesirable vibrations may reduce the performance and increase safety problems. Therefore, this contribution has the aim to reduce these harmful vibrations. For a better understanding, the dynamic behaviour of these constructions is analysed. The main interest is the overlapping area of each two sections of the above described systems (see markings in Figure 1) which is investigated by measurements and by computations. A test rig is constructed to determine the dynamic behaviour by measuring fundamental vibrations and higher frequent oscillations, damping coefficients, special appearances and more. For an appropriate physical model, the governing boundary value problem is derived by applying Hamilton’s principle and a classical discretisation procedure is used to generate a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as the corresponding truncated mathematical model. On {{the basis of this}} model, a controller concept for preventing harmful vibrations is developed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the area}} of model-based {{diagnosis}} has developed a number of prototypes with impressive features that promised economic impact and, hence, caught industrial interest, the number of actual industrial applications is still close to zero. One {{of the reasons is}} that the successful techniques have not yet been turned into tools that reflect and support the current diagnostic work processes and their existing tools. The INDIA project joined eight German partners (researchgroups, software suppliers, and end users) in an attempt to take a major step in the transfer of model-based diagnosis techniques into industrial applications. This paper describes part of the work carried out in this project. Rather than presenting the theoretical foundations of the techniques in depth, we focus on the aspect of how model-based diagnostic techniques can be related to established tools and systems in order to provide some leverage for today's work processes and to change them gradually, as opposed to postulating a radical change in current practice and organizational structures. From this perspective, we discuss the utilization of model-based techniques for the generation of fault trees for on-line testing and diagnosis of <b>fork</b> <b>lifters,</b> generation of test plans for an intelligent authoring system for car diagnosis manuals, and the exploitation of existing state-chart process descriptions for post-mortem diagnosis of processes in a dyeing plant...|$|R
