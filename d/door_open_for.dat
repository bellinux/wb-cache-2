In 2007, Seattle's racial tie-breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme Court, but the ruling left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> desegregation formulae based on other indicators (e.g., income or socioeconomic class).|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as {{the best chance to}} unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the role}} of Metrovías was lessened to simply {{operating}} the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri's mayoral administration and Metrovías became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. The relationship was further strained in 2013 when Metrovías' 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> a state-run or mixed operation. Among the public, privatisation has proved unpopular, with a survey carried out in 2015 indicating that 82% of passengers would like the Underground to be operated by the state instead of a private company.|$|E

25|$|After a {{disagreement}} between Chase and Smith {{in regard to}} differing levels of priority for the sequel project, Smith settled on adapting Fletch Won, which follows Fletch in his early years as newspaper junior reporter. Smith intended to follow the novel's plot and characters much more closely than earlier Fletch films had. Filming the prequel/origin story would have allowed Smith to make the movie without Chase while still leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> him to appear in a cameo role in framing scenes and/or as narrator. Around this time, Smith mentioned Jason Lee and Ben Affleck as possible choices to play Fletch.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to winning}} the city championship, Anacostia had played {{football}} on a barren field that {{was described by}} The Washington Post as [...] "rugged prairie known by players across the city as the 'dust bowl'". In 1996, Mayor of Washington, D.C., Marion Barry, helped the team acquire new topsoil and 500 rolls of Brute Bermuda sod worth about $60,000 ($ today). As a junior, June, who wore #1, rushed for 90 yards and scored two touchdowns in the DCIAA semi-final game. In the championship game, June fumbled on the 1-yard line in the fourth quarter, leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> Cardozo Senior High School to score a touchdown in the waning seconds to secure a victory.

As a sophomore, {{at the suggestion of}} his mother, Venable resumed baseball. He posted modest numbers in his first season, but in 2004, he hit for a [...]344batting average, earned All-Ivy honorable mention, and was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifteenth round of the draft (439th overall). Bradley felt that Major League Baseball scouts undervalued Venable because he did not participate in the Cape Cod League for college baseball players. Thus, instead of signing and giving up his amateur status, Venable returned for his senior season and posted a league leading 9home runs and runner-up [...]385 batting average while earning All-League honors. Subsequently, the Padres drafted him in the seventh round (215th overall); he was signed by the Padres' Northeast Scouting Director, Jim Bretz.|$|E
500|$|Ward Jackson {{continued}} to seek {{independence from the}} M and put forward a fresh proposal in 1859 to extend the line from Guisborough to the Tees at Cargo Fleet, so that the increasing demand for iron ore shipments to Tyneside could more easily be met. The S again opposed it. Although the House of Commons unanimously approved the Cleveland Extension Bill, it {{was rejected by the}} House of Lords. However, this left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> a private railway on the lands owned by Ward Jackson and his supporters. They began to construct it in 1860 {{under the auspices of the}} [...] "Upsall, Normanby and Ormesby Railway". Once again, the S opposed it, this time on the grounds that the new line had to cross the S's Redcar branch line, but it eventually gave permission for the construction of a bridge to cross its line.|$|E

The opening Six Man Tag Team match, the No Disqualification match, Bobby Roode versus Ron Killings, the NWA World Tag Team Championship match, and the main event all received a 7 out of 10 by Kapur in his review. Regarding the main event, Kapur said that [...] "Sting looked good, but {{it remains to be}} seen if his return will be a turning point for the company in the long run." [...] Kapur commented on the X Division Championship match stating it was a [...] "good match" [...] that [...] "reinforced Joe's dominance, and left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> another match with either Daniels or Styles."

500|$|In CSIs eighth season, when Fox {{decided to}} leave the show, both she and the writers decided not to kill the character, so as to leave the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> a {{possible}} comeback. Consequently, she becomes severely depressed after being abducted in the season seven finale (she is rescued in the first episode of the new season), and, even though she accepts Grissom's marriage proposal on the season's fourth episode, she shows signs of burnout during the subsequent episodes, breaking down on the season's seventh episode, leaving Las Vegas with only a goodbye letter for Grissom in which she tells him she loves him - also kissing him out of the blue in front of another colleague - [...] and a good luck note for Ronnie Lake (played by Jessica Lucas). In the letter she states that ever since her father's death she has been living with [...] "ghosts" [...] and that she now needs to go away and deal with them before self-destructing.|$|E
500|$|Goldwater mathematically {{secured the}} {{nomination}} after winning an additional 56 delegates at the Texas Republican Convention in Dallas on June 16. His {{address to the}} convention drew 11,000 people to the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, where he proclaimed that it was essential for Republicans {{to win in the}} south, after years of [...] "writing off" [...] the region. Although Goldwater had surpassed the number of delegates needed for the Republican nomination, only 361 were bound by state law, slightly leaving the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> a battle at the convention if his remaining 316 delegates chose to waver. Scranton hoped to change their minds and took control of a semi-revived Stop Goldwater movement, campaigning nationwide and labeling Goldwater as unqualified. While Scranton gained the support of Henry Cabot Lodge, who resigned his post in Vietnam to assist the campaign, Goldwater requested that Lodge give an update on the progress in Vietnam, but the former ambassador refused, saying that the war should not be a political issue. Goldwater took a further hit after voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, questioning its constitutionality. His vote was denounced by the NAACP, who publicly voiced their opposition to Goldwater, breaking their tradition of neutrality during presidential elections. But the vote helped Goldwater among southern Democrats. After returning from Washington, Goldwater briefly returned to Phoenix to attend his daughter's wedding, which received a great deal of media coverage. He then traveled to the midwest and the eastern seaboard to continue to build support for his candidacy. Polls from late June, showed that in a head to head match up, Republicans favored Scranton over Goldwater as Scranton escalated his attacks, labeling Goldwater's policy positions as [...] "ignorant" [...] with the convention just twelve days away.|$|E

500|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode [...] "was full of laughs {{but had a}} bit of a {{bittersweet}} aftertaste" [...] and had [...] "one hell of a cliffhanger" [...] ending. Rabin praised the Jim and Dwight teaming in the first episode, but said the plot line of Michael's lectures were predictable and [...] "promised more than it delivered". Rabin said the second episode [...] "wrapped up everything up nicely [...] delivered larfs aplenty"; he particularly enjoyed the subplot involving Angela's cats, {{and the fact that it}} [...] "left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> Holly's return". Will Leitch of New York magazine praised the cliffhanger ending of the first episode and said he was pleased the Holly character was still in the show's equation. Leitch also praised Ed Helms, who [...] "is nailing the right combination of ridiculous and sad-sack pathos", although he said he [...] " [...] nearly as inspired" [...] by the Jim and Dwight subplot. Leitch also enjoyed the second episode, particularly the [...] "legitimately sweet moment" [...] when Pam tells Michael that Holly still has feelings for him. Leitch was less praiseworthy of the Angela subplot involving her cats, and said the character [...] "appears to have officially gone batshit insane." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN criticized the first episode and said, [...] "I'm starting to wonder if the show is showing signs of winding down." [...] Fickett said the idea of Michael giving awkward lecture tours felt old and familiar, so much so that [...] "I was convinced it was a repeat". He also said the Jim and Dwight idea was funny, but [...] "nothing the show hasn't tapped before". Likewise, Fickett described the second episode as [...] "average Office and feels overly familiar without really blazing any new ground." [...] He also said it was disappointing Holly did not appear, and that Angela felt like a [...] "caricature" [...] in her subplot.|$|E
500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience {{wanted to know more}} about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
