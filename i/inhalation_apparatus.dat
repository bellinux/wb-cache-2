50|$|In {{light of}} the {{supposed}} curative properties of radioactivity, a spa was opened up in Joachimsthal, the place at which Madame Curie gathered some of her original samples of radium from spring waters. Radon inhalation rooms were set up, where air tubes carried the gas up from a processing tank in the basement; the visitor would then use it through an <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Baths were set up which were also irradiated, and irradiated air was also filtered through a trumpet-like pipe for inhalation.|$|E
40|$|Fall 2011 Respiratory {{illnesses}} {{caused by}} both viral and bacterial infection are serious issues for global healthcare providers. With {{the emergence of}} new, drug-resistant forms of these diseases, innovative drugs and treatment therapies are needed. M tuberculosis is an infection that affects {{a large portion of}} the world’s population each year. Aerosol inhalation therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment and possible prevention of diseases of the lung and nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have been shown to be therapeutically effective in the treatment of viral lung infections. This study set the pathway to develop an alternative inhalation therapy approach to treating M. tuberculosis using two nucleoside analog polymers 2 -fluoroadenosine and 2 -methyladenosine. In vitro experiments were designed to compare the permeability of the monomer and polymer form of 2 -fluoroadenosine and 2 -methyladenosine in Calu- 3 lung carcinoma cells as well as establish the basic pharmacokinetic properties of the pro-drugs using a surrogate marker, 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. An <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> was designed, constructed and validated through flow rate and particle size analysis. The data from the permeability experiments are still under analysis and have yet to be evaluated. Drug uptake experiments did not show an uptake of 5 -FdUMP into the cells in culture. The <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> was designed to theoretically provide efficient concentrations of inhaled pro-drug to the lung through eight directed-flow nose-only delivery cones. The flow rate of the <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> was analyzed through non-linear regression and demonstrated that the rate followed a predictable decrease as the number of open cones increased. The size of the water particles produced by the <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> was found to have an average size of 5 μm, which falls within the ideal range for inhalation therapy. A theoretical synthesis method for a 10 -subunit polymer of 2 -fluoroadenosine was proposed. The results of this study demonstrate that the <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> produces particles of appropriate size for inhalation therapy with predictable rates of administration for use in future in vivo testing models. The proposed synthesis scheme for a 10 -subunit polymer of 2 -fluoroadenosine is ready for evaluation and analysis. The results of this study thus far suggest that inhalation therapy using polymer forms of 2 -methyladenosine and 2 -fluoroadenosine may be a novel and efficient method for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

40|$|Reductions in {{testicular}} mass, sperm motility, and mating fre-quency {{have been}} attributed to the stresses caused by confinement of Sprague-Dawley male rats in nose-only inhalation exposure tubes. Testicular changes, including an increase in testicular atro-phy, have been detected at an increased incidence in male rats used in inhalation studies as compared with rats of the same age and strain used in oral toxicity studies. This study was designed to determine whether nose-only exposure of male rats caused testic-ular toxicity under conditions of cooling of the exposure room and appropriate acclimation to the exposure tubes. In order to accli-mate the rats to the nose-only <b>inhalation</b> exposure <b>apparatus,</b> all male rats were placed in the exposure tubes for at least four successively increasing time intervals (15, 30, 45, and 60 min) on 4 separate days, with a rest period of approximately 48 h {{between the first and second}} acclimation. Twenty male rats were expose...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} stop rising health care expenditures, 81 villagers and their health {{professionals}} were interviewed about their medical knowledge (aeteology, symptoms, treatment, illness length, necessity to consult a doctor, etc.) and health care practices concerning common respiratory illnesses. According to informants, sniffles, cough, flu, common cold, sore throat/tonsillitis, bronchitis and sinusitis {{are the most common}} respiratory illnesses. All of them are regarded to be caused by several mechanisms of getting cold and/or wet. Despite the general disbelief in the germ theory and the prevention of contagion among household members, informants have an extensive knowledge about effective treatments and consult health professionals when home-remedies fail or a doctor's excuse is needed. Due to the effectiveness of home-treatments and self-containment of most common respiratory infections, this study concludes that health insurance companies should restrict the reimbursement of prescriptions for Bagatellmedizin, <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> and home-remedies...|$|E
40|$|Microparticles {{containing}} large payloads of two anti-tuberculosis (TB) {{drugs were}} prepared and evaluated for suitability as a dry powder inhalation targeting alveolar macrophages. A solution containing 1 part each of isoniazid and rifabutin, plus 2 parts poly(lactic acid) (L-PLA) was spray-dried. Drug content and in vitro release were assayed by HPLC, and DSC {{was used to}} elucidate release behaviour. Particle size was measured by laser scattering and aerosol characteristics by cascade impaction using a Lovelace impactor. Microparticles were administered to mice using an in-house <b>inhalation</b> <b>apparatus</b> or by intra-tracheal instillation. Drugs in solution were administered orally and by intra-cardiac injection. Flow cytometry and HPLC were used to investigate the specificity and magnitude of targeting to macrophages. Microparticles having drug content ~ 50 % wt/wt, particle size ~ 5 μm and satisfactory aerosol characteristics (median mass aerodynamic diameter, MMAD = 3. 57 μm; geometric standard deviation, GSD= 1. 41 μm; fine particle fraction, FPF 60 %.
