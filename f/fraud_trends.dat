Computers, telecommunications systems, and international travel, now allow Australia to experience the same kinds of fraud as those which occur in other developed countries. This Trends and Issues paper considers one particular form of fraud which is endemic overseas, and which is likely to become a substantial problem for Australian law enforcement agencies in the years to come; namely, plastic card fraud, or crimes of deception committed through the use of credit cards, debit cards, and stored value cards.

40|$|Small {{business}} and entrepreneurship {{has emerged as}} an important area of research over the past 40 years. This paper revolves around {{the issues of the}} internal controls and fraud prevention measures on SMEs performance. The level of fraud incidence as reported by owners is still at a very low level and the overall cost incurred is still within expectation. However, there is a question of whether the low reported rate of fraud is due to adequate preventive actions currently employed by owners, or whether the owners are reluctant to reveal the truth in order to portray their efficiency and effectiveness in running their businesses. This conceptual paper attempts to analyze relevant literature on internal control, <b>fraud,</b> current <b>trends</b> on <b>fraud</b> and business crime prevention measure adopted by SMEs. Based on the literature, a future research could be suggested in the context of Malaysia. It is hoped that future research in this aspect will uncover the relationship between the effectiveness of internal control within SMEs and to gauge the adequacy of fraud prevention measure taken by owners of SMEs in Malaysia. It is expected that effective internal control and the presence of appropriate fraud preventive measures will help to improve SMEs performance...|$|R

The literature has many methods that try to find dense blocks in matrices, and, recently, tensors, but no method gives a principled way to score the suspiciouness of dense blocks with different numbers of modes and rank them to draw human attention accordingly. Dense blocks are worth inspecting, typically indicating <b>fraud,</b> emerging <b>trends,</b> or some other noteworthy deviation from the usual. Our main contribution is that we show how to unify these methods and how to give a principled answer to questions like the above. Specifically, (a) we give a list of axioms that any metric of suspicousness should satisfy; (b) we propose an intuitive, principled metric that satisfies the axioms, and is fast to compute; (c) we propose CROSSSPOT, an algorithm to spot dense regions, and sort them in importance (“suspiciousness”) order. Finally, we apply CROSSSPOT to real data, where it improves the F 1 score over previous techniques by 68 % and finds retweet-boosting in a real social dataset spanning 0. 3 billion posts. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Stream {{processing}} {{is a new}} {{and important}} computing paradigm. Innovative streaming applications are being developed in areas ranging from scientific applications (for example, environment monitoring), to business intelligence (for example, <b>fraud</b> detection and <b>trend</b> analysis), to financial markets (for example, algorithmic trading systems). In this paper we describe Streamsight, a new visualization tool built to examine, monitor and help understand the dynamic behavior of streaming applications. Streamsight can handle the complex, distributed and large-scale nature of stream processing applications by using hierarchical graphs, multi-perspective visualizations, and de-cluttering strategies. To address the dynamic and adaptive nature of these applications, Streamsight also provides real-time visualization {{as well as the}} capability to record and replay. All these features are used for debugging, for performance optimization, and for management of resources, including capacity planning. More than 100 developers, both inside and outside IBM, have been using Streamsight to help design and implement large-scale stream processing applications...|$|R
40|$|Analysts {{believe that}} fraud costs the nation {{considerably}} {{more than any other}} type of crime. It has serious consequences for all Australians, whether they be victims of fraud whose trust has been betrayed, or consumers who are required to shoulder the burden of business losses through increased costs of goods and services. It is surprising, therefore, that so {{little is known about the}} nature and extent of fraud. This may be due in part to fraud being seen as remote from the interests of average Australians, but also because it involves offences which are sophisticated in their planning and execution, under-reported and difficult to investigate. Although some forms of fraud appear to be waning, victimisation surveys have found that businesses continue to lose millions of dollars each year through fraud of various kinds. These losses are, in turn, passed on to consumers. This Trends and Issues reviews existing data on <b>fraud</b> <b>trends</b> in Australia and identifies ways of improving our level of understanding of the extent to which such crime occurs...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores what {{is likely}} to happen to the {{incidence}} of fraud {{in the context of the}} Global Financial Crisis (GFC), whether as a result of the crisis or of other factors that coincide with it. Normally, statistical data on crime and/or cost of crime trends is examined to enable determination of whether a problem is getting better or worse. However, despite measures being developed to improve fraud statistics in Australia, these cannot be applied retrospectively to past data (especially since the last serious recession was almost 2 decades ago and the last comparable global financial crisis was in the 1930 s); and fairly comprehensive Australian cost of fraud data are currently available only for one year and therefore cannot be used to show trends in the cost of fraud. Nonetheless, some useful insights can be gained from an examination of the GFC that could be used to predict <b>fraud</b> <b>trends</b> in the future and to determine how best to minimise risks of such opportunistic crime occurring in the years ahead...|$|E
40|$|This report {{argues that}} while email {{continues}} to be the most common method by which scams are delivered, the use of landline and mobile telephones, including SMS, to target potential scam victims, has increased. The Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce (ACFT) includes 22 government regulatory agencies and departments in Australia and New Zealand that work alongside private sector, community and non-government partners to prevent fraud. In order to understand the dynamics of consumer fraud victimisation, the ACFT has conducted a range of fraud prevention and awareness-raising activities since 2006. One key activity of the ACFT is to hold an annual consumer fraud survey to obtain a snapshot of the public’s exposure to consumer scams, to assess the range of ways scams can impact on victims and their families, to determine how victims respond to the experience and to identify any emerging typologies and issues. This report presents the results of surveys conducted in conjunction with the 2010 campaign, Online Offensive—Fighting Fraud Online, and the 2011 campaign, Scams: It’s Personal. Overall, in both surveys it was found that a high proportion of respondents had received a scam invitation, however the majority did not respond. Dating scams attracted the highest number of victims in 2010, whereas in 2011, lottery scams were the most common way in which respondents were victimised. Although the survey relies on self-reported information, it still provides a useful means of identifying the nature of victimisation and personal <b>fraud</b> <b>trends.</b> Those who perpetrate consumer scams use a wide range of deceptive practices and methods of communication. While email {{continues to be}} the most common method by which scams are delivered, the use of landline and mobile telephones, including SMS, to target potential scam victims, has continued to increase. This points to the need for ongoing education on the risks of scam victimisation for those who make use of mobile phones and SMS, particularly younger people...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the recent}} years, concept-evolution has {{received}} {{a lot of attention to}} the research community because of its importance in the context of mining data streams. Mining data stream has become a crucial task due to its wide range of applications such as network intrusion detection, credit card <b>fraud</b> identification, identifying <b>trends</b> in the social networks etc. Concept-evolution means introduction of novel class in the data stream. Many recent works address this phenomenon. In addition, a class may appear in the stream, disappears for a while and then reemerges. This scenario is known as recurring classes and also remained unaddressed in most of the cases. As a result, generally where a novel class detection system is present, any recurring class is falsely detected as novel class. This results in unnecessary waste of human and computational resources. In this paper, we have investigated the idea of a class-based ensemble of classification model addressing the issues of recurring and novel class in the presence of concept drift. Our approach has shown impressive performance compared to the state-of-art methods in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present an {{overview}} of <b>fraud,</b> including concepts, <b>trends,</b> and controls to in turn, develop an effective assurance work plan {{as well as a}} fraud-prevention proposal to a potential client. When KPMG collected data from 348 of their company fraud investigations in 2011, an average of 87 percent were male (3). Around thirty-two percent of fraudsters usually worked in a finance role which gave them access to assets and financial statements. According to Donald Cressy’s research, it takes all three elements to be considered fraud: a triangle of motivation, opportunity, and rationalization. However, in the 2004 CPA Journal, David T. Wolfe and Dana R. Hermanson discussed the addition of another element from their research to create a fraud diamond, which also includes the individual’s capacity. Compared to public companies, fraud occurs more frequently in privately owned companies. Nearly 40 percent of victim organizations in the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ 2012 study were privately owned while 28 percent were publicly traded. Furthermore, fraud {{is more likely to be}} detected by individuals in the internal or external audit setting or an anonymous tipline. These concepts are explained further in sections of the assurance engagement team plan and fraud-prevention proposal to a small business owner. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} data streams arising {{in a wide}} range of advanced applications such as <b>fraud</b> detection and <b>trend</b> learning has led to the study of online mining of frequent itemsets (FIs). Unlike mining static databases, mining data streams poses many new challenges. In addition to the one-scan nature, the unbounded memory requirement and the high data arrival rate of data streams, the combinatorial explosion of itemsets exacerbates the mining task. The high complexity of the FI mining problem hinders the application of the stream mining techniques. We recognize that a critical review of existing techniques is needed in order to design and develop efficient mining algorithms and data structures that are able to match the processing rate of the mining with the high arrival rate of data streams. Within a unifying set of notations and terminologies, we describe in this paper the efforts and main techniques for mining data streams and present a compre-hensive survey of a number of the state-of-the-art algorithms on mining frequent itemsets over data streams. We classify the stream-mining techniques into two categories based on the window model that they adopt in order to provide in-sights into how and why the techniques are useful. Then, we further analyze the algorithms according to whether they are exact or approximate and, for approxi-mate approaches, whether they are false-positive or false-negative. We also discuss various interesting issues, including the merits and limitations in existing research and substantive areas for future research. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} case study about employee fraud {{in a bank}} in Malaysia. As this bank is {{set up by the}} Government in 1965, the fraud has political implications. This thesis discusses the internal structure of the organization as well as the political and social climate conducive to fraud and corruption in Malaysia. Two other major financial fraud cases in Malaysia will be discussed as comparative case studies. <b>Fraud</b> and corruption <b>trends</b> in other countries will also be discussed to illustrate that the Malaysian case is not a unique one. In chapter one, a theoretical framework suitable for the studies of crime in developing countries will be formulated. In Malaysia, the historical development of the country is important. Chapter two introduces the concepts and definitions of crimes at the workplace, in particular fraud. Chapter three tries to trace the detailed movements of the funds that were defrauded in the Bumiputra Malaysian Finance Limited (BMF) case. In doing so, they give a good idea of how frauds can occur and how they can be prevented. Chapter four is an analysis of the BMF case. The chapter is divided into two sections. The first section is the micro-analysis which deals with the structure of the organisation that is problematic. The second section is the macro-analysis which deals with the wider political and social structure that is problematic. Chapter five is on the comparative case studies which tries to establish the trend of how public organisations can be defrauded in Malaysia. A comparison with other countries will also show that the Malaysian case is not a unique one. Chapter six deals with the overall commercial crime scenario in Malaysia. Chapter seven tries to give some suggestions on combating and preventing fraud. The thesis is concluded with chapter eight...|$|R
40|$|Fraud {{committed}} against Australian Commonwealth government agencies generates a significant financial burden to society, {{yet there is}} limited empirical research into the sociodemographic characteristics of persons who commit fraud or the outcomes of fraud investigations. In the academic literature, fraud is most commonly examined within the theoretical framework of white-collar crime, with the average fraud offender presented as a middle aged male in a role of occupational trust, positioned {{in contrast to the}} average street criminal. However, persons who commit fraud against Commonwealth agencies often display very different characteristics to the typical white-collar criminal. The heterogeneity of fraud offenders that is acknowledged in the literature tends to be presented in terms of psychological or motivational typologies, and not in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Furthermore, there is limited research which examines the outcomes of fraud investigations, and in particular the influence of suspect characteristics on the progression of a case through the criminal justice system. Not only has the criminology literature paid limited attention to the variability in offender types from a sociodemographic perspective, but also the variability in fraud investigation case loads and the factors associated with this variability have been overlooked for the purpose of monitoring performance and effective case outcomes in the management of police investigations. The key methodological focus in this thesis is to appropriately account for the variability inherent in the mix of fraud suspects and offenders, outcomes of <b>fraud</b> investigations and <b>trends</b> in <b>fraud</b> activity when undertaking statistical analysis of the data available. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is the primary law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth, and investigates cases of serious and complex Commonwealth fraud. Using seven years of case data from the AFP’s Police Real-time Online Management Information System (PROMIS) database, this thesis develops a statistical framework to analyse serious and complex Commonwealth fraud. Four key studies are conducted in this thesis. In the first study, the demographic characteristics of Commonwealth fraud offenders are compared to the characteristics of offenders in two major samples of Australian serious fraud to explore whether Commonwealth fraud offenders are typical of the fraud offender presented in the criminology literature. In the second study, an empirical typology of Commonwealth fraud suspects is developed from a cluster analysis of sociodemographic and case characteristics, to explore and describe the significant heterogeneity amongst fraud suspects. The third study identifies factors that predict prosecution outcomes, using a multilevel logistic regression model to incorporate the clustering effect of geographic location of the investigating office. Finally, automated statistical process control charts are developed to monitor the prevalence of fraud investigations of different types and to allow for evaluation of government policy surrounding these investigations. The results of the analyses in this thesis indicate that Commonwealth fraud offenders differ significantly from the typical fraud offender seen in the literature: on average {{they are less likely to}} work in white-collar occupations, have a much greater representation of women and defraud lower values than other Australian serious fraud offenders. These findings suggest that the offender characteristics identified in the literature may be an artefact of the opportunities provided by the particular victim type rather than a necessary characteristic of a fraud offender. There is significant heterogeneity amongst fraud suspects, and the suspect typology demonstrates that neither age nor occupational status are a prerequisite for serious fraud, and that both gender and the agency defrauded tend to define the limits of financial return from serious Commonwealth fraud. In terms of the progression of a case through the investigative process, the analyses in this thesis demonstrate that the organisational context within which an investigation occurs has an influence on the outcome of a case. Whilst the severity of the case influences the outcome of an investigation, there is no evidence that suspect age or occupational status influence conviction likelihood; although there is evidence to suggest that the presence of gendered bonds between suspects can increase the chances of conviction. Finally, statistical process control methods are reviewed and adapted for the purpose of developing a software tool that is capable of charting non-normally distributed time series data such as the number of cases referred, the value of frauds committed and proceeds of crime restrained, and the proportion of cases of high or very high impact. Appropriate probability distributions are identified for the performance measures utilised by the AFP and a statistically robust software tool is created. The final software, Multichart, facilitates easy charting and monitoring of case loads over time and the evaluation of the impact of policy shifts on fraud prevalence, as well as having significant applicability to the monitoring of crime data more broadly...|$|R
