This paper studies the benefit of using advanced data mining techniques for Colorectal Cancer (CRC). CRC is the second most common cancer in the EU and is known to be a disease with very a-specific predictors, making it difficult to generate good predictive models. In addition, the EMR data itself has its own challenges, including the sparsity, the differences in which physicians code the data, the temporal nature of the data, and the imbalance in the data. Results show that state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including temporal data mining, are able to generate better predictive models than currently available in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ Biological {{economics}} is the interdisciplinary research {{field in which}} the interaction between human biology and {{economics is}} investigated and in which human beings are primarily seen as biological organisms. This thesis adopts a perspective in which certain individual economic choices and outcomes are connected to individual biological characteristics. The value of biological economics is at least threefold. First, knowledge about biological predispositions to economic choices and outcomes improves {{our understanding of the}} causes and consequences of individual differences. Second, biological measures known to be associated with economic choices and outcomes could be used in (otherwise non-biological) empirical work as control variables or instrumental variables. Third, information about economic predisposition to biological states and outcomes may result in targeted interventions to prevent undesired outcomes. Although it has been known <b>for</b> already <b>quite</b> <b>some</b> time that many economic choices and outcomes are heritable, no robust, replicable genetic predisposition to them had been found. This thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} find such associations, robustly and replicable, with relatively crude methods in combination with statistical rigor. This thesis also presents evidence that self-employed individuals are generally healthier than wage workers and that the selection of comparatively healthier individuals into self-employment accounts for the cross-sectional association. It presents tentative evidence that, if anything, engaging in self-employment is bad for one’s health. In addition, popular ideas that entrepreneurship is a particular good occupation for dyslectic and left-handed individuals could not be substantiated...|$|R
40|$|Concrete is {{most widely}} used {{construction}} material because of ease of construction and its properties like compressive strength and its durability. It is difficult to point out other material of construction which is versatile as concrete. This {{is well known that}} plain concrete is very good in resisting compressive strength but possesses less specific modulus, low ductility and very little resistance to cracking. Internal micro cracks inherently present in the concrete and its poor tensile strength is due to propagation of such micro cracks eventually leading to brittle failure of concrete. Several admixtures have been developed to improve the strength and workability properties of concrete. Of all admixtures used in concrete, Micro Silica occupies a special position <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> a <b>some</b> reasons. The improvement of the durability, resistance to sulphate, freezing and thawing, alkali silica reaction, frost attack, increase in the compressive strength, reduces the permeability and bleeding. Micro Silica effectively improve the structure of interface eliminates the weakness of the interfacial zone. In the past, attempt has been made to improve tensile strength of concrete. This was achieved by the addition of small closely spaced and randomly oriented fibers, dispersed uniformly in the matrix.

40|$|In Euclidean space, the {{asymptotic}} {{shape of}} large cells in {{various types of}} Poisson driven random tessellations {{has been the subject}} of a famous conjecture due to David Kendall. Since shape is a geometric concept and large cells are identified by means of geometric size functionals, the resolution of the conjecture is inevitably connected with geometric inequalities of isoperimetric type and their improvements in the form of geometric stability results, relating geometric size functionals and hitting functionals. The latter are deterministic characteristics of the underlying random tessellation. The current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in spherical space. A key ingredient of our approach are new geometric inequalities and quantitative strengthenings in terms of stability results <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> general and <b>some</b> specific size and hitting functionals of spherically convex bodies. As a consequence we obtain probabilistic deviation inequalities and asymptotic distributions of quite general size functionals.

A single administration of 20 % eugenol solution showed maximum efficacy of 87. 5 %, and applied three times it was 100 % efficient in curbing Sarcoptes scabeiei var. suis. The best efficacy in the treatment of sarcoptes mange in swine was achieved with three applications of eugenol in a concentration of 20 %. This maximum effect (100 %) was obtained already after the second treatment. Eugenol in a concentration of 10 % was safe for local application on skin because it does not cause any undesired reactions, while a 20 % concentration caused irritation followed by a passing redness and disquiet in a smaller number of treated animals. The results of comparative investigations of acaricide efficacy of permethrin and eugenol demonstrate that there is resistence in Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis to permethrin.
