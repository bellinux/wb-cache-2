5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E

25|$|This {{is a rare}} lightswitch style 1-15 receptacle. It has one {{vertical}} receptacle, and it {{can accept}} modern ungrounded NEMA 1-15 plugs. It is obsolete as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> insulation, thus is a minor fire hazard when used with high-wattage devices.|$|E

25|$|Pests and {{diseases}} are {{a serious problem}} for this grape variety, since <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> resistance to either. The grape forms compact, cylindrical bunches of spherical, deep blue-black fruit with a colourless pulp. The leaves are large with five overlapping lobes.|$|E
25|$|Fleas {{can jump}} {{vertically}} up to 18cm and horizontally up to 33cm, however, although {{this form of}} locomotion is initiated by the flea, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> control of the jump - they always jump in the same direction, with very little variation in the trajectory between individual jumps.|$|E
25|$|Since then, Mary Russell has revoked all film rights, {{believing that}} Hollywood cannot {{and will not}} make a film version of The Sparrow that is {{faithful}} to the book. She has written her own screenplay with her assistant Karen Hall, but has realized <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> to no chance of being produced.|$|E

25|$|Invasive {{species have}} become a concern in some areas. Some of these include yellow starthistle and scotch broom. Starthistle has become {{a problem in the}} Siskiyous only in the last 20 years. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> value to habitat and is able to outcompete many native plants. Purple loosestrife is a plant that is {{invasive}} to waterways.|$|E
25|$|Materialistic {{evolution}} is {{the acceptance of}} biological evolution, combined with the position that if the supernatural exists, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> to no influence on the material world (a position common to philosophical naturalists, humanists and atheists). It is a view championed by the New Atheists, who argue strongly that the creationist viewpoint is not only dangerous, but is completely rejected by science.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels {{as if they are}} moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> to do with the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|E
25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} acro is the smooth, graceful transitions between dance and acrobatic movements. Also, a dance must have {{a significant percentage of}} dance movement, with respect to its acrobatic content, in order for it to be categorized as acro. For example, a gymnastics floor exercise is not considered to be acro because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> or no dance movement compared to its acrobatic content, and also because it lacks smooth transitions between dance and gymnastic movements.|$|E

25|$|Atomoxetine is {{approved}} {{for use in}} children, adolescents, and adults. However, its efficacy has not been studied in children under six years old. Its primary advantage over the standard stimulant treatments for ADHD is that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> known abuse potential. While {{it has been shown}} to significantly reduce inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, the responses were lower than the response to stimulants. Additionally, 40% of participants who were treated with atomoxetine experienced significant residual ADHD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The west ridge leads {{over the}} {{shoulder}} called Little Dodd, and then turns north-west to the rocky pinnacle of Calfhow Pike and to the col separating Great Dodd from Clough Head.

Although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> prominence, it is a pleasant top giving good views of the surrounding grassy slopes and the valleys below.|$|E
25|$|Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is {{a format}} that {{incorporates}} an extremely {{wide range of}} options. While this makes TIFF useful as a generic format for interchange between professional image editing applications, it makes adding support for it to applications a much bigger task and so <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> support in applications not concerned with image manipulation (such as web browsers). The high level of extensibility also means that most applications provide only a subset of possible features, potentially creating user confusion and compatibility issues.|$|E
50|$|Wigram {{did make}} at least one attempt at direct {{publicity}} - {{at the time of}} the Occupation of the Rhineland in early 1936, he arranged a press conference for French Minister of Foreign Affairs Flandin, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> effect.|$|R
