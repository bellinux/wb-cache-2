We discuss in detail the necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of these type of solutions written in terms of Riemann invariants. The most important characteristic of this approach is the introduction of specific first order side conditions consistent with the original system of PDEs, leading to a generalization of the Riemann invariant method of solving multi-dimensional systems of PDEs. We have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach through several examples of hydrodynamic type systems; new classes of solutions have been obtained in a closed form.

In this paper, we perform some distributed tasks on the sensors. We propose a distributed algorithm, which allows to raise alarms under some initial rules to alert efficiently medical staff in case of critical situations without needless warnings. Each mote monitors a parameter. When this parameter reaches an abnormal value, the mote communicates with other motes in order to check {{if it is a}} ‘local' anomaly or if the patient is in an abnormal situation. In such cases an alarm is raised. We implemented our algorithm over a network of micaZ sensors running under TinyOS. The obtained results show promising perspectives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} rank-k solutions in terms of Riemann invariants, obtained from interrelations between two concepts, that of the symmetry reduction method and of the generalized method of characteristics for first order quasilinear hyperbolic systems of PDEs in many dimensions. A variant of the conditional symmetry method for obtaining this type of solutions is proposed. A Lie module of vector fields, which are symmetries of an overdetermined system defined by the initial system of equations and certain first order differential constraints, is constructed. It is shown that this overdetermined system admits rank-k solutions expressible in terms of Riemann invariants. Finally, examples of applications of the proposed approach to the fluid dynamics equations in (k+ 1) dimensions are discussed in detail. Several new soliton-like solutions (among them kinks, bumps and multiple wave solutions) have been obtained.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} for computing a low rank approximation of a sparse matrix {{based on a}} truncated LU factorization with column and row permutations. We present various approaches for determining the column and row permutations that show a trade-off between speed versus deterministic/probabilistic accuracy. We show that if the permutations are chosen by using tournament pivoting based on QR factorization, then the obtained truncated LU factorization with column/row tournament pivoting, LU_CRTP, satisfies bounds on the singular values which have similarities with the ones obtained by a communication avoiding rank revealing QR factorization. Experiments on challenging matrices show that LU_CRTP provides a good low rank approximation of the input matrix and it is less expensive than the rank revealing QR factorization in terms of computational and memory usage costs, while also minimizing the communication cost. We also compare the computational complexity of our algorithm with randomizedalgorithms and show that for sparse matrices and high enough but still modest accuracies, our approach is faster.

40|$|The pectenotoxins (PTXs) are {{a family}} of marine macrolactones {{produced}} by Dinophysis dinoflagellates and found in coastal areas worldwide. The PTXs have drawn considerable attention {{not only because of}} their complex structure and toxicity but also because of their potential medical applications. Pectenotoxins have shown selective cytotoxicity against a variety cancer cell lines and they are known to interact with the actin cytoskeleton by unique mechanism. These properties could be of great clinical importance for the development of new cancer chemotherapy agents. The scarcity of the PTXs has hampered further studies into their biological activity, and as such access to synthetic PTXs would be immensely helpful. The exquisitely complex structure of the PTXs presents a considerable challenge for a synthetic chemist. One of the most challenging structural elements is the AB spiroketal ring fragment that is in the more unstable and less easily accessible nonanomeric configuration. Importantly, the PTX congeners that contain this nonanomeric spiroketal ring system, has been reported to be the most biologically active. In the literature part, a short discussion of the anomeric effect is presented. The previously published syntheses of the AB spiroketal ring fragment of PTXs are discussed. And finally, a brief insight into other natural products containing nonanomeric spiroketals and their recent syntheses are presented. In this work the objective was to synthesize the ABCDE ring fragment of PTX 2 using a highly convergent strategy. Three advanced ring fragments corresponding to the A, C and <b>DE</b> <b>ring</b> systems were synthesized. The A ring lactone was also used for the synthesis of the AB spiroketal ring fragment of PTX 2. During these studies we developed kinetic spiroketalization conditions that delivered {{for the first time the}} desired nonanomeric spiroketal isomer of the PTXs as the major product. For the C ring fragment an efficient synthesis was developed that delivered the key center peace with the right stereochemistry in excellent 46 % total yield over nine steps. The connection of the C ring aldehyde with the <b>DE</b> <b>ring</b> fragment using Mukaiyama aldol reaction gave access to the CDE ring system in highly stereoselective manner. The CDE ring allylic alcohol was connected with the A ring fragment via cross-metathesis. As the final step, the kinetic spiroketalization delivered a 3 : 1 mixture of the nonanomeric and the anomeric spiroketal. Unfortunately, it was discovered that the final ABCDE ring product had the wrong stereochemistry at C 10. Studies targeting the inversion of this stereocenter are under way, which would finally give access to the natural ABCDE ring fragment of PTX 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Estimates {{of nuclear}} genome size for 9 Selaginella species were {{obtained}} using flow cytometry, and measure-ments for 7 {{of these species}} are reported for the first time. Estimates range from 0. 086 to 0. 112 pg per holoploid genome (84 – 110 Mb). The data presented here agree with the previously published flow cytometric results for S. moellendorffii. Within the 9 species sampled here, chromosome number varies from 2 n = 16 to 2 n = 27. Nuclear genome size appears to be strongly correlated with chromosome number (Spearman’s rank correlation; p = 0. 00003725). Cultivated S. moellen-dorffii lacks sexual reproduction—manifest by the production of abortive megasporangia. Flow cytometric data generated from a herbarium specimen of a fertile wild-collected S. moellendorffii are virtually indistinguishable from the data gener-ated from fresh material (0. 088 vs. 0. 089 pg/ 1 C). Therefore, the limited fertility observed in cultivated plants is probably {{not the result of}} abnormal chromosome number (e. g., induced by interspecific hybridization). Key words: flow cytometry, genome size.
