25|$|Cao Cao led an army to Tong Pass {{to attack}} Ma Chao and the coalition, {{resulting}} in the Battle of Tong Pass. After both sides clashed in a few engagements, Cao Cao had talks with Ma Chao and Han Sui. Ma Chao thought highly of himself and secretly harboured the intention of dashing forth and capturing Cao Cao when they met. However, he did not dare to make his move when Xu Chu, one of Cao Cao's close aides, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Cao Cao later followed Jia Xu's strategy to sow discord between Ma Chao and Han Sui and make them become suspicious of each other. Taking advantage of the hostility between Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cao Cao launched {{an attack on the}} northwestern warlords and defeated them.|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
2500|$|Reggie Miller {{recalled}} his encounter with Larry Bird's legendary trash talking ability {{in his book}} I Love Being the Enemy. Miller tried to disrupt Bird's concentration when he was shooting free throws late in a game. Bird <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> made the first free throw and said, [...] "You {{got to be kidding}} me. Rook, I'm the best shooter in the league right now. In the league. Understand? And you're up here trying to say something?" [...] Bird then buried the second free throw.|$|E
60|$|CRAMPTON (rising and <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him).</b> Young man: {{you owe me}} six weeks' rent.|$|R

2500|$|Campbell {{stepped from}} cover with his pistol drawn, saw Hale {{collapsed}} dead, and yelled to Stoudenmire {{that this was}} not his fight. [...] However, Constable Krempkau, mistakenly believing that Campbell had shot him, then fired his pistol twice at Campbell before losing consciousness from loss of blood. [...] Krempkau's first bullet struck Campbell's gun and broke his right wrist, while the second hit him in the foot. [...] Campbell screamed in pain and scooped up his gun from the ground with his left hand. [...] Stoudenmire whirled from Hale and instantly fired at Campbell who dropped his gun again, grabbed his stomach and collapsed onto the ground. [...] Stoudenmire walked slowly toward Campbell and coldly <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] In agony, Campbell yelled, [...] "You big son of a bitch! You murdered me!" [...] Stoudenmire said nothing. [...] Both Campbell and Krempkau died within minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the song, Vedder said in {{an online}} chat that it was written {{around the time of}} the Gulf War and added that [...] "it's an anti-patriotic song, actually." [...] On August 7, 2008, at a solo {{performance}} in Newark, New Jersey, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Vedder took a question from the audience requesting that he explain the meaning of [...] "Yellow Ledbetter". At first, Vedder joked, saying, [...] "Wait...you mean there's lyrics?" [...] He went on to talk about how the song took as its subject a friend of his from Seattle whose brother served in the first Gulf War. His friend received a [...] "yellow letter" [...] in the mail informing him that his brother had died in the war. Vedder and his friend then went for a walk. On this walk, the friend, whom Vedder described as [...] "alternative looking," [...] happened by a house with an American flag flying and people on the porch. He stopped and gestured to the flag, as if to salute it, but the people on the porch <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> disapprovingly due to his appearance.|$|E
2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. She <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the context within which Milroy was operating.|$|E

6000|$|... "Maybe it's {{that crazy}} hermit," [...] {{suggested}} Whopper, {{and gave a}} little shiver. He could still see that impish face <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Be careful." ...|$|R
60|$|Quest drew a long breath. The man {{who stood}} <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> was well-dressed and still young. He was unarmed, however, and Quest secured {{him in a}} moment.|$|R

6000|$|YANK--[Viciously.] G'wan! Tell it to Sweeney! [He swaggers {{away and}} {{deliberately}} lurches into a top-hatted gentleman, then <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> pugnaciously.] Say, who d'yuh tink yuh're bumpin'? Tink yuh own de oith? ...|$|R

60|$|The Marquis {{advanced}} {{with his}} usual leisurely and aristocratic walk {{to the edge of}} the palings. Richard Vont stood <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like a wild beast, but there was no signs of any weapon about.|$|R

60|$|Jack Bates {{began to}} feel very awk'ard. They was all <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>'im</b> as though they could eat 'im, and he wasn't used to such treatment. And, as a matter o' fact, he'd got a very good-'arted face.|$|R
