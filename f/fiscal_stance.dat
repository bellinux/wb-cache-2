2500|$|In {{economic}} terms, Wilson's {{first three}} years in office were dominated by an ultimately doomed effort {{to stave off the}} devaluation of the pound.

Many British economists advocated devaluation, but Wilson resisted, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as [...] "the party of devaluation". In the latter half of 1967, however, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a winter rise in unemployment.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Heritage Foundation, a {{conservative}} American think tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil. “China has extended three multibillion dollar {{lines of credit}} to the Angolan government; two loans of $2 billion from China Exim Bank, one in 2004, the second in 2007, {{as well as one}} loan in 2005 of $2.9 billion from China International Fund Ltd.” Growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for corruption: according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, 32billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010. Furthermore, Sonangol, the state run oil company, has control of 51% of Cabinda’s oil. Due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit given to the government and the taxes paid. The council of foreign affairs states that the World Bank mentioned that Sonangol [...] " [...] is a taxpayer, it carries out quasi-fiscal activities, it invests public funds, and, as concessionaire, it is a sector regulator. This multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between Sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> of the state." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{structural}} (permanent) deficit {{differs from}} a cyclical deficit {{in that it}} exists regardless of {{the point in the}} business cycle due to an underlying imbalance in government revenues and expenditures. Thus, even at the high point of the business cycle when revenues are high the country's economy may still be in deficit. The structural component of the budget is used by some economists as an indication of a government's financial management, as it indicates the underlying balance between long-term government revenues and expenditure, while removing factors that are mainly attributable to the business cycle. Other economists see the structural deficit as simply a reflection of the implied discretionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> of the government, that is, a structural deficit would be an expansionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> that promotes at least nominal economic growth.|$|E

We find substantial {{variation in the}} discretionary policy of Canadian governments, across both time and jurisdictions. We uncover a marked asymmetry {{in the composition of}} discretionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>stances.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> retrenchments have tended to be dominated by a "balance" between spending cuts and tax increases, while fiscal expansions have been largely expenditure dominant. This asymmetry suggests a historic bias toward expanding the size of the public sector.

5000|$|The CPS soon drove for a {{reassessment}} of Conservative economic policy during their period in opposition from 1974-1979. It {{was during this}} period that the CPS released its landmark reports, such as Stranded on the Middle Ground? Reflections on Circumstances and Policies and Monetarism is Not Enough (1974 and 1976). Monetarism is Not Enough was described by Margaret Thatcher as “one {{of the very few}} speeches which have fundamentally affected a political generation's way of thinking.". Keith Joseph’s keynote speeches, also published by the CPS, aimed to lead the way in changing the climate of opinion in Britain and set the intellectual foundations for the enforced privatisation reforms of the 1980s. In 1981 Sherman brought the Swiss monetarist Jurg Niehans over to Britain to advise on economic management. Niehans wrote a report critical of the government's economic management that was crucial in influencing the change of policy in the 1981 budget; this tightened the government's <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> to make possible a looser monetary policy. However Hugh Thomas, who had been appointed Chairman of the CPS in 1979 was finding Sherman impossible to work with.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical evidence on saving {{trends in the}} global economy and the emergence of a single real long-term interest rate, from a Keynesian point of view. The essentially Ricardian position of bodies such as the IMF implies a 'savings shortage' which is theoretically implausible, and non-clearing market may be better explained by Keynesian concepts of liquidity applied to asset preference. The empirical evidence seems to indicate that global capital markets do not act so as to integrate national saving pools, despite interest rate convergence among both industrialized and industrializing countries.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} nature of fiscal {{discipline}} under alternative exchange rate regimes. First, it shows that fiscal agencies under a currency union with a fixed exchange rate can have a larger incentive to overspend or "free ride" than those under other exchange rate regimes, owing to the agencies' ability to spread the costs of overspending in inflation tax across both time, given the fixed exchange rate, and space, given the currency union. In contrast, such free-riding behavior does not arise under flexible regimes owing to the immediate inflationary impact of spending. Next, empirically, <b>fiscal</b> <b>stances</b> in countries with fixed pegs and currency union regimes demonstrate greater free-riding behavior than do countries with more flexible regimes in fifteen Caribbean countries from 1983 to 2004. currency unions, exchange rates, fiscal policy,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{aggregate}} shocks on the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> of the EU, and of its old (OMS) and new (NMS) member states over a business cycle. The <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> {{is measured by the}} government deficit. To study the impact of aggregate shocks, we use impulse responses derived from a pooled structural vector autoregression model estimated on annual panel data. We find that the fiscal deficits of OMS could be vulnerable to discretionary changes in government expenditures and revenues. In contrast, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> of NMS shows vulnerability to GDP shocks, because the increase in revenues after a positive GDP shock is often outpaced by greater expenditure increases in NMS. The estimated fiscal vulnerabilities stem from disproportionate policy responses concerning government expenditures and a lacking discipline to control pro-cyclical fiscal spending. Our findings for the EU thus support application of fiscal rules focused on government expenditure rather than other fiscal variables. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the {{interaction}} between fiscal and monetary policy on the low-frequency relationship between the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> and inflation using crosscountry data from 1965 to 1999. In a first step, we contrast the monetary-fiscal narrative for Germany, the U. S. and Italy with evidence obtained from simple regression models and a time-varying VAR. We find that the low-frequency relationship between the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> and inflation is low during periods of an independent central bank and responsible fiscal policy and more pronounced in times of high fiscal budget deficits and accommodative monetary authorities. In a second step, we use an estimated DSGE model to interpret the low-frequency measure structurally and to illustrate the mechanisms through which fiscal actions affect inflation in the long run. The findings from the DSGE model suggest that switches in the monetary-fiscal policy interaction and accompanying variations in the propagation of structural shocks can well account for changes in the low-frequency relationship between the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> and inflation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of debt stabilization for inflation targeting. If the monetary authority perfectly stabilizes inflation while the fiscal authority holds constant {{the real value of}} debt at maturity, the equilibrium dynamics might be indeterminate. However, determinacy can be restored by committing to targeting rules for either monetary or fiscal policy that include a concern for stabilization of the output gap. In solving the indeterminacy problem, flexible inflation targeting appears to be more robust than flexible debt targeting to alternative parameter configurations and steady-state <b>fiscal</b> <b>stances.</b> Conversely, flexible <b>fiscal</b> targeting rules lead to more desirable welfare outcomes. The paper further shows that if considerations beyond stabilization call for a combination of strict inflation and debt targeting rules, the indeterminacy result can be overturned if the fiscal authority commits to holding constant debt net of interest rate spending.
