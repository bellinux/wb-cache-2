5|$|Northern {{hardwood}} {{trees are}} common in the Fishing Creek watershed. Ruffed grouse are common along Little Fishing Creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> north of Iola.

5|$|The {{two main}} river {{systems of the}} state are the Krishna and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra, in the north, and the Kaveri and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in the south. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, {{reaching}} the sea at the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> were {{rated on a}} scale of 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. Most of this part of the creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> were rated 166 or higher, which was considered optimal. The waters near the mouths of West Branch and East Branch Fishing Creeks, and Fishing Creek near Benton, were rated 113 to 160, considered suboptimal. A portion of West Creek was rated 60–112, considered marginal.|$|E

50|$|Located in the Drainage {{basin of}} the Adour, the commune {{is the source}} of {{numerous}} tributaries of the Vert which is itself a tributary of Gave dOloron. The largest tributary flowing through the commune is the Vert dArrette however many other streams flow north towards the Vert including: the Abat Daurèye and <b>its</b> <b>tributary,</b> the Banu Erreka (accompanied by the Ruisseau de Aurèye); Ibarcis Erreka; the Lancy; the Ruisseau de Gurré and <b>its</b> <b>tributary</b> the Ruisseau de Lagaretche; the Ruisseau de Hournères and <b>its</b> <b>tributary,</b> the Ouettone; the Ruisseau de Légorre and <b>its</b> <b>tributary,</b> the Cassiau de Ber; the streams of Nécore, Soulayets, Talu Gros, and Virgou with the tributary of the latter, the Arrigau (accompanied itself in the commune by the Bachère).|$|R
5|$|Solomon Creek was {{devoid of}} fish in the 1970s. However, since then several fish species, {{including}} brook trout, have inhabited the creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries.</b> A number of varieties of aquatic insects are also present.|$|E
5|$|The Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association has {{proposed}} a number of methods to conserve Fishing Creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries.</b> These include planting riparian buffers, eliminating leaky septic systems, and protecting the area from hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
5|$|The {{river and}} <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> powered dozens of mills, and sheep in the {{surrounding}} grassland supplied fleeces to be made into woollen products.|$|E
50|$|Significant tributaries {{include the}} Mole, Wandle, Ravensbourne (tidal reach known as 'Deptford Creek') with <b>its</b> <b>tributary</b> the Quaggy, and the Darent and <b>its</b> <b>tributary</b> the Cray which {{together}} {{form part of}} the eastern boundary of Greater London.

5|$|Interstate 80 runs in an east-west {{direction}} {{through the}} watershed of Mahoning Creek. There {{are also a}} number of township roads near the creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries.</b> Pennsylvania Route 54, Pennsylvania Route 642, and US Route 11 are in the watershed as well.|$|E
5|$|Mud Creek {{is named}} for its muddiness. An area near it was settled as early as 1772 and several bridges were built across it and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> in the 20th century. The creek is {{designated}} as a warm-water fishery.|$|E
5|$|Pannonian basin: From easternmost Austria through Czech Republic (small {{part in the}} southeast), Slovakia, Hungary, {{northern}} Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina (marginally), northern Serbia to {{the east}} of Romania and southeast of Ukraine (Transcarpathian region). This includes the middle floodplains of the Danube river and some of <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> including the Drava, Sava and Tisza.|$|E

5|$|Several {{surveys of}} Catawissa Creek have been {{performed}} by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The first one was in 1957. There were two more surveys of chemical hydrology in 1966 and 1976. In 1997, the commission assessed the creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> for usability as fisheries for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{public and private}} sectors have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.|$|E
5|$|Southern Bedfordshire {{is part of}} the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. North and mid Bedfordshire are undulating claylands {{with broad}} river valleys of the River Great Ouse and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> and the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge.

5|$|The Merced River and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> are {{a popular}} {{recreational}} area {{in part because}} of Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{direction}} of Oregon stream flow {{is influenced by}} four major drainage divides: the Oregon Coast Range on the west, the Cascade Range further inland, the Klamath–Siskiyou Mountains in the southwest, and the Blue Mountains in the northeast. One set of streams, including the Nehalem River, flows directly into the Pacific Ocean or into larger streams flowing directly to the Pacific; other streams, such as the Deschutes River, flow into the Columbia River or <b>its</b> <b>tributaries.</b> A third set, including the Klamath River and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> originates in Oregon, but its waters eventually flow into northern California before reaching the ocean. Other streams like the Donner und Blitzen River flow into closed basins, such as Malheur Lake, that have no outlet to the sea.|$|E
5|$|The major {{communities}} in the Mud Creek watershed are Jerseytown and Washingtonville. Major roads in the watershed include Pennsylvania Route 254. There are also a number of township roads that go to the creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries.</b>|$|E

5|$|The river, and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries,</b> had a {{population}} of water rats (Hydromys chrysogaster) and Australian swamp rats (Rattus lutreolus). Water rats remain in reduced numbers, but the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus) and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) have largely supplanted the natives. The house mouse (Mus musculus) is now the most common mammal of the Torrens environ.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Briar Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage divide between the creek's watershed and another watershed. Several points along Briar Creek and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> have erode with ease or moderate ease. The infiltration capacity of these points is mostly moderate to high.|$|E
5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and <b>its</b> <b>tributaries</b> support populations of European water vole (Arvicola amphibius).
