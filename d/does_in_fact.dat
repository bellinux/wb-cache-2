5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E
5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed {{it turned out that the}} sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E
5|$|The results {{indicated}} that nuclei of unbinilium were produced at high (~70MeV) excitation energy which underwent fission with measurable half-lives just over 10−18 s. Although very short (indeed, insufficient for the element to be considered by IUPAC to exist, because a compound nucleus has no internal structure and its nucleons have not been arranged into shells until it has survived for 10−14s, upon which it forms an electronic cloud), the ability to measure such a process indicates a strong shell effect at Z=120. At lower excitation energy (see neutron evaporation), {{the effect of the}} shell will be enhanced and ground-state nuclei can be expected to have relatively long half-lives. This result could partially explain the relatively long half-life of 294Og measured in experiments at Dubna. Similar experiments have indicated a similar phenomenon at element 124 but not for flerovium, suggesting that the next proton shell <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> lie beyond element 120. In September 2007, the team at RIKEN began a program utilizing 248Cm targets and have indicated future experiments to probe the possibility of 120 being the next proton magic number (and 184 being the next neutron magic number) using the aforementioned nuclear reactions to form 302Ubn, as well as 248Cm+54Cr. They also planned to further chart the region by investigating the nearby compound nuclei 296Og, 298Og, 306Ubb, and 308Ubb.|$|E

25|$|The 3.73-mile (6.00km) {{northwest}} {{section in}} Queens is mostly built to freeway standards and lies {{along the north}} edge of JFK Airport, {{just south of the}} Belt Parkway and Conduit Avenue (NY27).

The separate NY878 begins at that split, and carries eastbound one-way traffic only until the junction with I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway). There it becomes two-way, continuing east past the JFK Expressway; the freeway ends at a traffic light at North Hangar Road. NY878 ends soon after at Rockaway Boulevard and Farmers Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong {{is not just}} the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E

25|$|A {{break point}} occurs if the receiver, not the server, {{has a chance}} to win the game with the next point. Break points are of {{particular}} importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. If the receiver <b>does,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert. Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back. Except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} ethanol {{is involved}} in the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. One study showed the nature of ethanol binding to L-type calcium channels is according to first-order kinetics with a Hill coefficient around 1. This indicates ethanol binds independently to the channel, expressing noncooperative binding. Early studies showed a link between calcium and the release of vasopressin by the secondary messenger system. Vasopressin levels are reduced after the ingestion of alcohol. The lower levels of vasopressin from the consumption of alcohol have been linked to ethanol acting as an antagonist to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Studies conducted by Treistman et al. in the aplysia confirm inhibition of VGCC by ethanol. Voltage clamp recordings have been done on the aplysia neuron. VGCCs were isolated and calcium current was recorded using patch clamp technique having ethanol as a treatment. Recordings were replicated at varying concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM) at a voltage clamp of +30 mV. Results showed calcium current decreased as concentration of ethanol increased. Similar results have shown to be true in single-channel recordings from isolated nerve terminal of rats that ethanol <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> block VGCCs.|$|E

Of those inmates with the best scores, 98% <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> succeed on parole; and of those with the worst scores, only 24% <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> succeed (Burgess, 1928).|$|R

500|$|The false {{catshark}} {{was first}} described by Portuguese ichthyologist Félix de Brito Capelo in the Jornal do Sciências Mathemáticas, Physicas e Naturaes in 1868.

Brito Capelo thought the specimen resembled {{a member of}} the genus Triakis, except lacking a nictitating membrane (though it is now known that this species <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> have this trait). Thus, he assigned it to the new genus Pseudotriakis, from the Greek pseudo ("false"). At the time, Triakis was classified with the catsharks, hence [...] "false catshark". The specific name microdon comes from the Greek mikros ("small") and odontos ("tooth"). Other common names for this species are dumb shark (from its Japanese name oshizame) and keel-dorsal shark.|$|E
500|$|Andrews found Cardozo's {{reasoning}} too narrow, {{and felt}} that the focus {{should be on the}} unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. [...] "Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he <b>does</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene." ...|$|E

500|$|Butters soon <b>does,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> write a {{novel of}} his very own, The Poop That Took a Pee, which {{consists}} solely of simple descriptions of scatological acts. The four boys are convinced the book will be a disaster and expose Butters as a fraud over the first book. However, much to their surprise, readers actually find it an even deeper, more profound book, and continue reading their own allegorical messages into the text. After finishing the book, one crazed reader storms onto the set of reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians and murders the entire Kardashian family with a pump-action shotgun. Both The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs and The Poop That Took a Pee are banned as a result, and Butters is devastated, mainly because he always saw Kim Kardashian as [...] "the {{most beautiful woman in}} the world". Stan and Kyle suggest that rather than reading books and mindlessly discovering false messages in them, people should simply watch television instead. Cartman also tricks Butters into thinking that he dressed Sarah Jessica Parker in a moose costume, and was therefore responsible for her being shot in the woods. Butters starts to panic at first, but calms down and shrugs because of how [...] "ugly" [...] she was anyway.|$|E

The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films.
