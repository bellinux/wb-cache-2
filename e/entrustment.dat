5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 <b>entrustment</b> had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this <b>entrustment</b> was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{dismissed}} Smith's argument, {{asserting that}} neither the Federation nor Rhodesia had ever made such an appointment (this was actually false; the Federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia retained them both). Johnston concluded that Rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing. The previous <b>entrustments,</b> he said, {{had been made to}} allow Britain and Rhodesia to cooperate subject to Whitehall's ultimate authority, and did not entitle Rhodesia to do as it liked in the field of external affairs, especially if its chosen line ran counter to Britain's. In an attempt to intimidate Smith, Johnston sternly asked why the Rhodesian Prime Minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying Britain; Smith replied that following Britain's several slights against Rhodesia over the previous year and a half, Salisbury would not accept another. The conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards. Smith proposed that the relevant documents be examined jointly by two judges, one British and one Rhodesian, but Johnston refused this. The meeting ended without agreement.|$|R
40|$|Property rights, {{institutions}} and insurance mechanisms that assure property ownership and required legislative arrangements in Muslim counties {{just like in}} the other developing counties are generally taken from the best practices of western capitalist countries. In this study, insurance and property ownership are searched from the İslamic point of view. Our argument is that in comparison with capitalist paradigms related with property ownership and insurance mechanisms, there exist an Islamic approach based on some exalted principles and systems that not only covers worldly needs of mitigating risks associated with the property rights and proper insurance, but also includes concerns regarding preparation for the hereafter and eternal life. Particularly, the prominence of İslamic Economics in setting up of economic principles with their institutional basis regarding property mechanisms from the holy Koran is being searched in brief with some specimens on systematic differentiations. Everything is the property of God and human being is temporarily undertaking its ownership as a vicegerent of God on the earth in which materials and properties are considered as <b>entrustments.</b> Property ownership at the eternal abode will be based of proper conduct of temporary properties...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews natural {{resource}} governance in Zimbabwe’s peasant sector from colonial to post-colonial times. Governance is considered {{within the framework}} of power, process and practice and how these shaped peasant access, control and use of {{natural resource}}s. Colonial natural resource governance systems resulted in over-centralisation because they were crafted in the context of conquest and subjugation. Over the years, state visions of appropriate management and use of resources have largely been extended to the African peasant sector through a centrally-directed structure and process. However, state control over the use and management of resources among the peasantry was and is largely ineffectual because the state lacks the resources and capacity to enforce such controls. Much of the colonial legislation was inherited piecemeal into post-colonial times, and amendments to date have largely deracialised the colonial acts and policies without democratising them. Pioneering efforts at decentralizing <b>entrustments</b> over use and management of resources to the peasant communities have largely resulted in recentralisation at the district level, where such efforts are still practiced in the trickle-down mode. This is in part because the policy thrust seeking to empower the peasant communities is supply-led, and thus defined according to the terms and processes of external agents, including funders and central governments and their functionaries. The study argues that supply-led decentralisation needs to be complemented by demand-driven decentralisation...|$|R

25|$|Montserrat was {{awaiting}} <b>entrustment</b> (approval) of the United Kingdom {{with regards}} to the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas in order to participate, but such <b>entrustment</b> was denied in mid-2008, and the CARICOM Heads of Government (including Montserrat) expressed disappointment and urged the United Kingdom to reconsider its position. Until such time, Montserrat remains a member under the conditions existing immediately prior to the coming into force of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and the CSM on 1 January 2006 and as such is legally in a common market relationship with all CSM participating states. This means that while goods from Montserrat are eligible for CARICOM treatment and free trade (as covered under the old Common Market Annex), service providers in Montserrat are not eligible for CARICOM treatment unless so provided for by the various CSM countries individually in legislation or administratively.|$|E

These were Antigua and Barbuda (December 30, 2010), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (January 12, 2011), St. Kitts and Nevis (January 20, 2011), Grenada (January 20, 2011) and Dominica (January 21, 2011). In order for the Treaty to have entered into force at least four of the independent Member States must have ratified it by January 21, 2011.

[...] Following the need of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to temporarily assume control of two indigenous commercial banks in Anguilla, the Chief Minister of Anguilla, Hubert Hughes, announced on August 12, 2013 that Anguilla will seek to join the OECS Economic Union as soon possible in order to fully participate in the strategy of growth conceived by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (which was crafted within the context of the Economic Union). He was supported in his position by St. Lucia's Prime Minister, Dr. Kenny Anthony, who also called on Anguilla to join the Economic Union to complement its membership of the Currency Union.|$|R
40|$|The proper {{alignment}} {{of authority and}} responsibility within and between various levels of social organization is a fundamental governance problem. This study used a review approach to critically interrogate {{the political economy of}} the allocation of environmental jurisdictions among the Zimbabwean state, local communities and Rural District Councils through the conferment, to the latter, of the authority to enact conservation and land use planning by-laws. The subsidiary aim was to investigate, through afield study, the practical operation of the by-laws in everyday social life, in an analysis that situates the effectiveness of the by-laws within the theme of proximity to citizens. Several flaws and contradictions are evident in the political economy of the allocation of authority and responsibility among the above actors. Assignment of the responsibilities is framed within a top-down structure in which <b>entrustments</b> are transferred solely to Rural District Councils {{at the expense of other}} levels of social organization, particularly those close to the citizens. Although parent legislation allocates broad powers to Rural District Councils, monitoring of the effectiveness of such allocations is done on the basis of whether the governance arrangements deliver on the stateâ€™s goals, and not on local peopleâ€™s goals and aspirations. But there is not much scope for communities to effectively participate in governance at the Rural District Council level. There also is not much scope in parent legislation for revising these governance arrangements, with higher level actors enjoying the prerogative to effect amendments, and not the communities. Governance arrangements fostered by the by-laws punish citizens for not respecting arrangements that the citizens do not effectively participate in crafting.

500|$|Kolbe {{was sent}} to Rome in 1912, where he {{attended}} the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1919 or 1922 (sources vary). He {{was active in the}} consecration and <b>entrustment</b> to Mary. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against Popes St. Pius X and Benedict XV in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the Freemasons. According to Kolbe, They placed the black standard of the [...] "Giordano Brunisti" [...] under the windows of the Vatican. On this standard the archangel, St. Michael, was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully. Soon afterward, Kolbe organized the Militia Immaculatae (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary. So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee.|$|E

50|$|Negligence in {{employment}} differs from negligent <b>entrustment</b> in two key respects. First, negligent employment {{requires that the}} injury {{was caused by the}} actual employment of the party. By comparison, a party can be held liable for negligently entrusting something to any person, whether that person is an employee or not. Second, an employee can be found liable for negligent hiring, retention, supervision or training even without provision of any dangerous instrumentality to the employee. However, where an employer hires an unqualified person to engage in the use of a dangerous instrumentality, as in the above example with the bus driver, the employer may be liable for both negligent <b>entrustment</b> and negligent hiring.|$|E
50|$|Negligent <b>entrustment</b> arises {{where the}} entrustor is {{held liable for}} {{negligence}} because they negligently provided the entrustee with a dangerous instrument, and the entrusted party caused injury to a third party with that instrument. Where such a claim is brought against an employer, the employer will be held liable if the entrustee's record was known, or would have been easily discoverable, to the employer. For example, if a bus company hires a driver who {{has a record of}} reckless driving, of which the company could have learned through a search of publicly available records, the company would be liable for the negligent <b>entrustment</b> of the bus to that driver, should the driver cause an accident.|$|E
50|$|Negligent <b>entrustment</b> is {{generally}} found where the entrustee {{had a reputation}} or record that showed his propensity to be dangerous through possession of such an instrumentality. Where the claim is against an employer, the employer will be held liable if the entrustee's record was known to the employer or would have been easily discoverable by that employer, had a diligent search been conducted. For example, suppose a bus company hires a driver who {{has a record of}} reckless driving, which the company could have learned of through a search of publicly available records. The company will be liable for the negligent <b>entrustment</b> of the bus to that driver, if the driver is in an accident.|$|E
