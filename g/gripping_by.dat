50|$|The {{standard}} lower handguard {{features an}} angled rib pattern {{designed to enhance}} <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> the support hand. The rear of the handguard features two molded notches that enable the 40 mm wz. 1974 grenade launcher to be mounted under the barrel (early versions of the wz. 1996 lacked these notches, fitted instead with handguards with lateral grooves). Some Beryl handguards are equipped with short Picatinny rails and an integral vertical foregrip.|$|E
50|$|The {{handle of}} the hammer helps in several ways. It keeps the user's hands away {{from the point of}} impact. It {{provides}} a broad area that is better-suited for <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> the hand. Most importantly, it allows the user to maximize the speed of the head on each blow. The primary constraint on additional handle length is the lack of space to swing the hammer. This is why sledge hammers, largely used in open spaces, can have handles that are much longer than a standard carpenter's hammer. The second most important constraint is more subtle. Even without considering the effects of fatigue, the longer the handle, the harder it is to guide the head of the hammer to its target at full speed.|$|E
40|$|The magnetorheological {{properties}} of ferrofluids (or smart, or active fluids) are well known, and are currently exploited in shear in advanced damping {{systems in the}} automotive industry, robotics (prosthesis), and machine tools (chatter reduction, positioning). This paper proposes an end effector for <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> a novel form of controllable wet adhesion inspired by gastropod pedal mucus. The design of a gripper has been proposed, along with performance analysis based on experiments on various parameters, materials and surfaces, exhibiting robustness in unknown and dirty environment, typical of disassembly. Benefits over competing handling technologies and future research directions in this new area have been addressed...|$|E

40|$|The crystal slicing {{method is}} {{described}} as follows. A crystal is sliced in a plane parallel to flat, opposed parallel end faces of the crystal. The end faces of the crystal are <b>gripped</b> <b>by</b> a pair of opposed, perforated platens {{of a pair of}} vacuum chambers, one of which is translatable relative to the other. A blade cuts the crystal through the desired plane. A spring biases one of the vacuum chambers away from the other vacuum chamber while both of the faces are <b>gripped</b> <b>by</b> the vacuum chambers and the blade is cleaving the crystal. A sliced portion of the crystal <b>gripped</b> <b>by</b> one of the vacuum chambers is pulled away from the remainder of the crystal <b>gripped</b> <b>by</b> the second vacuum chamber when the crystal was cleaved by the blade through the plane...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the control}} method to <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> {{means of a}} robot hand that {{automatically}} discriminates among rigid body, middle body and soft body is proposed. Further, an anti-fall method due to slipping of gripping body is made a trial by using a slipping sensor due to rotary encoder form to improve the reliability. For a control of gripping behavior in this paper, the grip force control is enforced by means of DC servo motor instead of the stepping motor by reason of which have a week gripping force and a slow gripping behavior. Still more, gripping control program is constructed by means of Visual Basic by reason of that express many data of gripping movement visually...|$|E
40|$|The Masserann kit is {{a hollow}} tube device {{specially}} {{designed for the}} removal of intracanal metallic objects. This report describes some modifications in the usage of this device for effective removal of tightly bound intracanal broken instruments whose diameter is relatively large at the coronal end. The techniques described are: 1) modification of the extractor to ensure <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> creating a wider space inside the tube, and 2) combined use of the modified extractor with an ultrasonic device and a surgical operating microscope. A clinical case demonstrating that these modifications resulted in successful retrieval of firmly wedged instruments is presented. 3 Takashi Okiji Intracanal broken instruments impedes thorough cleaning and shaping of the root canal system and thus may compromise the outcome of endodontic treatment. However, orthograde removal of separated instruments is usually a significant challenge to practitioners. There is no standardized procedure, and a number of different remova...|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{endurance}} measurement using {{a progressive}} workload method may reduce pain sensation in the subject. This study aimed {{to examine the}} relationships between force-time parameters during sustained static gripping as measured by maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) using either a progressive workload (PW) or a constant workload (CW). Sixteen subjects performed sustained static gripping with 7 gradually increasing relative demand values of 20 % to 80 % MVC and sustained static <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> MVC. The staging of progressive workload was 10 s for 20 % MVC, 20 s each for 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 % MVC, and 10 s for 80 % MVC. The forces exerted at 120 s in the CW and PW methods were at around the 23 - 27 % MVC level. Peak force, final force, and force during the last 30 s for the PW method evaluated muscle endurance after 1 min and showed high correlations (r = 0. 746 ? 0. 895). Significant correlations (r = 0. 575 ? 0. 605) were found between time to 40 % MVC in the CW method and peak force, final force, and force in the last 30 s in the PW method group. The peak force in the PW method may be useful for evaluating muscle endurance with a short testing time and without high pain sensation...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of cryotheapy versus no treatment in preventing blistering and tearing of the hands of twenty-six male college age gymnastics students at Utah State University. The subjects were tested with a hand dynamometer to determine differences in grip strength between right and left hands. Two groups of thirteen subjects each were formed to equalize the differences in grip strength. During the experimental period of four class sessions totaling two hours, subjects participated in various activities on the horizontal bar, parallel bars, anG rings which rec.,ui red simultaneous <b>gripping</b> <b>by</b> both hands. Whenever a subject experienced a burning sensation in the skin of his hands, he went immediately to tn ice water bath (100 C) and soaked one hand for thirty seconds. One group treated only the stronger hand, while the other group treated only the weaker hard. After treatment, the hand was dried and workout continued. When the skin tore on a subject 2 ̆ 7 s hand, he reported to the recorder and treated the tear by carefully trimming away a ll the loose skin. He was a lso encouraged to apply a disinfectant. The tear was measured and given a classification as to whether it was a 1 st, 2 nd, or 2 rd degree tear, with a corresponding weighted value. Training continued unless the tear was serious. The data was subjected to the t distribution test for significance to de!ermine whether the cryotherapy was successful in preventing tearing of the skin on the treated hand. The res ul ts of the t test indicated a significant reduction in the amount of tearing that occurred on the treated hands of the subjects. Results of the t test for two sample means showed that there was no significant difference whether a subject treated the weaker hand or the stronger hand at the. 05 level of significance...|$|E
