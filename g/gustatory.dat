5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the <b>gustatory</b> cortex.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{description of the}} hypoglossal nerve was by Herophilos (335–280 BC), {{although it was not}} named at the time. The first use of the name hypoglossal in Latin as nervi hypoglossi externa was used by Winslow in 1733. This was followed though by several different namings including nervi indeterminati, par lingual, par gustatorium, great sub-lingual by different authors, and <b>gustatory</b> nerve and lingual nerve (by Winslow). It was listed in 1778 as nerve hypoglossum magnum by Soemmering. It was then named as the great hypoglossal nerve by Cuvier in 1800 as a translation of Winslow and finally named in English by Knox in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, flies have chemoreceptors that detect {{smell and}} taste, and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch. The third {{segments}} of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors, while the <b>gustatory</b> receptors are in the labium, pharynx, feet, wing margins and female genitalia, enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it. The taste receptors in females {{at the tip of}} the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing. Flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts, and many blood-sucking flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals. Some tachinid flies (Ormiinae) which are parasitoids of bush crickets, have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts.|$|E
25|$|Taste, <b>gustatory</b> perception, or {{gustation}} {{is one of}} {{the five}} traditional senses that belongs to the <b>gustatory</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>gustatory</b> {{disorders}} are challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because <b>gustatory</b> functions {{are tied to}} the sense of smell, the somatosensory system, and the perception of pain (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, <b>gustatory</b> dysfunction is rare when compared to olfactory disorders.|$|E
25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in any sensory modality—visual, auditory, olfactory, <b>gustatory,</b> tactile, proprioceptive, equilibrioceptive, nociceptive, thermoceptive and chronoceptive.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gustatory</b> sense (taste): GPCRs in taste cells mediate {{release of}} gustducin in {{response}} to bitter- and sweet-tasting substances.|$|E
25|$|Taste is the {{sensation}} produced when a substance {{in the mouth}} reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (<b>gustatory</b> calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. The <b>gustatory</b> cortex {{is responsible for the}} perception of taste.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} further {{classify}} {{the extent of}} dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, <b>gustatory</b> testing may be performed. <b>Gustatory</b> testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the anterior and posterior tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs. In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.|$|E
25|$|NST {{receives}} {{input from}} the amygdala (regulates oculomotor nuclei output), bed nuclei of stria terminalis, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex. NST is the topographical map that processes <b>gustatory</b> and sensory (temp, texture, etc.) info.|$|E
25|$|Chemicals that stimulate taste {{receptor}} {{cells are}} known as tastants. Once a tastant is dissolved in saliva, it can {{make contact with the}} plasma membrane of the <b>gustatory</b> hairs, which are the sites of taste transduction.|$|E
25|$|The parabrachial area {{integrates}} {{taste and}} pain info then relays it. Parabrachial checks if {{the pain is}} being received in normal temperatures and if the <b>gustatory</b> system is active; if both are so the pain {{is assumed to be}} due to poison.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{diagnostic}} tools {{can also}} be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. Electrophysiological tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the nerve-to-brainstem pathways. For example, the blink reflex may be used to evaluate the integrity of the trigeminal nerve–pontine brainstem–facial nerve pathway, which may play a role in <b>gustatory</b> function.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{hallucination}} is {{the perception}} of taste without a stimulus. These hallucinations, which are typically strange or unpleasant, are relatively common among individuals who have certain types of focal epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy. The regions of the brain responsible for <b>gustatory</b> hallucination in this case are the insula and the superior bank of the sylvian fissure.|$|E
25|$|Tied to VCM {{into the}} classic arcuate nucleus (in fact heterogeneous), it has neurons of an own type. Also, {{it does not}} receive lemniscal afferent and is thus {{not a part of}} VC. It {{receives}} axons from the nucleus of the solitary tract. Its thalamocortical neurons send axons to the primary <b>gustatory</b> area located in the opercule of the insula.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{analysis}} of saliva should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of taste receptors, including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor. Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry. Studies have shown that electron micrographs of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate pathological changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other <b>gustatory</b> disorders.|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} {{as early as}} 1895 {{reported}} that approximately 10% of the population experiences hallucinations. A 1996-1999 survey of over 13,000 people reported a much higher figure, with almost 39% of people reporting hallucinatory experiences, 27% of which daytime hallucinations, mostly outside the context of illness or drug use. From this survey, olfactory (smell) and <b>gustatory</b> (taste) hallucinations seem the most common in the general population.|$|E
25|$|Sensory cortices {{additionally}} share {{highly complex}} reciprocal {{connections with the}} orbitofrontal cortex. All sensory modalities are represented in connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, including extensive innervation from areas associated with olfaction and <b>gustatory</b> somatic responses. Somatosensory cortices including primary areas 1 and 2, particularly in areas associated with innervation of the hand and trigeminal complex, indicating {{the importance of the}} orbitofrontal cortex in face and hand sensation.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} function, the insula is {{believed}} to process convergent information to produce an emotionally relevant context for sensory experience. To be specific, the anterior insula is related more to olfactory, <b>gustatory,</b> vicero-autonomic, and limbic function, whereas the posterior insula is related more to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function. Functional imaging experiments have revealed that the insula has {{an important role in}} pain experience and the experience of a number of basic emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness.|$|E
25|$|Distortions in {{the taste}} buds may {{give rise to}} dysgeusia. In a study {{conducted}} by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the nucleus and cytoplasm of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of microvilli and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the <b>gustatory</b> pathway.|$|E
25|$|Chemoreception in {{crocodiles}} {{is especially}} interesting because they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings. Crocodiles {{have only one}} olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adults indicating all olfactory perception {{is limited to the}} olfactory system. Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. Crocodiles close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably <b>gustatory</b> and tactile.|$|E
25|$|Structural imaging is {{routinely}} used to investigate lesions in the taste pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging allows direct visualization of the cranial nerves. Furthermore, it provides significant {{information about the}} type and cause of a lesion. Analysis of mucosal blood flow in the oral cavity {{in combination with the}} assessment of autonomous cardiovascular factors appears to be useful in the diagnosis of autonomic nervous system disorders in burning mouth syndrome and in patients with inborn disorders, both of which are associated with <b>gustatory</b> dysfunction. Cell cultures may also be used when fungal or bacterial infections are suspected.|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} a muscular organ {{in the mouth}} of most {{vertebrates}} that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the <b>gustatory</b> system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.|$|E
25|$|The poet {{has used}} vibrant senses of human body to {{describe}} the majesty of the Hyderabadi traditional bazaar. Visual depiction is described {{by the use of}} lively colours such as silver, crimson, purple, amber, blue, azure, red and white. Aural depiction is created through the melody of the sitar, the sarangi, the drums and the chanting of the magical spells by the magicians. Olfactory senses are stimulated through the use of the fragrances describing sandalwood, henna and the smell of flowers. <b>Gustatory</b> depiction is created through the portrayal of the fruits like lemons, pomegranates, plums and principal Hyderabad food such as lentils and rice. In the last, the palpable imagery is produced by the bells made for the pigeons.|$|E
25|$|Other tests include {{identification}} or discrimination {{of common}} taste substances. Topical anesthesia {{of the tongue}} {{has been reported to}} be of use in the diagnosis of dysgeusia as well, since it has been shown to relieve the symptoms of dysgeusia temporarily. In addition to techniques based on the administration of chemicals to the tongue, electrogustometry is frequently used. It is based on the induction of <b>gustatory</b> sensations by means of an anodal electrical direct current. Patients usually report sour or metallic sensations similar to those associated with touching both poles of a live battery to the tongue. Although electrogustometry is widely used, {{there seems to be a}} poor correlation between electrically and chemically induced sensations.|$|E
25|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} {{are common in}} PD, generally associated with dopamine therapy. Symptoms of psychosis, or impaired reality testing, are either hallucinations, typically visual, less commonly auditory, and rarely in other domains including tactile, <b>gustatory,</b> or olfactory, or delusions, that is, irrational beliefs. Hallucinations are generally stereotyped and without emotional content. Initially, patients usually have insight so that the hallucinations are benign {{in terms of their}} immediate impact, but have poor prognostic implications, with increased risk of dementia, worsened psychotic symptoms, and mortality. Delusions occur in about 5-10% of treated patients, and are considerably more disruptive, being paranoid in nature, of spousal infidelity or family abandonment. Psychosis is an independent risk factor for nursing-home placement.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia, {{also known}} as dry mouth syndrome, can {{precipitate}} dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the <b>gustatory</b> pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, {{it has been observed}} that the areas responsible for urinary system and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.|$|E
25|$|The {{bitter taste}} is almost universally {{unpleasant}} to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules {{which have a}} pharmacological effect on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. It is also {{interesting to note that}} many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the <b>gustatory</b> system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate <b>gustatory</b> neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E
25|$|Every year, {{more than}} 200,000 {{individuals}} see their physicians concerning chemosensory problems, {{and many more}} taste disturbances are never reported. Due to {{the large number of}} persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country. These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in <b>gustatory</b> function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products. Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function. The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order {{to improve the lives of}} taste disorder sufferers.|$|E
500|$|The epithet of deterrimus is Latin, and {{was chosen}} by Gröger to {{highlight}} the poor <b>gustatory</b> properties of the mushroom, such as the bitter aftertaste and often heavy maggot infestations. The superlative of [...] "dēterior" [...] (meaning less good) means [...] "the worst, the poorest". The mushroom {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "false saffron milkcap".|$|E
500|$|Grasshoppers have {{a typical}} insect nervous system, {{and have an}} {{extensive}} set of external sense organs. On {{the side of the}} head are a pair of large compound eyes which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement, shape, colour and distance. There are also three simple eyes (ocelli) on the forehead which can detect light intensity, a pair of antennae containing olfactory (smell) and touch receptors, and mouthparts containing <b>gustatory</b> (taste) receptors. At the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organs for sound reception. There are numerous fine hairs (setae) covering the whole body that act as mechanoreceptors (touch and wind sensors), and these are most dense on the antennae, the palps (part of the mouth), and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen. There are special receptors (campaniform sensillae) embedded in the cuticle of the legs that sense pressure and cuticle distortion. There are internal [...] "chordotonal" [...] sense organs specialized to detect position and movement about the joints of the exoskeleton. The receptors convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neurons, and most of these have their cell bodies located in the periphery near the receptor site itself.|$|E
2500|$|Tongue-consciousness — tasting {{perceived}} {{through the}} <b>gustatory</b> organs ...|$|E
2500|$|Taste or {{gustation}} (adjectival form: <b>gustatory)</b> {{is one of}} {{the traditional}} five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the [...] "sense" [...] of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or <b>gustatory</b> calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five basic tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami. Other tastes such as calcium and free fatty acids may also be basic tastes but have yet to receive widespread acceptance. The inability to taste is called ageusia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a case of}} <b>gustatory</b> allochiria, a {{substance}} placed {{on one side of}} the tongue was said to have been tasted on the opposite side. [...] Also, touches on that side of the tongue were also referred to the opposite side. [...] In this type of allochiria, it is difficult to see how one can in this case dissociate the reference of taste from that of touch.|$|E
