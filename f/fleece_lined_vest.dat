5000|$|Cold Climate Jacket - <b>Fleece</b> <b>lined</b> {{often used}} in cold climates, or worn during {{overnight}} firefighting shifts if cold.|$|R
5000|$|The uniform {{consists}} of a bottle green v-neck jumper worn over a white open necked girls' blouse, with a calf-length green check skirt (green trousers are also an option) and a green rain-coat with a <b>fleece</b> <b>lining</b> bearing the schools crest. Shoes must be flat-soled and black.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} [...] "patrol uniform" [...] {{consisted of}} a grey-brown denim jacket for officers and chiefs while a grey all weather smock coat was worn by enlisted personnel. Some of the original U-boat uniforms had been issued from British stocks abandoned at Dunkirk. [...] U-boat personnel were also issued a variety of weather clothing to include <b>fleece</b> <b>lined</b> footwear and all weather over-trousers of brown or grey leather. After the war, information came to light that the U-boat crews had also been issued a special brand of hair yarn socks which had been made from the shaved hair of concentration camp inmates.|$|R
25|$|On 24 July 1854 {{parts of}} the <b>line</b> were <b>vested</b> with the Caledonian Railway; and final {{amalgamation}} occurred on 29 June 1865.|$|R
2500|$|On September 21, 2009, in {{his first}} and main dance for the season nine premiere episode, DeLay donned a sequined, leopard-print <b>lined</b> <b>vest</b> (as part of an outfit he called [...] "Elvis meets animal print") and put on {{orthopedic}} shoes (he sustained pre-stress fractures in his feet during training) to perform the cha-cha-cha (complete with air guitar, knee-sliding, finger-pointing, and hip and rear action galore) to The Troggs' 1966 hit song [...] "Wild Thing". (DeLay said [...] "Wild Thing" [...] was an apt description of him during his college days.) ...|$|R
50|$|Horse tie-up collar. A collar {{designed}} to teach horses to tie up and to tie stallions at public events. It is constructed from double-stitched wide leather (sometimes <b>fleece</b> <b>lined),</b> with heavy duty dees sewn into each end. The collar is placed on a horse just behind the poll strap of a headcollar (headstall) which is used in conjunction, and a strong rope passes through the headcollar to secure the two dees so that the horse's wind is not impaired in any way. This manner of application will {{reduce the likelihood of}} the collar slipping and injuring or choking the horse. Sometimes used for tethering horses, they are expensive and are potentially dangerous if the horse should become entangled in the tether or frightened etc.|$|R
5000|$|Although most of Brooks Brothers' {{clothing}} is imported, {{many of the}} firm's suits, sport coats, shirts, and some accessories are manufactured in the United States. Many of its mid-range [...] "1818" [...] line of suits are manufactured at Brooks Brothers' Southwick plant in Haverhill, Massachusetts. All Brooks Brothers necktie silk is woven in England or Italy, and the ties still are [...] "cut and piled" [...] at the Brooks Brothers' tie factory in Long Island City, New York; many of its shirts are manufactured at its shirt factory in Garland, North Carolina. Brooks also has a series of books on etiquette and manners for ladies and gentlemen. Its higher-end label is the Golden <b>Fleece</b> <b>line</b> which features suits that are tailored in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{line had}} been worked by the Great Western Railway from the outset, and on 1 July 1898 the <b>line</b> was <b>vested</b> in the GWR, the {{original}} Helston company being dissolved.|$|R
50|$|Opened on 15 August 1872 and is {{believed}} to have been worked with a locomotive on hire from the Great Western Railway.The <b>line</b> was <b>vested</b> into the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1883.Two locomotives were taken over.|$|R
60|$|An old farmer has {{assured me}} that he has also caught him tormenting his sheep, {{lighting}} on their backs and pulling the wool out by the roots to get <b>fleece</b> for <b>lining</b> his nest. This {{is a much more}} serious charge than that of pulling up corn, though the latter makes almost every farmer his enemy.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{entrance}} station (phone: 418-562-7006), the [...] "Société de gestion de la rivière Matane" [...] provides rental equipment for fly fishing, including: fly rod, boots, panties, silk, stockings <b>line,</b> fishing <b>vest</b> and glasses. In addition, the package provides ZEC River School for salmon fishing with qualified instructors {{appointed by the}} Sogerm.|$|R
50|$|Slipper boots - {{slippers}} {{meant to}} look like boots. Often favoured by women, they are typically furry boots with a <b>fleece</b> or soft <b>lining,</b> and a soft rubber sole. Modelled after sheepskin boots, they may be worn outside.|$|R
40|$|Merino sheep {{infested with}} lice (Bovicola ovis) and with 8 months 2 ̆ 7 wool were hand jetted with a {{commercial}} spinosad formulation or treated with an α-cypermethrin backline product {{to examine the}} effect of long wool treatment on lice numbers and wool damage, relative to untreated controls. Mean lice numbers were reduced significantly (P < 0. 05) by treatment and then remained relatively constant until shearing 20 weeks later. Treatment with either product resulted in significant improvements in mean clean and greasy wool cut, yield, staple length, both visually assessed and measured colour, and the proportion of fleeces classed into the main <b>fleece</b> <b>line.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the two treatments in either efficacy in reducing louse numbers or on production characters. Wool rub score and cotting assessed on the sheep increased slightly after treatment and then did not change until shearing whereas both scores increased significantly in the untreated group. There was a strong relationship between the visual rub score and the loss of wool at shearing, indicating that rub score can be a good predictor of lice-induced reduction in fleece weights...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1871 {{the matter}} was raised again and an offer to {{purchase}} was made: £3,515 of GWR 5% preference stock would {{be transferred to the}} W&WR shareholders, as well as £16,750 cash. The transfer was made and on 2 December 1871 the <b>line</b> was <b>vested</b> in the GWR. (The Act of Parliament ratifying the transfer was made on 18 July 1872.) ...|$|R
50|$|The LNWR was amalgamated {{into the}} London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) on 1 January 1923. The LMSR {{continued}} {{to operate the}} passenger train service through Dunham Massey, but by July 1946 only eight trains per day in each direction stopped at the station. The LMSR was nationalised on 1 January 1948 and operations on the <b>line</b> were <b>vested</b> in British Railways London Midland Region (LMR).|$|R
5000|$|Makosinski {{appeared}} on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon twice on the GE Fallonventions segment to demonstrate her inventions. In 2014, she was named one of TIME magazine's 30 Under 30. In 2017 she was named one of Forbes 30 under 30. As of October 2015, Makosinski has been featured as the global ambassador for the Uniqlo <b>Fleece</b> product <b>line</b> that highlights the similar harvesting of thermal energy in the Uniqlo product and the [...] "Hollow Flashlight." [...] She is currently a second year student at the University of British Columbia.|$|R
500|$|Relations {{between the}} two {{companies}} were, therefore, not entirely amicable. [...] In 1853 the ELR made further proposals for a new line from Clifton to Salford, roughly parallel to the L line, however in 1854 an agreement {{between the two}} companies meant that the Clifton Junction to Salford <b>line</b> was <b>vested</b> jointly in both companies. [...] Amalgamation had been discussed since the early 1850s and in 1859, {{by an act of}} parliament, the ELR was absorbed by the L ...|$|R
50|$|After M'ba's {{accession}} to power, {{the press was}} suppressed, political demonstrations banned, freedom of expression curtailed, other political parties gradually excluded from power, and the Constitution changed along French <b>lines</b> to <b>vest</b> power in the Presidency, a post that M'ba assumed himself. However, when M'ba dissolved the National Assembly in January 1964 to institute one-party rule, an army coup sought to oust him from power and restore parliamentary democracy. French paratroopers flew in within 24 hours to restore M'ba to power.|$|R
25|$|Much of the Port Chalmers line is {{now part}} of the Main South Line from Christchurch to Dunedin. When the first section of the main line, from Dunedin to Waitati, opened in December 1877 a {{junction}} was established at Sawyers Bay. The section from Dunedin to Sawyers Bay became part of the Main South Line, while the remaining two kilometres to Port Chalmers became the Port Chalmers Branch. In 1880 the <b>line</b> was <b>vested</b> in the newly established New Zealand Railways Department, and the private company dissolved.|$|R
50|$|After being {{controlled}} by the Great Western Railway from the Railways Act 1921, and then British Railways Western division from nationalisation in 1946 onwards, the former CR <b>lines</b> were <b>vested</b> to the London Midland Region of British Railways from 1963. The LMR saw no point in keeping two competing Chester/Shrewsbury to Hereford/Newport lines in operation, and so decided to keep the faster Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway route open, and close the CR mainline from Llynclys junction south to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), on 18 January 1965.|$|R

30|$|Due {{to their}} {{positive}} characteristics, like strength increasing and film generating features, {{they are more}} and more used for various purposes as additives in the paper industry [12, 21, 22]. Currently, the application of nanocellulose [BNC, NFC, and CNC (cellulose nanocrystals)] in paper conservation is increasing quickly, and approaches vary considerably. Santos et al. used BNC sheets prepared as <b>fleeces</b> for <b>lining</b> or reinforcing papers [23, 24]. A novel type of mending paper of BNC fibres and Japanese fibres was developed by Segers et al. [25]. Because of the special surface characteristics, it is well-suited for transparent or coated papers, as well as parchment, and can be used to stabilize or to fill losses [25].|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, some car coats were being {{designed}} in nylon, {{a report from}} the British Nylon Spinners' Fair in London in 1961 described a new washable mock suede car coat with brushed <b>fleece</b> nylon <b>lining</b> as: [...] "one of the good possibilities" [...] of the technology. Real leathers remained popular - showerproof suede models with detachable collars and large leather buttons were being designed for women by 1964. These were also in the shorter length, ending at mid thigh. Another new motoring design was the roebuck suede (deerskin) jacket, designed at hip length for both women and men, and described as a real innovation because: [...] "A suede upon which grease, alcohol, even motor oil has no effect is a find indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the tragedy}} began. Several of the villains seized the first merchant, and, {{stopping}} his cries and protestations with a blow in the mouth, stripped {{him to the}} shirt, abstracting notes and gold and everything else of value that they could find in various portions of his attire where he had hidden them, and principally, I remember, from the <b>lining</b> of his <b>vest.</b> When they had done with him, they dragged him away and bundled him roughly into the diligence.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a saying}} that no man has tasted the full flavour of life {{until he has}} known poverty, love and war. The justness of this {{reflection}} commends it to the lover of condensed philosophy. The three conditions embrace about all there is in life worth knowing. A surface thinker might deem that wealth should {{be added to the}} list. Not so. When a poor man finds a long-hidden quarter-dollar that has slipped through a rip into his <b>vest</b> <b>lining,</b> he sounds the pleasure of life with a deeper plummet than any millionaire can hope to cast.|$|R
40|$|The Information Technology (IT) {{governance}} arrangements {{refer to the}} patterns of authority for key IT activities in organizations, including IT infrastructure, IT use, and project management. During the last 20 years, three primary modes of IT governance have become prevalent: centralized, decentralized, and the federal mode. These modes vary in {{the extent to which}} corporate Information System (IS), divisional IS, and <b>line</b> management is <b>vested</b> with authority for the key IT activities. In order to making integrity in information systems, reducing redundancy of information in organizations, managing of information security and IT services, and standardizing of software producing, a suitable framework for organizations is needed. Thus, this study investigates to comparison the IT governance tools and males solutions which helps an organization in selection of the best IT Governance tools fit to its structure...|$|R
