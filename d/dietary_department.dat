Outside the school are the district's baseball fields, softball fields, and tennis courts. In 2011, a $41 Million Dollar addition/renovation project took place within several phases. Phases 1 and 2 included renovating and moving the current library, replacing the entire physical plant, which one of two boilers from the original building were out of service, construction of school administrative offices as well as band classrooms, {{all of which were}} completed in the spring of 2012. The next phase included demolition and reconstruction of general classrooms, which students at the time were displaced during this phase. During the summer recess of 2012, the <b>dietary</b> <b>department</b> was renovated into a food-court type setting, giving students more food choices.On September 4, 2012, with the closing of Junior High West, the district's ninth-graders began attending the Senior High, making it a Grade 9-12 facility. Also completed at this time was a new science addition as well as technological capabilities, including surround sound within the classrooms. In December 2012, in cooperation with the schools Patriots' Organization, a 4-ton piece of steel from the World Trade Center in New York from the September 11, 2001 attacks, was placed in the school's auditorium lobby.

40|$|This {{investigation}} is concerned mainly {{with the various}} types of food services distribution systems, with particular reference to a centralized hospital <b>dietary</b> <b>department.</b> The purpose of this {{investigation is}} to find a food service for patients which most nearly meets the needs necessary for a good food service in hospitals ranging in size from 150 - 300 beds. The hospital administrator and the chief dietitian at Lincoln General Hospital felt a need to study and perhaps contemplate a change in the type of food service system in use because of the present high labor cost of the decentralized service. This study includes an investigation of the methods of food transportation used in centralized services, and the adaptability of the plan to the kitchen area and layout at Lincoln General Hospital. The hope of the writer is to affect a more economical operation of the <b>dietary</b> <b>department</b> through changes in layout, equipment and method of services without affecting the high standard of food service. Letters were written to fifty-two manufacturers of equipment used for transporting trays to patients, which were listed in Hospital Management magazine for November 1956. After studying the material received, more consideration was directed to the hot-cold cart type of food conveyor. As a follow-up, a detailed specification questionnaire on hot-cold carts was sent to ten of these manufacturers, requesting information on carts having capacity for twenty trays and having a self-contained compressor. The data from the specification questionnaire were tabulated according to statements of quality, capacity, and price of the food conveyor carts. A hospital using the hot-cold cart system of food transportation was visited in order to see the system in operation. One day was spent observing the cold tray set-ups, the method of serving the hot food, and the final assembly in the patient’s area. Advisor: Florence C. Smit...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{departments}} in most hospitals today is the <b>dietary</b> <b>department.</b> Traditionally, this department, especially if in a large hospital, has been administered by a dietitian {{who was a member}} of the American Dietetic Association. Recently, however, many factors have influenced hospital administrators to turn to food service companies for the directors of their <b>dietary</b> <b>department.</b> Examples of these factors are increased cost of equipment, food, and facilities; labor shortages; technical innovations; convenience food systems; the shortage of dietitians willing to assume managerial positions; and the inability of some of those who have. Because of these factors, dietitians are being challenged either to become more effective administrators or to retire completely from management positions and serve only in therapeutic positions. The objective of this study was to investigate how hospital administrators and chief hospital dietitians perceived personal characteristics and managerial skills of the chief hospital dietitian. Although the hospital administrators and the chief hospital dietitians perceived many of the skills and characteristics studied similarly, wide differences did exist in their perception of the importance of some of them, as well as among the perceptions of individual hospital administrators concerning a particular characteristic or skill. If the chief hospital dietitian is to be successful, she must know her functions and be able to perform them well, but also, she must know her hospital administrator and his perception of her functions. Each hospital administrator will perceive her functions differently. Good communication must exist between the two if the chief dietitian is to know what her administrator expects and be able to meet his expectations. One of the secrets of success for a chief hospital dietitian is for her to know her administrator. Advisor: Marie E. Knickreh...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of paediatric obesity {{is high in}} most countries. Added to this, the degree of paediatric obesity {{is also on the}} rise. It is however to be noted that although the psychological causes of the problem are well known, they remain difficult to assess. Facing the great number of adolescents suffering from severe obesity, who are looking for treatment and failing to find one, this survey aims at facts-finding and analyses of the psychological and psychopathological origin and associated severity of obesity, and of the parameters that can lead to a successful treatment. Methods: This survey has been carried out among 125 adolescents suffering from grade 2 obesity. To lose weight, the adolescents were treated during 1 year at the boarding <b>dietary</b> <b>department</b> of the "Institut Médical Pédiatrique Clairs-Vallons" in Belgium. The evaluation consists in a type CFTMEA-R- 2000 psychopathological diagnosis including previous traumatic factors, taking into consideration the information regarding weight, weight evolution over one year and a quality assessment of the compliance of the patient with the treatment. These data have been submitted to the SPADN statistical program in order to carry out an analysis taking into account the various connections. Results: Our results have underlined that the severity of the obesity in our population can be coupled with pathological family environment factors such as mental illness, care deficiencies, child abuse and, as a result, the presence of a psychopathological diagnosis. The same can be said in cases of lesser compliance with the treatment by the patient and his family, although in the short term the weight loss is greater. Likewise, a less severe obesity and a better compliance with the treatment can be coupled with the absence of both psychopathological diagnosis and pathological family environment. Conclusion: In our sample population, the psychological and psychopathological factors tend to be linked with a more severe obesity, and less good compliance with the treatment on both individual and family accounts. As a result, obesity could be considered as a way for the patient to adapt him/herself or compensate in front of traumatic family experiences. The isolation from the family seems therefore indispensable for any change in the adolescent, but then raises the problem of long term care after hospitalisation. If obesity is an adaptation process, the loss of weight could then have deeper psychological implications, implying a more complex follow-up of the patient. © 2011 LEncéphale, Paris.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to assess hospital foodservice quality and to identify causes of quality problems and improvement strategies. Based on the review of literature, hospital foodservice quality was defined and the Hospital Foodservice Quality model was presented. The study was conducted in two steps. In Step 1, nutritional standards specified on diet manuals and nutrients of planned menus, served meals, and consumed meals for regular, diabetic, and low-sodium diets were assessed in three general hospitals. Quality problems were found in all three hospitals since patients consumed less than their nutritional requirements. Considering the effects of four gaps in the Hospital Foodservice Quality model, Gaps 3 and 4 were selected as critical control points (CCPs) for hospital foodservice quality management. In Step 2, the causes of the gaps and improvement strategies at CCPs were labeled as "quality hazards" and "corrective actions", respectively and were identified using a case study. At Gap 3, inaccurate forecasting and a lack of control during production were identified as quality hazards and corrective actions proposed were establishing an accurate forecasting system, improving standardized recipes, emphasizing the use of standardized recipes, and conducting employee training. At Gap 4, quality hazards were menus of low preferences, inconsistency of menu quality, a lack of menu variety, improper food temperatures, and patients' lack of understanding of their nutritional requirements. To reduce Gap 4, the <b>dietary</b> <b>departments</b> should conduct patient surveys on menu preferences on a regular basis, develop new menus, especially for therapeutic diets, maintain food temperatures during distribution, provide more choices, conduct meal rounds, and provide nutrition education and counseling. The Hospital Foodservice Quality Model was a useful tool for identifying causes of the foodservice quality problems and improvement strategies from a holistic point of view...|$|R

However, the benefits of antioxidant-rich foods have not been reproduced in supplementation trials with pure antioxidants.

In this paper, evidence for {{the health benefits of}} antioxidant-rich foods and methods to increase the antioxidant content and bioavailability of food antioxidants are reviewed briefly, and the concept that increased food antioxidant content/intake per se is beneficial is examined from a cautionary perspective, considering issues of low bioavailability, rapid catabolism, biotransformation and the paradoxical pro-oxidant effects of <b>dietary</b> antioxidants. <b>Department</b> of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{antioxidant}} intake {{requires a}} food antioxidant database. However, cooking may affect antioxidant content due to antioxidant release, destruction or creation of redox-active metabolites. Here, effects of boiling, steaming and microwaving of broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and choy-sum (Chinese cabbage) were explored by measuring antioxidant contents of raw and cooked vegetables. Cooking water was also tested. For all cooked vegetables, antioxidant content was highest in steamed > boiled > microwaved, and decreased with longer cooking time, regardless of method. All steamed vegetables had higher antioxidant contents than had matching raw vegetables. Effects were variable for boiling and microwaving. Microwaving caused greater antioxidant loss into cooking water than did boiling. Marked losses of anitoxidants occurred in microwaved cabbage and spinach.

Piceatannol supplement significantly lowered the total cholesterols, low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the atherogenic index {{as compared to}} the HFD model which only have increased dietary cholesterol intake. Using untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomic platforms, multivariate statistics revealed that HFD significantly perturbed fatty acids, lysophospholipids, bile acids and conjugated bile acids. Reduced CYP 7 A 1 protein expression and increase in glycocholate and taurodeoxycholate after piceatannol treatment suggested the conjugated bile acid might contribute to the cholesterol-lowering effect. For lipid profiles, lysoPC (20 : 2) and lysoPC (20 : 0) were decreased while the ratio of esterified arachidonic acid to esterified dihomo-γ linoleic acid was up-regulated for rats after piceatannol supplement.

In this study, wooden-tip electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (WT-ESI-MS) was developed for rapid detection of adulterated drugs in three categories of herbal dietary supplements, namely tranquilizer, aphrodisiac and weight-loss products. Samples were directly taken by using pre-wetted wooden tips and analyzed by WT-ESI-MS, with the drug identities confirmed by MS/MS spectra. Furthermore, a high-throughput WT-ESI-MS method was developed to allow automated WT-ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis of herbal dietary supplement samples with an analysis speed of similar to 15 seconds per sample. The limits of detection of typical drugs were found to be at the ng g(- 1) level using the WT-ESI-MS method.

40|$|Regular {{consumption}} of adequate amounts {{of fruits and}} vegetables may be protective against chronic disease such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and some cancers. Inadequate {{consumption of}} fruit and vegetables is a major risk factor contributing to 1. 8 % of the worldwide burden of disease, with Australian estimates at 2. 7 %. Dietary guidelines encourage eating patterns {{to reduce the risk of}} diet-related disease and improve population well being. They provide the context for most nutrition education initiatives. Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is a core component of most dietary guidelines. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agricultural Organization asked nations to conduct targeted campaigns to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables. Effective health communications have the capacity to increase awareness and knowledge and induce long-term changes in individual and social behaviours. There is a lack of published information about population-based interventions promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. In addition, information about the factors influencing fruit and vegetable consumption is required to assist the development of effective interventions to promote increased consumption. Demographic, individual, and environmental factors are associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. The Department of Health in Western Australia aimed to increase the prevalence of healthy eating habits consistent with Australian <b>Dietary</b> Guidelines. The <b>Department</b> developed and implemented the Go for 2 & 5 ® population based campaign to increase awareness of the need to eat more fruit and vegetable consumption between 2002 and 2005. Effective fruit and vegetables communication campaigns reach the target audience via a number of pathways including point-of-sale promotions developed by industry partners. Health professionals, industry and consumers need resources to assist food selection. Specific nutrition and recipe criteria consistent with Australian Dietary Guidelines were developed to assist industry to conduct Go for 2 & 5 ® promotions at point-of-sale. Attitudes, beliefs and behaviours relating to fruit and vegetable intake were monitored with the 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004 Nutrition Monitoring Surveys (NMS), the Health & Wellbeing Surveillance System (HWSS) from 2001 to 2006, and the Campaign Tracking Surveys (CTS) from 2002 to 2006. Analysis of the CTS and the HWSS found that the Go for 2 & 5 ® campaign was successful in reaching the target audience and increased awareness of the recommended serves of fruit and vegetables. There was a 0. 8 serve population net increase in the mean number of serves of fruit and vegetables per day over three years (0. 2 for fruit (1. 6 in 2002 to 1. 8 in 2005) and 0. 6 for vegetables (2. 6 in 2002 to 3. 2 in 2005)) significant at (p< 0. 05)). Social marketing campaigns are an effective method to increase awareness of dietary recommendations and to motivate dietary behaviour change. Monitoring changes over time showed the importance of implementing social marketing campaigns over an extended period so that incremental growth in knowledge, intentions and behaviour can occur and be maintained. Analysis of the NMS observed changes in knowledge, attitudes and some behaviours relating to fruit and vegetable intake between 1995 and 2004. In 2004, respondents were more likely to report two servings of fruit/day (OR 3. 66, 95 % CI= 2. 85, 4. 70) and five servings of vegetables/day (OR 4. 50, 95 % CI= 3. 49, 5. 80) as optimum compared to 1995. However, vegetable consumption (in cups) in 2004 remained less than in 1995 (RR= 0. 88, 95 % CI= 0. 82 to 0. 96, p= 0. 003). Perceived adequacy of vegetable (59. 3 %) or fruit (34. 5 %) intake, and insufficient time for vegetable preparation (14. 3 %) remained the main barriers to a healthy diet. A population based nutrition campaign intervention based on the fruit and vegetable dietary guideline message was associated with changes in knowledge, attitudes and some behaviours relating to fruit and vegetable consumption in Western Australian adults.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, the {{percentage}} of the US population that is overweight and obese has increased significantly, with nearly 70 % of American adults now overweight or obese (National Center for Health Statistics, 2013). The American Medical Association officially recognized obesity as a disease (American Medical Association, 2013) that afflicts approximately {{one out of every three}} adults in the US (National Center for Health Statistics, 2013). While the health implications of being overweight or obese are well established, the environmental impacts have not received equal attention. In light of this inattention, this dissertation analyzes the effects of the overweight and obese population on energy use, water withdrawals, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and fuel costs through the US food supply system and transportation system. The first empirical chapter investigates the impacts of current US food consumption on energy use, water withdrawals, and GHG emissions. The purpose of this analysis is twofold: first, two top-down approaches are used to establish a range of life-cycle industrial energy use, water withdrawals, and GHG emissions in the US food supply system that are attributed to total food consumed by the US adult population. The two methods utilized are 1) economic input-output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) and 2) process-based analysis. Second, the additional industrial energy use, water withdrawals, and GHG emissions required to support the extra Caloric intake of the US overweight and obese adult population are estimated. Extra Caloric intake estimates are developed using anthropometric data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In 2012, 6. 1 - 6. 2 million TJ of cumulative energy use, 100 - 105 billion m 3 of water withdrawals, and 600 million metric tons (MMT) CO 2 -eq were needed to provide food to the US adult population. Furthermore, 8 - 10 % of total Caloric intake of adults were extra Calories consumed from overeating for overweight and obese adults. Providing these additional Calories resulted in 440, 000 - 610, 000 TJ of energy use, 7 - 10 billion m 3 of water withdrawals, and 43 - 59 MMT CO 2 -eq. The second empirical chapter uses a bottom-up approach to measure the changes in energy use, water withdrawals, and GHG emissions associated with shifting from current US food consumption patterns to three dietary scenarios, which are based, in part, on the 2010 USDA <b>Dietary</b> Guidelines (US <b>Department</b> of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services 2010). Amidst the current overweight and obesity epidemic in the US, the Dietary Guidelines provide food and beverage recommendations that are intended to help individuals achieve and maintain healthy weight. The three dietary scenarios examined include 1) reducing Caloric intake levels to achieve “normal” weight without shifting food mix, 2) switching current food mix to USDA recommended food patterns, without reducing Caloric intake, and 3) reducing Caloric intake levels and shifting current food mix to USDA recommended food patterns, which support healthy weight. This analysis finds that shifting from the current US diet to dietary Scenario 1, decreases energy use, water withdrawals, and GHG emissions by around 8. 5 %, while shifting to dietary Scenario 2 increases energy use by 48 %, water withdrawals by 22 %, and GHG emissions by 13 %. Shifting to dietary Scenario 3, which accounts for both reduced Caloric intake and a shift to the USDA recommended food mix increases energy use by 39 %, water withdrawals by 13 %, and GHG emissions by 6 %. The third empirical chapter analyzes the transportation industry to determine the amount of additional fuel use, GHG emissions, and fuel costs that are attributed to excess passenger weight in light-duty vehicles, transit vehicles, and passenger aircraft in the US from 1970 to 2010. Using driving and passenger information in the US and historical anthropometric data, it is estimated that since 1970 over 205 billion additional liters of fuel were consumed to support the extra weight of the American population. This is equivalent to 1. 1 % of total fuel use for transportation systems in the United States. Also, excess passenger weight results in an extra 503 MMT CO 2 -eq and $ 103 billion of additional fuel cost over the last four decades. If overweight and obesity rates continue to increase at its current pace, cumulative excess fuel use could increase by 460 billion liters over the next 50 years, resulting in an extra 1. 1 billion metric tons CO 2 -eq and $ 200 billion of additional fuel costs by the year 2060...|$|R
