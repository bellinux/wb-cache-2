40|$|The {{characterization}} of the reactive thiolester bond in the third component of human complement {{has led to the}} identification of homologous sites in a number of proteins. In addition to the participation of the C 3 thiolester in the opsonic acylation of surface components of microorganisms, new evidence is emerging to implicate thiolester disrup-tion by physiologic nudeophiles, such as ammonia, as a potent mediator of local inflam-mation in the lung, the kidney, and at endothelial surfaces. Manipulation of the thiolester bonds in these related proteins should permit us to understand, and ultimately to direct, the molecular mechanisms of inflammation. The {{characterization of}} the reactive thiolester bond in the third component of human complement [1] unified our concepts of structure and function for this protein and marked an important contribution {{to our understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms of infection and inflammation. After the <b>initial</b> re-port by <b>Tack</b> and colleagues [1), thiolester bonds o...|$|R
