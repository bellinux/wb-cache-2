500|$|Two RNA genomes are <b>encapsidated</b> in each HIV-1 {{particle}} (see Structure and genome of HIV). Upon {{infection and}} replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination {{between the two}} genomes can occur. Recombination occurs as the single-strand (+)RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During reverse transcription the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome. [...] From 2 to 20 events per genome may occur at each replication cycle, and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.|$|E

40|$|The {{specificity}} and quantitation of {{the rescue}} of RNA sequences by mammalian type C viruses has been investigated. Type C viruses can package with specificity only type C viral RNA. Type C viruses do not <b>encapsidate</b> with comparable efficiency either type B viral or cellular globin mRNA. Conversely, a non-type C mammalian retravirus, MP-MV, cannot <b>encapsidate</b> type C RNA. A revertant of Kirsten sarcoma virus (Ki-SV) -transformed nonproducer cells which fails to rescue biologically active Ki-SV after superinfection with helper virus had no detectable intracellular Ki-SV -specific RNA. The results suggest specific mechanisms by which type C viral proteins can package type C viral RNA and provide an approach to classifying RNA of potentially defective endogenous retraviruses as type C in origin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRabies virus {{nucleoprotein}} (N) <b>encapsidates</b> negative-strand genomic RNAin vivo,and this RNA–N complex, {{together with}} the nominal viral phosphoprotein (P) and RNA polymerase (L), forms the active cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex in virus-infected cells and the RNP core in virus particles. The RNP complex is capable of initiating viral RNA transcription and replicationin vivoandin vitro. To obtain insight into the events leading {{to the formation of}} the RNA–N complex, we have investigated the interaction between rabies virus N and the positive-strand leader RNA transcript. Binding studies revealed that recombinant N binds preferentially to rabies virus leader RNA and that N binding to leader RNA was 5 to 10 times stronger than to nonleader RNA. Encapsidation of leader RNA by N could be competetively inhibited by unlabeled leader RNA but not by nonleader RNA. Furthermore, N protein encapsidation of nonleader RNA but not the leader RNA was inhibited when P was simultaneously added into the encapsidation reaction, indicating that P helps confer the specificity of leader RNA encapsidation by N. The initiation signal for leader RNA encapsidation by N has been mapped to nucleotides 20 – 30 of the RNA sequence which is A rich. Studies with N-deletion mutants indicate that the intact N is required to <b>encapsidate</b> RNA, since deletion of amino acid residues from either the N- or the C-terminus of N abolishes the ability of N to <b>encapsidate</b> leader RNA...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{nucleoprotein}} (N) of {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus (VSV) plays {{a central role}} in transcription and replication by <b>encapsidating</b> genome RNA to form a nucleocapsid as the template for the RNA synthesis. Using minigenome system we evaluated the roles of 21 amino acids of the N-terminal arm of N in forming functional N–RNA templates and found that three triple-amino-acid substitutions (TVK 4 - 6 A 3, RII 7 - 9 A 3, and VIV 13 - 15 A 3) and one single-amino-acid substitution (R 7 A) resulted in RNA synthesis loss. But all the mutants maintain the ability to oligomerize N, interact with P, and <b>encapsidate</b> viral RNA for template formation. Further analysis showed that the nucleocapsid formed by these mutants failed to protect RNA from nuclease digestion. Then, we found that only recombinant viruses containing R 7 A could be recovered. Our results show that the several amino acids within the N-terminal arm of N contribute to the template function beyond its role in RNA encapsidation and viral growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{cytidine}} deaminases, including APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) and A 3 F, {{are part}} of a cellular defense system against retroviruses and retroelements including non-LTR retrotransposons LINE- 1 (L 1) and Alu. Expression of cellular A 3 proteins is sufficient for inhibition of L 1 and Alu retrotransposition, but the effect of A 3 proteins transferred in exosomes on retroelement mobilization is unknown. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} exosomes secreted by CD 4 +H 9  T cells and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells <b>encapsidate</b> A 3 G and A 3 F and inhibit L 1 and Alu retrotransposition. A 3 G is the major contributor to the inhibitory activity of exosomes, however, the contribution of A 3 F in H 9 exosomes cannot be excluded. Additionally, we show that exosomes <b>encapsidate</b> mRNAs coding for A 3 proteins. A 3 G mRNA, and less so A 3 F, was enriched in exosomes secreted by H 9 cells. Exosomal A 3 G mRNA was functional in vitro. Whether exosomes inhibit retrotransposons in vivo requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Under many {{in vitro}} conditions, some small viruses spontaneously <b>encapsidate</b> a single {{stranded}} (ss) RNA into a protein shell called the capsid. While viral RNAs {{are found to}} be compact and highly branched because of long distance base-pairing between nucleotides, recent experiments reveal that in a head-to-head competition between a ssRNA with no secondary or higher order structure and a viral RNA, the capsid proteins preferentially encapsulate the linear polymer! In this paper, we study the impact of genome stiffness on the encapsidation free energy of the complex of RNA and capsid proteins. We show that an increase in effective chain stiffness because of base-pairing could be the reason why under certain conditions linear chains have an advantage over branched chains when it comes to encapsidation efficiency. While branching makes the genome more compact, RNA base-pairing increases the effective Kuhn length of the RNA molecule, which could result in an increase of the free energy of RNA confinement, that is, the work required to <b>encapsidate</b> RNA, and thus less efficient packaging...|$|R

50|$|Expression of {{the late}} genes results in {{accumulation}} of the viral capsid proteins in the host cell cytoplasm. Capsid components enter the nucleus in order to encapsidate new viral genomic DNA. New virions may be assembled in viral factories. The mechanism of viral release from the host cell varies among polyomaviruses; some express proteins that facilitate cell exit, such as the agnoprotein or VP4. In some cases high levels of <b>encapsidated</b> virus result in cell lysis, releasing the virions.|$|E

40|$|LuIII is an {{autonomous}} parvovirus which <b>encapsidates</b> either strand of its genome with similar efficiency in NB 324 K cells. Two parvoviruses {{closely related to}} LuIII, minute virus of mice (MVM) and H- 1 virus, <b>encapsidate</b> primarily the minus strand of their genome when grown in the same cell type. It has been postulated that an AT-rich region unique to LuIII is responsible for symmetric encapsidation of plus- and minus-strand genomes by LuIII. To address this hypothesis, recombinant LuIII-luciferase genomes containing or lacking the AT-rich sequence (AT) were packaged into LuIII virions. Hybridization of strand-specific probes to DNA from these virions revealed that either strand of the genome was packaged regardless {{of the presence of}} AT. In addition, encapsidation of both strands of the AT+ LuIII-luciferase genome into MVM and H- 1 virions was observed, suggesting that MVM and H- 1 viral proteins are not responsible for the minus-strand packaging bias of these two viruses. Alignment of the published LuIII and MVMp sequences shows that AT exists as an insertion into an element that, in MVM, binds cellular proteins. We suggest that in LuIII, AT disrupts binding of these cellular proteins, allowing encapsidation of either strand...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFilamentous virions of Beet yellows virus {{contain a}} long body formed {{by a major}} capsid protein and a short tail that is {{assembled}} by a minor capsid protein (CPm), an Hsp 70 -homolog (Hsp 70 h), a 64 -kDa protein (p 64), and a 20 -kDa protein (p 20). Using mutation analysis and newly developed in planta assays, here we investigate the genetic requirements for the tail assembly. We show that the inactivation of CPm dramatically reduces incorporation of both Hsp 70 h and p 64. Furthermore, inactivation of Hsp 70 h prevents incorporation of p 64 into virions and vice versa. Hsp 70 h and p 64 are each required for efficient incorporation of CPm. We also show that the tails possessing normal relative amounts of CPm, Hsp 70 h, and p 64 can be formed {{in the absence of}} the major capsid protein and p 20. Similar to the tails isolated from the wild-type virions, these mutant tails <b>encapsidate</b> the ∼ 700  nt-long, 5 ′-terminal segments of the viral RNA. Taken together, our results imply that CPm, Hsp 70 h and p 64 act cooperatively to <b>encapsidate</b> a defined region of the closterovirus genome...|$|R
