40|$|A view of {{manufacturing}} processes {{is presented in}} which five distinct categories are defined as casting, deformation, machining, joining, and solid <b>freeforming.</b> Solid <b>freeforming</b> is essentially biomimetic and shares problems of morphogenesis with natural processes. Our team in University of London has been exploring three mechanisms of solid <b>freeforming.</b> In dry powder deposition and direct ink-jet printing, the emphasis has turned {{to the problem of}} delivering a complex shape in which the three dimensional spatial arrangement of composition is delivered from the design file. In extrusion <b>freeforming,</b> the aim is to control microstructure at hierarchical levels also from the design file. The quest for 3 -D functional gradients is satisfied by acoustic and ultrasonic dispensing and mixing of powders so that each layer can be patterned. These methods could be extended to deliver the complex patterns demanded by left-handed microwave metamaterials. Dry powder deposition and direct ink-jet printing are turning towards combinatorial methods in which multiple sample libraries are used to accelerate discovery. In turn, this paves the way for [`]autonomous research machines' which steer their own search refinements in response to our requests for new materials. In this way, solid <b>freeforming</b> used for sample preparation can give an [`]arm' to an intelligent machine so that it can conduct its own experimentation and learning; an idea that originated with Alan Turing in the late 1940 s...|$|R

5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring <b>freeform</b> samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
