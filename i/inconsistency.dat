40|$|While {{developing}} complex systems, software engineers {{generally have}} to deal with various kinds of <b>inconsistencies.</b> Certain kinds of <b>inconsistencies</b> are inevitable, for instance, in case of multiple persons working independently of each other within the same project. Some <b>inconsistencies</b> are desirable when, for instance, alternative solutions exist for the same problem, and these solutions have to be preserved to allow further refinements along the development process. Current software development methods do not provide adequate means to model the desired <b>inconsistencies</b> and, therefore, aim to resolve the <b>inconsistencies</b> whenever they are detected. Although early resolution of <b>inconsistencies</b> reduces complexity of design by eliminating possible alternatives, it results in loss of information and excessive restriction of the design space.

5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data. In the case of an <b>inconsistency</b> between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data.

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent <b>inconsistency</b> {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant <b>inconsistency</b> in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for <b>inconsistency</b> in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA typical way of {{managing}} the inherent complexity of contemporary technical systems is to study them from different viewpoints. Such viewpoints are defined {{by a variety of}} factors, including the concerns of interest, level of abstraction, observers and context. Views conforming to these viewpoints are typically highly interrelated since the concerns addressed in the different viewpoints overlap semantically. Such overlaps can lead to <b>inconsistencies.</b> The challenge is to identify and resolve – that is, manage – such <b>inconsistencies.</b> This paper introduces an approach to identifying <b>inconsistencies</b> within the context of Model- Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In current practice, <b>inconsistencies</b> are typically only discovered after long time intervals, e. g., during reviews. This can result in costly rework or even mission failure. Therefore, actively checking for <b>inconsistencies,</b> and doing so in a continuous fashion, can be valuable. We investigate the hypothesis that all models can be represented by graphs and that <b>inconsistencies</b> can be identified by means of pattern matching. We show that this process is equivalent to inferring <b>inconsistencies</b> by means of deductive reasoning. Finally, we present the results of a proof-of-concept implementation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{points out}} some <b>inconsistencies</b> in {{appraisal}} practice stemming, in some cases, from <b>inconsistencies</b> in underlying theory, {{and in some}} cases from applications that are inconsistent with theory. The identification of <b>inconsistencies</b> in appraisal practice is not meant to be a wholesale attack on traditional appraisal approaches. Quite the contrary; the <b>inconsistencies</b> are identified with the premise that their correction would strengthen these procedures. The corollary is, of course, that their continued occurrences weaken appraisal and the appraisal function.

These viewpoints are defined by a variety of factors, including the concerns of interest, level of abstraction, observers and context. Views conforming to these viewpoints are highly interrelated due to the concerns addressed overlapping. These interrelations and overlaps can lead to <b>inconsistencies.</b> The challenge is to identify and resolve - that is, manage - such <b>inconsistencies.</b> This paper introduces an approach to managing <b>inconsistencies</b> within the context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In current practice, the management of <b>inconsistencies</b> relies on ad-hoc methods and infrequently conducted activities such as reviews. The result of this practice is that decisions are often made based on inconsistent information, which can lead to costly rework or even mission failure. Therefore, assisting humans by means of a computational method that can continuously identify and aid in resolving <b>inconsistencies</b> adds significant value. In the paper, the hypothesis that pattern matching can serve as a generic means of identifying <b>inconsistencies</b> is investigated.

The paper concludes that using patterns to manage <b>inconsistencies</b> can be very effective and accurate, but it may also incur additional costs that must be carefully balanced with the benefits gained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Gene Ontology (GO) {{provides}} a controlled vocabulary for describing genes and gene products. In {{spite of the}} undoubted importance of GO, several drawbacks associated with GO and GO-based annotations have been introduced. We identified three types of semantic <b>inconsistencies</b> in GO-based annotations; semantically redundant, biological-domain inconsistent and taxonomy inconsistent annotations. Methods To determine the semantic <b>inconsistencies</b> in GO annotation, we used the hierarchical structure of GO graph and tree structure of NCBI taxonomy. Twenty seven biological databases were collected for finding semantic inconsistent annotation. Results The distributions and possible causes of the semantic <b>inconsistencies</b> were investigated using twenty seven biological databases with GO-based annotations. We found that some evidence codes of annotation {{were associated with the}} <b>inconsistencies.</b> The numbers of gene products and species in a database that are related to the complexity of database management are also in correlation with the <b>inconsistencies.</b> Consequently, numerous annotation errors arise and are propagated throughout biological databases and GO-based high-level analyses. GOChase-II is developed to detect and correct both syntactic and semantic errors in GO-based annotations. Conclusions We identified some <b>inconsistencies</b> in GO-based annotation and provided software, GOChase-II, for correcting these semantic <b>inconsistencies</b> in addition to the previous corrections for the syntactic errors by GOChase-I. </p...|$|R
