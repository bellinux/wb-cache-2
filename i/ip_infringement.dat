40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the risk}} of intellectual property (<b>IP)</b> <b>infringements</b> by competitors from abroad and in particular whether this risk is higher for international innovating firms. We distinguish three different types of <b>IP</b> <b>infringements</b> from abroad: the usage of firms' technical inventions, product piracy and copying of corporate names and designs. Our analysis rests on the German data from the Europe-wide Community Innovation Survey (CIS). We use a unique data set of about 900 observations which are retrieved from two survey waves. While the earlier wave contains information about international and domestic innovation activities the later wave reports <b>IP</b> <b>infringements.</b> In a second analysis, the likelihood of infringements from innovation host countries and no innovation host countries abroad is examined. Before the empirical analysis, an explorative study {{has been carried out}} in China with interviews of German firms with innovation activities in China and with a legal advisor for small and medium sized German enterprises. The results show that firms with international R&D activities are increasing their chances to lose technological knowledge to their local competitors abroad. R&D activities in countries with weak intellectual property rights increase the risk for all types of infringement. Infringements by competitors from the host country are driven by the production of innovations in this country. Export intensity is the major driver of infringements from no innovation host countries. R&D activities in China and North America also increase {{the risk of}} an infringement. However, firms that innovate only in their home country experience significantly more product piracy cases than internationally innovating firms...|$|R

Accessory liability is an important mechanism for enhancing the protection afforded to holders of legal rights against wrongful interference in those rights. Accessory liability in tort law has been extended to apply to statutory intellectual property (IP) wrongs, that is, statutory torts, and thereby serves an important function in protecting economic and other interests, albeit in a context where other parties may have competing interests.

Despite the importance of the issue, there has not been any research on the first integration of Vietnamese judiciary in line with international regulations on IPRs protection and enforcement applicable to all WTO member states. This thesis will also examine impacts of this international compliance for the Vietnamese judiciary in particular, and to this South East Asian country in general. After analysing the critical situation of IPRs infringements in Vietnam, which lie behind an impetus for change, the thesis will review the historical development of IPRs and main provisions of the TRIPs Agreement.

40|$|The {{harmonization}} of {{the legal}} framework for criminal enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) at the regional and international level has since its inception been a sensitive and difficult issue, mainly due to the diverging moral and cultural legal conceptions of negotiating parties and because of strong sovereignty issues traditionally raised by criminal law. Against this background, the current international provisions on the subject established in Article 61 of the TRIPS Agreement only provide for a minimum standard level on criminal measures for the infringement of intellectual property rights. This situation was perceived by many developed nations {{as the result of}} an ineffective multilateral approach and led them to advance precise and tougher TRIPS-plus provisions on criminal enforcement in bilateral, plurilateral or regional agreements. These efforts to strengthen the criminal framework in an undifferentiated manner caused strong counter-reactions and even led to the overall rejection of intellectual property rights protection in certain cases. The general tendency to criminalize end users in relation to copyright infringements on the Internet is a good example. Therefore, a balanced and differentiated set of rules for criminal enforcement of intellectual property rights needs to be considered in order to secure in the long run the acceptance of intellectual property rights within society. In this specific context, the purpose of this chapter is to reflect on the proper design of a legal framework which would provide for a legitimate protection for IPRs through adequate and efficient enforcement measures, {{while at the same time}} taking into account the public interest and basic principles of justice such as proportionality, legal certainty, procedural justice and the protection of fundamental rights. For this purpose, the chapter begins with a closer look at the norms codified in the TRIPS Agreement and explores their flexibilities, in order to verify whether international standards allow Member States to implement criminal provisions on IP rights in their national legislation in accordance with their domestic needs and circumstances. Later, this chapter envisages a revision of the main requirements for the criminalization of <b>IP</b> <b>infringements,</b> especially the concept of “commercial scale”, with the aim to propose a balanced and differentiated legal framework. In this sense, it suggests that when elaborating new conditions for the criminal enforcement of intellectual property rights, the international legislature should propose criteria that take into account the aggravated social harm caused by the infringement...|$|R

It addresses such issues as the following: ISP liability; contributory and secondary liability for trade mark, copyright, and patent infringement; time- and geo-shifting devices and services; consumer identification through dynamic <b>IP</b> addresses; <b>infringements</b> committed on a "commercial scale"; liability of hosting providers; requirements for a breach of duty of care; notice to users to refrain from infringements; filters and other due diligence measures; "actual knowledge"; privacy and infringers’ personal data; file sharing services; online storage services; and liability of transporters and freighters.

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} table of contents, introduction, and {{a brief description of}} Christina Bohannan 2 ̆ 6 Herbert Hovenkamp, Creation without Restraint: Promoting Liberty and Rivalry in Innovation (Oxford 2011). Promoting rivalry in innovation requires a fusion of legal policies drawn from patent, copyright, and antitrust law, as well as economics and other disciplines. Creation Without Restraint looks first at the relationship between markets and innovation, noting that innovation occurs most in moderately competitive markets and that small actors {{are more likely to be}} truly creative innovators. Then we examine the problem of connected and complementary relationships, a dominant feature of high technology markets. Interconnection requirements, technological compatibility requirements, standard setting, and the relationship between durable products and aftermarkets all involve interconnection, or “tying. ” Some see tying as inherently anticompetitive, while others view it as unexceptionally benign. In fact, bundling products or technologies is essential in high technology markets and most of it is socially beneficial, but possibilities of abuse nevertheless remain. Identifying good substantive legal rules for facilitating innovation is often very difficult. Two generations ago antitrust law addressed problems of complexity by shifting the focus to harm. The courts reasoned that they could often avoid unmanageable substantive doctrine by considering whether the plaintiff had suffered the appropriate kind of injury. Plaintiffs who are injured by more rather than less competition should be denied a remedy. In the case of patent and copyright law, the appropriate question is whether an infringer’s conduct served to undermine the right holder’s incentive to innovate, with incentives measured from before the innovation occurred. Some <b>IP</b> <b>infringements</b> do no harm to the incentive to innovate; others actually make the right more rather than less valuable. In these situations relief should be denied. Patent and copyright law are both in crisis today – major problems include overissuance, overly broad and ambiguously defined protections, and rules that permit both patentees and copyright holders to make broad claims on unforeseen innovations. The result has been that many patents are valueless, while others have very considerable value precisely because they enclose ideas or technologies that rightfully belong in the public domain. Patent law could be greatly improved if inventions were tied to real, nonobvious technology actually in the patentee’s possession at the time its application was filed, and if patentees were obliged to give comprehensible and timely notice of their inventions. Copyright law would be greatly improved by an aggressive theory of harm that reduces the scope of the derivative works right and increases the scope of fair use. In Eldred the Supreme Court suggested that the First Amendment should not be an important copyright infringement defense because the Constitution’s IP clause and the initial copyright act were passed “close in time,” leading to an inference that Congress must have considered these concerns. But the original copyright act bears little resemblance to the expansive coverage granted by the current Act, passed almost two centuries later. Finally, we examine the role of both antitrust and intellectual property law in two areas, exclusionary practices and licensing arrangements among multiple firms. On the first, one of the most controversial practices is refusal to license, because compulsory licensing rules are so difficult to administer. Nevertheless, serious competition concerns arise when dominant firms acquire technologies from others mainly to shut them down without actually employing them. We also examine claims that innovation itself should be regarded as anticompetitive when it makes the technology of others incompatible with a dominant firm’s technology. The size and diversity of the “innovation commons,” or the vast area involving collaborative innovation and dissemination of IP rights, is driven mainly by the fact that IP rights are nonrivalrous. In addition, however, in some industries patents are worthless or have negative value. Pooling becomes a mechanism by which firms use private ordering to “back out” of an IP system that is unsuitable to their needs. By recognizing this fact the legal system can provide greater accommodation for much needed diversity in IP coverage...|$|R

40|$|Counterfeiting and the piracy of {{consumer}} goods in China are serious and globally recognized problems. Despite concerns expressed by the US and past efforts, China {{has been unable to}} enforce IP rights effectively for decades. As a result, American businesses seeking to sell IP-protected goods in China suffer {{tens of billions of dollars}} in losses every year. This Comment aims to determine and assess what measures the US may take to reduce <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> in China in the short term. China 2 ̆ 7 s weak IP enforcement record is a result of both long-term and short-term causes. Short-term causes (that is, causes that could be remedied within the next five years) include problems with China 2 ̆ 7 s nascent judicial system, local protectionism and economic dependence on <b>IP</b> <b>infringement,</b> under-deterrence, market access limitations, and the vagueness of the TRIPS Agreement. However, the various proposals found in existing literature for improving China 2 ̆ 7 s IP enforcement record fail to adequately tackle these short-term causes and are therefore unlikely to produce an immediate benefit. The US should adopt a three-pronged approach to improve China 2 ̆ 7 s IP enforcement record. First, the US should file a WTO complaint alleging an Article 63. 1 violation. Article 63. 1 imposes transparency standards on the adjudicative processes and regulations of WTO member states. Second, the US and China should conclude a bilateral agreement providing incentives for joint ventures between American and Chinese companies. Joint ventures will give Chinese companies an incentive to enforce their IP rights since they will then hold an ownership stake. Third, the US should, either by filing a WTO complaint or through bilateral negotiations, seek to reduce China 2 ̆ 7 s current market access barriers. However, because China 2 ̆ 7 s IP enforcement problem is largely a result of long-term causes, there may be little the US can realistically do to bring about immediate and marked improvement in the effectiveness of China 2 ̆ 7 s IP enforcement...|$|E
40|$|Every {{intellectual}} property (“IP”) right {{has its own}} definition of infringement. In this Article, we suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for evaluating <b>IP</b> <b>infringement.</b> That patent law, for example, focuses on an expert audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many {{of the differences in}} how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s works. Consumers, by contrast, are likely {{to pay more attention to}} market substitution and less attention to how things work under the hood. Understanding the different audiences in <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> is critical to understanding how the IP regimes variously define infringement. The focus on audience has normative as well as descriptive implications. Neither patent law, with its focus on experts and technical similarity, nor trademark law, with its market-based consumer focus, has it entirely correct. Rather, we suggest that as a general matter, infringement of an IP right should require both technical similarity and market substitution. An ideal IP regime should care about a defendant’s conduct only if that conduct actually causes injury to the plaintiff’s market and its work is sufficiently like the plaintiff’s that it is reasonable to give the plaintiff control over that work. Assessing infringement through the expert’s eyes ensures that the law prevents closely related works in the field while permitting sufficiently different contributions. The consumer vantage point ensures that we protect IP owners only when they have been harmed in the marketplace. IP owners who want to show infringement should have to demonstrate both that the defendant’s work is technically similar to their own from the expert’s vantage point and that the defendant’s use causes the plaintiff harm in the marketplace. Copyright law, which looks to both experts and consumers at various points in the infringement analysis, is on the right track...|$|E

40|$|FPGAs, {{because of}} their re-programmability, are {{becoming}} very popular for creating and exchanging VLSI intellectual properties (IPs) in the reuse-based design paradigm. Existing watermarking and fingerprinting techniques successfully embed identification information into FPGA designs to deter <b>IP</b> <b>infringement.</b> However, such methods incur timing and/or resource overhead, unpredictable at times, which causes performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a new FPGA watermarking technique that guarantees zero design overhead. Our approach consists of two phases. First we design as usual to obtain the best, possible, quality IP. Then we map the required signature to additional timing constraints on carefully selected nets and redo {{a small portion of}} the design (e. g. place and route). The FPGA configuration bitstream for the resulting watermarked design will be significantly different from the original design, which provides us with a strong proof of authorship. The watermarking technique has zero design overhead because it is developed to maintain the performance of the design from the first phase. This is demonstrated by applying the proposed technique on several real-life FPGA designs, which range in size from a few thousand to more than two million gates, on Xilinx devices...|$|E

To overcome the vulnerability attack and minimize the design error, the Digital watermark bits are seamlessly introduced into the outputs of the existing and free transitions of state transition graph (STG). To offers {{a high degree of}} tamper resistance and provides an easy and non invasive copy detection. The assignment of reserved literals is exploited to minimize the overhead of watermarking and make the watermarked FSM fallible upon removal of any pseudo input variable. A direct and convenient detection scheme is also proposed to allow the watermark on the FSM to be publicly detectable. Experimental results an acceptably low overheads with higher tamper resilience and stronger authorship owner proof in comparison with related watermarking schemes for sequential functions. IP providers are in pressing need of a convenient means to track the illegal redistribution of the sold IPs. This method is a great approach to protect a VLSI design against <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> has to embedding a signature that can only be uniquely generated by the IP author into the design during the process of its creation...|$|E

Based on this analysis I conclude, and thus predict, that the iPhone will enter the Chinese market in 2009, that Apple will use an outpacing strategy, and if unaffected by contingent factors Apple will be very successful, but I find it likely that contingent factors for instance concerning monitoring of IP will adversely affect the outcome...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the term}} “anti-counterfeiting” {{suggests}} an agreement limited to preventing trade in counterfeit products, ACTA’s draft provisions, to date, would set new minimum enforcement standards {{for a range}} of intellectual property rights. In several areas, these standards could impede legitimate competition, shortchange legal process and shift costs of enforcing private commercial rights to the public. The parties to ACTA have agreed to narrow some of its provisions in recent months. Despite these improvements to its text, ACTA continues to present risks for global access to medicines, including potentially restricting free transit of generics, imposing chilling effects on the medicines trade, and limiting flexibilities in intellectual property (IP) rules. The parties have cited protecting consumers from unsafe products as a primary benefit of ACTA. But among IP infringements, only willful trademark counterfeiting of potentially dangerous classes of products poses a categorical public safety risk. Outside the context of counterfeiting, <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> analysis is not related to health. Moreover, ACTA diverts attention and resources away from more direct and comprehensive public safety measures. ACTA’s most significant public health costs may come from its narrative positioning and precedent. ACTA does not adequately distinguish between criminal activity and civil infringements occurring in the context of market competition—a problem that concerns consumer groups and intellectual property owners alike. Several parties to ACTA now rightly suggest narrowing the agreement’s scope altogether. Public health analysis leads to the conclusion that ACTA should be scaled back to cover only willful commercial scale trademark counterfeiting...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{insertion}} of China and India in the contested and highly legalised regime of intellectual property rights (IP). In doing so it pays particular attention at two dimensions, the internal adoption of this regime and external endorsement/contestation of international IP norms. Much {{has been written about}} whether emerging countries will challenge or support the maintenance of an open rules-based multilateral trade system. In this context, the differentiated integration of these two countries in the IP regime is notable. Domestically, China despite much criticism for widespread <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> has followed a maximalist interpretation of TRIPS. India, on the contrary has followed other emerging countries in pursuing a more critical, minimalist understanding. These positions have also been visible at the multilateral arena. This empirical finding runs contrary to the assumption that defiance results from market power. The divergence is the more surprising given a recent explosion of patent filings in both countries. From a political economy perspective, this should translate into support for stricter rules under TRIPS. In explanaining the two countries’ divertent insertion this paper looks beyond economic (market) power and domestic interests and underlines the role of ideational legacies, domestic interests and regulatory capacity. The paper thus stresses the need to look deep into domestic politics and ideational cleavages, as well as at their evolution over time, in order to better understand the international behaviour of emerging countries...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the developing {{law in the}} US applicable to judicial decisions to grant or to deny various forms of equitable injunctive relief {{as a tool for}} intellectual property rights enforcement. It then analyzes the 2006 US Supreme Court decision, eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 US 388 (2006), which reversed a prevailing general rule in US jurisprudence that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances, and held that the existence of an <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> itself did not necessarily entitle the right-holder to an injunction. The author places the eBay decision’s restoration of flexibility and discretion to trial court judges in regard to injunctive relief in an international context by showing that the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is likewise flexible, and pointing to the possible lessons in terms of policy choices that post-eBay jurisprudence in the US may offer the law-makers and the judiciary in developing countries in balancing the right-holders’ interest and public interest when deciding to grant an injunction. These policy choices include the amount of compensation considered to be fair and adequate for different types of intellectual property right-holders; the costs of judicial supervision of injunctive remedies and concerns that such remedies may excessively empower right holders; the potential for injunctive remedies to deter legitimate challenges to the validity of asserted rights; and the public interests that warrant authorizing prospective infringement.

40|$|Recent {{reviews and}} policy {{discussions of the}} various IP systems have {{consistently}} lamented the lack of hard data {{on the extent of}} the problem of infringement, what it costs and whom it affects, how firms respond, and how successful existing systems for IP enforcement are. This is hardly a new problem: over the years uncertainty and issues of measurement have plagued attempts to assess the various IP systems, causing even the most rigorous assessors to throw up their hands and say, more or less, ‘we don’t know if it works’, whether ‘it’ be the patent system (Machlup 1958) or copyright (Breyer 1970). Nevertheless, innovation and its promotion are important to all advanced economies, basing policy on statistical evidence is increasingly possible due to enhanced accessibility of data, {{and a great deal of}} effort has been invested into answering what questions we can about the effects of the IP system. It is opportune, therefore, to review where we are: what we know already, where the gaps in our knowledge lie, and what research could practicably be done to improve our knowledge. To this end, the authors have reviewed the literature concerning <b>IP</b> <b>infringement</b> and enforcement. One goal is to work out what we know already: that is, what research has already been done. But equally, the aim is to assist in identifying what exactly we want to know and whether it is possible to find out, in some reasonably objective way...|$|E
