30|$|The ‘cyclic flow’ reactor is {{designed}} to operate very differently than other PBR designs. In addition to the high energy penalty associated with the continuous circulation of large volumes of algae culture, unintended consequences can <b>arise.</b> <b>Fully</b> <b>developed</b> flow in a pipe results in a ‘no slip’ condition at the pipe wall. This provides convenient conditions for algae cells to accumulate {{on the wall of}} the tube. Given time, these cells will colonize and form a biofilm; indeed, biofilm formation has been a major technical hurdle to the deployment and scale up of photobioreactors. To avoid this issue, the culture in the new reactor does not flow continuously. Instead, the tubes in the photo array drain and fill in a cyclic manner multiple times per day. Consequently, the liquid flow is never fully developed and biofilm formation is minimized. In the cyclic flow PBR, biofilm mitigation is additionally controlled by the introduction of gas bubbles in the PET tubes to create multi-dimensional fluid mixing, and through the use of a buoyant pipe pig (one per PET tube) to clean the reactor walls as flow is cycled. Each time the reactor is filled and drained the pipe pigs—which are equipped with rubber gaskets—travel the length of the clear PET tubes, mechanically removing any attached algae (confirmed by visual inspection).|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSelected swell wave records from Monterey, California {{and the associated}} weather maps were analyzed to determine at what stage in the storm history the peak energy in the swell trains was produced. The apparent origin of the swell, derived by frequency-time analysis of the wave records, was found to lie within the fetch determined from the weather maps, and to occur during the stage in the storm history when the fetch velocity was rapidly decreasing. The group velocity of the peak energy swell was found to equal the fetch velocity {{at the time of}} swell origin, a condition suitable for the generation of large wave energy because of a long effective wind duration. By assuming <b>fully</b> <b>arisen</b> seas at the apparent swell source, and average value of the ratio of surface to geostrophic wind speed of 0. 77 was obtained. This value was derived from surface winds obtained from the wave data and geostrophic winds obtained from the weather maps.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the turbulence induced by wave-breaking {{at the ocean}} surface. Two recent models use a mechanism of direct depth injection of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) by breaking waves. Those models aim to reproduce the near-surface mean and turbulent properties, in particular the TKE dissipation rates. Of critical importance are the injection depth of each breaking wave and the size distribution of those breaking waves. The models by Sullivan et al. (2007) and by Kudryavtsev et al. (2008) have very different parameterizations, and those differences are reviewed here and compared to available observations. Using realistic parameterizations in these models leads to TKE injections too shallow to compare to observations, in particular for <b>developed</b> <b>seas.</b> The near-surface turbulence is thus still not well understood to the zeroth order. For instance, whether <b>developed</b> <b>seas</b> produce deeper or shallower mixing than young seas is neither well understood nor well modelled.

40|$|Abstract. The {{practicality}} {{of common}} wave breaking criteria is reviewed. Video {{recordings of the}} sea surface taken from aboard R/P FLIP are used to extract breaking wave properties. The key quantity is Λ(c) dc, the length of breaking crests per unit area propagating with speeds in the range (c, c+ dc). Independent of wave field development, Λ(c) is found to peak at intermediate wave scales and to drop off sharply at larger and smaller scales. For young waves, breakers occur at {{a wide range of}} scales corresponding to phase speeds of about 0. 1 - 1. 0 cp, but in <b>developed</b> <b>seas</b> breaking is hardly observed at scales corresponding to phase speeds> 0. 5 cp. The phase speed of the most frequent breakers shifts from 0. 4 cp to 0. 2 cp as the wave field develops. The relative distribution of breaker scale increases the likelihood of rogue waves in <b>developed</b> <b>seas</b> compared to young seas.

They emerged in early eumetazoan evolution, being already expressed in cnidarians, a prebilaterian phylum where the early steps of neurogenesis {{can be traced}} back. We first performed a systematic phylogenetic reconstruction of the Hox/ParaHox families and proposed that the ProtoHox gene most likely resembled the Gsx/Pdx genes. We then made use of the sea anemone (Nematostella) cnidarian model system to investigate the developmental role of Gsx. Thanks to neuronal markers that we identified to monitor neurogenesis in developing Nematostella, we could show in loss of function assays that Gsx/Anthox 2 is likely involved in nerve net formation. Moreover Gsx/Anthox 2 upstream sequences drive expression in apical neurons, suggesting that they contain a neurogenic element to be identified.
