6000|$|Is it not curious, that so vast a {{being as}} the whale {{should see the}} world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare's?

Now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the looking-glass. That was I too.

[...] He stared at the case {{in which it was}} now again hidden as though tanned leather were no obstacle to his sight; then went on: [...] "Do not answer: I will tell you why. You shot at me because you were afraid of me, and fear is ever cruel, is it not? Only something happened to your arrow, something that has never happened to any arrow of yours before. Oh, yes, you have saved me from the Italian cut-throats, and being a gentleman I thank you very much. Only why did the arrow burst in your bow?"

5000|$|Quentin's main {{obsession}} is Caddy's virginity and purity. He {{is obsessed}} with Southern ideals of chivalry and is strongly protective of women, especially his sister. When Caddy engages in sexual promiscuity, Quentin is horrified. He turns to his father for help and counsel, but the pragmatic Mr. Compson tells him that virginity is invented by men {{and should not be}} taken seriously. He also tells Quentin that time will heal all. Quentin {{spends much of his time}} trying to prove his father wrong, but is unable to do so. Shortly before Quentin leaves for Harvard in the fall of 1909, Caddy becomes pregnant by a lover she is unable to identify, perhaps Dalton Ames, whom Quentin confronts. The two fight, with Quentin losing disgracefully and Caddy vowing, for Quentin's sake, never to speak to Dalton again. Quentin tells his father that they have committed incest, but his father knows that he is lying: [...] "and he <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make her do it and i i was afraid to i was afraid she might and then it wouldn't do any good" [...] (112). Quentin's idea of incest is shaped by the idea that, if they [...] "could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us" [...] (51), he could protect his sister by joining her in whatever punishment she might have to endure. In his mind, he feels a need to take responsibility for Caddy's sin.|$|E

Through processes such as “talk of castigation, ” the Civil Police reproduce three kinds of authority—public, institutional, and criminal— that infl uence how police work is done. These authorities are antagonistic, battling over different normative worldviews and notions of acceptable police practice, and these an-tagonisms result in police work that is often a confl icted amalgam of democratic, institu-tional, and criminal pressures. The slow pace of democratic change at this police station emerges from not one but multiple modes of resistance that complicate how police can do their work. “Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> kill a cop?! ” shouted Renata, a Civil Police (CP) investiga-tor (investigadora). 1 “You’re lucky. If it had been me out there, you’d be dead by now. You should be thankful that it was these guys that caught you. ” In front of her a teenage boy sat, stoic, with his head thickly wrapped in gauze, blood encrusted about his eyes, ears, and face.
