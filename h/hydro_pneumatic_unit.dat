This solution is alternative to commercial projects of hybrid systems, which store energy in the <b>hydro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> accumulators or the super capacitors. Suggested solution includes designed system of active counterweight, which cooperates with working mechanism of machine. The hydraulic circuit of active counterweight is connected with the boom standard hydraulic system. The counterweight mechanism is homothetic to working mechanism of the excavator. The homothetic transformation applies to kinematical structure and positions of the centres of gravity. The homothetic transformation provides to static unloading of boom cylinder by the connected counterweight cylinder. The possibility of energy saving by using movable counterweight was estimated during tests. The key parameters of hydraulic system, such as: cylinders velocity, working pressure, oil flow and another were measured on prepared research stand. The comparison of power consumption for standard and modification system during the same work cycles allowed confirms the correctness of the suggested concept for energy saving system.

40|$|Off-road {{and racing}} {{motorcycles}} require a particular setup of the suspension {{to improve the}} comfort {{and the safety of}} the rider. Further, due to ground unevenness, off-road motorcycle suspensions usually experience extreme and erratic excursions in performing their function. In this regard, the adoption of nonlinear devices, such as progressive springs and <b>hydro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> shock absorbers, can help limiting both the acceleration experienced by the sprung mass and the excursions of the suspensions. For dynamic analysis purposes, this option involves the solution of the nonlinear differential equations that govern the motion of the motorcycle, which is excited by the stochastic road ground profile. In this study a 4 degrees-of-freedom (4 -DOF) nonlinear motorcycle model is considered. The model involves suspension elements with asymmetric behaviour. Further, it is assumed that the motorcycle is exposed to loading of a stochastic nature as it moves with a specified speed over a road profile defined by a particular power spectrum. It is shown that a meaningful analysis of the motorcycle response can be conducted by using the technique of statistical linearization. The validity of the proposed approach is established by comparison with results from pertinent Monte Carlo studies. In this context the applicability of auto-regressive (AR) filters for efficient implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation is pointed out. The advantages of these methods for the synthesis of excitation signals from a given power spectrum, are shown by comparison with other methods. It is shown that the statistical linearization method allows the analysis of multi-degree-of-freedom (M-DOF) systems that present strong nonlinearities, exceeding other nonlinear analysis methods in both accuracy and applicability. It is expected that the proposed approaches, can be used for a variety of parameter/ride quality studies and as preliminary design tool by the motorcycle industry...|$|R

40|$|Medical gases can be {{identified}} simply if they are supplied at different pipeline pressures. Routine maintenance errors, accidental pipeline cross-connections, or gas failures, can be automatically detected by incorporating a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>unit</b> with pressure-sensitive valves into the anaesthetic machine. A fall-iafe method of ensuring the delivery of the correct gases to the patient is described. Tragedies have been reported throughout the world from errors in medical gas pipeline installations (Robinson, 1979) and, {{in addition to the}} reported mishaps, we have been aware of other instances where disaster has been narrowly averted. The com-monest cause appears to be cross-connecting gas supply pipelines at some point between storage and the point of use (Klein and Lilburn, 1980; Cundy and Baldock, 1982). However, errors in outlet fit-tings and cross-connected lines within the anaesthe-tic machine have occurred also (Spurring and Shenolikar, 1978; Downing, 1981). A system is proposed whereby gases are delivered at differential pressures. This allows the user to check correct connections visually and by audible alarm. The system will automatically interrupt the supply of all gases {{in the event of a}} fault in the oxygen supply line and that of other gases if they deviate from the standards set. THE PRINCIPLE It is customary to distribute medical gases at a pressure of about 400 kPa. The reason for the adop-tion of this specific pressure is obscure and is proba-bly the result of common usage rather than deliber-ate design. The pressure of 400 kPa is by no means universal. The U.

40|$|The article {{shows the}} {{relevance}} of the approaches to the object-oriented programming when modeling the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>units</b> (PU). Based on the analysis of the calculation schemes of aggregates pneumatic systems two basic objects, namely a cavity flow and a material point were highlighted. Basic interactions of objects are defined. Cavity-cavity interaction: ex-change of matter and energy with the flows of mass. Cavity-point interaction: force interaction, exchange of energy in the form of operation. Point-point in-teraction: force interaction, elastic interaction, inelastic interaction, and inter-vals of displacement. The authors have developed mathematical models of basic objects and interactions. Models and interaction of elements are implemented in the object-oriented programming. Mathematical models of elements of PU design scheme are implemented in derived from the base class. These classes implement the models of flow cavity, piston, diaphragm, short channel, diaphragm to be open by a given law, spring, bellows, elastic collision, inelastic collision, friction, PU stages with a limited movement, etc. A numerical integration of differential equations for the mathematical models of PU design scheme elements is based on the Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order. On request each class performs a tact of integration i. e. calcu-lation of the coefficient method. The paper presents an integration algorithm of the system of differential equations. All objects of the PU design scheme are placed in a unidirectional class list. Iterator loop cycle initiates the integration tact of all the objects in the list. One in four iteration makes a transition to the next step of integration. Calculation process stops when any object shows a shutdowns flag. The proposed approach was tested in the calculation of a number of PU designs. With regard to traditional approaches to modeling, the authors-proposed method features in easy enhancement, code reuse, high reliability, and low time consuming development.

Transportation of fish to acclimation sites is tentatively scheduled to begin January 12 th. FISH CULTURE: Production pond cleaning continues on a weekly basis, and feeding continues to be performed two days per week due to the colder river water temperatures. Eggs in the incubation continue to be tempered in 38 degree water and temperature units recorded daily. On the 20 th the river became too inclement for normal operations as the intake screens were covered with ice, at that time we shutdown two river pumps and turned on wells four and six to get 6, 825 gallons of water. This was the operation at the facility for twenty-four hours at which point we were able to get back to normal operations. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 756 gallons/min. The river pumps are supplying 13, 571 gallons per minute. Well pumps No. 2 and No. 4 are operating and supplying 1, 185 gallons/min. More on well pumps in the well field maintenance section of this report. ACCLIMATION SITES: Preparation of acclimation sites for fish transfer was the main focus for the month of December.

Wallace Electric was called and after extensive monitoring of the tank, compressor and electrical operations an electrical relay switch was replaced. Weekly cleaning and tool inventory continues to be a priority. The shop is home to our liberation truck along with fish transfer equipment, fish pump and seine nets. ELECTRICAL BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The large generator is located in the electrical building and is checked daily for routine inspections. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The incubation building is being used to clean and repair isolation buckets, egg incubation baskets and troughs. An experiment involving remote site incubators (RSI's) continued through the month. Chad Stockton, WDFW, records flows and monitors emergence of fry on a daily basis. Chad is working with Steve S. and Curt K. on the RSI's research along with spawning channel fry emergence. RIVERWATER COOLING FACILITY: The one pump in operation in this building is checked daily during our routine inspections, the variable pump is supplying water to the artificial spawning channel. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four river pumps are in operation and pumping {approx} 13, 571 gallons/min to the facility. The building is cleaned monthly and the air burst system is cycled daily during the morning checks. The crew continued weekly changing of the graph paper on the river temperature thermograph throughout the month, continuing this activity as part of the daily checks routine. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Wells No. 1 and No. 4 were in operation and supplying 1, 185 gallons/minute to the facility and incubation building. Weekly test well readings are recorded and sent via fax to CH 2 MHILL. Also weekly well meter readings are recorded. Well No. 5 had been determined to have a faulty drain valve while trying to operate the pump for emergency water usage.
