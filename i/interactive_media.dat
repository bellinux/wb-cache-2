5|$|After Sesame Streets initial success, the CTW {{began to}} think about its {{survival}} beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, <b>interactive</b> <b>media</b> and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO during 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement. On June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its work which included non-television activities, and Gary Knell became CEO. H.

5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an <b>interactive</b> <b>media</b> experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

This study is a Research and Development (R and D). It was conducted at SMP N 8 Yogyakarta. The instrument in the research is questionnaires. There were two questionnaires used in the research. The data from the first questionnaire were analyzed qualitatively. Meanwhile, the data from the second questionnaire were analyzed quantitatively. The research procedure adapted ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) model that was commonly used in developing <b>interactive</b> learning <b>media.</b> In analysis step, the observation and needs analysis were conducted. The design step was selecting topics and objectives, designing the course grid, and the materials. The development step was designing the flowchart and the storyboard, developing the media, and validating by experts. In the validating steps, the material expert evaluated the quality of the materials while the media expert evaluated the quality of the program design. The implementation step is a step where the researcher tested the media to the students and the teachers to find out the quality of the <b>media.</b> The English <b>interactive</b> learning <b>media</b> was reviewed and revised according to any feedback given. The implementation involved 27 students and 3 English teachers. They were asked to give feedback to the English <b>interactive</b> learning <b>media</b> by filing out the questionnaire. The evaluation step dealt with revisions and discussion based on the result of the result of the try out. Revisions were made as necessary based on the data obtained. The English <b>interactive</b> learning <b>media</b> has some features. They are Direction, Materials (Achievement Indicators, Start to Units, Vocabulary, and Pronunciation), Evaluation, Developers and References. The criteria for the design quality are categorized into three aspects: content aspect, media aspect, and interactivity aspect. The results of the program are called effective and feasible to apply if the obtained score mean for content aspect was more than 28; the media aspect was more than 45. 5; the interactivity aspect was more than 17. 5. In conclusion, the developed English <b>interactive</b> learning <b>media</b> is appropriate and feasible {{to be used in the}} teaching-learning process. The English <b>interactive</b> learning <b>media</b> that has been produced is integrated in a compact disc (CD) that can be used by the students at schools and homes...|$|R
