At the age of 15, he entered an {{accelerated}} college program at the University of Chicago where he studied mathematics and philosophy. In Chicago he discovered the serialism of Anton Webern and composed a twelve-tone string trio. In 1954 Glass traveled to Paris, where he encountered the films of Jean Cocteau, which made a lasting impression on him. He visited artists' studios and saw their work; [...] "the bohemian life you see in [...] Orphée was the life <b>I</b> ... <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to,</b> and those were the people I hung out with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul was {{attracted}} to her {{for a number of}} reasons, he explained: [...] "I liked her as a woman, she was good-looking with a good figure, so physically <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> her." [...] But he also liked her sense of independence: [...] "Her mental attitude was quite rebellious... she was the kind of kid who would hang out in the kitchen with the black maids" [...] to learn cooking. She disliked [...] socializing. They both liked natural surroundings, he said, and they shared a love of nature, which became one of their most important emotional links. He knew that because of her [...] "very free spirit," [...] she was considered a rebel and a black sheep by her family for avoiding excelling in education, unlike her father and brother. [...] "She was an artist," [...] Paul said, [...] "and was not cut out to be an academic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Truffaut {{first began}} work on The Green Room in December 1970 after reading the works of Henry James. Truffaut {{especially}} liked [...] "The Altar of the Dead" [...] and asked his friend Aimée Alexandre to translate a new French version for him. Alexandre also recommended works by Anton Chekov and Leo Tolstoy with similar themes, while Truffaut did his own research on James's life and visited his home in Boston. Truffaut worked on other projects until 1974, when a new French version {{of the short story}} was published, renewing his interest. Truffaut commented on the film, [...] "the story was difficult to construct, but at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the subject." [...] In July of that year he then reached a contract agreement with screenwriter Jean Gruault to begin drafting a film adaptation. [...] Truffaut and Gruault had previously collaborated on Jules and Jim (1962), The Wild Child (1970), and Two English Girls (1971).|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> this grove, however, by {{memorials}} {{of a more}} touching character. It {{had been}} one of the favorite haunts of the late Lord Byron.

"My dear," [...] the Duchess said impressively, [...] "David Thain {{may have}} his peculiarities, {{but he is}} really a most simple and sincere person. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> him upon the steamer simply because of his shyness, and {{a good thing for}} you, dear, that I was.

60|$|When {{we arrived}} at the Palazzo Orsi, many of the guests had already come. Matteo was {{immediately}} surrounded by his friends; and a score of ladies beckoned to him from different parts of the room, so that he was torn away from me, leaving me rather disconsolate alone in the crowd. Presently <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> a group of men talking to a woman whom I could not see; Matteo had joined them, and they were laughing at something he had said.

5000|$|In October 2013, Morrissey {{released}} a statement through his semi-official website, which said, [...] "Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not homosexual. In technical fact, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> humasexual. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> humans. But, of course ... not many."

In {{an interview}} with The Independent, she said, [...] "I've never particularly said I'm hetero or I'm a lesbian. <b>I</b> know there <b>are</b> people who are definitely one way, but not really me.

60|$|After observing these lively {{indications}} for awhile, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> a neighbouring grove by {{a prodigious}} squeaking which I heard there. On reaching the spot I found it proceeded {{from a large}} hog which a number of natives were forcibly holding to the earth, while a muscular fellow, armed with a bludgeon, was ineffectually aiming murderous blows at the skull of the unfortunate porker. Again and again he missed his writhing and struggling victim, but though puffing and panting with his exertions, he still continued them; and after striking {{a sufficient number of}} blows to have demolished an entire drove of oxen, with one crashing stroke he laid him dead at his feet.|$|E
60|$|The poker {{got into}} my dozing {{thoughts}} besides, and wouldn't come out. I thought, between sleeping and waking, {{that it was}} still red hot, and I had snatched {{it out of the}} fire, and run him through the body. I was so haunted at last by the idea, though I knew there was nothing in it, that I stole into the next room to look at him. There I saw him, lying on his back, with his legs extending to I don't know where, gurglings taking place in his throat, stoppages in his nose, and his mouth open like a post-office. He was so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy, that afterwards <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> him in very repulsion, and could not help wandering in and out every half-hour or so, and taking another look at him. Still, the long, long night seemed heavy and hopeless as ever, and no promise of day was in the murky sky.|$|E
6000|$|The large ward I am in is {{used for}} secession {{soldiers}} exclusively. One man, about forty years of age, emaciated with diarrhoea, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to,</b> as he lay with his eyes turn'd up, looking like death. His weakness was so extreme that it took a minute or so, every time, for him to talk with anything like consecutive meaning; yet he was evidently a man of good intelligence and education. As I said anything, he would lie a moment perfectly still, then, with closed eyes, answer in a low, very slow voice, quite correct and sensible, {{but in a way}} and tone that wrung my heart. He had a mother, wife, and child living (or probably living) in his home in Mississippi. It was long, long since he had seen them. Had he caus'd a letter to be sent them since he got here in Washington? No answer. I repeated the question, very slowly and soothingly. He could not tell whether he had or not--things of late seem'd to him like a dream. After waiting a moment, I said: [...] "Well, I am going to walk down the ward a moment, and when I come back you can tell me. If you have not written, I will sit down and write." [...] A few minutes after I return'd; he said he remember'd now that some one had written for him two or three days before. The presence of this man impress'd me profoundly. The flesh was all sunken on face and arms; the eyes low in their sockets and glassy, and with purple rings around them. Two or three great tears silently flow'd out from the eyes, and roll'd down his temples (he was doubtless unused to be spoken to as I was speaking to him.)Sickness, imprisonment, exhaustion, &c., had conquer'd the body, yet the mind held mastery still, and call'd even wandering remembrance back.|$|E
5000|$|In her poems, Sheila Black {{writes in}} a confessional style, often {{referencing}} past conflicts {{that resulted from}} her diagnosis of XLH, such as in her poem What You Mourn. According to Sheila Black, “As a poet, a storyteller, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> the unruly and confrontational elements of the confessional, to the ways it complicates personal truth through a presentation that makes the audience continually question whether the speaker is to be trusted” ...|$|R
40|$|The hurried {{aspects of}} daily living exhaust me. Speed is the {{operative}} word. Apparently everyone wants more of it. Not me. While I value the innovations that speed up my onerous tasks, in my artwork <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> its opposite [...] repose.

5000|$|My {{family was}} very shy with {{feelings}} and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit. I {{think part of}} the reason <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> theater was because I wanted to be close to stories because they could help me relate to my family.|$|E

5000|$|Derek Buckner is a Brooklyn-based {{artist who}} draws his {{inspiration}} from the beauty within the seemingly banal settings of suburban houses and intersecting freeways.

Buckner states, “.... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> American productivity-- its fecundity and its excess in the twenty-first century.
