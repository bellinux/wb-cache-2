50|$|For {{military}} cargo airdrops, the rigged load is cut {{free and}} rolls {{out of the}} plane as a result of aircraft <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> (ADA). The load then proceeds to fall under canopy to a designated drop zone.|$|R
50|$|The circular-throw {{vibrating}} screen generates a rotating acceleration vector {{and the screen}} must maintain a steep throwing angle to prevent transportation along the screen deck. The deck is commonly constructed to have an angle {{within the range of}} 10° to 18°, in order to develop adequate particle movement. An Increase of <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> speeds particle motion with proportional relationship to particle size. This decreases residence time and size stratification along the mesh screen. However, if the angle is greater than 20°, efficiency decreases due to reduction of effective mesh area. Effect of <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> on efficiency is also influenced by particle density. In mining the optimal inclination angle is about 15°. Exceptions are the dewatering screens at 3° to 5° and steep screens at 20° to 40°.|$|R
50|$|The Dexion-style slotted <b>angle</b> or <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> {{was also}} widely copied by other {{manufacturers}} using different configurations of slots, different metal thicknesses, and different metals (e.g.: aluminium).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Typical {{corrugated}} {{galvanised iron}} appearance, with visible large flake type patterns. The galvanised sheet has been repaired or reinforced {{with a piece}} of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> (painted white).|$|R
50|$|Rods of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> {{from the}} ALS {{structure}} penetrated the passenger compartment, injuring passengers in seats 47G (near amputation of left leg below the knee) and 48G (severe laceration and crushing of left upper arm).|$|R
30|$|The highest {{recovery}} {{can observe}} when <b>deck</b> tilt <b>angle</b> was 12 o, {{feed water flow}} rate and wash water flow rate were 12 (L/min) (Table  4). Therefore, the following points were selected as the optimal values: <b>deck</b> tilt <b>angle</b> 12 o, feed water flow rate and wash water flow rate 12 (L/min) and size fraction −  5  +  2  mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} this single process to weld many {{different}} metals with simple parameter adjustments {{makes it very}} versatile. Materials and Design discusses the use of flash welding in the metal building industry to increase {{the length of the}} <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> used to fabricate joists.|$|R
40|$|A fishway {{constructed}} of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> and reinforcing bar {{was installed in}} a high-gradientculvert to allow the passage of Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) toupstream spawning areas. The structure was detachable from the culvert, inexpensive, andportable. The fishway was still effective 8 years after installation...|$|R
40|$|Use of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> {{separators}} in two evaporator vessels at Darnall {{resulted in}} a marked reduction in entrainment rates. Efficiencies in excess of 90 % were observed with negligible pressure differential across the separator. Separator efficiency can be evaluated rapidly by using a centrally based Auto-Analyser...|$|R
25|$|Submarines {{typically}} rely {{on speed}} and <b>deck</b> <b>angle</b> (angle of attack) rather than deballasting to surface; they are propelled {{at an angle}} towards the surface. Ballast tanks were almost never blown at depth, and doing so could cause the submarine to rocket to the surface out of control. Normal procedure was to drive the submarine to periscope depth, raise the periscope to verify the area was clear, then blow the tanks and surface the submarine.|$|R
5000|$|Dennis Hennessy had {{works at}} West Jefferson Street {{as well as}} Onondaga Creek and South West Street near the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad. The company {{manufactured}} steam boilers and iron smoke stacks. In 1894, Hennessy applied for a patent on [...] "ash barrels" [...] that had reinforced <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> bottoms.|$|R
25|$|The {{automobile}} was lightweight, {{a critical}} determinant in a well-performing car for that time, given the limited {{power of the}} engines available. Most Franklins were wood-framed, although the very first model in 1902 was constructed from an <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> frame. Beginning in 1928, the heavier Franklin models adopted a conventional pressed-steel frame.|$|R
5000|$|The rubber-tyred metro {{systems that}} {{incorporate}} [...] track have <b>angle</b> <b>irons</b> as guide bars, or guiding bars, along the roll ways. The Busan Subway Line 4, that lacks a rail track, has I-beams installed with the flanges being vertical. The Sapporo Municipal Subway, that lacks a rail track as well, has none.|$|R
50|$|Very narrow aisle {{otherwise}} known as VNA, {{is the use of}} selective pallet racking in a tighter configuration to provide maximum space utilization within a storage facility. These systems typically operate in conjunction with wire-guided or rail-guided reach-truck systems. A wire-guided system consists of a wire embedded in the concrete floor that provides tracking for the reach-truck. A rail-guided system consists of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> bolted to the floor down the length of each row. Typically, the <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> is 4” by 3” and ¼” - ⅜” inches thick. A distinct advantage of a narrow aisle pallet racking is fast picking without large aisles which results in improved use of space. When there is limited space, a compact storage method is ideal. Fully adjustable system flexibility and space saving aisles can be manipulated as one to give the greatest amount of pallet storage locations.|$|R
5000|$|Worth quotes Mr Francis Mitchell, C.E., of Redruth, {{in saying}} (in 1888) that [...] "The {{line has been}} taken up, and that it {{consisted}} of two <b>angle</b> <b>irons,</b> placed face to face, and not back to back as was usual later lines... These irons were fastened to stone blocks and the gauge was about [...]" ...|$|R
50|$|The entire {{assembly}} hangs {{above the}} garage door. The power unit {{hangs from the}} ceiling and is located towards {{the rear of the}} garage. The end of the track on {{the opposite end of the}} power unit attaches to a header bracket that is attached to the header wall above the garage door. The power head is usually supported by punched <b>angle</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|R
40|$|Soil surface {{treatments}} {{consisting of}} gully plugs and contour furrows were constructed {{as a means}} of reducing erosion and holding sediment on site. To measure the effectiveness of the gully plugs and furrows, <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> stakes and profile transects were installed to measure soils loss and accompanying change in the soil profile. The profile transects gave a reliable measure of the change in the height of the soil surface in constructed pits and across contour furrows. Because of the shrinking and swelling of the soil, the change in height of the <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> stakes was found to be much more than the reduction in soil surface caused by erosion. High intensity thunderstorms, occuring mostly during July, August, and September, cause most of the erosion from the semi-arid land. The gully plugs and contour furrows were effective in holding runoff and sediment on site, but the life expectancy of the treatments is only about fifteen years...|$|R

50|$|The stack {{has been}} braced at set {{intervals}} {{from the top}} down to approximately half height. <b>Angle</b> <b>iron</b> is used and is formed by two pieces with short overlapping angle pieces at the join and is held in place with a looped and threaded rod. This bracing appears to be held in place by clamping to the stack fascia rather than direct attachment to the brickwork.|$|R
5|$|The {{new owners}} decided {{not merely to}} give the vessel a total refit. The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was {{completely}} renewed along a length of , and the owners {{took the opportunity to}} further strengthen the hull. The old keelsons were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran {{the entire length of the}} keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double <b>angle</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 16 ft flat bogie rail carrier, a 14 ft {{bogie coach}} to carry 12 passengers, and a tool van were all built using the chassis and framework. This was flame {{cut from the}} brick {{carrying}} trollies, cutting down the pillars. Typically, a chassis had to be cut in half, a section of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> then welded on each end resulting in two bogies, each needing two axle boxes / wheels.|$|R
50|$|Slotted angle (also {{sometimes}} referred to as slotted <b>angle</b> <b>iron)</b> is a system of reusable metal strips used to construct shelving, frames, work benches, equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of elongated slots punched into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the metal strips to form a right angle.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s on {{conventional}} carriers {{it has been}} the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a bolter, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> allows the installation of one or two [...] "waist" [...] catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> also improves launch and recovery cycle flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Towers {{were built}} of {{numbered}} <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> sections with concrete footings. Some facilities used concrete arrows pointing {{in the direction}} of towers. In areas where no connection to a power grid was available, a generator was housed in a small building. Some buildings also served as weather stations. Many arrow markings were removed during World War II, to prevent aiding enemy bombers in navigation, while 19 updated beacons still remain in service in Montana.|$|R
50|$|The Western Metal Supply Co. building, a hundred-year old brick {{structure}} {{that had been}} scheduled for demolition {{to make way for}} Petco Park, was saved and incorporated into the design of the ballpark. The building was renovated and contains the team store, private suites, a restaurant and rooftop seating. The southeast corner of the building serves as the left field foul pole, and is protected by a strip of bright yellow <b>angle</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{alligator}} shear, historically {{known as}} a lever shear and sometimes as a crocodile shear, is a metal-cutting shear with a hinged jaw, powered by a flywheel or hydraulic cylinder. Alligator shears are generally set up as stand-alone shears; however, there are types for excavators. The jaw size can range from 4 to 36 in long. They are generally used to cut steel members, such as rebar, pipe, <b>angle</b> <b>iron,</b> or I-beams.|$|R
50|$|The {{new owners}} decided {{not merely to}} give the vessel a total refit. The keel, badly damaged during the grounding, was {{completely}} renewed along a length of 150 ft, and the owners {{took the opportunity to}} further strengthen the hull. The old keelsons were replaced and ten new ones laid, which ran {{the entire length of the}} keel. Both the bow and stern were also strengthened by heavy frames of double <b>angle</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Tent pegs may be {{manufactured}} from steel rod or wire, pressed flat steel, aluminium section, titanium alloy, <b>angle</b> <b>iron,</b> plastic, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polystyrene, or ABS plastic. [...] Steel tent pegs are typically zinc plated or stainless steel. Untreated metal tent pegs are available. Carbon fibre metal tipped tent pegs are also manufactured. Wooden tent pegs are now not common, with higher {{strength to weight}} ratio, and high durability, materials being used instead.|$|R
50|$|Some {{experiments}} were made before 1945 with reinforced concrete sleepers, {{in most cases}} with bullhead chairs mounted on them. This {{was in response to}} the very high price of the best (most durable) timber, but reinforced concrete sleepers were never successful in main line use. Concrete pots were also used in sidings; they are sometimes called twin-block sleepers, and consisted of two concrete blocks each mounted with a chair, and an <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> connecting them and retaining the gauge.|$|R
50|$|A damaged {{conveyor}} {{supported on}} a steel frame made of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> {{starts at the}} bottom of the crushing plant and slopes upward to end in mid-air above the remains of a screening plant. The belt of the conveyor is missing except for a portion at the upper end. This is draped over a wide pulley wheel at the very end of the conveyor. The pulley wheel is powered via a chain (still extant) and an electric motor mounted on a frame above it.|$|R
50|$|Three large crosses, {{visible from}} Interstate 40, mark the church’s location. The center cross is 150 ft high with two {{flanking}} crosses at 120 ft. The crosses are engineered to withstand 70 mph winds and are constructed of four pieces of structural steel and <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> painted white. The landmark crosses were dedicated {{at a special}} ceremony with choir, orchestra, and hundreds of church members at midnight on New Year’s Eve, 1999. In September 2008 the three crosses became the central image in the church logo.|$|R
50|$|Structural shapes can {{be rolled}} in {{different}} ways such as the “easy-way”, the “hard-way”, heel in/out, ball in/out, leg in/out, stem in/out, and off axis. The hard-way would be bending the workpiece in the orientation where its moment of inertia is the greatest. The easy-way is bending the workpiece along the axis with the smallest moment of inertia. For example, a piece of <b>angle</b> <b>iron</b> rolled the easy-way would be rolling it along one of its flanges, while the hard-way would be along the angle itself.|$|R
5000|$|The terms <b>angle</b> <b>iron,</b> channel iron, and {{sheet iron}} {{have been in}} common use since before wrought iron was {{replaced}} by steel for commercial purposes. They have lived on after the era of commercial wrought iron and are still sometimes heard today, informally, in reference to steel angle stock, channel stock, and sheet, despite that they are misnomers (compare [...] "tin foil" [...] still sometimes used informally for aluminum foil). In formal writing for metalworking contexts, accurate terms like angle stock, channel stock, and sheet are used.|$|R
