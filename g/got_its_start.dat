5|$|Pixar <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>start</b> in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who {{was also}} {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E

25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>start</b> in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G.

These courses are offered free of charge to students enrolled through a high school, but not to those in private or home schooling, or those who are out of state. This program <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>start</b> in the 1980s, when AP courses were offered through satellite schools to students in Virginia, mostly to those in rural areas without many other education options. The program became known as the Virginia Satellite Education Network (VSEN). That program got combined with Virtual Virginia Advanced Placement School to become what it is today.|$|E

5000|$|Before World War Two, Higgins <b>got</b> <b>its</b> big <b>start</b> {{with the}} design and {{production}} of small shallow-draft boats that were designed to be operated in the shallow marsh areas common to Louisiana. These small but fast boats were called Eureka Boats or Spoonbills, and they could impact partially submerged logs without suffering damage. The propeller was partially enclosed in a tunnel to protect it against submerged objects. The Spoonbill was the first design used for a personnel landing craft used by the US Navy, the LCPL, before the famous and much improved Higgins LCVP, the [...] "Higgins Boat" [...] was offered. These were the landing craft that were main type used on the invasion of Guadalcanal. Unfortunately, these first primitive landing craft (LCPL) required the landing party {{to go over the}} sides to exit the craft exposing them to enemy fire. But later in the war they were found extremely successful for combat engineer units, rescue, etc.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} for investigating {{of the effects}} of tamsulosine and doxazosine in vitro on trigone smooth muscle of rat bladder. Fifty rats which were 250 - 300 gr were used for this study. One strip shape trigone preparat was prepared for each of the isolated bladder. At first, 1 gram of strecth was applied to tissues and after waiting for training to media. Next, determination of the level of electrical stimulation which created submaximal contraction after training time and this stimulation was performed with adding different concentrations of phenylephrine. At the end of this process, effective dosage was found, for trigone was determined by applying different concentrations of phenylephrine (10 - 8 M, 10 - 7 M, 10 - 6 M, 10 - 5 M) respectively. Firstly 10 - 9 M dosage of doxazosine was added as a adrenergic receptor antagonists which tamsulosine (10 - 8 M, 10 - 7 M, 10 - 6 M, 10 - 5 M) and doxazosine (10 - 9 M, 10 - 8 M, 10 - 7 M, 10 - 6 M) and waited for 20 minute. Then, effective dosage of phenylephrine (10 - 5 M) was added to the solution and waited for 7 minute, again. After this process, electrical stimulation was applied for contraction of the tissue. After stimulation, tissue was washing once for every two minute twice and by resting, tissue was waited until it <b>got</b> <b>its</b> <b>starting</b> strecting value. Same processes were performed for tamsulosine and doxazosine other dosages. As a result, when we compared the amplitutes of the responses of all concentrations of doxazosine at trigone smooth muscle with amplitute of a response of effective concentration of phenylephrine. Alone, a decrease in the amplitites were found in the ration of 10 % (10 - 9 M), 14 % (10 - 8 M) 21 % (10 - 7 M), 28 % (10 - 6 M) respectively related to increase of concentration. Similarly, when we compared the amplitutes of the responses of all concentrations of tamsulosine with amplitute of a response of effective concentration of phenylephrine. Alone, a decrease in amplititues were found in the ration of 32 % (10 - 8 M), 37 % (10 - 7 M) 41 % (10 - 6 M), 46 % (10 - 5 M) respectively related to increase of concentration. Prevention of contractions which was done with tamsulosine hydrochloride more effectively than doxazosine mesylate was determined. With these results, we showed that doxazosine and tamsulosine inhibited noradrenaline based contractions at the rat trigone smooth muscle and this results can be used both for in vitro and in vivo for future studies...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the first}} state of the United States, Delaware was at the {{forefront}} of the creation in U.S. political parties. The origins of the Delaware Democratic Party can be traced back to the original anti-federalist party. While key difference divide this part from the Democratic Party today, key issues involving government involvement and ideologies such as Jeffersonian and Jacksonian can be linked to modern day ideals of the Delaware Democratic party. Yet, despite being one of {{the first state}}s with true parties, the spiritual predecessor of the Democratic party struggled to support its agenda in the state. It wasn't until the splitting of parties into federalists and Jacksonians that the Democratic party <b>got</b> <b>its</b> first true <b>start.</b> With only one bad loss in 1855 to the American Party, the Democratic Party dominated politics up until the end of Reconstruction in the United States. Most fascinating of all, was how the party maintained its popularity during the Civil War. Despite being a northern state, Delaware Democrats opposed the abolition of slavery and named themselves [...] "the white man's party" [...] as they fought the Republican congress during Reconstruction. With 36 years of election dominance, the Democrats eventually fell out of power due to one major factor, the growth of industry in the state.|$|R
