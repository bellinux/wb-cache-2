25|$|By May, Jennings had early {{versions}} of the new software running. These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include {{a list of all}} the known systems in that area, with instructions to <b>forward</b> <b>mail</b> to each of those nodes through node 10.

50|$|A smart host {{is a type}} of {{email message}} {{transfer}} agent that allows a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server to route email to an intermediate mailserver rather than directly to the recipient's server.

Common authentication techniques include SMTP Authentication and POP before SMTP.|$|E
