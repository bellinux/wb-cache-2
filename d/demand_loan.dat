40|$|Below {{market loans}} have been {{traditionally}} used as substitutes for gifts, salaries, and dividends {{for the primary}} purpose of tax avoidance in the transfer of wealth. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Dickman v. Commissioner subjected both <b>demand</b> and term <b>loans</b> in an intrafamilial setting to the federal gift tax.

40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{research}} has investigated the effects of short sale constraints, very little is understood about the origin of these constraints in the one-trillion-dollar equity lending market. Using a unique database comprising data from twelve lenders, we find significant dispersion in share loan fees across lenders, and we find that the dispersion is increasing in share loan demand and various proxies for search costs, including a stock’s illiquidity and the number of small lenders making loans. These findings are consistent with the existence of search frictions between share borrowers and lenders, as Duffie, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2002) suggest. We further analyze the effect of search frictions by examining the response of shorting cost to exogenous shocks in demand. We find that for stocks with moderate <b>demand,</b> <b>loan</b> fees are largely insensitive to demand shocks. However, for stocks with high demand, an increase in demand triples the already higher abnormal loan fees.

The key to Thom 2 ̆ 7 s argument is that, in the circumstances indicated, the aggregate demand curve does not shift. This, however, {{is no more than a}} mere hypothesis which does not, I think, possess much apriori appeal. If, after searching the market, an applicant finds that, because of generalised excess demand, there still remains a large discrepancy between what he/she can afford or is willing to pay (including all non-price terms of which the DR is one) and what is required by the building society, that person will clearly cease to actively search for a mortgage.

40|$|The {{importance}} of studying <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loan</b> by private business sector {{stems from the}} fact the money supply is ‘credit-driven’ and demand-determined and at the rate of interest determined by the central bank the money supply function is horizontal as illustrated by Moore and Threadgold (1985), Coghlan, (1981), Moore (1979, 1983). The analysis of the <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loan</b> by private business sector is important for understating the monetary transmission mechanism and formulation of the effective monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic objectives. The study aimed to model the <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loan</b> by private business sector in Pakistan. We use Hylleberg, et al., (1990) seasonal unit root test for investigation of properties of data. The dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is used for long rung and the short run analysis of <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loans</b> by the business sector. For the testing long run relationship among the variables we used bounds test proposed by Pasaran and Shin (1995). Real rate of return on advances, economic activity, expectations about future state of economy, macroeconomic risk, inflation and foreign demand pressure are taken as the determinants of <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loan</b> by private business sector. Economic activity, real rate of interest, macroeconomic risk and inflation were found significant in affecting <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loans</b> while the estimated equation do not provide evidence for the role of foreign demand pressure and expectations about future state of economy in effecting <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loans.</b> The sign of the coefficients of real rate of return on advances, inflation and macroeconomic risk is negative whereas economic activity is directly related to <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loans</b> by private business sector. The short run model shows that the speed of adjustment is 8. 5 % quarterly. Therefore it takes three years {{to go back to the}} long run equilibrium level. In the short run change in rate of inflation, RRA and economic activity have negative impact. The short run equation explores that change in real rate of return (RRA) does not affect RDBL. It implies that in very short run business cannot change their demand for bank credit in response to changes in real interest rate. Changing in macroeconomic risk appears in the model in form against a priori expectations. Foreign demand pressure (FDP) has no long run effect and in short run has the coefficient having low value. The <b>demand</b> for bank <b>loan</b> by private business sector was found interest elastic and gives the provision to central bank to control credit in the economy through variations of interest rate. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{gradually}} construct a monthly encompassing monetary model {{on the basis}} of its two constituting components: a money demand and a loan demand model. Each of the three models pays special attention to the intermediation role of banks by modelling the relation between the retail bank interest rates and the short-term market interest rate. The encompassing monetary model accounts for the possible interactions between money and loans induced by the intermediation role of the banking sector, which is represented in this paper by its interest rates setting behaviour. Our analysis indicates that, over the period January 1981 -September 2001, our monthly money demand model corroborates the existing quarterly evidence. The same does not hold for our loan demand model where a correcting variable for the mergers and acquisitions wave of 1999 - 2000 is added as an exogenous variable to stabilise the loan demand equation. Our encompassing monetary model rejects the frequently used assumption of complete separability in the pricing of loans and deposits. It provides also some evidence on the existence of a bank lending channel in the euro area, although there is some indication of a possible instability in the link between money and loans towards the end of the sample period. The estimation of the Structural-VECM highlights very rich dynamics in the system. The common trends method results in the identification of seven shocks: an aggregate supply shock, an inflation objective shock, an institutional shock, a money demand shock, a loan demand shock, a banking shock and a monetary policy instrument shock. The first three shocks are permanent shocks, responsible for the main variability in the macro-economic variables in the long run; while the last four shocks are temporary ones, affecting the economy only in the short and medium run.

40|$|The recent {{mortgage}} foreclosure crisis, whose economic effects are well known, transformed state legal structures governing the {{mortgage foreclosure}} process. What {{had been a}} relatively routine system of default judgments and auction sales {{has evolved into a}} negotiation and workout practice in which homeowners contest foreclosures, <b>demand</b> <b>loan</b> modifications and short sales, and propose other alternatives to foreclosures. A profusion of state laws and court orders were adopted between 2008 and 2014 with the aim of promoting negotiated foreclosure alternatives. These laws have produced a variety of experiments in the “laboratories of democracy. ” The defaults—whether home loans are renegotiated, defaults are cured, or homes are sold at auction—have varied tremendously among the states. We can now begin to assess the desirability of these new laws and procedures, and more importantly, identify the foreclosure reforms that merit wider adoption. One of the most effective legal innovations has been the use of mandatory pre-foreclosure mediation, introduced in about half the states during this period. The Uniform Home Foreclosure Procedures Act (UHFPA), approved by the Uniform Law Commission in 2015, incorporates permanent provisions for pre-foreclosure mediation in all residential mortgage foreclosure cases. The uniform law provisions are modeled on the most successful state programs and were drafted with the aid of judges, mediators, and attorneys with experience in several state foreclosure mediation programs. This article begins with a brief history of the foreclosure crisis and the progressive adoption of foreclosure mediation programs in various states. Next, it will summarize the empirical research and data measuring the effectiveness of those programs. Both the benefits of mediation and the costs, including delay, will be considered and compared. The article will then discuss the ways in which foreclosure mediation may or may not differ from conventional mediation standards embodied in the Uniform Mediation Act, and in particular, how and why courts enforce a duty to mediate in good faith. Finally, the mediation provisions of the new UHFPA and the case for their adoption will be presented...|$|E

Up to 75 % of new mothers experience the condition's mildest form, "baby blues" which may result from the rapid hormonal shifts that occur during postpartum period. These postpartum blues typically begin {{a few days after}} the baby's birth and generally resolve within two weeks. Tearfulness and depression mood are common features and are usually self-limiting. Women with "baby blues" often report feeling overwhelmed, anxious, irritable and sensitive. A more serious form of the disorder is referred to as postpartum depression. Post partum {{depression is}} a significantly more severe depressed mood than "baby blues" and often last much longer. It affects approximately 10 % of post partum mothers and is characterized by sadness, frequent crying, insomnia, appetite change, difficulty concentration or making decisions, feeling of inadequacy, and lack of interest in normal activities. Postpartum depression most often occurs around the fourth week after giving birth, just prior to resumption of menses, and after weaning; however, it may occur any time during the first postpartum year. Risk factors for postpartum depression include first birth, ambivalence about the pregnancy, lack of social support, economical problems, history of abortion, died infant, gender of infant, medical or surgical history, number of pregnancies, type of delivery, life stressor event, lack of partner, and a history of depression or another depression illness, and more. Study Objectives: The current study aims to: 1 - Analyze the risk factors contributing of PPD mothers in Saudi Arabia. 2 - Correlate between risk factors and postpartum depression. So it is of great value to conduct postpartum depression study, the most sensitive and unsearched well issue in our cutler and as health care providers in order to assess and investigate most important factors that affect post partum mothers in attempting their role in infant, family and self care. Result for instrument used were found as: The result obtained from sample socio-economical status factors and previous obstetrical history indicated strong relationship between postpartum depression and mothers in middle age group (37 %), unemployed (54 %), low education level and non professional (65 %). History of disease were found to be non with (96 %), family history of depression were non in most of the sample with (67 %). History of previous postpartum depression were found in (64 %) of sample and non of them were effected by any other psychological disease. Multi-Para (2 - 6 pregnancies) were found to be more effected by post partum depression (60. 5 %), as well as number of abortion (73 %). Data related to last pregnancy indicated that 85 % of them did not encounter any health problems during pregnancy and the remaining 14. 5 were affected by anemia. Most of the mothers came across problems during last delivery (52 %) with (75 %) of the problem associated with difficulty of labor. Newborn were 55 % not complaining of problems during last delivery. With normal birth weight 2200 mg- 2100 mg (69. 5 %). Majority of mothers did not diagnosed by antenatal depression during last pregnancy (53. 5 %) and the rest who diagnosed by antenatal depression (46. 5 %) were most diagnosed at third trimester (23 %). Type of last delivery indicated that cesarean section were more related to postpartum depression with 52. 5 % more than normal vaginal delivery, complications after delivery were found in 62. 5 % of mothers and the most common reason were breast inflammation and feeding problem. Father socioeconomic status studied in different country to show the relationship between father occupational, educational and family monthly income then by statistical method define the social level of family, the questioner help this study in identifying father relationship as essential factor in postpartum depression. Result indicted that 56. 5 % of father educational level were intermediate and primary, 78. 0 % were semi-profession or skilled worker and 51. 5 % of family monthly income were between 5000 to 7999. Final family social class shows that 82. 0 % of families were middle social class. Life stressor scale shows that all study sample 200 (100 %) have low stress event; this may indicate a critical issue that post partum depression can develop even in low life stress and it also can indicate that physiological changes and personality type of mothers can more affect in developing of postpartum depression than outside or environmental and social factors. The scale divided to 10 items each items as discussed contain several points, 105 points in total. Item related to giving birth e. g. mode of delivery, infant status, becoming pregnant, husband desire to get pregnant, fertility issue, got the highest mean score (18. 88) it indicate that women are more influenced by issues related to stress during pregnancy and delivery, followed by the scale attitude related to marriage e. g. enforced to get marred, relation with husband, separation from husband, with average mean (17. 91), and then the scale of attitudes related to money e. g. <b>Demand</b> <b>loan,</b> not able to pay loan, with average mean (17. 11). Signs and symptoms of depression mode were searched to identify most common indication for the disease. Mothers who thought that they ' don¡¦t feel happy' got highest mean score (4. 44). Mean of (4. 01) for both feeling of 'interrupted sleep either few or much sleeping' and mothers feel that' husband did not honored or respect them'. Mothers who feel anxious and can not relax got mean score of (3. 94). But no suicide or die thought were found in this sample. Other signs of postpartum depression were found with less mean e. g. perform all things slowly, future may be desperate, feeling guilt and deserve penalty, cant take decision, may not concern with important things, feel tired, feeling of emptiness, others like "am sure my husband mother did not love me ", "I feel my husband is punishing me because I get pregnant and deliver without his desire", "I have no concern with my child", were added to address our cultural concerns. Based on the study findings the following recommendations are suggested in providing care and preventing from postpartum depression in kingdom of Saudi Arabia: For Research: More research is n needed to: „h Assess life style / stress / environmental factors around family that can lead to postpartum depression. „h family awareness and practice which may predisposed or influenced women depression „h Health education program by maternity nurse or/and psychologist about physical and psychological changes during pregnancy are needed for women pre-conception, during pregnancy and during postnatal period. „h Provide books, websites, and phone discussion if needed. „h Continuing in-service training program for all nurses working in maternity departments and primary health care centers to enhance their awareness about different type of stressor in life which has effect on reproductive health and how family and mother can manage Community and Family: „h Group of home health care nurses, psychologist and social workers should visit mother at risk to assess, prevent and follow up her situation, and helping affected mother family / father to cope with disease.

They define credit constraints as a situation where rural agents report an unsatisfied <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> (formal or informal), which originates from rural agents having projects that are too risky or from impediments hindering the ability of rural agents and lenders to reduce information asymmetries. The authors find that the self-reported <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> is low. Nevertheless, the incidence of credit constraints is pervasive, especially among individual entrepreneurs. The low use of loans has consequences {{for the amount of}} investments that occur in the rural economy, posing a major obstacle to Mexico’s convergence towards its NAFTA partners.

40|$|In the posl-Keynesian {{approach}} to money, endogeneity has its {{origin in the}} demand for Ioans which in turn arises from frms' requirementsfor worhng capital whenever the cost and/or volume of planned output increases. Banl<s meet all creditworthy <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> and the central bank supplies lhe necessary reserves. Thus, bank lending (and the supply of new deposits) depen & critically upon the 'state of trade'. However a number of institutional changes have recently taken ploce. in the UK which call this sequence into question- Household demand has taken over from corporate demand as the major component in the aggrcgate demand for bank credit. Furthermore, we bzow that total transactions (including those on assets, intermediale and secondhand goods) have grown much more rapidly than GDP during the 1980 s. If credit is required {{for all types of}} transactions, we might therefore acpect the <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> to depend more directly on tolal transactions than on those rclated to outpul alone. This paper docwnents those institutional changes and considers some of lhe implicafions. I. hrboduaion The endogeneity of credit and money is central to the Post Keynesian view of the macroeconomy. Until now, dre source ofthe endogen€ity has alwals been identified as the costs and the volume of production. The behaviour of nominal output determines the demand for credit. The central bant sets the rediscount rate and commercial banks meet the whole of the creditworthy <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> at the rediscount rate plus a risk-related mark-up. The new loans create new deposits. The importance of nominal output as the origin of the <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> is ofien summarised by salng that <b>loan</b> <b>demand</b> is created by the 'state of trade'. We may take the following as typical. The single most important demand for credit is fron business firms. Companies bonow frmds short-ierm from banks primarily to meet their needs for increased working capital. This need arises because companies must pay their factors of production, in particular labor, before they receive the sales receipts from the goods and services produced, which take time to manufacture and sell.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{monetary}} policy channels in an imperfect competition framework of the banking sector. It emphasizes {{the relationship between the}} commercial banks rate and the lending rate of the central bank. The framework of imperfect competition is provided by the Salop [1979] model of horizontal differentiation which is applied to the banking sector and which is extended, to take account of the <b>loan</b> <b>demand</b> function elasticity. We shown that when the <b>loan</b> <b>demand</b> function is sufficiently convex (log convex), the banking sector exacerbates surprises in the monetary policy. This result is relevant for the efficiency of the monetary policy and for the behavior of the central bank when facing shocks of the <b>loan</b> <b>demand</b> function. Then, we study what should be the optimal implementation of the monetary policy when the central bank is concerned with both the price stability and the financial stability of the banking sector. In the model, the price stability is looked through an quantitative objective for the loans provided by the banking sector. We show that the trade-off between financial stability and price stability induces violent surprises in the monetary policy with respect to the volatility of the <b>loan</b> <b>demand</b> function. ...|$|R

By contrast, in the four years 1993 - 96 it rose moderately, and in real terms it diminished. The paper addresses some questions in the light of these trends: Was there a structural change in firms’ demand for credit after 1993 ? Are there systematic differences in the parameters of the <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> in the different parts of Italy? If such differences do exist, how have they influenced recent developments in credit? The evidence presented delineates a rather clear picture. At national level the <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> was stable during the observation period. The deceleration in lending is ascribable in small part (about 3 percentage points on an annualized basis) to the increase in the opportunity cost of loans; it was due largely (about 10 percentage points on an annualized basis) to the sizable decrease in business investment in relation to firms’ gross margins. The <b>demand</b> for <b>loans</b> displays differing characteristics in the different parts of Italy. In particular, its elasticity to interest rates was lower and its elasticity to investment higher in the North-East than in the other parts of the country. It is possible that changes occurred in the demand function in the North-West and the Centre. bank loans, Italy, regional...|$|R
