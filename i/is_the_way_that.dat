5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E

25|$|The charism (or spiritual focus) of the Carmelite Order is contemplation. Carmelites {{understand}} contemplation in a {{broad sense}} encompassing prayer, community, and service. These three elements {{are at the heart}} of the Carmelite charism. The most recent statement about the charism of Carmel was in the 1995 Constitutions of the Order, in which Chapter 2 is entirely devoted to the idea of charism. Carmel understands contemplation and action to be complementary, not contradictory. What is distinctive of Carmelites <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they practice the elements of prayer, community and service, taking particular inspiration from the prophet Elijah and the Blessed Virgin Mary, patrons of the Order.|$|E
25|$|Although {{concerns}} about shamateurism were widespread, {{the abolition of}} amateurism was actually the result of interaction by two irresistible forces. One was the tide of social change {{in the wake of}} the Second World War and the growth of a more egalitarian society in general. The other was the demand for dedicated professionalism in sports such as cricket and football that became increasingly conscious of their business obligations and the need to generate income through success on the field. An example of the latter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> cricket dropped the Gentlemen v Players fixture after amateurism was abolished in January 1963 and introduced the Gillette Cup limited overs knockout competition for primarily commercial reasons.|$|E

500|$|Cochrane {{considers}} feminism, {{the final}} tradition he examines, in chapter seven. As with Marxism, there are historical links between feminism and animal liberation. Cochrane considers the putative interrelatedness, posited by some feminist theorists, of {{the oppression of}} animals and women, but denies that the liberation of animals and women are necessarily interdependent. He {{suggests that there are}} four ways that this relationship could be grounded. The first is an idea taken from theorists drawing upon ecofeminism, like Josephine Donovan. This is the claim that the domination of women and animals are both due to a patriarchal elevation of the [...] "rational" [...] over the [...] "natural". The second is Carol J. Adams's argument that the connection of meat-eating and masculinity serves to oppress both women and animals, meaning that the liberation of both depends upon the end of meat-eating. The third is that, as identified by Adams and Catharine MacKinnon, women and animals are linked and oppressed by linguistic norms. For example, women might be called cow, bitch or dog, which serves to denigrate both woman and animals. The fourth <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> both animals and women are objectified, treated as mere things to be used towards the ends of others. Cochrane argues that women are not irrational, though animals are less rational than humans, meaning that the oppression and liberation of the two groups may differ. He challenges Adams's claims about meat by envisioning a vegetarian but misogynistic society {{on the one hand and}} a society where the genders are equal but meat continues to be eaten on the other. He challenges the claims about language by observing that some animal-based insults are gender-neutral (for example, rat, pig, sheep), and some slurs to women (for example, witch, jezebel, whore) are unrelated to animals. Concerning objectification, Cochrane notes that women are not considered property under the law, though animals are. This makes their respective objectification importantly different. Next, the author rebuts five criticisms of reason-based approaches—epitomised, for Cochrane, by Singer and Regan—to animal liberation from thinkers supportive of feminist care-based approaches, before outlining and rejecting an emotionally driven, care-based approach to animal justice.|$|E
