5|$|Jelena {{wrote her}} will on 25 November 1442. Based on its text {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that she <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> library and that in 1441 she told her chancellor Doberko Marinić to order a book cover. The book cover was made of silver and decorated with the image of Jesus. It was made by Andrija Izat, who was a famous goldsmith from Kotor.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck.

Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E

5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E
5|$|The new Queen of Hungary {{subjected}} herself {{entirely to}} her controlling mother-in-law, Elizabeth of Poland. The {{fact that the}} young queen's retinue consisted of the same individuals who had served the queen mother indicates that Elizabeth of Bosnia may not even have <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> court. Her mother-in-law's influence prevailed until 1370, when Louis succeeded his maternal uncle, CasimirIII, as King of Poland. Elizabeth's maternal uncle, Vladislaus the White, had also been {{a candidate for the}} Polish throne. Following his coronation in Poland, Louis brought Casimir's underage daughters, Anne and Hedwig, to be raised by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, though Queen of Poland, was never crowned as such.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the Inner Court varied over different periods, but by all accounts it was large. Each queen consort <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> household of around 200 to 300 women. Her various ladies-in-waiting were usually recruited from noble families; others were minor princesses who would also have a retinue of servants. Each minor wife or consort (เจ้าจอม; Chao Chom) had a fairly large household; this would increase significantly if {{she gave birth to}} the king's child, as she would be elevated to the rank of consort mother (เจ้าจอมมารดา; Chao Chom Manda). Each royal lady had a separate establishment, the size of which was in proportion to her rank and status in accordance with palace law. Altogether the {{population of}} the Inner Court numbered nearly 3,000 inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|Sophia Dorothea had {{a second}} child, a {{daughter}} named after her, in 1687, {{but there were no}} other pregnancies. The couple became estranged—George preferred the company of his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Sophia Dorothea, meanwhile, <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> romance with the Swedish Count Philip Christoph von Königsmarck. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and mother, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694 the Swedish count was killed, possibly with the connivance of George, and his body thrown into the river Leine weighted with stones. The murder was claimed to have been committed by four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers, one of whom (Don Nicolò Montalbano) was paid the enormous sum of 150,000 thalers, which was about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest paid minister. Later rumours supposed that Königsmarck was hacked to pieces and buried beneath the Hanover palace floorboards. However, sources in Hanover itself, including Sophia, denied any knowledge of Königsmarck's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Ernst of Bavaria expanded the local feud {{into a more}} German-wide phenomenon. The pope committed 55,000crowns to pay soldiers to fight for Ernst, and another 40,000directly into the coffers of the new Archbishop. Under the command of his brother, Ernst's forces pushed their way into Westphalia, threatening Gebhard and Agnes at their stronghold at Arensburg. Gebhard and Agnes escaped to the rebellious provinces of the Netherlands with almost 1000cavalry, where Prince William gave them a haven in Delft. There, Gebhard solicited the impecunious William for troops and money. After William's assassination in July 1584, Gebhard wrote to Queen Elizabeth requesting assistance. Elizabeth responded {{toward the end of}} 1585, directing him to contact Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, her deputy with the rebellious Dutch, and recently commissioned as the commander-in-chief of her army in the Netherlands. Elizabeth <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> problems with adherents of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{royal family}} left Europe {{and settled in}} colonial Brazil in 1808, after their escape from the Napoleonic {{invasion}} of Portugal. Carlota Joaquina, sister of FerdinandVII, was {{the wife of the}} Portuguese prince regent, but <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> political projects. As she avoided the later capture of the Spanish royal family, she attempted to take charge of the viceroyalty as regent. This political project, known as Carlotism, sought to prevent a French invasion of the Americas. A small secret society of criollos, composed of politicians such as Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, and military leaders such as Antonio Beruti and Hipólito Vieytes, supported this project. They considered it an opportunity to get a local government instead of a European one, or a step towards a potential declaration of independence. The project was resisted by Viceroy Liniers, most peninsulars, and some criollos, including Cornelio Saavedra and the lawyers Mariano Moreno and Juan José Paso. They suspected that it concealed Portuguese expansionist ambitions over the region. The supporters of Carlota Joaquina intended her to head a constitutional monarchy, whereas she wanted to govern an absolute monarchy; these conflicting goals undermined the project and led to its failure. Britain, which had a strong influence in the politics of the Portuguese Empire, opposed the project as well: they did not want Spain split into several kingdoms, and considered Carlota Joaquina unable to prevent this.|$|E
