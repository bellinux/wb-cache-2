5|$|There is no waxwork {{figure of}} <b>Jack</b> <b>the</b> Ripper at Madame Tussauds' Chamber of Horrors, unlike murderers of lesser fame, in {{accordance}} with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown.

5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as the murderer in the musical <b>Jack</b> <b>the</b> Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the <b>Jack</b> <b>the</b> Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E

Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as <b>Jack</b> <b>the</b> Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of <b>Jack</b> <b>the</b> Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being <b>Jack</b> <b>the</b> Ripper.|$|E
