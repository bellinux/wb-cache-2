50|$|However, {{the design}} of the {{carriages}} was not quite identical to 6 through 8AS, with some modifications from the original design not applied. For instance, the end <b>diaphragm</b> <b>units</b> did not have the flat aluminium ends applied, and the carriages were all fitted with varnished timber wall linings. A new change was the division of the toilet compartments {{at each end of the}} carriage into two smaller areas, thus separating the toilet from the sink. The carriage bodies were mostly welded, although when first built a line of rivets was visible along the bottom of the carriage body.|$|R
40|$|Foundation {{construction}} {{process has been}} an important key point in a successful construction engineering. The frequency of using diaphragm wall construction method among many deep excavation construction methods in Taiwan is the highest in the world. The traditional view of managing <b>diaphragm</b> wall <b>unit</b> in the sequencing of construction activities is to establish each phase of the sequencing of construction activities by heuristics. However, it conflicts final phase of engineering construction with unit construction and effects planning construction time. In order to avoid this kind of situation, we use management of science in the study of <b>diaphragm</b> wall <b>unit</b> construction to formulate multi-objective combinational optimization problem. Because the characteristic (belong to NP-Complete problem) of problem mathematic model is multi-objective and combining explosive, it is advised that using the 2 -type Self-Learning Neural Network (SLNN) to solve the N= 12, 24, 36 of <b>diaphragm</b> wall <b>unit</b> in the sequencing of construction activities program problem. In order to compare the liability of the results, this study will use random researching method in comparison with the SLNN. It is found that the testing result of SLNN is superior to random researching method in whether solution-quality or Solving-efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} different {{commercially available}} peristaltic and diaphragm micro-pumps {{suitable for the}} application in a portable/wearable artificial kidney and carries out their flow dynamic and ener- getic assessment in a specifically designed experimental rig. This analysis provides information on pres- sure and flow rate behaviours for developing control algorithms and data on energy consumption for increasing operation time of portable/wearing systems. Both the peristaltic and the <b>diaphragm</b> commer- cial <b>units</b> are able to cover the whole operative range of a portable/wearable artificial kidney. The peri- staltic units allow a more regular flow and a reduced level of noise and vibration, particularly at low and medium flow rates, whereas the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>units</b> are more compact and lightweight and they exhibit a superior energetic efficiency. The overall efficiency of the diaphragm pumps is 2 – 4 times {{higher than that of}} the peristaltic pumps those exhibit very poor efficiency, particularly at low rotation speed. The final assessment of the more suitable commercial micro-pump for this specific application requires fur- ther investigation concerning biocompatibility, hemolysis, sterilisation, reliability, and economic costs...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a method for fabricating a microfluidic device with integrated large-scale all-glass valves and constructed an actuator system to control each of the valves on the device. Such a microfluidic device has advantages that allow its use in various fields, including physical, chemical, and biochemical analyses and syntheses. However, it is inefficient and difficult to integrate the large-scale all-glass valves in a microfluidic device using conventional glass fabrication methods, especially for the through-hole fabrication step. Therefore, we have developed a fabrication method for the large-scale integration of all-glass valves in a microfluidic device that contains 110 individually controllable <b>diaphragm</b> valve <b>units</b> on a 30 mm × 70 mm glass slide. This prototype device was fabricated by first sandwiching a 0. 4 -mm-thick glass slide that contained 110 1. 5 -mm-diameter shallow chambers, each with two 50 -μm-diameter through-holes, between an ultra-thin glass sheet (4 μm thick) and another 0. 7 -mm-thick glass slide that contained etched channels. After the fusion bonding of these three layers, the large-scale microfluidic device was obtained with integrated all-glass valves consisting of 110 individual <b>diaphragm</b> valve <b>units.</b> We demonstrated its use as a pump capable of generating a flow rate of approximately 0. 06 – 5. 33 μL/min. The maximum frequency of flow switching was approximately 12 Hz...|$|R
40|$|DE 102009011239 A 1 UPAB: 20100925 NOVELTY - The cell has an anode-side {{electrode}} and a cathode-side electrode with a <b>diaphragm</b> electrode <b>unit,</b> and a <b>diaphragm</b> arranged {{between the}} electrodes. Distribution structures for fuel and oxidants are arranged at an anode-side and a cathode-side. The cathode-side distribution structure comprises fuel feed canals (4) and a capillary structure for an evacuation of product water by the cathode. Capillaries (3) of the capillary structure exhibit a hydraulic diameter, which permits evacuation {{of the product}} water by the capillaries using capillary force. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The fuel feed canals comprises oval, rectangular, square, hexagonal, triangular and star or trapezoidal cross section. The distribution medium consists of a hydrophilic coating, and a hydrophilic capillary material such as micro-porous foam, fabric, fleece, ceramics, metal, polymer or natural fiber. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for evacuation of the product water in a low-temperature fuel cell. USE - Low-temperature fuel cell. ADVANTAGE - The capillaries of the capillary structure exhibit the hydraulic diameter, which permits the evacuation of the product water by the capillaries by using capillary force, thus achieving efficient evacuation of the product water without impairing gas supply of the cathode, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} fuel cell during continuous operation, and hence improving the water management in the fuel cell...|$|R
40|$|Solar-powered {{water pumping}} is an {{inherently}} sensible proposition {{due to the}} pump being able to supply water at times when it is most in demand. In general small solar-thermal water pumps hold some promise for low technology applications in developing countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to model the characteristics of an appropriate technology water pump and build a concept-proving pump. A detailed computer model of the pump and flat plate collector gave the ability to optimise the pump's dimensions and predict the output for any average day in any location. An exergy analysis showed that the major losses in the system were due to wasteful processes within the pump's operating cycle. The pump took the form of a 450 mm diameter double <b>diaphragm</b> suction <b>unit</b> with a predicted operating efficiency of approximately 1 % when operating at 68 °C. The concept-proving pump was set up using compressed air and preliminary runs on pentane gave an efficiency of 0. 3 %. The pump takes water from 7 metres below to 1. 5 metres above the pump at a rate of 3 litres every 10 seconds. A financial analysis highlighted the fact that the solar pump has higher capital but lower running costs than some of its competitors, and as such would suit certain niche applications. Recommendations are to improve the physical lay-out of the pump and improve the design of several components to enable better performance of the pump operating on the same principle...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of diaphragmatic function {{is vital for}} successful extubation from mechanical ventilation. Recent studies have detected diaphragm atrophy in ventilated adults by using ultrasound, but no similar report has been conducted in children. In the current study, we hypothesized that mechanically ventilated children may also develop diaphragm atrophy and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Children who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and were newly intubated for mechanical ventilation were enrolled into this prospective case-control study. Diaphragm ultrasound assessments were performed daily to evaluate diaphragmatic function in the enrolled children until their discharge from the pediatric intensive care <b>unit.</b> <b>Diaphragm</b> thickness and the diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) were measured through these assessments. A total of 31 patients were enrolled, and overall, 1389 ultrasound assessments were performed. Immediately after intubation, the initial diaphragm thickness and DTF were measured to be 1. 94 ± 0. 44 mm and 25. 85 % ± 3. 29 %, respectively. In the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation, diaphragm thickness and the DTF decreased substantially and decreased gradually thereafter. After extubation, the DTF was significantly different between the successful and failed extubation groups (P < 0. 001), and a DTF value of < 17 % was associated with extubation failure. Diaphragm ultrasound is a noninvasive method for measuring diaphragmatic function in mechanically ventilated children. In this study, significant diaphragm atrophy and a decreased DTF were observed within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. The {{recovery of}} diaphragm thickness and the DTF may be a potential predictor of successful extubation from mechanical ventilation...|$|R
