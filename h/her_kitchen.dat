5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E
5|$|From 1950 onwards David {{was well}} known for her {{magazine}} articles and, in the 1960s and '70s, for <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> shop, but her reputation rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author's death in various formats in hardback and paperback have been compilations drawn from her existing works.|$|E

The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Stella Gwynne {{was not an}} uncaring mother, but her {{relations}} with her daughters were distant rather than affectionate. Elizabeth and her sisters, Priscilla, Diana and Felicité were sent away to boarding schools. Having been a pupil at Godstowe preparatory school, Elizabeth was sent to St Clare's Private School for Ladies, Tunbridge Wells, which she left {{at the age of}} sixteen. The girls grew up knowing nothing of cooking, which in upper-class households of the time was the exclusive province of the family's cook and <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> staff.|$|E

Down-to-earth Ada could sit in <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> on Bowman Street and be perfectly content with her life.

25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1861 the Soldiers' Relief Association was organized, with McCord as {{president}}. In July 1861, she was made president of the Ladies' Clothing Association. The first-named organization made the uniforms for the company of her son, Captain L. Cheves McCord, his mother furnishing the material. She resigned her presidency of the Soldiers' Relief Association in order to give her whole time to the military hospital established within the South Carolina College; this was in 1862, and here she gave her greatest service. In her home, at the northwest corner of Pendleton and Bull streets, {{across the street from the}} college property, she received supplies from the women of the city -— supplies available for nourishment for the sick, and hospital comfort. Early every day, there was made in <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> a supply of corn bread and broth, heaped into plates and left on a long dresser on her back piazza, served day after day as the nourishment for wounded soldiers who could drag themselves across the street from the convalescent building on the campus.|$|E
25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in <b>her</b> <b>kitchen</b> tin.|$|E

500|$|As Mimi {{refused to}} have a record player in her house, Lennon learned how to play his {{favourite}} songs by going to Julia's house.

After each song she would clap and whistle louder than everyone else and was seen [...] "swaying and dancing" [...] throughout the whole concert. Lennon frequently visited her house during that period, detailing his anxieties and problems, where she gave him encouragement to continue with music over Mimi's objections.|$|E
500|$|The book is in two parts.

In these chapters, David writes about {{the background of the}} herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe. The Times Literary Supplement called this part of the book [...] "as difficult to put down as a good thriller." ...|$|E
