500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years old, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E
500|$|In late 1910, the new {{government}} introduced legislation to revoke the A's charter and confiscate the proceeds {{from the sale of}} bonds, which were still held by the province. [...] In introducing the bill, Sifton made no commitment as to what would be done with the funds once confiscated. [...] Many northern MLAs, including Cornwall and Cross, suspected that the Premier's plans for the money did not include construction of a northern railway, and opposed the bill on that basis. [...] Clarke re-surfaced in Winnipeg to deny Sifton's charge that the A had defaulted on any of its obligations, and Conservative leader Bennett opposed the confiscation out of stated respect for private property: [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will allow this province to take his property 'without due process of law'." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{speaking}} of A President William Clarke (an American), Bennett {{went on to}} say [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law." [...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? [...] The answer came in December, when the bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. [...] Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

Due to very long hours at his accounting job, often going from 7 am to 6 pm {{six days a}} week, White most often photographed his subjects just after dawn and just before dusk. Once he wrote [...] "My photographs were less sharp than others and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was because of the}} lens so much as the conditions under which the photographs were made ‒ never in the studio, always in the home or in the open, and when out of doors at a time of day very rarely selected for photography." [...] He also shared an intimate familiarity with his subjects, who most often were his wife, her three sisters and his own children.|$|E

2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{accounts}} of the Spix in captivity was given by Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "I have not yet seen a good-tempered Spix... My Spix, which is really more a Conure than a Macaw, will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on sunflower seed. It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> eats much of any of them. It barks {{the branches of the}} tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet has had. But I expect it would not eat any sop, even if I gave it nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elbegdorj stated [...] "Capital {{punishment}} is wrong–it degrades human dignity. It brings no peace to society. It does not deter crime {{and does not}} lift up mankind," [...] in [...] at the High-Level Meeting on the Rule of Law of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2012. [...] "By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more {{country in the world}} community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe, and must be just. However, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of state. The right to life is one of the fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state. The state should respect very fundamental human rights, and secure them by law," [...] Elbegdorj pointed out in [...] to the delegation of the 5th international meeting of Justice Ministers on 18 May 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious.

2500|$|On 24 August 2009, Lockerbie campaigner Dr Jim Swire {{wrote to}} Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, {{calling for a}} full inquiry, {{including}} the question of suppression of the Heathrow evidence. This was backed up by a delegation of Lockerbie relatives, led by Pamela Dix, who went to 10 Downing Street on 24 October 2009 and handed over a letter addressed to Gordon Brown calling {{for a meeting with}} the Prime Minister to discuss the need for a public inquiry and the main issues that it should address. An op-ed article by Pamela Dix, subtitled [...] "The families of those killed in the bombing have not given up hope of an inquiry to help us learn the lessons of this tragedy", was published in The Guardian on 26 October 2009. On 1 November 2009, it was reported that Gordon Brown had ruled out a public inquiry into Lockerbie, saying in response to Dr Swire's letter: [...] "I understand your desire to understand the events surrounding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be appropriate for the UK government to open an inquiry of this sort." [...] UK ministers explained that it was for the Scottish government to decide if it wants to hold its own, more limited, inquiry into the worst terrorist attack on British soil. The Scottish government had already rejected an independent inquiry, saying it lacks the constitutional power to examine the international dimensions of the case.|$|E
