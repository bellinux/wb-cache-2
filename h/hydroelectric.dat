5|$|Much of the {{electricity}} generated by Hydro-Québec Generation comes from <b>hydroelectric</b> dams located far from load centres such as Montreal. Of the 33,000MW of electrical power generated, over 93% of that comes from <b>hydroelectric</b> dams and 85% of that generation capacity comes from three <b>hydroelectric</b> generation centers: James Bay, Manic-Outardes, and Churchill Falls.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest of}} the 150 <b>hydroelectric</b> projects, the Grand Coulee Dam and the Chief Joseph Dam, are also {{the largest in the}} United States. As of 2017, Grand Coulee is the fifth largest <b>hydroelectric</b> plant in the world.|$|E
5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of <b>hydroelectric</b> power are directly related to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via <b>hydroelectric</b> power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting. In 2009 Iceland built its biggest <b>hydroelectric</b> project to date, a 690 MW <b>hydroelectric</b> plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant. This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|After the war Matthais went to Brazil, {{where he}} helped build a <b>hydroelectric</b> facility. He joined the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1951, and was {{involved}} in the construction of its Kemano-Kitimat <b>hydroelectric</b> dam and aluminum smelter project in northern British Columbia and the Chute-des-Passes project in Quebec. He was a vice president at Kaiser Engineering from 1960 to 1973.|$|E
5|$|Below the dam {{the river}} flows west, passing the mostly dry Lower Klamath Lake {{bed and the}} <b>hydroelectric</b> John C. Boyle Dam. The Klamath River then enters California, where it passes through three more <b>hydroelectric</b> plants and turns south {{near the town of}} Hornbrook towards Mount Shasta. However, the river soon swings west to receive the Shasta River and the Scott River, {{entering}} a long canyon through the Klamath Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Other major dams in the Willamette {{watershed}} {{are owned}} by other interests; for example, several <b>hydroelectric</b> facilities on the Clackamas River {{are owned by}} Portland General Electric. They include the River Mill <b>Hydroelectric</b> Project, the Oak Grove project, and the dam at Timothy Lake.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} project was {{initially}} built for <b>hydroelectric</b> power generation to meet the mining requirements, it has over the years evolved into a multipurpose reservoir with benefits of power generation, drinking water and fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for <b>hydroelectric</b> development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest <b>hydroelectric</b> station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|Iceland is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to create an economy {{generated}} through industries fueled by renewable energy, and there is still a large amount of untapped <b>hydroelectric</b> energy in Iceland. In 2002 it was estimated that Iceland only generated 17% of the total harnessable <b>hydroelectric</b> energy in the country. Iceland’s government believes another 30 TWh of hydropower every year could be produced, whilst taking into account the sources that must remain untapped for environmental reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{renewable}} energy, primarily geothermal and <b>hydroelectric</b> power, generated 40.1% of New Zealand's {{gross energy}} supply. Geothermal power alone accounted for 22% of New Zealand's energy in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 29 February 2016, Zinta {{married her}} long-time American partner Gene Goodenough {{at a private}} {{ceremony}} in Los Angeles. Goodenough is Senior Vice-President for Finance at NLine Energy, a US-based <b>hydroelectric</b> power company.|$|E
5|$|Other charter flights include heliskiing shuttles, {{services}} for the energy industry such as facilitating oil exploration or surveying for <b>hydroelectric</b> stations and environmental research counting polar bears and tracking other large Arctic fauna.|$|E
5|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Russia mainly {{consists}} of <b>hydroelectric</b> energy. The {{country is the}} sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world, although it is 56th when <b>hydroelectric</b> energy is not taken into account. Some 179TWh of Russia's energy production comes from renewable energy sources, {{out of a total}} economically feasible potential of 1823TWh. 16% of Russia's electricity is generated from hydropower, and less than 1% is generated from all other renewable energy sources combined. Roughly 68% of Russia's electricity is generated from thermal power and 16% from nuclear power.|$|E
5|$|Settlement of Labrador {{followed}} a similar pattern, with the interior being settled {{only in the}} latter part of the 20th century with the development of the iron ore mines at Wabush, <b>hydroelectric</b> generation at Churchill Falls and the military base at Goose Bay.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lanka's {{electricity}} demand is currently met by nine thermal power stations, fifteen large <b>hydroelectric</b> power stations, and fifteen wind farms, {{with a smaller}} share from small hydro facilities and other renewables such as solar. Most <b>hydroelectric</b> and thermal/fossil fuel–based power stations {{in the country are}} owned and/or operated by the government via the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), while the renewable energy sector consists mostly of privately run plants operating on a power purchase agreement with the CEB.|$|E
5|$|The Croton Dam and <b>hydroelectric</b> {{plant is}} owned and {{operated}} by Consumers Energy, an electric power company headquartered in Jackson, Michigan. Croton generated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity in 2006, which would satisfy the annual electric consumption of about 6,000 residential customers.|$|E
5|$|The Manic-Outardes river {{area in the}} Côte-Nord or North Shore region {{consists}} of several <b>hydroelectric</b> facilities located on three principal rivers, from west to east: Betsiamites River, Rivière aux Outardes, and the Manicouagan River. A single plant named Sainte-Marguerite-3 is located to the east on the Sainte-Marguerite River. The facilities located in the region were constructed {{over a period of}} five decades, from 1956 to 2005. The total generation capacity from these power stations is 10,500MW. A 21-MW <b>hydroelectric</b> power station, the Lac-Robertson generating station on the Lower North Shore, is not connected to the main Quebec grid.|$|E
5|$|The Pensacola Dam, {{also known}} as the Grand River Dam, is a multiple-arch {{buttress}} dam on the Grand River in-between Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. After decades of vision and planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of <b>hydroelectric</b> power generation, flood control and recreation. It is Oklahoma's first <b>hydroelectric</b> power plant and {{is referred to as the}} longest multiple-arch dam in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its upper reaches (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for <b>hydroelectric</b> power generation due to the steep gradient in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of <b>hydroelectric</b> power stations began before World War II, it significantly increased following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 kilowatt JR East Shinano River Hydropower Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|The largest dams in Russia are the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam, {{which has}} an {{installed}} capacity of 6,400MW; the Krasnoyarsk Dam (6,000MW); the Bratsk Dam (4,500MW); the Ust-Ilimsk Dam (4,320MW) and the Zeya Dam (1,330MW). Some {{of the most recent}} dam projects are the Bureya Dam (2010MW) and the Irganai Dam (800MW). The Boguchany Dam (1920MW), Zelenchuk Dam (320MW), Zaramag Dam (352MW) and Nizhne-Chereksky (60MW) are currently under construction. RusHydro is the largest <b>hydroelectric</b> company in Russia and the second largest <b>hydroelectric</b> producer in the world. In October 2010, China Yangtze Power, the largest hydropower corporation in China, and EuroSibEnergo, a Russian energy company, signed a cooperation agreement to expand <b>hydroelectric</b> energy production in Russia and export energy to China's northern territories. The West Siberian Generating Company has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the Altai region before 2015.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Japan's oldest <b>hydroelectric</b> {{power plant}} {{is located in}} the Shinano River system. The Miyashiro Power Plant No. 1 was opened by the Azumi Electric Power Company in 1904 and has, since then, been in continual operation, {{currently}} operated by Chubu Electric Power Company.|$|E
5|$|Childs-Irving was {{the first}} <b>hydroelectric</b> power plant built in Arizona, and in 1920 it was {{supplying}} as much as 70percent of the power used by Phoenix. The complex was named an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1976 and a National Historic District in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Critics have {{objected to}} {{the killing of the}} sea lions, {{pointing}} out that the level of mortality permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of <b>hydroelectric</b> dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{and natural}} gas are {{provided}} by Manitoba Hydro, a provincial crown corporation headquartered in the city; it uses primarily <b>hydroelectric</b> power. The primary telecommunications carrier is MTS, although {{a number of other}} corporations offer telephone, cellular, television and internet services in the city.|$|E
5|$|Fields opposed a plan {{to develop}} <b>hydroelectric</b> power {{generation}} capabilities on the Cumberland Falls. In order to prevent development, he accepted an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the property around the falls and donate it to the state. He also suggested the creation of Carter Caves State Resort Park in his home county.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec's {{electricity}} transmission system {{is an international}} power transmission system centred in Quebec, Canada. The system pioneered the use of very high voltage 735kV alternating current (AC) power lines that link the population centers of Montreal and Quebec City to distant <b>hydroelectric</b> power stations like the Daniel-Johnson Dam and the James Bay Project in northwestern Quebec and the Churchill Falls Generating Station in Labrador.|$|E
5|$|I-84 {{follows the}} Weber River into Weber Canyon, Morgan County, and the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. Once in the canyon, the carriageways {{of the highway}} split to {{accommodate}} the Devil's Gate-Weber <b>Hydroelectric</b> Power Plant. Following the river south, I-84 exits the forest and enters the county seat of Morgan. Leaving the city the highway turns back east, passing Devil's Slide, an unusual rock formation just off the freeway.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, a dam in the {{northern}} portion of the park was proposed. Located in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, its purpose was to provide water and <b>hydroelectric</b> power to San Francisco. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the Raker Act.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017, after heavy {{fighting}} damaged the {{main control panel}} at the dam and disabled the <b>hydroelectric</b> power station, ISIL warned of the imminent collapse of the Tabqa Dam, during a joint US/SDF operation to capture the dam. SDF forces announced they captured the dam on 10 May 2017.|$|E
5|$|Much of Quebec's {{population}} {{is served by}} a few 735kV power lines. This contributed to {{the severity of the}} power outage following the North American ice storm of 1998. The extent and duration of this blackout has generated criticism of the transmission system, and there is controversy concerning the use of <b>hydroelectric</b> dams.|$|E
5|$|One of Hareide's last {{actions in}} office was {{to approve the}} {{construction}} of a <b>hydroelectric</b> power plant in the Hatteberg watershed in Kvinnherad, a protected natural area. Most of the criticism went to his successor, Helen Bjørnøy, who neglected to roll back the decision when assuming office. She eventually resigned halfway into her term.|$|E
5|$|Pumped-storage {{hydroelectricity}} stores {{energy in}} the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a <b>hydroelectric</b> power generator.|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{liquid water}} {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for <b>hydroelectric</b> power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on those resources for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, means it has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that Russia has, 44GW comes from hydroelectricity, 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by <b>hydroelectric</b> power stations. Some of Russia's <b>hydroelectric</b> power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, as shown by the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Since 1750, the Columbia has {{experienced}} six multi-year droughts. The longest, lasting 12years in the mid‑19th century, reduced the river's flow to 20percent below average. Scientists {{have expressed concern}} that a similar drought would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia. In 1992–1993, a lesser drought affected farmers, <b>hydroelectric</b> power producers, shippers, and wildlife managers.|$|E
