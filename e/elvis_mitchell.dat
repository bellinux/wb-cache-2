500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{believed}} [...] "the {{actors in}} the nonhuman roles are mostly too buried by makeup to make strong impressions.

[...] "Planet of the Apes shows that taking material too seriously can be {{as much of a}} handicap as not taking it seriously at all." [...] <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times gave a more favorable review, feeling the script was balanced and the film served its purpose as [...] "pure entertainment". Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today enjoyed Planet of the Apes, feeling most of the credit should go to prosthetic makeup designer Rick Baker.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the film}} community, he {{is better known}} {{for the success of}} the director's cut of the film that premiered at the 2015 Berlin International Film Festival.

500|$|The first trailer {{appeared}} in theaters and was made available via the official website in early May 2000, over nine {{months before the}} film's release.

500|$|Jolie next starred {{opposite}} Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), {{the first}} of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with [...] "soft-core nonsense." [...] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salons Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance [...] "doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'". Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress; in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.|$|E
500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reviewed}} {{a host of}} Westerns from 1992 and 1993 {{and said}} that Brisco was [...] "the most sheer fun of the bunch", calling it [...] "a period piece with slick production values and a mix of drama and humor, fast pace and high camp". In {{an article on the}} 1993 television season, the Toronto Stars Greg Quill wrote that Brisco was a program that represented [...] "American TV craft at the top of its form". In contrast, <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of Spin magazine gave Brisco a scathing review, calling the show's premise a [...] "tedious... rickety gimmick". Mitchell acknowledged the show's [...] "quick reflexes", but said the humor was [...] "uncomfortable" [...] with a [...] "cynical quickness". He added, [...] "Brisco County relieves us of the burden of laughing. It spends too much time looking at itself in the mirror, admiring its own adorable dimpled half-smile." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a full four stars, praising {{the film and}} Miyazaki's direction. Ebert also said that Spirited Away was one of [...] "the year's best films." [...] <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times {{positively}} reviewed the film and praised the animation sequences. Mitchell also drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and also said that his movies are about [...] "moodiness as mood" [...] and the characters [...] "heightens the [...] tension." [...] Derek Elley of Variety said that Spirited Away [...] "can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike" [...] and praised the animation and music. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised the voice acting and said the film is the [...] "product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before". Turan also praised Miyazaki's direction. Orlando Sentinels critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki's direction and said the film is [...] "the perfect choice for {{a child who has}} moved into a new home." ...|$|E
500|$|In Audition, the {{character}} of Asami {{is a victim of}} child abuse. Colette Balmain, in her book Introduction to Japanese Horror Film, described Asami as [...] "just one more face of the wronged women in Japanese culture... They are victims of repression and oppression, and only death and loneliness remain for them". [...] " [...] The film critic Robin Wood wrote that through her child abuse, Asami is taught that love and pain must be inseparable. The audience is led to identify with Asami through this victimization and also what Stephen LeDrew described as a [...] "patriarchal Japanese society". <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> (The New York Times) stated that the theme of the film was: [...] "the objectification of women in Japanese society and the mirror-image horror of retribution it could create". Tom Mes suggested that these themes can be witnessed in the scene where Asami feeds her mutilated prisoner and then turns into the childhood version of herself and pets him like a dog. Mes concludes that this is done to suggest that what had happened in Asami's life had made her the violent adult seen in the film.|$|E
500|$|Rita Kempley of The Washington Post commented: [...] "A million monkeys with {{a million}} crayons would be hard-pressed {{in a million years}} to create {{anything}} as cretinous as Battlefield Earth. This film version of L. Ron Hubbard's futuristic novel is so breathtakingly awful in concept and execution, it wouldn't tax the smarts of a troglodyte." [...] <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times wrote: [...] "It may be a bit early to make such judgments, but Battlefield Earth may well {{turn out to be the}} worst movie of this century" [...] and called it [...] "Plan 9 from Outer Space for a new generation." [...] The British film critic Jonathan Ross said: [...] "Everything about Battlefield Earth sucks. Everything. The over-the-top music, the unbelievable sets, the terrible dialogue, the hammy acting, the lousy special effects, the beginning, the middle and especially the end." [...] The Hollywood Reporter summarized the film as being [...] "a flat-out mess, by golly, with massive narrative sinkholes, leading to moments of outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly chaotic mise en scène that's accompanied by ear-pummeling sound and bombastic music." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Aaliyah landed {{her first}} film role in Romeo Must Die, {{released}} March 22, 2000. Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing {{a couple who}} fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to [...] "make it easier on" [...] herself, but she heard [...] "that people {{were able to get}} into me, which is what I wanted." [...] In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was [...] "a natural" [...] and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, [...] "they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character [...] "as a victimized female" [...] but instead [...] "as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate." ...|$|E
500|$|Minority Report is {{a futuristic}} film which portrays {{elements}} of a both dystopian and utopian future. The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick's story. From a stylistic standpoint, Minority Report resembles Spielberg's previous film A.I., but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he [...] "wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. Asphalt Jungle. Key Largo. The Maltese Falcon." [...] The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son's kidnapping at the pool {{is the only one}} shot in [...] "normal" [...] color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film's colors, {{to the point that it}} nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by [...] "about 40%" [...] to achieve the [...] "washed-out" [...] appearance. <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> formerly of The New York Times, commented that [...] "he picture looks as if it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late '70s car." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time magazine, {{considered}} the film a [...] "by the numbers adaptation," [...] criticising {{the pace and}} the [...] "charisma-free" [...] lead actors. CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves [...] "are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative {{is more like a}} jamboree inside Rowling's head." [...] Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: [...] "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is as bland as movies can get." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography [...] "bland and muggy," [...] and the majority of the film a [...] "solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo." [...] <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying [...] " [...] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve." [...] He also said it suffered from [...] "a lack of imagination" [...] and wooden characters, adding, [...] "The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC's review, {{written by}} Susan Hodgetts, {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "... a superior British costume drama that expertly mixes art history with romantic fiction ...," [...] which would appeal to [...] "... anyone who likes serious, intelligent drama and gentle erotic tension." [...] Hodgetts said that both Firth and Johansson gave [...] "excellent" [...] performances who did [...] "... a grand job of expressing feelings and emotions {{without the use of}} much dialogue, and the picture is the better for it." [...] <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times called the film an [...] "... earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh." [...] Mitchell did however laud its cinematography, production design, and musical score, as did the Film Journal Internationals Erica Abeel. Despite praising its visuals, Abeel criticized Girl with a Pearl Earring for being [...] "... a chick flick dressed up in Old Master clothes ..." [...] and for failing [...] "... to render Griet's growing artistic sensibility dramatically credible." [...] She cited its melodramatic villains as another failing, but concluded that it was [...] "... to Johansson's credit that she alone pulls something plausible out of her character." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell's next American films, American Outlaws (2001) and Hart's War (2002), {{were not}} commercially successful. His 2002–2003 films, {{including}} Phone Booth, The Recruit and S.W.A.T. (all thrillers, {{with the former}} two his first starring roles), were well received by critics and successful at the box office. Of Phone Booth, Ebert wrote that it is [...] "Farrell's to win or lose, since he's onscreen most of the time, and he shows energy and intensity". Philip French of The Observer praised Farrell's performance. In S.W.A.T., the actor starred in an ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, Olivier Martinez and Jeremy Renner; Renner became a friend. Alan Morrison of Empire wrote, [...] "Farrell can usually be relied upon to bring a spark to the bonfire. That's also true of [...]" [...] <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of the New York Times criticised Farrell's accent, writing that he [...] "employ a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal {{a step ahead of}} the authorities". Ebert and the New York Timess A.O. Scott disagreed on the actor's effectiveness in The Recruit; Ebert noted the actor's likability, but Scott felt that Farrell [...] "spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy, trying to maintain his leading-man sang-froid while registering panic, stress and confusion". Phone Booth earned $46.6million, S.W.A.T. $116.9million and The Recruit $52.8million at the box office.|$|E
500|$|The {{first of}} these was Daredevil (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a {{longtime}} comic book fan, and had written a foreword for Kevin Smith's Guardian Devil (1999) about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times said Affleck was [...] "lost" [...] in the role: [...] "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor." [...] In 2014, Affleck described Daredevil as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy Gigli (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times remarking that [...] "Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material." [...] Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director Marty Brest since the film's release, describing him as [...] "one of the really great directors". In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a reverse engineer in the sci-fi thriller Paycheck (2003). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked on Affleck's [...] "self-deprecating charm" [...] and wondered why {{he could not find}} better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found it [...] "almost unfair" [...] to critique Affleck, given that he [...] "had such a rough year".|$|E
500|$|Particularly-negative reviews {{included}} that of The New York Times <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> {{who said}} the film was [...] "second-rate and ordinary," [...] while Variety's Todd McCarthy considered it [...] "a pretender {{in the realm of}} bona-fide superheroes." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "C-", criticizing the story as [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "slipshod", saying, [...] "Daredevil is the sort of half-assed, visually-lackadaisical potboiler that makes you rue the day that comic-book franchises ever took over Hollywood." [...] Time Outs Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck, feeling he [...] "persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing," [...] but also felt writer/director Johnson's construction fails all involved in the film. Slates David Edelstein believed Johnson copied a lot of Batman, and concluded by saying [...] "that's not so bad: The movie looks best when it looks like other, better movies." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention, but felt it does not reward it. The New York Posts Lou Lumenick panned the film, describing it as a [...] "mind-numbing, would-be comic-book franchise, which often seems as blind as its hero -- not to mention deaf and dumb." [...] Character co-creator Stan Lee himself felt, [...] "hey just wrote the whole thing wrong. They made him too tragic." [...] Ben Affleck won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his work in the movie, as well as for Gigli and Paycheck.|$|E
500|$|While critics {{had mixed}} {{reactions}} to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. Roger Ebert gave Atlantis three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's [...] "clean bright visual look" [...] and the [...] "classic energy of the comic book style", crediting this {{to the work of}} Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, [...] "The story of Atlantis is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way, but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself {{as one of the great}} animated action sequences." [...] In The New York Times, <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> gave high praise to the film, calling it [...] "a monumental treat", and stated, [...] "Atlantis is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove." [...] Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, [...] "On the whole, Atlantis offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division." [...] Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote positively of the film's approach for an older audience: [...] "But just beneath the surface, Atlantis brims with adult possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer {{throughout}} pre-production of {{the action}} thriller Reindeer Games (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having [...] "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've {{been doing this for}} a long time and he's really one of the nicest." [...] He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: [...] "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated [...] In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "understated intensity and exquisite detail" [...] of his performance: [...] "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{has been}} called [...] "one of the most {{exciting}} talents to come along in years" [...] and [...] "among the supreme talents of today." [...] After the release of Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson was praised as a wunderkind. In his 2002 interview with Jan Aghed, the director Ingmar Bergman referenced Magnolia {{as an example of the}} strength of American cinema. In 2004, Anderson was ranked twenty-first on The Guardian's list of the forty best living filmmakers. In 2007, Total Film named him the twentieth greatest director of all time and the American Film Institute regarded him as [...] "one of American film's modern masters." [...] In 2012, The Guardian ranked him number one on its list of [...] "The 23 Best Film Directors in the World," [...] writing [...] "his dedication to his craft has intensified, with his disdain for PR and celebrity marking him out as the most devout filmmaker of his generation." [...] In 2013, Entertainment Weekly named him the eighth-greatest working director, calling him [...] "one of the most dynamic directors to emerge in the last 20 years." [...] In a podcast interview with critic <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> director Sam Mendes referred to Anderson as [...] "a true auteur – and there are very few of those who I would classify as geniuses", and Ben Affleck in his acceptance speech for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director said [...] "Paul Thomas Anderson, who I think is like Orson Welles." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "The Master, the sixth film from the 42-year-old writer-director, affirms his position as the foremost filmmaking talent of his generation. Anderson is a rock star, the artist who knows no limits." [...] As of 2016, Anderson is the only person to win all three director prizes from the three major international film festivals (Cannes, Berlin, Venice).|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale's second film {{appearance}} of 2001 {{was in the}} romantic comedy Serendipity as the love interest of John Cusack. It was filmed directly after Pearl Harbor and Beckinsale found it [...] "a real relief to return to something slightly more familiar." [...] Turan praised the [...] "appealing and believable" [...] leads, adding that Beckinsale [...] "reinforces the strong impression she made in Cold Comfort Farm, The Golden Bowl, and The Last Days of Disco" [...] after [...] "recovering nicely" [...] from her appearance in the much-maligned Pearl Harbor. Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that [...] "Beckinsale's talents haven't been mined as effectively in any other film since Cold Comfort Farm." [...] McCarthy found her [...] "energetic and appealing" [...] while <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times described her as [...] "luminous but determined." [...] In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Ebert described her as [...] "a good actress, but {{not good enough to}} play this dumb." [...] The film has grossed over $77 million at the worldwide box office. In 2002 Beckinsale starred in Lisa Cholodenko's Laurel Canyon as a strait-laced academic who finds herself increasingly attracted to her free-spirited future mother-in-law. The independent film was another opportunity for Beckinsale to work with Christian Bale, her Prince of Jutland co‑star. She found their sex scene awkward because she knew Bale well: [...] "If it was a stranger, it would have been easier." [...] While Frances McDormand's performance as Bale's mother was widely praised, Beckinsale received negative reviews. Holden found the film [...] "superbly acted, with the exception of Ms.Beckinsale, whose tense, colourless Alex conveys no inner life." [...] Schwarzbaum was unimpressed by the [...] "tedious" [...] characters and criticized [...] "the fussy performances of Bale and Beckinsale" [...] in particular. The film has grossed over $4million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote [...] "DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name {{to trust}} for imaginative, funny {{animated}} movies that delight kids and adults equally." [...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek {{is the sort of}} unlikely hero that nobody could love -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic <b>Elvis</b> <b>Mitchell</b> has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E
