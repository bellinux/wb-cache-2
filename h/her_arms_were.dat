5|$|On 11 February 2010, Romania's Violeta Strămăturaru {{was knocked}} {{unconscious}} after hitting several walls during a training run. She was {{strapped to a}} backboard and placed on a stretcher though <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> moving. Strămăturaru withdrew before the women's singles event.|$|E
25|$|Princess Paola of Belgium {{was never}} {{turned away from}} an {{audience}} with Pope John XXIII. While on a private trip to Rome as a tourist whose identity was unknown she went to St. Peter's Basilica. An attendant declined her admittance because <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> uncovered. Vatican protocol did not allow women with uncovered arms to enter the basilica. Neither the attendant nor the Vatican {{knew at the time}} that the tourist was a member of the Belgian Royal Family (and future queen). When the Pope discovered what had happened he apologised and invited her to an audience.|$|E
500|$|Dr. David Spain, a {{pathologist}} from Brookdale Community College, {{testified that}} her bullet scars {{as well as}} X-rays supported her claim that <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> raised, {{and that there was}} [...] "no conceivable way" [...] the first bullet could have hit Shakur's clavicle if her arm was down.|$|E
5000|$|Within <b>Her</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>is</b> scored for {{a string}} {{orchestra}} consisting of 15 players. The work has a duration 14 minutes and is composed in one continuous movement. Concerning {{the dedication of}} the piece to her late mother, Clyne simply wrote, [...] "Within <b>Her</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>is</b> music for my mother, with all my love." ...|$|R
50|$|Darcy <b>is</b> Jake's crush. <b>Her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> scarred from a {{fire that}} burned down her house.|$|R
50|$|Sun Yingjie has {{an easily}} {{recognizable}} running style where <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> almost completely extended and point straight down.|$|R
500|$|Mary I's {{coat of arms}} was {{the same}} as those used by all her {{predecessors}} since Henry IV: Quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or [...] and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England). Sometimes, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> impaled (depicted side-by-side) with those of her husband. She adopted [...] "Truth, the Daughter of Time" [...] (...) as her personal motto.|$|E
500|$|According to tradition, bishops may use {{the arms}} of their diocese marshalled with their own {{personal}} arms, with a mitre {{in place of the}} helmet and a crosier displayed behind the shield, but these are removed when the bishop retires. These arms may {{take the form of a}} shield divided per pale or quartered with the arms of the diocese in the first and third quarters and the bishop's personal arms in the second and fourth quarters. The cross staff or [...] "primate cross" [...] is used only by the Archbishop of Uppsala and the Bishop of Lund, crossed with the crosier behind the shield. Antje Jackelén, Bishop of Lund, uses the traditional oval shield of a woman's arms, and <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> designed by the diocese's heraldist, Jan Raneke. Raneke also designed the arms of Jackelén's predecessor, Christina Odenberg, who was the first woman to be a bishop in the Church of Sweden.|$|E
500|$|The {{silencer}} {{was not on}} the gun {{when the}} police found the bodies. It was found by one of Bamber's cousins, three days after the murders, in the ground-floor office gun cupboard. Whether it was on the gun during the murders became a pivotal issue. The prosecution maintained that the silencer had indeed been on the gun, and that this meant Sheila could not have shot herself. Forensic tests indicated that <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> not long enough to turn the gun on herself with the silencer attached. If she had shot the others with the silencer, then realized the gun was too long for her to shoot herself, the silencer would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard before going back upstairs to shoot herself. If Sheila was not the killer, it meant Bamber had lied about the telephone call from his father saying Sheila had [...] "gone berserk" [...] with the gun. That put Bamber himself in the frame.|$|E

5000|$|On September 12, 2008, To Write Love on <b>Her</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>was</b> {{featured}} on the NBC Nightly News segment [...] "Making a Difference".|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> on his shoulder, {{but she did}} {{not look}} in his face while he spoke. Bending her head she looked another way.|$|R
2500|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} for a bride, Charles looked to France instead. The English agent Kensington {{was sent to}} Paris in 1624 to examine the potential French match, and the marriage was finally negotiated in Paris by James Hay and Henry Rich. Henrietta Maria was aged just fifteen {{at the time of}} her marriage, but this was not unusually young for royal princesses of the period. Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given me such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> long and lean, her shoulders uneven, and some of her teeth were coming out of her mouth like tusks.... She did, however, have pretty eyes, nose, and a good complexion...." ...|$|E
2500|$|A search {{party of}} more than thirty men looked for the {{children}} throughout the afternoon and evening. They {{had to give up}} when it grew dark, but set out again the next morning. When they finally found the children, it was two o'clock in the afternoon on March 16, twenty-five hours since the children had first set out from the school house. The overturned sleigh, with the horse still hitched up to it, was resting in a coulee two miles south of the school. [...] "With breathless haste we harried to the rig and will never forget the sight that met our eyes," [...] one of the men reported. The searchers found the rigid Hazel lying over her siblings, covering them with her body. Her coat, which she had unbuttoned, was spread over the bodies of the two younger children and <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> stretched out over them. Beneath her, still alive, were Emmet and Myrdith. [...] "Maude," [...] the old horse, was standing beside the overturned sled, also still alive. If the horse had moved, the three children would have been tipped into the snow.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{questioned}} the Degnan family's neighbors, but few had seen anything unusual. Someone later telephoned police anonymously, suggesting that police {{look in the}} sewers near the Degnan home. Police did, and discovered the young girl's head in a storm-drain sewer that was in an alley {{a block from the}} Degnan residence. In the same alley, they discovered the girl's right leg in a catch basin, her torso in another storm drain and her left leg in a drain in another alley, each location progressively further from her home. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> found a month later in a sewer {{on the other side of}} the Howard elevated train line more than three blocks from the Degnan residence. All the drains were capped with circular cast-iron manhole covers, yet no one had heard them being lifted or replaced. Searches of an apartment building near where her head was found uncovered a basement laundry room with four tubs that contained evidence indicating she had been dismembered there. The killer had mopped the floor, but blood was found in the drains of all four tubs. The press called it the [...] "Murder Room" [...] although the autopsy showed that she had been alive when taken from her home, murdered at a second location that was never identified, and then taken to the laundry room.|$|E
50|$|Both of <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> severed by the Gorgon, {{and she is}} {{temporarily}} {{unable to}} remain active with the team. However, both <b>arms</b> <b>are</b> later replaced with prosthetics, and she returns to active duty.|$|R
50|$|Mary Ritchie, {{eighty years}} old, had <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> {{fractured}} because {{she refused to}} take a bath. She was seized {{by two of the}} attendants, and in the struggle <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> broken. Mary Green, one of the attendants, was then discharged by the committee.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An 1888 Japanese woodblock {{print of}} a prostitute biting her {{handkerchief}} in pain as <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> tattooed. Based on historical practice, the tattoo is likely {{the name of}} her lover.|$|R
60|$|Paul kissed her, {{and left}} her. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> so pitifully thin that his heart ached also.|$|E
60|$|She {{suffered}} him to {{lead her}} away, but her head hung on her breast, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> limp.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{a little}} off, {{and in doing}} so, {{observed}} that <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> black, her face cut, and her bosom bruised.|$|E
60|$|The {{mother who}} {{lay in the}} grave, {{was the mother of}} my infancy; the little {{creature}} in <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>was</b> myself, as I had once been, hushed for ever on her bosom.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{will teach}} you to sell my property,' said she, when <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> quite tired, but Ian her son {{answered}} her nothing, {{and went off to}} his bed, for he was very sore.|$|R
60|$|Lassiter's gray lips formed soundless {{words that}} meant even her love could not avail to bend his will. As if {{the hold of}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>was</b> that of a child's he {{loosened}} it and stepped away.|$|R
6000|$|She {{leaned back}} in her chair; <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> folded. [...] "That is a terrible accusation, but I have not the courage to defend myself." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{rose to his}} feet. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> still twined {{about his}} neck, her lips hungry for his kisses, her eyes shining up into his.|$|E
60|$|She looked--I {{felt her}} look. She sobbed--I heard her sob, and then <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{about me and}} her lips were pressed upon my own.|$|E
60|$|One hand grasped her wrist, {{the other}} hand passed around and under her forearm and grasped his own wrist. And at {{the first hint of}} {{pressure}} she felt that <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> a pipe-stem about to break.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had on a}} low necked dress {{covered with}} silver spangles, and diamond rings and ear bobs. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>was</b> bare; and she was using a desk {{telephone}} with one hand, and drinking tea with the other.|$|R
60|$|There was a silence. The {{man looked}} at him, sober enough now, in amazement. The girl's hands were clasped together. She was {{watching}} the man--her man. She crept to his side, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> around his neck.|$|R
60|$|But Sadie {{had learned}} to think more about others during those terrible days of schooling. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> round Mrs. Belmont, and her cheek against hers.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{uttered a}} cry of horror. Instinctively <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{interposed}} between the unconscious man and these inhuman creatures, with a beautiful gesture of protecting motherhood.|$|E
60|$|All that day, in {{the teeth}} of a keen winter wind, I hugged myself in my plaid, and it was as though <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> flung around me.|$|E
5000|$|Davis relied more on {{the precise}} {{mechanics}} of pitching rather than strength. [...] According to John Brenkus of ESPN, Davis had a wind up and release point that never varied by more than 3 degrees. [...] Although <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> 15% shorter than a major league pitcher's <b>arm,</b> she <b>was</b> able to deliver balls at over 70 mph, due to {{the efficiency of the}} kinetic linking of her body parts. Her pitching was compared to the throwing motion of major league pitcher Jonathan Papelbon. [...] At the end of her throwing motion, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>was</b> moving forward at peak angular velocity of 2500˚/sec, which was over 80% of the peak angular velocity (3000˚/sec) of typical major league pitchers.|$|R
