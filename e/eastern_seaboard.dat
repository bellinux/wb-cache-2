5|$|Colonists from England {{also brought}} horses of Arabian {{breeding}} to the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard.</b> One example was Nathaniel Harrison, who imported a horse of Arabian, Barb and Turkish ancestry to America in 1747.|$|E
5|$|Owing to Hurricane Belle's {{proximity}} to many states along the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Seaboard,</b> hurricane watches and warnings were issued {{for the entire}} coast from Georgia to Maine. Accordingly, evacuations took place in numerous states with an estimated 500,000 people evacuating overall.|$|E
5|$|Following his baptism, Edwin's Northumbrian priests {{were in a}} {{position}} to be able to suppress pagan practices in Eorpwald's kingdom and convert the East Anglians. The conversion had the general political benefit of bringing the entire <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> from Northumbria to Kent, with the exception of Essex, under the dominion of Edwin and his Christian allies.|$|E
50|$|Zaops ostreus {{is found}} along the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboards</b> of North America and South America, from Massachusetts to Brazil, {{including}} the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.|$|R
50|$|The I-400 {{class was}} {{the brainchild of}} Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he {{conceived}} the idea of taking the war to the United States mainland by making aerial attacks against cities along the U.S. western and <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboards</b> using submarine-launched naval aircraft. He commissioned Captain Kameto Kuroshima to make a feasibility study.|$|R
50|$|K. margaritifera can {{be found}} in the Gulf of Mexico, ranging from the <b>eastern</b> Florida <b>seaboard</b> along the coast to Louisiana.|$|R
5|$|In July 2010, AT {{announced}} {{the construction of}} a $120 million data center in Akron, their 9th facility dedicated to such for the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> of the United States, which was followed by the announcement in August of {{the construction of a}} $20 million Involta data facility, also in Akron, which will be constructed to meet LEED certification.|$|E
5|$|In October of that year, {{he became}} {{commanding}} {{general of the}} I Bomber Command of First Air Force at Mitchel Field, flying anti-submarine warfare missions along the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Seaboard.</b> In July 1944, he went to MacDill Field in Florida, where {{he took over the}} III Bomber Command, a bomber training group that also hunted for submarines.|$|E
5|$|November is {{traditionally}} {{the start of}} the thunderstorm season along the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool air in the upper atmosphere. These conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms, particularly those which feature hail.|$|E
5000|$|The Jamaica Channel is a strait {{separating}} {{the islands of}} Jamaica and Hispaniola, in the Caribbean Sea. [...] Along with the Windward Passage to its north, it connects the Caribbean Sea to the North Atlantic Ocean. Due to its location about 1000 km north-east of the Panama Canal, it is a main sea lane through which vessels with Pacific Ocean destinations sailing from the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboards</b> of the United States and Canada, as well from Europe, frequently pass.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, Protector was {{transferred}} to the Australian Commonwealth Government and became a Commonwealth naval vessel primarily based in Sydney, New South Wales. In the years leading up to the establishment of an Australian Naval Fleet, Protector was active around the southern and <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboards.</b> Her main role was to train the Naval Militia Forces of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, a duty which she continued on following the foundation of the Royal Australian Navy. From September 1913, she served as a tender to the naval base HMAS Cerberus in Williamstown, Victoria.|$|R

5|$|The next day, Missouri {{departed}} Pearl Harbor {{bound for}} the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> of the United States. She reached New York City on 23 October and hoisted the flag of Atlantic Fleet commander Admiral Jonas Ingram. Four days later, Missouri boomed out a 21-gun salute as President Truman boarded for Navy Day ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunk of}} the Atlantic U-Boat menace, the roots being in the Biscay ports and the {{branches}} spreading far and wide, to the North Atlantic convoys, to the Caribbean, to the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> of the North America and to the sea-lanes where the faster merchant ships sail without escort.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. <b>Eastern</b> <b>Seaboard,</b> with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the storm}} was {{forecast}} to remain away from the Philippines, it was expected to enhance the southwest monsoon over western {{areas of the country}} starting July 10. Later that day, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #1 for the Batanes in northern Luzon, indicating expected winds of 45 to 60 km/h. Fishermen along the northern and <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboards</b> of the region were advised to avoid sailing due to rough seas. On July 12, the PSWS for the Batanes was raised to #2 as winds were expected to reach 61 to 100 km/h as the storm brushed the area. Additionally, the Calayan and Babuyan Islands were placed under PSWS #1. Following the typhoon's landfall in Taiwan, the signal were discontinued for all areas during the morning of July 13.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} concentrations and investigated {{potential source}} regions for PCBs, PBDEs, and organochlorine pesticides in Acadia National Park, Maine, USA. Back-trajectories and potential source contribution function (PSCF) values {{were used to}} map potential source areas for total-PCBs, BDE- 47, and 10 organochlorine pesticides. The constructed PSCF maps showed that ANP receives high pollutant concentrations in air masses that travel along four main pathways: (1) from the SW along the <b>eastern</b> Atlantic <b>seaboard,</b> (2) from the WSW over St. Louis, and Columbus regions, (3) from the west over Chicago, and Toronto regions, and (4) from WNW to NNW over the Great Lakes, and Quebec regions. Transport of all studied pollutants were equally distributed between the first three pathways, with only minor contributions from the last pathway. This study concludes that the high-pollutant concentrations arriving at ANP do not exclusively originate from the major urban centers along the <b>eastern</b> Atlantic <b>seaboard...</b>|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Yancey {{underwent}} a regular overhaul there and then operated off the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> and into the western Atlantic. During that time, she called at Bayonne, New Jersey; Bermuda; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Balboa, Canal Zone; Jacksonville, Florida; and made return calls at Norfolk, Bayonne, and Bermuda. In addition, the ship visited the New York Naval Shipyard and Davisville, Rhode Island, before being assigned tentatively to TF 68 effective on 9 November.|$|E
5|$|The city of Providence is {{geographically}} very compact, {{characteristic of}} <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> cities that developed prior {{to use of}} the automobile. It {{is among the most}} densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal plain}} of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to {{deciduous}} forests and {{the rolling hills}} of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south {{through the heart of}} the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.|$|E
50|$|Red Devil was an American {{progressive}} {{punk rock}} band, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Fond of odd time signatures and compositional elements, {{the band played}} a somewhat unusual brand of punk rock incorporating both Heavy metal and pop punk. The band released two proper records and played a handful of shows throughout the <b>Eastern</b> US <b>seaboard,</b> the Midwest, and Southwest during its career.|$|R
50|$|A {{change of}} {{operational}} area saw the boat deploy to the <b>Eastern</b> United States <b>seaboard</b> following {{the success of}} Operation Drumbeat (Paukenschlag); leaving Lorient on 21 February 1942. Like the original 'drumbeaters', Mohr found the US defences easy to penetrate.|$|R
50|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the race, the National Hurricane Center began {{tracking}} the development of a storm several hundred miles south-southwest of Bermuda. On September 30, the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Joaquin. The forecast model from the National Weather Service had the storm potentially affecting the race weekend. However, updated models had the storm avoiding landfall on the <b>Eastern</b> U.S. <b>seaboard</b> and moving out into the North Atlantic. Nevertheless, heavy rain was expected to affect the Dover area.|$|R
5|$|Winslow was {{commissioned}} into the United States Navy on 7 August 1915 {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander Neil E. Nichols. After trials off the upper east coast, Winslow joined the 6th Division, Atlantic Fleet Torpedo Flotilla. The destroyer participated in maneuvers in Cuban waters during the winter of 1915 and 1916 and, in the spring, began operations along the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard.</b> By October 1916, she was serving in coastal waters near Newport, Rhode Island.|$|E
5|$|After {{debarking}} her passengers at San Juan on 1 May, {{the ship}} took on supplies {{needed by the}} American ground forces in Santo Domingo: gasoline, oil, and ammunition. She docked in Santo Domingo on 2 May and exchanged her cargo for 450 more evacuees {{to be taken to}} San Juan. In all, Yancey carried almost a quarter of those fleeing the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk soon thereafter, and resumed her role of training and cruising off the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> and into the Caribbean basin. On 1 January 1969, Yancey was redesignated as LKA-93.|$|E
5|$|During the {{conflict}} over the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the <b>Eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. The canal, finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns.|$|E
5000|$|Reveal {{discovered}} or identified {{over fifty}} plant varieties, {{most of these}} discoveries being flowering plants of the American Southwest. In 1968, Reveal identified five new plant varieties at a Nevada nuclear testing site. In 1981, Reveal and Norlyn James Bodkin, then professor of Botany at James Madison University, identified a new lily variety, the first new plant discovery along the <b>eastern</b> U.S. <b>seaboard</b> since the 1940s. They named the new variety of Virginia Wake Robin Trillium pusillum var. monticulum (Shenandoah Wake Robin).|$|R
50|$|Note: A 2013 {{history book}} by Billy G. Smith (professor {{of history at}} the Montana State University) makes a case that the {{principal}} vector of the 1793 plague in Philadelphia (and other Atlantic ports) was the British merchant ship Hanley, which had fled the West African colony of Bolama (an island off West Africa, present day Guinea-Bissau) the previous November, trailing yellow fever at every port of call in the Caribbean and <b>eastern</b> Atlantic <b>seaboard.</b> See: The Ship of Death: The Voyage That Changed the Atlantic World.|$|R

5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Seaboard).</b> It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Navy {{fully in}} May 1774, Harvey became a {{midshipman}} aboard the sloop HMS Lynx {{and spent the}} next two years in the West Indies. Briefly returning to Britain at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Harvey returned to the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> of North America late in 1776 aboard HMS Mermaid, before transferring to the flagship of the North America Station HMS Eagle. From there Harvey joined HMS Liverpool on temporary assignment, only to be wrecked on Long Island aboard the frigate in 1778. Harvey rejoined Eagle after the wreck and returned to Britain in her. He was promoted to lieutenant on 25 February 1779.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several months}} of coastal operations, Orizaba, now armed with two guns and four guns, {{departed}} New York in April 1942 on the first transatlantic run of her second world war. Sailing via Iceland, she steamed to England, Cape Town, Recife, and Norfolk, Virginia, from which she got underway for Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Returning to Norfolk in January 1943, she plied the <b>eastern</b> <b>seaboard</b> for a month, then took up transatlantic duties again. Until July she traversed the ocean to Oran, Algeria, carrying troops over and prisoners of war back to New York.|$|E

50|$|Alaina Moore (born May 9, 1985) and Patrick Riley (born September 9, 1986) {{met in a}} {{philosophy}} class while both students at the University of Colorado, Denver in 2008. The couple started the band after they returned from an eight-month sailing expedition down the <b>Eastern</b> Atlantic <b>Seaboard</b> after their graduation. Moore had initially intended {{to go to law}} school. The songs on the band's first album would come to document their experiences sailing. Prior to forming Tennis, Moore's earliest singing experience was in church choirs during her youth.|$|R
