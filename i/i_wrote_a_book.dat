25|$|A new epoch in {{literature}} {{dates from the}} Revolution of 1383-1385. King John <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> of the chase, his sons, King Duarte and Peter, Duke of Coimbra, composed moral treatises, and an anonymous scribe told with charming naïveté {{the story of the}} heroic Nuno Álvares Pereira in the Chronica do Condestavel. The line of the chroniclers {{which is one of the}} boasts of Portuguese literature began with Fernão Lopes, who compiled the chronicles of the reigns of Kings Pedro I, Fernando I, and John I. He combined a passion for accurate statement with a special talent for descriptive writing and portraiture, and with him a new epoch dawns. Azurara, who succeeded him in the post of official chronicler, and wrote the Chronicle of Guinea and chronicles of the African wars, is an equally reliable historian, whose style is marred by pedantry and moralizing. His successor, Ruy de Pina, avoids these defects and, though not an artist like Lopes, gives a useful record of the reigns of Kings Duarte, Afonso V, and John II. His history of the latter monarch was appropriated by the poet Garcia de Resende, who adorned it, adding many anecdotes he had learned during his intimacy with John, and issued it under his own name.|$|E

[...] Rangel's lawyers continued to insist {{that he had not}} intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain. [...] Rangel somberly said only this on the day the charges were announced: Sixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a result <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> that, having survived that, that I haven't had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that.|$|E
2500|$|Toole later {{described}} the novel during correspondence with an editor, [...] "In 1954, when I was 16, <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> called The Neon Bible, a grim, adolescent, sociological attack upon the hatreds {{caused by the}} various Calvinist religions in the South—and the fundamentalist mentality {{is one of the}} roots of what was happening in Alabama, etc. The book, of course, was bad, but I sent it off a couple of times anyway." [...] It failed to attract interest from publishers and was not released until after Toole's death.|$|E

Most of the time, Aaron Klein <b>wrote</b> his <b>books</b> as <b>a</b> part-time freelancer. He once described his writing career by saying: [...] "I work full time to make <b>a</b> living.

2500|$|In 1984, Madden {{took the}} advice of NFL coach John Robinson—a friend of Madden's since {{elementary}} school—and created the [...] "All-Madden" [...] team, a group of players whom Madden thought represented football and played the game the way he thought it should be played. Madden continued to pick the All-Madden team through the 2001 season when he left to move to ABC and Monday Night Football. Madden added his [...] "Haul of Fame" [...] for his favorite players, he created a special 10th Anniversary All-Madden team in 1994, an All-Madden Super Bowl Team in 1997 and an All-Time All-Madden team in 2000. All Madden was also the title of Madden's third best-selling book (after Hey, Wait A Minute? <b>I</b> <b>Wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>Book</b> and One Knee Equals Two Feet).|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Christian Post on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as {{being part of the}} prosperity gospel. [...] "I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it's fair, but it's just what it is. I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of. But when I hear the term prosperity gospel, I think people are sometimes saying, 'Well, he's just asking for money'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to their}} work {{together}} on the book, Donald Trump had established himself {{in the business of}} real estate development and written The Art of the Deal, and Robert Kiyosaki authored The New York Times best seller Rich Dad Poor Dad. The coauthors became familiar with each other through encounters at the company The Learning Annex. Trump explained his motivation for wanting to work with Kiyosaki: [...] "Robert wrote a book that was a tremendous success, like 30- some-odd million copies of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad,' and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> called 'The Art of the Deal' which was the biggest selling business book of all time and since then I've written a lot of other books and they've all gone into being bestsellers. And we just wanted to join forces." [...] Trump and Kiyosaki published the book as a private business venture together, forming a new company as a partnership called Rich Press. They stated they would allocate a segment of profits from its publication to be given for altruistic purposes. After their initial book venture, Trump and Kiyosaki collaborated on another book, Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich-And Why Most Don't, published in 2011. Why We Want You to be Rich included work from writers Meredith McIver and Sharon Lechter.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, London {{purchased}} a [...] ranch in Glen Ellen, Sonoma County, California, {{on the eastern}} slope of Sonoma Mountain, for $26,450. He wrote: [...] "Next to my wife, the ranch is the dearest {{thing in the world}} to me." [...] He desperately wanted the ranch to become a successful business enterprise. <b>Writing,</b> always <b>a</b> commercial enterprise with London, now became even more a means to an end: [...] "I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> {{for no other reason than}} to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate." ...|$|R

60|$|And the {{foregoing}} was my attitude of mind for years. Occasionally I got well jingled, but such occasions were rare. It interfered with my work, and I permitted nothing {{to interfere with}} my work. I remember, when spending several months in the East End of London, during which time <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> and adventured much amongst {{the worst of the}} slum classes, that I got drunk several times and was mightily wroth with myself because it interfered with my writing. Yet these very times were because I was out on the adventure-path where John Barleycorn is always to be found.|$|E

When I was a student {{it seemed to me that}} the Radicalism of so called advanced thinkers was a half-hearted sham; I had no interest in politics at all until I read your attack--one of them--on the House of Lords. That day marked an epoch in my life. I used to read the University library copy of 'Truth' from cover to cover. Sometimes I carried it into the class-room. That was not allowed. I took it up my waistcoat. In those days I said that if <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> I would dedicate it to you without permission, and London, when I came to it, was to me the town where you lived." ...|$|E

Three hours out, three hours back, and sit up all night watching the young people dance; yelling conversationally and being yelled at, conversationally, by new acquaintances, through the deafening music, about how I like Vienna, and if it's my first visit, and how long we expect to stay, and did I see the foot-washing, and am <b>I</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> about Vienna, and so on.
