500|$|In January 1930, Tracy was {{approached}} {{about a new}} play called The Last Mile. Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row, producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy, and later recounted: [...] "beneath the surface, <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part." [...] The Last Mile opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls. The Commonweal described him as [...] "one of our best and most versatile young actors". The play was a hit with critics, and ran for 289 performances.|$|E
500|$|Hardy said: [...] "He {{combined}} a {{power of}} generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who could work out modular equations and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms {{of many of the}} most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a doubly periodic function or of Cauchy's theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was...". When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were [...] "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account." [...] He also stated that he had [...] "never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{first meeting}} with Adm. James Holloway was some experience. I had asked to brief him on our plan for Jordan and was shown to his office. He was {{reclining}} on a sofa and remained that way throughout the session. When I would make a particular point, he would exclaim, 'Atta boy,' or 'That's it. Give'm hell' [...] a one-man cheering section, so to speak. It was quite the most incredible briefing I ever gave. I learned later that he suffered from some ailment at the time, which required him to take these rest sessions. He impressed me as a 'big picture' type, not too interested in details, but I left his office feeling that <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> for whom you would make that extra effort and take that extra step." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just my point. It IS serious. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{helpless}} burden. He may {{be restored}} to reason and usefulness--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sire, it is,' {{answered}} the servant; 'and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> I have brought with {{me from the}} country to confirm the tale.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I've got you." [...] Ernest's jaw snapped like a trap. [...] "Let me show you. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who works}} on the street railways." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{eyes of the}} Echo-dwarf glistened. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who might}} help him in his plans.|$|E
60|$|Here was a {{new phase}} in her life. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> willing to marry her {{even though she had}} no assured fortune.|$|E
60|$|But <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> {{who rose}} of Himself. He {{was raised by}} God, and {{therefore}} He raised Himself, for He was God.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Here</b> <b>is</b> realization, [...] <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> tallied--he realizes <b>here</b> {{what he has}} in him, [...] The past, the future, majesty, love--if {{they are}} vacant of you, you [...] are vacant of them.|$|R
6000|$|... “Explain! explain!” cried Richard; “it {{was about}} the mines, ha! Ay, ay, I see it, I see it; <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with <b>a</b> pick on his shoulder. So you heard it all, Benjamin?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is not enough, my friend. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of whom I {{only know}} that he has bought a great many marble statues. He has done nothing for his country, and nothing for his sovereign." ...|$|R
60|$|Saxon was glowing. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> a protector, {{something}} to lean against, of whom even the Butchertown toughs were afraid {{as soon as}} his name was mentioned.|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who {{had come}} from {{goodness}} knows where, whose strange wanderings and secret appearances in the neighborhood had oft roused the anger of the village folk, just as his fantastic clothes, his silken doublet and befrilled shirt had excited their scorn; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> I say, who came from nowhere, and now he chose--the yokels of the neighborhood declared it that he chose--to make his exit from the world in as weird a manner as he had effected his entrance into this remote and law-abiding little island.|$|E
60|$|If the {{thoughts}} that still hung heavy {{on my mind}} were only the morbid, fanciful thoughts of the hour, <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose society would dissipate them. I resolved to try the experiment, and accepted his invitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "'O strange interment! Civilized lands [...] Afford few types thereof; <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{who takes}} his rest [...] Beside his very Love, Beside {{the one who}} was his wife [...] In our sight up above!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{with whom}} God is, in whom God works and walks; <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose motion <b>is</b> governed and steered by the mighty hand of God, and the effectual working of his power. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The sun {{touches his}} side--and yet, Captain Ludlow, you may <b>be</b> right--for <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in his fore-top, plainly enough to <b>be</b> seen. <b>A</b> shot, or two, among his spars and sails, might now do service." ...|$|R
60|$|How {{characteristic}} of cowboys that they lied to shield Jack Belllounds! But it was futile {{to attempt to}} deceive the old rancher. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had been forty years dealing {{with all kinds of}} men and events.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Crewe {{glanced at}} him again. In spite of himself, respect was growing in him. He had {{expected}} to find {{a certain amount of}} eagerness and subserviency--though veiled; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of different calibre than he looked for in Ripton.|$|E
60|$|Lydia {{looked at}} him thoughtfully. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whom she had mistaken for the finest image of manly {{strength}} and beauty in the world; {{and he was so}} devoid of artistic culture that he held a statue to be a distasteful lump of stone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{very thing}} that has always struck me when, poor man, {{he has tried to}} be civil to me. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> {{sensible}} himself, but who has never had the hap to live with sensible women.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I thank you, sir, {{for what}} you have done,” said the youth, with a little distance; “but <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who will take me under his care, and spare you all, gentlemen, any further trouble on my account” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 4. This man {{can look}} upon death with comfort, can laugh at {{destruction}} when it cometh, and longs {{to hear the}} sound of the last trump, and to see his Judge coming in the clouds of heaven. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> indeed! ...|$|R
60|$|Assuredly the Americans are the best-natured {{people on}} earth! <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose house was nearly {{tumbling}} down about his ears--always bating the principle in architecture just named--and he could smile as Nero may be {{supposed to have}} done when fiddling over the conflagration of Rome.|$|E
60|$|Muda Saffir nodded. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{after his}} own heart, which loved intrigue and duplicity. Evidently {{he would be}} a good ally in wreaking vengeance upon the white giant who had caused all his discomfiture--afterward there was always the kris if the other should become inconvenient.|$|E
60|$|Gently explorative, he {{slid his}} hand from wrist to elbow and came to rest half way back. Tired and languid from the morning in the sun, she found herself thrilling to his touch and half-dreamily {{deciding}} that <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> she could love, hands and all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} anybody <b>is</b> to do. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> as mad as a March hare, and yet nobody can touch him. If {{it was not}} for the child, I should advise Emily to put him out of her head altogether." ...|$|R
60|$|ARETHUSA. He hasn't {{learned to}} know you, Kit, as I have, nor yet {{do you know}} him. He seems hard and violent; at heart he <b>is</b> only <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{overwhelmed}} with sorrow. Why else, when {{he looks at me}} and does not know that I observe him, should his face change, and fill with such tenderness, that I could weep to see him? Why, when he walks in his sleep, as he does almost every night, his eyes open and beholding nothing, why should he cry so pitifully on my mother's name? Ah, if you could hear him then, you would say yourself: <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> that has loved; <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> that will <b>be</b> kind to lovers.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. This man is {{travelling}} to Mount Zion, {{the heavenly}} Jerusalem, {{the city of}} the living God, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect, to God the Judge of all, and to Jesus. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{about to}} risk his life--for {{there was no}} denying the fact--in a great sociological experiment, yet they {{received}} the announcement with absolute unconcern. It offered one more assurance, had I needed it, of the degenerate state of the civilization upon which I was turning my back.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothea colored with pleasure, {{and looked}} up gratefully to the speaker. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who could {{understand}} the higher inward life, and with whom {{there could be some}} spiritual communion; nay, who could illuminate principle with the widest knowledge a man whose learning almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed! ...|$|E
60|$|When {{this news}} was made public, the school, lost in wonder and admiration, gasped at the Head {{as he went}} to his house. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> to be reverenced. On the rare {{occasions}} when he caned he did it very scientifically, and the execution of a hundred boys would be epic--immense.|$|E
5000|$|In peacetime Germany, about 18,000 or 20,000 {{people a}} year chose to commit suicide, even without being in such <b>a</b> position. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who sees 50,000 or 60,000 of his {{soldiers}} die defending themselves bravely to the end. How can he surrender himself to the Bolshevists?! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2. This man, by {{the power}} of God's might, which worketh in him, is able to cast a whole world behind him, with all the lusts and pleasures of it, and to charge through all the {{difficulties}} that men and devils can set against him. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'All right,' {{said the}} man, {{and they went}} {{together}} to the palace; and when the king asked the servant if he had found out {{the truth about the}} cauliflower, the servant replied: 'Sire, all that you heard <b>was</b> perfectly true; <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> from the country who will tell you so.' ...|$|R
