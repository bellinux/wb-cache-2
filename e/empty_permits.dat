There are settings, such as inclusive logic, where <b>empty</b> domains are <b>permitted.</b> Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty poset), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if <b>empty</b> domains are <b>permitted</b> or the <b>empty</b> structure {{is removed from the}} class.|$|R

This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when <b>empty</b> domains are <b>permitted.</b> For example, the equivalencefails in any structure with an empty domain. Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when <b>empty</b> structures are <b>permitted.</b> However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{when the}} <b>empty</b> domain is <b>permitted,</b> it must often {{be treated as}} a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.|$|R

50|$|After the show, spectators {{from the}} stalls left the theatre through two {{separate}} {{doors on the}} side of the theatre or through the main lobby. Spectators from the first and second rows of balconies had special exits through the staircases, so they would not have to cross the lobby again. This allowed the theatre to <b>empty</b> quickly and <b>permitted</b> shorter time periods between two shows.|$|R

Given {{that the majority}} of circulating ghrelin appears to be of gastric origin, we addressed the contribution of gastric distention or nutrient sensitivity to this response. Awake, unrestrained rats received intragastric infusions of glucose or water (1 ml/min for 12 min) with gastric emptying either proceeding normally or prevented by inflation of a pyloric cuff. When <b>emptying</b> was <b>permitted,</b> glucose infusion reduced ghrelin level by approximately 50 %, and, in agreement with previous data, water infusions were without GHRELIN, A RECENTLY DISCOVERED ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor, is an orexigenic hormone produced primarily by cells in the oxyntic gland of the stomach (1 – 3).

40|$|Virtually all {{semantic}} or object-oriented {{data models}} assume objects have an identity separate {{from any of}} their parts, and allow users to define complex object types in which part values may be any other objects. In [20], a more general form of functional dependency is proposed for such models in which component attributes may correspond to descriptions of property paths, called path functional dependencies (PFDs). The main contribution of the reference is a sound and complete axiomatization for PFDs when databases may be infinite. However, {{a number of issues}} were left open which are resolved in this paper. We first prove that the same axiomatization remains complete if PFDs are <b>permitted</b> <b>empty</b> left-hand sides, but that this is not true if logical consequence is defined with respect to finite databases. We then prove that the implication problem for arbitrary PFDs is decidable. The proof suggests a means of characterizing an important function closure which is then used to derive an effective procedure for constructing a deterministic finite state automation representing the closure. The procedure is further refined to efficient polynomial time algorithms for the implication problem for cases in which antecedent PFDs are a form of complex key constraint.

40|$|Hyperbranched {{polymers}} show {{an outstanding}} potential for applications ranging from chemistry over nanotechnology to pharmacy. In {{order to take}} advantage of this potential, the underlying phase behaviour must be known. From the thermodynamic point of view, the modelling of these phase diagrams is quite challenging, because the thermodynamic properties depend on the architecture of the hyperbranched polymer as well as on the number and kind of present functional end groups. The influence of architecture can be taken into account via the lattice cluster theory (LCT) as an extension of the well-known Flory–Huggins theory. Whereas the Flory–Huggins theory is limited to linear polymer chains, the LCT can be applied to an arbitrary chain architecture. The number and the kind of functional groups can be handled via the Wertheim perturbation theory, applicable for directed forces between the functional groups and the surrounding solvent molecules. The combination of the LCT and the Wertheim theory can be established for the modelling or even prediction of the liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) of polymer solutions in a single solvent or in a solvent mixture or polymer blends, where the polymer can have an arbitrary structure. The applied theory predicts large demixing regions for mixtures of linear polymers and hyperbranched polymers, as well as for mixtures made from two hyperbranched polymers. The introduction of <b>empty</b> lattice sites <b>permits</b> the theoretical investigation of pressure effects on phase behaviour. The calculated phase diagrams were compared with own experimental data or to experimental data taken from literature...|$|R
