5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was {{developed}} from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, {{at the moment when}} she has been shot in the eye. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E
5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary. The most complete account {{is that of}} Arnold Jacobi (1895) on specimens from Great Natuna (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). Unfortunately, although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in the two species Jacobi dissected, unfortunately we do not know which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two species as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E

5|$|Pressured by the United Nations, {{which had}} looked at the {{situation}} in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began rationalising the army, cutting back on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000men, with a further 470,000in the laskar.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the term post-transition metal is unclear. An early usage is {{recorded}} by Deming, in 1940, in his well-known book Fundamental Chemistry. He treated the transition metals as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum). <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ensuing elements in periods 4 to 6 of the periodic table (copper to germanium; silver to antimony; gold to polonium)—in view of their underlying d10 electronic configurations—as post-transition metals.|$|E
25|$|On one of {{the drives}} along the coast, Master (Yogananda) spoke {{to me about the}} value of SRF Colonies. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forming of groups within a city or a rural area in the manner of hermitage life, among members who do not desire to become renunciants, or cannot do so because of certain obligations.

50|$|Falquet {{was very}} learned and well-read. References to {{contemporary}} literature (primarily chivalric romance) abound in his poetry. In his Ma bella domna, per vos dei esser gais he references Floire et Blancheflor (the former whom he calls Flori), the Roman d'Andrieu de Fransa, and the Raoul de Cambrai. On two other occasions {{he was given}} to referencing Floire et Blancheflor and in his 254-line letter <b>he</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman de Renart and Tristans and Ysout. Elsewhere <b>he</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latter as Tristanz and Ysolt.|$|R

25|$|Ronald Lauder, {{writing in}} the German {{newspaper}} Die Welt, called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance NATO: “Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,” the WJC president wrote. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia {{and said they were}} reminders of how “unpredictable” developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership “would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel”, Lauder argued.|$|E
25|$|Socrates asks {{questions}} of Agathon: has <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> object of love, or love itself? Socrates then relates a story {{he was told}} by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god, but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful, but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the “form of beauty”, which humans must try to achieve.|$|E
25|$|The first Interslavic grammar, Gramatíčno izkâzanje ob rúskom jezíku by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić, {{was written}} in 1665. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{language}} as Ruski, but in reality it was mostly based on a mixture of the Russian edition of Church Slavonic and his own Ikavian Čakavian dialect of Croatian. Križanić used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise Politika (1663–1666). According {{to an analysis of}} the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in Politika are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the recurring motif of screaming mouths in many Bacons of the late 1940s and early 1950s was drawn {{from a number of}} sources, including medical text books, the works of Matthias Grünewald and photographic stills of the nurse in the Odessa Steps scene in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent The Battleship Potemkin. Bacon saw the film in 1935, and viewed it frequently thereafter. He kept in his studio a photographic still of the scene, showing a close-up of the nurse's head screaming in panic and terror and with broken pince-nez spectacles hanging from her blood-stained face. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image throughout his career, using it as a source of inspiration.|$|E
25|$|The new Pope Pius XII sent a radio {{message of}} {{congratulation}} to the Spanish government, clerics and people on April 16, 1939. <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> denunciation of his predecessor, Pope Pius XI, who had described past horrors {{and the need}} to defend and restore the rights of God and religion. The pope stated that the victims of terror died for Jesus Christ. He wished peace and prosperity upon the Spanish people and appealed to them to punish criminals but to exercise leniency and Spanish generosity against the many who were on the other side. He asked for their full participation in society and entrusted them to the compassion of the Church in Spain.|$|E
25|$|According to the American Enterprise Institute, {{research}} has shown that income and intelligence are related. In a 1998 study, Charles Murray compared the earnings of 733 full sibling pairs with differing intelligence quotients (IQs). <b>He</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sample as utopian in that the sampled pairs were raised in families with virtually no illegitimacy, divorce or poverty. The average earnings of sampled individuals with an IQ of under 75 was $11,000, compared to $16,000 for those with an IQ between 75 and 90, $23,000 for those with an IQ between 90 and 110, $27,000 for those with an IQ between 110 and 125, and $38,000 for those with an IQ above 125. Murray's work on IQ has been criticized by Stephen Jay Gould, Loïc Wacquant and others, including the Southern Poverty Law Center.|$|E

25|$|It is {{relevant}} to note here that Turner was extremely conservative in {{his use of the}} word “Indian.” Instead <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> different Indian peoples by their culture’s name, such as Yaqui or Aztec, in order to humanize and emphasize their identities. For Turner, Díaz “created a machine and oiled the machine with the flesh and blood of a people. He rewarded all except the people; the people were the sacrifice.” Indians were seen as chattel and although Díaz’s regime justified its means for this treatment, Turner emphasizes this point. Additionally, Turner does not explicitly mention the científicos, but he makes a stand against the “scientific knowledge” of that time in regard to race; in a way, against positivism. He indirectly brings up issues surrounding the Indian questions of labor—through haciendas—and of education. Turner points out that regardless of the public primary schools that had been built, “what promise does study hold out for a youth born to shoulder a debt of his father and carry it {{to the end of his}} days?” At its core, Turner’s question embodies the meaning of slavery, because that is precisely what he saw.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Periyar was also {{known to have}} made {{controversial}} remarks on the Tamil language and people from time to time. On one occasion, <b>he</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tamil people as [...] "barbarians" [...] and the Tamil language as the [...] "language of barbarians". However, Anita Diehl explains that Periyar made these remarks on Tamil because it had no respective feminine verbal forms.|$|E
