It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a main roof line running east-west and cruciform gables (two south, one north) projecting from each side. The gable ends are all decorated with a distinctive vine-like vergeboard. A square tower rises at the northeast corner of the eastern and northern <b>gables,</b> <b>capped</b> by a steeply-pitched pyramidal roof with a finial at the top.

50|$|The two-and-a-half-story {{building}} at 612 Fifth Street (118-5318-0018) is another rare surviving example of early 19th century residential or commercial architecture (during this period, {{there is little}} stylistic distinction between buildings for residential use versus commercial use) in Lynchburg. While not the first building {{to stand on the}} site, the present building was likely built in 1827 by Lilbourn Johnson. A three-bay, double pile building (the rear interior end chimney has been removed), 612 Fifth Street is of brick construction with kneelered (parapeted) <b>gables</b> <b>capped</b> by half-round brick coping, a feature rarely found in Lynchburg. While the façade has been covered by a modern layer of running bond brick, the building’s early 19th century roots can be clearly discerned.|$|R
50|$|The {{western wall}} terminates {{at the first}} floor in a {{projecting}} gable with a coping. The gable terminates with squared piers finished with <b>gable</b> <b>caps.</b> The north and south walls have a high parapet that is finished in a wide castellation with regularly spaced piers which stop short {{of the top of}} the parapet and are finished with a gabled cap. At first floor level are large square aluminium windows with louvres which replaced paired timber casement windows with lancet hoppers. At ground floor level on the southern and northern elevations the segmental arched colonnades have been infilled with aluminium joinery. East elevation has a matching gable to west end, with small lancet windows at high level between squared piers. There are three louvred windows symmetrically positioned at first floor level and below this three casement windows with hoppers over.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral's {{exterior}} {{is composed}} of white brick and Ohio sandstone. Several layers of brick in the facade create strong, square inset designs around the lancet windows of the clerestory. This allows for a play {{of light and shadow}} that dramatizes the heaviness of the wall, and was the effect of emphasizing the wall's depth by partially cutting into it. The spires are built of stone and decorated with pinnacles and dormers, and ball flower ornaments atop the pinnacles. Tower walls are reinforced with square and octagonal buttresses that taper abruptly with generous weatherings at transitional points and terminate in pinnacles, some with slender colonettes abutting chamfered edges, with ribbed, stepped, or <b>gable</b> <b>caps.</b> These buttresses are accented by heavy weatherings in lighter coloured stone (creating visual contrast while drawing attention to the points of stress on the building), and topped with pinnacles, thus emphasizing their massiveness, structural function, and verticality. They provide spatial rhythm on the east and west facades.|$|R
50|$|The steeply pitched {{gabled roof}} has Marseilles pattern {{interlocking}} terracotta tiles, with matching ridge <b>capping.</b> <b>Gables</b> are {{found on the}} southern end of the east and west walls, where transepts were to begin. Featured on each of the gables is a large pointed arch stained glass window, integrating many smaller lights with geometric tracery.|$|R

The sandstone blocks used in the construction of Pringle Cottage are generally coursed rubble, with picked faces. The cottage sits on a plinth of margined rock faced sandstone.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is {{found at the}} southeast corner of Wesley and Main Streets in Wheaton. It stands two stories tall and was built with coursed limestone and Bedford stone trimmings in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The style is characterized by rough-hewn stone blocks, emphasized horizontal lines, wide rounded arches, and intricate ornamentation. The work is nearly identical to a library that Frost designed in Morgan Park, Chicago the previous year. Each facade has a tall stone gable with pinnacles on either side near the base. Gable eaves have dentil moldings carved into a leaf motif. Each gable has an arched window. The north <b>gable</b> is <b>capped</b> with a decorative urn.

50|$|The {{new church}} was {{constructed}} primarily of red Walkeringham brick. Ancaster stone was utilised for exterior trim, with red Mansfield stone {{employed in the}} interior.

The lower portion of the tower features the entrance to the building, as well as a porch with a staircase that extends up to the belfry. There, two new bells were supplemented by three old bells from the former church. The number of bells was eventually increased to six. The arched entrance to the porch has ashlar trim, over which there is an ashlar cross. The ground floor of the tower has the entrance to the north, a pair of lancet windows to the east, and another pair to the west. Each side of {{the first floor of the}} tower features a grouping of three lancets, with a single lancet window flanked by blind lancets.

5000|$|The {{building}} is a two storey mansion in the early Stuart or Jacobean Revival style set on 32,000 square metres of English gardens in {{the centre of the}} Perth business district, between St. Georges Terrace and the Swan River. The unique architectural character of the {{building is}} characterised by the use of stonework and bonded brickwork, incorporating square mullioned windows, decorated <b>gables</b> and ogival <b>capped</b> turrets. The attenuated gothic arcading at ground floor level derives from another form of Victorian Revival expression Fonthill Gothic. The building has 16 rooms on the ground floor and 25 on the first floor. According to the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places Assessment, Government House is a 'unique example of a Victorian Gentleman's residence'set in landscaped gardens with mature plantings and a number of commemorative trees.|$|R
