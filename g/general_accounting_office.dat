5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the <b>General</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office</b> {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered.

It is also mandatory that an explanatory report is attached to all bills, elaborating on the purpose of the proposed legislation and indicating the exact wording of current legislation to be amended or repealed. Draft Laws (but not Law Proposals) must also be accompanied by an Impact Assessment Report and by a report on the results of the public consultation that took place prior to the submission of the bill.

40|$|Texas has {{embarked}} {{on the process of}} developing quantitative or numerical nutrient criteria in response to EPA’s 1998 national initiative. Texas is dealing with many complex issues in developing appropriate criteria, and one is simply determining what is to be the technical basis for the criteria.

In contrast, the language in the Clean Water Act is fairly specific as to the relationship between designated uses and criteria. Furthermore, recent significant documents including the National Research Council’s 2001 review of the TMDL program, and the <b>General</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office’s</b> 2003 review of EPA’s efforts, suggest there is interest and support for developing appropriate and attainable designated uses and having criteria that are tied to those uses.

40|$|The <b>General</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office's</b> 1990 {{conclusion}} about {{the prevention of}} homelessness still holds: It remains "too early to tell " what works best. Eviction prevention programs show some promise but have not been rigorously evaluated and tend to exclude people at highest risk of homelessness. Several studies suggest that individuals with severe mental illness can be supported in the community, but the mixture of housing and supportive services necessary remains unclear. There is even less evidence for the usefulness of planning discharges from institutions or of programs to ameliorate domestic conflicts. However, even if expanded to reach 100 percent of their target populations and even if 100 percent successful, all of these programs together would reach {{only a minority of}} the people who become homeless each year, and targeting efforts would yield many false alarms for each future case of homelessness correctly identified. Based on evidence that subsidized housing, with or without supportive services, is sufficient to end homelessness for most families, and given the important role of subsidized housing (everywhere it has been examined) in ending homelessness among people with serious mental illnesses, we propose a shift to selected strategies of prevention, such as providing housing subsidies to those with worst—case housing needs, supporting employment and transitional assistance to poor, young people setting up households for the first time, and focusing efforts on communities from which large proportions of homeless people originate...|$|R
