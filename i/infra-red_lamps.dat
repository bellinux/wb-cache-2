40|$|International audienceThe {{superplastic forming}} {{is used in}} {{aeronautics}} in order to manufacture titanium parts with complex shapes. Regarding to others forming processes, {{it is important to}} save costs of superplastic forming. Using <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>lamps</b> to heat directly the blank is an economic way to raise the temperature as the heating time is cut to a few minutes instead of 24 hours. The tool core is not completely heated anymore, leading to greater efficiencies. Radiative flux model was developed and complex thermomechanical simulations have been used as a predicting tool of the <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamps</b> power. The lamps power is adjusted throughout the forming step in order to obtain an optimized flux and thus to ensure a homogeneous temperature of the blank during the superplastic forming. Through these simulations, several TA 6 V sheets with a size of 500 x 500 mm 2 were successfully formed by using this technology. The microstructure is not affected by the quick heating phase. Secondly, an aircraft part with a size of 1500 x 1000 mm 2 were likewise formed which demonstrates the efficiency of the IR heating for the industrial superplastic forming...|$|E

This research investigated {{the effects of}} altering the dosage of ink (via grayscale/dithering) on the properties of parts produced from elastomers. The results indicate that print density may be optimized to maximize mechanical properties and have achieved an elongation at break as high as 365 pct.

Research was carried out {{to determine the effects of}} varying process parameters on the mechanical properties of parts produced using this process. Results showed that increasing the temperature of the part bed led to an increase in the mechanical properties of the parts produced, and that increasing the <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamp</b> power had the same effect, but to a lesser degree. It was also found that these increases in process parameters led to a corresponding increase in the hardness of the unsintered powder, which could lead to difficulties with post-process powder removal...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Rapid prototyping journal, [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] To investigate the effects of the infra-red power level on sintering behaviour in the High Speed Sintering process. Design/methodology/approach: Single-layer parts were produced using the High Speed Sintering process, {{in order to determine the}} effect of the infra-red power level on the maximum achievable layer thickness, and the degree of sintering. The parts were examined using both optical microscopy and contact methods. Findings: Whilst it was expected that an increase in the <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamp</b> powder might allow an increase in the depth of sintering that could be achieved, as a result of increased thermal transfer through the powder, results in fact indicated that there is a maximum layer thickness that can be achieved, as a result of part shrinkage in the z direction. Optical microscopy images have shown that a greater degree of sintering occurs at higher power levels, which would be expected to correspond to an improvement in the mechanical properties of the parts produced. These images also indicate that the RAM forms in small ‘islands’ on the powder bed surface. However, these islands begin to merge as sintering progresses, to a greater degree as the <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamp</b> power is increased. Research limitations/implications: These results are based only on single layer parts. Further work will examine the sintering characteristics of multiple layer parts. Practical implications: Results have shown that, whilst it is not possible to increase the achievable layer thickness of the parts produced by modifying the <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamp</b> power, the degree of sintering can be improved greatly by increasing the power. Originality/value: High Speed Sintering is an entirely new process which is currently still under development; the results presented here will directly impact the direction of further development and research into this process...|$|R

40|$|The {{prolonged}} exposure of carbon steel in marine atmospheres with high chloride deposition rates and long times of wetness of the metallic surface {{leads to the}} formation of thick multilayered rust. The present work proposes an accelerated cyclic laboratory test based on immersion (4. 2 min) in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution followed by drying (12 min) under <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamps</b> in the laboratory atmosphere. The carbon steel corrosion process is thus accelerated, giving rise to the generation of thick rust layers in relatively short times. The rust phases and the structure of the rust layers formed offer a good approximation to the multilayered rust formed in marine atmospheres. The study includes a gravimetric evaluation of the magnitude of corrosive attack and a characterisation of the rust phases and corrosion layers formed using XRD, optical microscopy and SEM.

40|$|Data from 67 pig farms with {{a variety}} of {{farrowing}} systems were used to identify factors associated with preweaning mortality in British pig herds. The median mortality reported by the farmers was 10 - 7 per cent (interquartile range 8. 5 to 14 per cent). There was a significantly higher mortality when the pigs were weaned when they were older. A multivariable Poisson model was developed into which the types of farrowing system on each farm and the age at weaning were forced. Factors associated with a lower preweaning mortality rate were insulating the farrowing building, providing extra heat at farrowing, giving the piglets iron injections, dipping their navels, using fan ventilation and using artificial lighting systems. Factors associated with a higher mortality rate were a later weaning age, the use of <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamps</b> rather than other forms of supplementary heat, and the use of a creep without any bedding. ...|$|E
50|$|Some StG 44s were {{fitted with}} the Zielgerät 1229 infra-red aiming device, also {{known by its}} codename Vampir ("vampire"). This device {{consisted}} of a large scope, rather like modern starlight scopes, and a large <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamp</b> on top, the scope being {{able to pick up}} the infra-red that would be invisible to the naked eye. The user had to carry a transformer backpack powered by a battery fitted inside the gas mask canister. Electric cables connected the power unit with the IR reflector, with the cathode ray tube mounted on the rifle imaging IR from the spotlight. The Vampir had only 15 minutes of battery life, but was able to sight within 200 meters in total darkness. A conical flash hider was added to the barrel to keep the muzzle flash from blinding the shooter.|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the methodology for 96 parallel organic syntheses of peptides on Teflon-patterned paper assisted by heating with an <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamp.</b> SPOT synthesis is an important technology for production of peptide arrays on a paper-based support for rapid identification of peptide ligands, epitope mapping, and identification of bio-conjugation reactions. The major drawback of the SPOT synthesis methodology published to-date is suboptimal reaction conversion due to mass transport limitations in the unmixed reaction spot. The technology developed in this report overcomes these problems by changing {{the environment of the}} reaction from static to dynamic (flow-through), and further accelerating the reaction by selective heating of the reaction support in contact with activated amino acids. Patterning paper with Teflon allows for droplets of organic solvents to be confined in a zone on the paper array and flow through the paper at a well-defined rate and provide a convenient, power-free setup for flow-through solid-phase synthesis and efficient assembly of peptide arrays. We employed an <b>infra-red</b> (IR) <b>lamp</b> to locally heat the cellulosic support during the flow-through delivery of the reagents to each zone of the paper-based array. We demonstrate that IR-heating in solid phase peptide synthesis shortened the reaction time necessary for amide bond formation down to 3 minutes; in some couplings of alpha amino acids, conversion rates increased up to fifteen folds. The IR-heating improved the assembly of difficult sequences, such as homo-oligomers of all 20 natural amino acids...|$|R

The goats were main-tained under the usual husbandry conditions, being turned out to pasture in the summer and kept in individual pens in a separate male goat house in winter; supplementary heating from <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamps</b> was used when necessary.

40|$|Male {{chickens}} {{belonging to}} three Italian purebreds – Ermellinata di Rovigo (ER), Robusta lionata (RL) and Robusta maculata (RM) – were studied. All {{the birds were}} reared under the same rearing conditions (from May until autumn). Chickens were reared under <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamps</b> from birth until 4 weeks of age with a 24 L: 0 D photoperiod. Then they were kept outdoor: the photoperiod changed according to the season (from 16 L: 8 D to 12 L: 12 D). At 138 and 168 days of age 20 birds/breed were weighed and then slaughtered. Testicular samples were collected, after evisceration, processed and embedded in paraffine wax. Sections were stained for morphological observations, observed with light microscope, and then classified according to the testis maturation stage. Ermellinata di Rovigo chickens showed the lowest (P< 0. 01) body weight and the highest (P< 0. 01) testes weight; testes maturity was higher (P< 0. 01) in ER than in RL, whereas RM was intermediate. For each genotype testes weight and testes maturity did not significantly differ with aging. Correlations between testes weight and body, comb, and wattles weight, according to the breed, were calculated at 168 days of age. For ER no significant correlation was found, whereas RL showed a significant (P< 0. 01) positive relationship between testes weight and body weight, and sexual secondary characters. Robusta maculata showed a significant correlation between testes weight and comb (P< 0. 01) and wattles weight (P< 0. 10).

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of increasing levels of water restriction on body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion and mortality of broiler chicks to eight weeks of age. In addition, the effects of water restriction on water:feed ratios, water consumption per pound of body weight and on the percent of toe moisture were observed. A total of 312 one-day-old broiler chicks were placed on regimens of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 percent water restriction after the first week based on ad libitum intake of the control chicks for the previous 24 hours. Water and feed were weighed and recorded daily for all treatments during the eight-week trial. The chicks were bulk weighed weekly by sex and brooded on floor pens under <b>infra-red</b> <b>lamps</b> in a forced-draft ventilated house. Results indicated that feed consumption, water consumption, body weight, water:feed ratio and water consumption per pound of body weight were decreased with each increment of water restriction. A significant difference in body weight between males and females was found in all groups throughout the trial. Interactions due to replication, sex x replication and sex x treatment were not present. Water restriction was found to be deleterious to feed conversion with each increment of water restriction. Mortality and percent toe moisture content were not significantly affected by water restriction. Edema and degeneration of the cells lining the tubules of kidneys were the only changes observed in the body tissues of the 50 percent restricted chicks. For all practical purposes the optimum amount of water consumed by the growing chick to eight weeks of age under conditions of this experiment equals 10. 61 pounds per bird...|$|E

50|$|Thermal radiation, {{a common}} synonym for infra-red when it occurs at {{temperatures}} commonly encountered on Earth, {{is the process}} by which the surface of an object radiates its thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Infrared radiation that one can feel emanating from a household heater, <b>infra-red</b> heat <b>lamp,</b> or kitchen oven are examples of thermal radiation, as is the IR and visible light emitted by a glowing incandescent light bulb (not hot enough to emit the blue high frequencies and therefore appearing yellowish; fluorescent lamps are not thermal and can appear bluer). Thermal radiation is generated when the energy from the movement of charged particles within molecules is converted to the radiant energy of electromagnetic waves. The emitted wave frequency of the thermal radiation is a probability distribution depending only on temperature, and for a black body is given by Planck's law of radiation. Wien's displacement law gives the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law gives the heat intensity (power emitted per area).|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{strongly}} {{affects the}} operation of integrated circuits, and its impact has been largely investigated on a device level. However, the impact of temperature variations on networks of multiple devices is far less understood and requires investigation. We aim to close this gap and analyse the impact of temperature fluctuations on low-power wireless sensor networks, a key enabling technology of pervasive computing. As we are moving forward into an era of human-centric safety-critical applications (e. g., smart health and intelligent transportation systems), it is particularly important {{to make sure that}} a networked system offers a reliable and deterministic performance despite all possible temperature changes over its deployment lifetime. In this demo, we present a testbed infrastructure based on <b>infra-red</b> heating <b>lamps</b> that allows to vary the on-board temperature of sensor nodes on a large scale in a repeatable fashion. Using this experimental infrastructure, we show the effects of temperature variations on network performance in two different ways. First, in a small-scale local testbed at PerCom, we highlight the degradation of the wireless link quality at high temperatures, and show that the performance of radio transceivers is temperature-dependent. We quantify this degradation and parametrize the dependency between temperature and link quality using the signal strength information captured between four wireless sensor nodes. Second, we connect remotely to our large-scale experimental infrastructure at TU Graz, and assess the impact of temperature variations on the performance of state-of-the-art network protocols, showing that the typical outdoor temperature fluctuations occurring during 24 -hours do affect key network metrics such as throughput, delay, and lifetime...|$|R
5000|$|It is true {{that many}} of Hannell's works of pottery were for dinner-time, but the shape and design are identifiably {{of her hand and}} design. An article in Craft Ceramist Utopia from the 1950s tells of her [...] "stunning centerpieces of piled up artichokes, onions, peppers, etc., all done in a solid finish of gold of pewter with {{matching}} treatment in the dinner wear, enough to transport the buyer to the world of Cellini." [...] Oftentimes Hazel designed the pieces and Vin would fire them. Hannell's method of applying the designs to her pottery involved an oriental brush with cobalt (blue), copper oxide (green), iron oxide (brown), and pewter glaze. The beauty of her cobalt pieces is known well among collectors of her work. Clem and Nixon Hall of New York, a designer-distributor organization, brought [...] "their years of design and merchandising experience to the end that Hannell pieces fit market demands." [...] A feature of the couple in The Gary Post-Tribune spoke of the Hannells' open to the public studio in which, [...] "Vin would probably be watching over the two electric kilns, where the articles are fired," [...] or would be checking [...] "the <b>infra-red,</b> electric <b>lamps,</b> which provide a quick-drying method for the newly made cups and saucers." [...] Her pieces are not perfect in form and often include bulges or indentations allowing for easy handling. This was done purposefully as a counter to the industrialization against which she often protested. [...] "Some people seem to like the factory-made look," [...] she told the Chesterton Tribune, [...] "I'm a little inclined not to bother with it; the pieces are more interesting if they're not all exactly the same." [...] On the pottery dune grasses can be found, bending in the wind, flora such as the lily-of-the-valley, or privately done calligraphy. Hannell also designed a series of clay angels and women figures such as the Madonna from Indian red clay.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Petroleum mulch applied on {{the soil}} surface over a row of planted seeds {{promotes}} a more rapid and a more uniform germination of seeds, enhances elongation of seedlings {{and in some cases}} increases the yield of the crop. The beneficial effects of petroleum mulch have usually been attributed to increased soil temperatures below the mulch. Some reports have pointed out that evaporation of soil water is reduced {{as a result of the}} mulch application. An experimental arrangement was designed so that changes in soil temperature and soil water content of mulched and unmulched soil, subjected to the same radiation load could be measured under controlled conditions. Soil at a pre-determined water content was packed into boxes with inside dimensions of 4. 0 x 40. 0 x 48. 0 cm. A ten cm wide band of mulch was applied to one side of the slab leaving 30 cm of bare soil. The soil was subjected to a temperature cycle by turning on <b>infra-red</b> heat <b>lamps</b> at 8 : 00 A. M., increasing the energy output at hourly intervals with a variable transformer until 2 : 00 P. M. and then decreasing the energy output until the lights were turned off at 8 : 00 P. M. Soil temperatures were measured at two-hour intervals with calibrated thermistors inserted into the soil slab. Soil water content changes at selected points were measured at regular intervals with a collimated gamma-beam, movable in a vertical as well as a horizontal direction. The heat flux into the soil was measured with heat flux discs. It was observed that an application of petroleum mulch, changes the temperature and water regime of a soil. The mulch covered soil was about 5 °C warmer than the bare soil at the time the soil temperatures attained their maximum value. At all other times the temperature difference between mulched and bare soil was smaller. The bare soil rapidly lost water in the upper four centimeters. The mulch covered soil lost water in the upper cm of soil but gained water at depths below this zone. This gain in water was observed in the zone where seedlings are normally placed, indicating that the beneficial effect of petroleum mulch on germination and seedling growth must be attributed to improved soil water conditions as well as to improved soil temperature conditions...|$|R
