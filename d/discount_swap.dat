This intuition breaks down when swaps are marked-to-market and collat-eralized to mitigate credit exposure which is current market practice. Marking-to-market improves recovery rates and hence affects the default-adjusted rates used to <b>discount</b> <b>swap</b> cash flows. Marking-to-market also results in intermediate cash-flows and it is costly to post collatera. We show that collateralized swap rates differ from those obtained by viewing swaps as portfolio of forward contracts. Ig-noring collateralization introduces significant biases in swap rates, especially for long dated swaps. ∗Johanne...|$|E
40|$|Interest rate swap pricing theory {{traditionally}} views swaps as portfolios of forward {{contracts with}} net <b>swap</b> payments <b>discounted</b> using LIBOR rates. Current market practices of marking-to-market and collateralization question this view. Collateralization and marking-to-market affects <b>discounting</b> of <b>swap</b> payments (through altered default characteristics) and introduces intermediate cash-flows. This paper provides {{a theory of}} swap valuation under collateralization and we find evidence that collateralization effects swap rates. Using Eurodollar futures, we find that swaps are priced above the portfolio of forwards value and below a portfolio of futures value. The effect of collateral is time varying. We estimate a term structure model to characterize the cost of collateral and quantify its effectonswaprates. ∗Johannes and Sundaresan are with the Columbia Business School.

40|$|In {{the context}} of multi-curve {{modeling}} we consider a two-curve setup, with one curve for <b>discounting</b> (OIS <b>swap</b> curve) and one for generating future cash flows (LIBOR for a give tenor). Within this context we present an approach for the clean-valuation pricing of FRAs and CAPs (linear and nonlinear derivatives) {{with one of the}} main goals being also that of exhibiting an "adjustment factor" when passing from the one-curve to the two-curve setting. The model itself corresponds to short rate modeling where the short rate and a short rate spread are driven by affine factors; this allows for correlation between short rate and short rate spread as well as to exploit the convenient affine structure methodology. We briefly comment also on the calibration of the model parameters, including the correlation factor. Comment: 16 page...|$|R
40|$|Looking at the {{valuation}} of a swap when funding costs and counterparty risk are neglected (i. e., {{when there is}} a unique risk free discounting curve), it is natural to ask "What is the discounting curve of a swap in the presence of funding costs, counterparty risk and/or collateralization". In this note we try to give an answer to this question. The answer depends on who you are and in general it is "There {{is no such thing as}} a unique <b>discounting</b> curve (for <b>swaps).</b> " Our approach is somewhat "axiomatic", i. e., we try to make only very few basic assumptions. We shed some light on use of own credit risk in mark-to-market valuations, giving that the mark-to-market value of a portfolio increases when the owner's credibility decreases. We present two different valuations. The first is a mark-to-market valuation which determines the liquidation value of a product. It does, buy construction, exclude any funding cost. The second is a portfolio valuation which determines the replication value of a product including funding costs. We will also consider counterparty risk. If funding costs are presents, i. e., if we value a portfolio by a replication strategy then counterparty risk and funding are tied together: - In addition to the default risk with respect to our exposure we have to consider the loss of a potential funding benefit, i. e., the impact of default on funding. - Buying protection against default has to be funded itself and we account for that. The valuation naturally attributes for wrong-way-risk (i. e., the correlation between counterparty default and counterparty exposure). ...|$|R
40|$|Non-performing loans (NPLs) are {{essentially}} {{a product of}} the irrational allocation of resources. Different from other Asian countries, China's NPL issue resulted primarily from a transitioning economy dominated by the triangular relations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), state-owned commercial banks (SOBs) and the fiscal system. Even though the total amount of NPLs in 1999 was estimated to be around 30 % of the total outstanding loans of SOBs, the NPL problem in China would not lead to an immediate financial crisis as the NPL problem is more a stock problem than a flow one. However, the huge amount of overhanging bad debts {{has become one of the}} bottlenecks for China's further reform, particularly, in the banking sector. The establishment of four Asset Management Companies (AMCs) was an innovative approach to provide an instant relief of the bad debt burden of SOBs, to recover distressed assets and to restructure SOEs. Despite facing many challenges, the AMCs have been continuously seeking new NPL workout approaches and made substantial progress. A series of workout approaches have been introduced including debt-equity <b>swap,</b> <b>discounted</b> payoff, loan pool sale and property auction, etc. The process, however, will become increasingly difficult because the high quality assets have been disposed of first and the more troubled ones still remain in the portfolio. Furthermore, if the government cannot make a creditable commitment that the current NPL transfer and debt-equity swap is a once-off policy, new NPLs will be encouraged through soft lending by the SOBs and strategic default by the SOEs. There are also several obstacles ahead to the AMCs including China's immature capital market, the AMCs' internal structural problems as well as China's weak legal enforcement mechanism. Fortunately, the Chinese government has made a great commitment to tackle the NPL issue not only from the surface but also from the fundamental structure, evidenced by the Chinese government's efforts to improve the corporate governance of SOEs and institutional infrastructures. China's accession to the WTO in 2001 will further force the government to seriously reform the banking sector in order to build up the competitive advantage to face the imminent competition from foreign banks. With more international practices introduced and corporate governance improved, China's banking system could be more resilient and healthier in the near future. The AMC scheme would hopefully be a once-off prescription. by Xiaojun Allan Wu. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2002.
