25|$|From 1944 Baird was {{suffering}} from increasingly poor health, and late that year he suffered an attack of fever that left him almost invalid. Nevertheless, he formed a new company, John Logie Baird Ltd., with offices and labs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> London house. Baird visited the lab less and less frequently over time, and his wife noticed why in a November 1945 visit when he was seen {{to have to stop}} and pant after climbing every stair of the building's four stories. He caught a cold over Christmas 1945, and suffered a stroke in February 1946. He was ordered bedridden but refused to stay there, and continued to deteriorate until his death on 14 June.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, {{through the}} years of World War II American art was {{characterized}} by Social Realism and American Scene Painting (as seen above) {{in the work of}} Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, and several others. Nighthawks (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, {{but one of the most}} recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. The scene was inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's home neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.|$|E

The episode was not intended to give the actors a week off, but ended up that way, which Duchovny was very pleased with. Producer J.P. Finn coordinated the sequence where The Smoking Man assassinates John F. Kennedy. It was filmed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> Vancouver location doubling for Dealey Plaza. The show's costume designer contacted the costume designer for the film JFK and borrowed a reproduction of Jackie Kennedy's pink suit used in the film. The presidential limousine ridden by Kennedy was created by picture vehicle coordinator Nigel Habgood.|$|E

[...] Jackson survived a three-hour surgical removal of a benign tumor from her neck on May 7, 2008.

Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) arrive and investigate the scene while being accosted by a new junior agent, Amy Jessup (Meghan Markle), who wonders what they do for the FBI. After Walter searches through the SUV, he shuts the door and Olivia suddenly ejects through the windshield. She is {{rushed to the hospital}} and declared brain dead. Peter and Broyles (Lance Reddick) drink at a bar together in sorrow, and Broyles reveals the Fringe Division is being shut down because of their failure to provide [...] "usable results".

500|$|Honey pays {{homage to}} some of Nagai's other creations, such as the Mazinger and Devilman series; the first two episodes alone include many cameos. [...] The first shows Mayor Light and Chokkei in a picture with {{characters}} from Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen, Iyahaya Nantomo, and Oira Sukeban, while Devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle. In the second, a scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> market in Cosplay City has cameos from Hige Godzilla from Harenchi Gakuen and Naojiro Abashiri from The Abashiri Family; a scene in Honey's bedroom shows a bust of Mazinger Z and a framed picture of her father, Dr. Kisaragi; and several scenes show Mazinger Z Sayaka Yumi, The Abashiri Family Kikunosuke, and an unnamed character from Kekkō Kamen as they get turned into plastic-coated statues. Cutie Honey's skin-tight, full-body costume uses the same design and tricolor (blue, black, and red) scheme as that of Nagai's original manga, but its chest opening—with rounded side edges—resembles the one in her 1973 anime attire. The opening sequence used {{in the first four}} episodes shows versions of Honey's original seven forms in the TV series: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's techniques parody those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later episodes feature appearances by Akira Fudo of Devilman and Professor Kabuto of Mazinger Z. In episode 7, Honey transforms herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title sequence of episodes 5 through 8 features Sirene, Devilman's nemesis, and Akira Fudo of Devilman along with Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto. Devilman can be briefly seen as one of the back-up guitarists for the one-time antagonist Saline in episode 3.|$|E
500|$|In the 2007 off-season, Lucic {{signed an}} {{entry-level}} {{contract with the}} Bruins on August 2. He had been chosen as the Giants' next team captain, but made the Bruins' 2007–08 opening roster out of training camp. He played in his first career NHL game on October 5, 2007, a 4–1 loss to the Dallas Stars, in which he fought opposing forward Brad Winchester. His first goal came a week later on October 12 against Jonathan Bernier, a game winner, in an 8–6 win against the Los Angeles Kings. By also fighting Kings forward Raitis Ivanāns and notching an assist, he recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick (an unofficial statistic constituting a goal, an assist and a fight in one game). Unsure of whether the Bruins would keep him or return him to junior, he stayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> hotel in Boston to start the season. However, Lucic made enough of an impression during his first set of games with the Bruins, showing grit and consistent willingness to fight (he recorded 13 fighting majors in his rookie season), that they decided {{to keep him in}} the lineup. Bruins management informed the Giants prior to Lucic's tenth game, accounting for the NHL's nine-game maximum for junior-eligible players to stay with their NHL club without initiating their contract. He was chosen to participate in the 2008 NHL YoungStars Game and finished his rookie campaign with eight goals and 27 points. Towards the end of the season, he was voted by Bruins fans for the team's Seventh Player Award for exceeding expectations. Matched up against the first-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the opening round, Lucic scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal in Game 3 on April 13, 2008. [...] He finished his first NHL post-season with two goals as the Bruins were eliminated by the Canadiens in seven games.|$|E

In 1931, a director slipped a kissing scene past the censor (who was a friend), {{but when the}} film opened <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> Tokyo theater, the screening was stopped and the film confiscated. During the American Occupation of Japan, in 1946, an American censor required a film to include a kissing scene. One scholar says that the censor suggested [...] "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?" [...] Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl Harbor, Americans had felt that the Japanese were [...] "sneaky", claiming that [...] "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early Lynchburg was {{not known}} for religiosity, {{although}} the Church of England supposedly built a log church in 1765. In 1804, evangelist Lorenzo Dow wrote: [...] "...where I spoke {{in the open air}} in what I conceived to be the seat of Satan's Kingdom. Lynchburg was a deadly place for the worship of God'." [...] That referred to the lack of churches, which was corrected the following year. Itinerant Methodist Francis Asbury visited the town; Methodists built its first church in 1805; and it hosted the last Virginia Methodist Conference that bishop Asbury attended (February 20, 1815). Nonetheless, as Lynchburg's citizens and visitors grew wealthier, prostitution and other [...] "rowdy" [...] activities became quite common and often ignored, if not accepted, particularly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> area referred to as the [...] "Buzzard's Roost." [...] Also, pro-slavery Methodist preacher and later bishop John Early became one of Lynchburg's civic leaders.|$|E

On New Year's Day, he appeared before Judge Andrew Wilson <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> New Orleans court, who presided over a hearing lasting about fifteen minutes. Armstrong was sentenced him to detention at the Colored Waif's Home. The home had only been established four years earlier.
