2500|$|Assault planning. As {{with most}} VC Main Force/PAVN operations, the general pattern of [...] "one slow, four quick" [...] was {{followed}} - slow recon and initial penetration, then <b>fast</b> <b>approach,</b> attack, clearance and withdrawal. A typical assault {{began with a}} detailed recon of the target- pinpointing bunkers, ammo dumps, command and communications centers, barracks, power generation facilities and other vital points. Data from many other sources (farmers, spies, informers etc.) was collected and added to this. Detailed mortar ranges to each target area were plotted. A mock-up of the target was created and detailed rehearsals took place. Assaults were usually planned after nightfall. Signalling systems were sometimes devised using colored flares. A typical signal package by the assault teams might be as follows: red flare: area hard to get into; white flare: withdrawal; green followed by white: reinforcements requested; green flare: victory.|$|E

50|$|The landing continued, but manual braking did not {{commence}} {{until the}} aircraft was over 1,600 metres down the runway. Then the plane proceeded to hydroplane and skid {{its way down}} the runway, departing substantially from runway centreline.

The combination of flaps 25, no auto-braking, no reverse thrust, a high and <b>fast</b> <b>approach,</b> a late touch down, poor Cockpit Resource Management, and the standing water on the runway led to a runway overshoot.|$|E

Fly-offs are often used by the U.S. Air Force to select military aircraft; NASA has never used this approach in awarding contracts.

50|$|On 6 January 1953, Willem Ruys {{collided}} in the Red Sea {{with running}} mate , which was {{heading in the}} opposite direction. At that time, it was common for passenger ships to pass each other at close range to entertain their passengers.

50|$|After the war ended, Oranje {{returned}} to {{her life as a}} passenger ship. In 1947, she recommenced the Amsterdam to Jakarta service, sailing via Southampton, England. In January 1953 on a voyage outward bound Oranje collided in the Red Sea with her Royal Rotterdam Lloyd running mate Willem Ruys homeward bound heading the opposite direction. On the (later heavily criticized) abrupt and <b>fast</b> <b>approach</b> of Oranje (ships wanted to pass each other at close range for passenger amusement) Willem Ruys made an unexpected swing to left and a shameful collision was the result. It was a near-miss disaster. Oranje badly damaged her bows and due to the possibility she would be impounded for safety reasons, she was unable to call at Colombo as scheduled, and went directly to Jakarta. The passenger service to Jakarta eventually ended in 1957. The next year, in 1958, she made her first liner voyage from Amsterdam to Australia, sailing via Southampton, Suez in Egypt, and Singapore. She underwent a refit and a minor facelift in Amsterdam in 1959. Upon completion the tonnage was then listed as , and the ship was able to accommodate 323 First Class and 626 Tourist Class passengers.|$|E

50|$|The {{player can}} assumed {{the role of}} one of four {{different}} character class types, the Warrior, Wizard, Assassin or Shaman. The player enters a Mansion on the top floor and gradually progress down the increasing difficulty floors by leveling up.The entire game is randomly generated, so monsters, traps, loot are never on the same place. The game world is placed in a tile-based square grid that is viewed from a top-down perspective, where the player, enemies, items and objects occupy discrete squares. The game is turn-based, and both the player and numerous enemies take turns performing actions. The game has a very <b>fast</b> <b>approach</b> to the turn-based mechanic, and while the player does {{have to wait for the}} enemies to take turn, everything is done very quickly to keep the action fluid. Each turn the player may move or attack monsters in adjacent squares, pick, drop, and use items, and interact with various in-game objects. Permanent death is a major part of the game, in which if the player dies by losing all HP it will restart from the beginning of the game, thus creating a different dungeon, there are no options inside the game to change this, so while the player can save and continue later at any moment, if he dies he can't continue.|$|E
