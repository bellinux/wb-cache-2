5|$|When {{compared}} to the CHA, the geographical distances between NHA teams were much greater; however, the NHA's financial backers were more notable businessmen. These businessmen applied <b>financial</b> <b>principles</b> {{similar to those of}} early baseball, and the leagues quickly entered a bitter bidding war over players. In particular, after being rejected from the CHA, Renfrew aggressively pursued any players that the CHA's Ottawa club wanted. Montreal became a notable battleground as the NHA established two franchises, including the modern-day Montreal Canadiens. With its significantly wealthier backers, the NHA easily recruited the top players, leaving the CHA teams, except Ottawa, relatively mediocre. Ottawa regularly trounced its opponents, and league attendance and interest dropped. The CHA's final season lasted eight games, and the league folded in 1910, as its Ottawa and Montreal clubs joined the NHA.|$|E

30|$|For Copula models, {{although}} we have verified that Gaussian Copula has a better performance than other Copula function in this sample. There is still needed to test its fitting property with original sample. Hence, Diehoid <b>financial</b> <b>principle</b> ‘Assessment of density distribution model based on series probability integral transformation’ is introduced [25, 26]. In this principle, the general idea of Diehoid is: obtaining a new series from the original data by probability integral transformation, and then testing whether the new series is independent and identically distributed to (0, 1) uniform distribution. In this paper, it is divided as two steps: (1) Transforming the Copula wind model under the Weibull distribution by probability integral transformation, and then testing the autocorrelation of each transformed series probability to see whether series itself independent; (2) Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) principle to check transformed series keeps (0, 1) uniform distribution. We could recognize that the marginal distribution of wind speed sample by Copula modeling is correct.|$|R

Under Robert Lehman, the bank concentrated on rapidly developing consumer industries with financing deals arranged in retailing, airlines, and the entertainment business notably with the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theatre group 1928 deal that sold the majority of its stock to Joseph P.

5000|$|As 1914 approached, the Institute was {{operating}} at a financial loss, {{and the executive}} considered closure. With {{the outbreak of the}} Great War in 1914, there was a large number of potential membership candidates. From 1919-1930 the financial position of the Institute and membership were healthy. After 1930, the membership dwindled a little each year, owing to deaths and resignations. With the depression it was uncertain whether the Institute could survive. Resignations increased since many members could not afford the yearly membership fee of $15. Some affluent citizens who had resigned from their $100-a-year clubs, but still wanted a club to belong to, joined the CMI. In 1935, accounts were short by $52,000. Although criminal prosecution was pointless, so far as collecting the balance was concerned, a cheque for $35,000 was sent by the bonding company. The $17,000, which could have been a death blow to the institute, was written off. In 1935, the executive considered closing. A new finance committee was set up, chaired by Lt. Col. F. S. McPherson, who kept the Institute in the black during the period he was either President or Chairman of the Finance Committee, from 1936 to 1953 inclusive, except for two years he was overseas on active service. Under McPherson an annual budget was prepared in advance and adhered to. Once a dollar was banked, it stayed in the bank. Entrance fees were banked and the Institute operated on annual fees.

On one hand, social interaction is becoming a major subject to increase engagement and popularity in games, therefore, this doc¬ument focusses on unveiling the potential of using several Social Networks instead of using only Facebook, pioneer of Social Networks. Moreover, 2 versions of the same game are analysed. While version 1 is capable to share content in many Social Networks, version 2 cannot. On the other hand, Pareto principle also known as the 80 - 20 rule, is a <b>financial</b> <b>principle</b> used to describe the correlation between two variables. In this document, Pareto principle will be applied to the outcome of the games, aiming to discover the sources of popularity growth in mobile games. Finally, in relation to the re¬sults of the experiment, this work highlights the most important profitability factors to maximise revenue or at least to minimise financial lost in mobile games...|$|R
