Arsenal had been the more successful team in recent years, having won three First Division titles in succession {{in the past few}} seasons; while Sheffield United were keen to win the trophy after the success of rival team Sheffield Wednesday in the 1935 Final.|$|E

5|$|Departing from Cape Henlopen, Delaware on February 17, 1776, {{the fleet}} {{arrived in the}} Bahamas on March 1, with the {{objective}} of seizing gunpowder and munitions known to be stored there.

Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets that have <b>had</b> <b>most</b> of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.|$|E

Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this <b>had</b> <b>most</b> likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E

5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that <b>had</b> <b>most</b> closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian <b>had</b> <b>most</b> of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E
5|$|Baron Franz Nopcsa, in 1902, {{proposed}} a new grouping of dinosaurs, Acanthopholididae, a clade of lightly-built thyreophorans. He included {{in it the}} genera Acanthopholis, Polacanthus, Syngonosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and possibly Nodosaurus. Soon after, he also added Priodontognathus and Palaeoscincus. He considered Acanthopholididae to be the sister clade to Stegosauridae, and also stated that it might include Hylaeosaurus, which he found <b>had</b> <b>most</b> {{of the characteristics of}} the family. Later, in 1915, he rearranged the species included in it. The genera that were later included were Acanthopholis (=Anoplosaurus), Polacanthus, Stegopelta, Stegoceras, and Struthiosaurus. Along with Ankylosaurus, Acanthopholididae was defined to form a subfamily of Nodosauridae. In 1923 he divided up the family into two subfamilies without comment. These two subfamilies were named Acanthopholinae and Struthiosaurinae.|$|E

5|$|Despite her injury, McLeod {{returned}} to the pitch quickly, starting in three games at the CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier in February 2016 where she recorded two shutouts. On February 19, McLeod joined the national team for their semifinal match against Costa Rica. In the warmup for the game, she again injured her right knee and left the warmup early. However, she played all 90 minutes of the match. Following the tournament, she {{returned to}} Sweden to play with her club team, FC Rosengård. In March 2016, her knee collapsed after kicking a ball while playing with FC Rosengård. It was revealed that she had torn her ACL in her right knee for the third time. Later, her surgeon stated that the injury <b>had</b> <b>most</b> likely occurred in the warmup before Canada's match against Costa Rica. McLeod has stated that her recovery {{is expected to take}} one to two years and plans to be back on the field in February or March 2017.|$|E

Convection around the eye continued become more symmetrical, though the National Hurricane Center had stated that Hernan <b>had</b> <b>most</b> likely {{reached its peak}} intensity or {{was very close to}} doing so. However, the eye suddenly became better defined. Based on this, Hernan was {{upgraded to}} a major hurricane. The intensity of Hernan was uncertain, as there was some difference between intensity estimates. Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125mph (205km/h). Overnight, Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken. Although the eye remained well defined, outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor.|$|E

It was announced in February 2016 that she had signed with Swedish team, FC Rosengård, along with her wife, Ella Masar. McLeod made her debut for the team in the final of the Super Cup on March 16, 2016, where FC Rosengård won 2–1. Though she was noticeably nervous, she made a number of saves and showed good reflexes. She made one other appearance on March 23, 2016, playing 13 minutes before she was forced to leave the game due to a knee injury.

5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county <b>had</b> <b>most</b> of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the geographic rivalry between the two teams, the controversies surrounding Lane Kiffin, and the performances of the players on each team.
