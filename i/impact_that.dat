The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it was before the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E

40|$|The 2015 Paris Agreement commits {{countries}} to pursue efforts {{to limit the}} increase in global mean temperature to 1. 5 °C above pre-industrial levels. We assess the consequences of achieving this target in 2100 for the <b>impacts</b> <b>that</b> are avoided, using several indicators of impact (exposure to drought, river flooding, heat waves and demands for heating and cooling energy). The proportion of <b>impacts</b> <b>that</b> are avoided is not simply equal to the proportional reduction in temperature. At the global scale, the median proportion of projected impacts avoided by the 1. 5 °C target relative to a rise of 4 °C ranges between 62 and 95 % across sectors: the greatest reduction is for heat wave impacts. The 1. 5 °C target results in <b>impacts</b> <b>that</b> would be between 27 and 62 % lower than with the 2 °C target. For each indicator, {{there are differences in}} the proportions of impacts avoided between regions depending on exposure and the regional changes in climate (particularly precipitation).

5|$|Apollo 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the <b>impact</b> <b>that</b> created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant <b>impact</b> <b>that</b> most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E

5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the <b>impact</b> <b>that</b> created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E
