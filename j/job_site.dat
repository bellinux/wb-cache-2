5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the <b>job</b> <b>site,</b> enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure the ground below some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} first span, the second span was poured in place. Although {{construction}} of the first span had occurred without any reported accidents, construction on the second span did not proceed as safely. On August 14, 1906, an African American worker had his hand crushed on the <b>job</b> <b>site.</b> Despite the accident, construction officials still estimated the time of completion at January 1.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{requirements}} for transportation of concrete are low {{because it is}} produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the <b>job</b> <b>site.</b> Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO2 are produced by the chemical reactions in cement manufacture). The overall embodied energy of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service {{employees}} often traveled {{many miles}} from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, {{getting to a}} <b>job</b> <b>site</b> meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment need to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round-trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many guard stations were no longer needed. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandon.|$|E
500|$|In the 2000s, Monster had legal {{disputes}} over its trademarks with the Discovery Channel for its show Monster Garage. Monster also had trademark disputes with Bally Gaming International over its slot machines, Monster Slots, with Hansen Beverage Co. for its Monster Energy drink, and the Chicago Bears, {{who use the}} nickname [...] "Monsters of the Midway". Other trademark disputes include a 2001 lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company for products related to the film Monsters, Inc., and a claim against an online used clothing retailer, MonsterVintage LLC. In 2004, Monster filed a complaint about the trademark application from Snow Monsters, a video website with skiing content for kids. The Snow Monsters owner initiated a lawsuit against Monster pre-emptively. It has also had a trademark dispute with the <b>job</b> <b>site,</b> Monster.com.|$|E
500|$|Inequality issue: A {{main concern}} is the {{possibility}} of undesirable distribution repercussions because of the diversity of road users. The use of the tolled road depends on the user's level of income. [...] Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge, then this policy is likely to privilege the middle-class and rich. The users who shift to some less-preferred alternative are also worse off. The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit. Road space rationing is another strategy generally viewed as more equitable than congestion pricing. However, high-income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand (such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a <b>job</b> <b>site)</b> are relatively more impacted.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, Slashdot, SourceForge, and Freecode were {{acquired}} by online <b>job</b> <b>site</b> Dice.com for $20 million, and {{incorporated into a}} subsidiary known as Slashdot Media. While initially stating {{that there were no}} plans for major changes to Slashdot, in October 2013, Slashdot launched a [...] "beta" [...] for a significant redesign of the site, which featured a simpler appearance and commenting system. While initially an opt-in beta, the site automatically began migrating selected users to the new design in February 2014; the rollout led to a negative response from many longtime users, upset by the added visual complexity, and the removal of features, such as comment viewing, that distinguished Slashdot from other news sites. An organized boycott of the site was held from February 10 to 17, 2014. The [...] "beta" [...] site was eventually shelved. In July 2015, Dice announced that it planned to sell Slashdot and SourceForge; in particular, the company stated in a filing that it was unable to [...] "successfully [...] the Slashdot user base to further Dice's digital recruitment business".|$|E

His roommate was an employee of PDM Contractors who had formerly lived with Gacy and had moved into Mowery's apartment less than one week before the youth's disappearance.

2500|$|Shaver {{claimed to}} have worked in a factory where, in 1932, odd things began to occur. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, Shaver [...] "began to notice {{that one of the}} welding guns on his <b>job</b> <b>site,</b> 'by some freak of its coil's field atunements', was {{allowing}} him to hear the thoughts of the men working around him. More frighteningly, he then received the telepathic record of a torture session conducted by malign entities in caverns deep within the earth". According to Michael Barkun, Shaver offered inconsistent accounts of how he first learned of the hidden cavern world, but that the assembly line story was the [...] "most common version". Shaver said he then quit his job, and became a hobo for a while.|$|E

2500|$|The {{courthouse}} {{was designed}} by Calvin R. Thornton, an architect from La Grande, Oregon. [...] The construction contract was won by S. R. Haworth for $31,300. [...] Haworth began work on the building in January 1909. [...] The plumbing and heating work was done under a separate sub-contractor, costing an additional $4,592. [...] Thornton moved to Enterprise to supervise to the courthouse construction. However, {{he was killed in}} December 1909 when he fell from a scaffold at another <b>job</b> <b>site</b> in Enterprise. [...] As a result, he never saw the finished courthouse. [...] In March 1910, a local furniture company was awarded a $3,183 contract to provide furniture, counters, and bar railings to finish the courthouse. [...] The courthouse opened for business on 5January 1910. [...] However, construction was not actually completed until May of that year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} prior to opening the Smith Center, UNC {{basketball}} played its home games in Carmichael Auditorium (now Carmichael Arena). Although Carmichael was fairly new, having opened in 1965, basketball's popularity overwhelmed the 10,180-seat facility, and [...] "you had to know somebody who knew somebody" [...] {{to get into a}} game. As early as 1979, talks began for a new arena. With the hope of accommodating every fan who would want to attend a game the plans became very ambitious. Money was raised entirely from private donations, using neither university funding nor taxes. According to David Halberstam's biography of Michael Jordan, Smith did not want the arena named after him, but was persuaded by the UNC administration and the arena's backers that fundraising efforts for the facility could fail if they did not use his name. The site chosen for the arena was a wooded ravine south of the main campus, and construction began in 1982. On the first day of construction, contractors were banned from wearing Duke or N.C.
