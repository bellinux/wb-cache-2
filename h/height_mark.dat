50|$|Built in Gothic style, in {{line with}} the rest of the cathedral, the chapel {{consists}} of two floors, the lower floor intended as a burial chapel for Christian I and the upper floor as Great Hall for the members of the king's newly created Fellowship of the Mother of God, the precursor to the modern day Order of the Elephant. The two floors rest on a central granite pillar, the so-called King's Pillar, where numerous kings have had their height measured over the years. Amongst the kings measured, Peter the Great, measured in 1716, stands tallest, while Chulalongkorn of Siam, measured in 1907, is the smallest. The <b>height</b> <b>mark</b> for Christian I is believed to be a technical error, as the king may have been tall, but not the giant the marker would suggest.|$|E
30|$|The boxplots {{representing}} the yearly mean evolution of significant wave height measurements {{are presented in}} Fig. 13. Data filtering processes have been performed, with the objective to remove missing data due to faulty instrument prior to boxplot representation. Of the 3 years investigated, the year 2013 records the larger spread in significant wave height measurements. This can be explained {{on the basis of}} the passage of cyclone ’Imelda’ within the vicinity of the island. Owing to relatively stable atmospheric conditions, the year 2014 recorded the lower spread of the distributions over the 3 -year period. The greater number of high outliers is observed for the year 2012 while the median value over the 3 -year period at Roches Noires seem to deviate not by much from the 2 m significant wave <b>height</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the victory at Taman, 18th and 56th Armies launched the Kerch–Eltigen Operation, a set of amphibious assaults from Taman across the Kerch Strait into the Crimea.

The city made some improvements, such as grading of new streets, regrading of older dirt streets, and paving of some streets, prior to 1945.

Most of the phase 2 and subsequent construction probably occurred during this period. During this timeframe, balloon framing was a popular and inexpensive technique for many farm houses in the 19th century. Requiring no specialized skills, it utilized long continuous framing members (studs) that ran from sill plate to eave line with intermediate floor structures nailed to them, with the heights of window sills, headers and next floor <b>height</b> <b>marked</b> out on the studs.|$|R

The men, mostly from Leith, {{were on their way}} to board ship at Liverpool in order to travel to the battlefront at Gallipoli. The handful of survivors were sent onwards the following day. The bodies of those killed in the railway disaster were returned to Leith and buried with great aplomb on 24 May with the 15th and 16th battalions Royal Scots serving as guard of honour. These are among 270 First World War casualties and 36 Second World War casualties interred at Rosebank.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} some RNA {{molecules}} to switch between different metastable conformations {{plays an important}} role in cellular processes. In order to identify such molecules and to predict their conformational changes one has to investigate the refolding pathways. As a qualitative measure of these transitions, the barrier <b>height</b> <b>marks</b> the energy peak along such refolding paths. We introduce a meta-heuristic to estimate such barriers, which is an NP-complete problem. To guide an arbitrary path heuristic, the method uses RNA shape representative structures as intermediate checkpoints for detours. This enables a broad but efficient search for refolding pathways. The resulting Shape Triples meta-heuristic enables a close to optimal estimation of the barrier height that outperforms the precision of the employed path heuristic. ...|$|R

At 0100 hours on November 15 the division resumed its assault, with the 227th Rifle Division on its right flank, but again failed to achieve success, losing six men killed and 20 wounded in the process; the division's combat journal described the German defense as [...] "persistent resistance by fire". At 1325 hours on November 16 the German air force began a series of heavy strikes against the division's positions, with over 100 Ju-87 and ME-109 sorties. Colonel Kulakov had established his observation post {{in the midst of his}} division's forward defense line in the northern portion of the Voikov factory. At 1330 hours he was killed along with two other officers standing nearby by a bomb blast, with a fourth officer wounded. Unaware of his fate, the People's Commissariat of Defense issued a decree the following day promoting Kulakov to the rank of Major General. On May 16, 1944, Kulakov was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his outstanding performance in the Kerch-Eltigen Operation, along with a captain and a sergeant-major of his division who were also killed during its course. Kulakov was buried at Krasnodar.|$|R
500|$|Though Hurricane Elena {{never crossed}} Florida's coast, its {{drawn-out}} interaction with land agitated large swaths of the state's western shore.

Near Clearwater, waves reached [...] in <b>height,</b> <b>marked</b> by a period of 13 seconds on August 31. One study determined that the storm removed an average of 10 cubic yards of coastal material per linear foot of shoreline in Escambia County, Gulf, Franklin, and Pinellas counties, with values peaking at 15.6 cubic yards per foot. Along the predominantly marshy coasts of Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus counties, erosion and structural damage were much more limited, {{partly due to the}} local southerly or southeasterly wind direction.|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the maximum}} {{permitted}} gross {{weight of a}} semi-trailer truck, {{without the use of}} a Special Type General Order (STGO), is 44 t. In order for a 44 t semi-trailer truck to be permitted on UK roads the tractor and semi-trailer must have three or more axles each. Lower weight semi-trailer trucks can mean some tractors and trailer having fewer axles. In practice, like double decker buses and coaches in the UK, there is no legal height limit for semi-trailer trucks; however, bridges over 5.03 m do not have the <b>height</b> <b>marked</b> on them. Semi-trailer trucks on Continental Europe have a height limit of 4.0 m.Vehicles heavier than 44 t are permitted on UK roads but are indivisible loads, which would be classed as abnormal (or oversize).
