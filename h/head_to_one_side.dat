500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side...</b> moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing {{his left knee}} in the same direction, {{with the palm of}} his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E

2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E

60|$|Here Rollo {{laid his}} <b>head</b> down <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> {{and placed his}} hand under it, {{as if it were}} a pillow, and then shut his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Then Wang heard, {{much more}} faint, a voice {{he had never}} heard before--a novel {{impression}} which he acknowledged by cocking his <b>head</b> slightly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
60|$|Pat Hawe {{cocked his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> like a vulture about to strike with his beak, and cunningly eyed Madeline.|$|E
60|$|He made {{a certain}} move {{of his hand}} and the canine {{suddenly}} sat upon his haunches and cocked his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then John Crumb slowly {{arose from}} his chair, {{and stood up}} at his full height. 'I hove,' said he, {{swinging}} his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|The pouch {{fell from}} the table and his pipe went down. His <b>head</b> leaned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and found the chair rail, and he knew nothing more.|$|R
60|$|Our hero was {{prepared}} for it. He put his <b>head</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> let the blow pass, and {{with his left hand}} lightly tapped the bridge of his opponent's nose.|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{appearance of}} patients with fourth nerve palsies (<b>head</b> tilted <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> chin tucked in) suggests the diagnosis, but other causes must be ruled out. For example, torticollis can produce a similar appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm just {{thinking}} that out.' She spread {{the picture on}} her knee and considered it, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> {{as though it were}} indeed dress material.|$|E
6000|$|Poker sprang forward, wagging {{the stump}} of his tail, {{and turned his}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> as if to say: [...] "Well, what's up? Any fun going?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{boatswain}} {{was quite}} taken aback. He {{opened his eyes}} wide with surprise, and putting his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> gazed earnestly and long at the boy {{as if he had}} been a rare old painting.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>head</b> is tilted <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> which stimulates {{both the}} canals and the otoliths.|$|R

60|$|At this Cocky {{burst into}} such wild and fantastic shrieks of {{laughter}} that Michael, ears pricked, <b>head</b> cocked <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> {{identified in the}} fibres of the laughter the fibres of the various voices he had just previously heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jove!" [...] Mulhall muttered {{under his}} breath. [...] "A long-legged Napoleon the Third, but burnt out, baked, and fire-crackled. And mangy! No wonder he crooks his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> He's {{got to keep}} the balance." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{inclined}} her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> {{while her}} fine eyes kept her visitor in view; she mused {{a moment and}} then smiled as with a certain compassionate patience. [...] "It's not in my interest to contradict you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Those who beg {{in silence}} starve in silence,' said Kim, quoting a native proverb. The lama tried to rise, but sank back again, sighing for his disciple, dead in far-away Kulu. Kim watched <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> {{considering}} and interested.|$|E
60|$|The little {{creature}} {{turned its}} <b>head</b> a trifle <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> as though {{listening for the}} fall of nuts.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{only made}} out of copper, like the old kettle in the barn-yard at home," [...] {{continued}} the hen, turning her <b>head</b> first <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and then <b>to</b> the other, so that both her little round eyes could examine the object.|$|R
6000|$|A largish, well-made {{dog with}} a sleek black coat, white underneath, and a black tail white-tipped, came running up, and stood before Tod, with its <b>head</b> rather <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and its {{yellow-brown}} eyes saying: 'I simply must get at what you're thinking, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Elizabeth {{was engaged}} with her needle also, and she bent her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> {{affecting}} to arrange her muslin; but her hand shook, her color heightened, {{and her eyes}} lost their moisture in an expression of ungovernable interest, as she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth-Jane was {{standing}} in the middle of her upstairs parlour, critically surveying some re-arrangement of articles with her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> when the housemaid came in with the announcement, [...] "Oh, please ma'am, we know now how that bird-cage came there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Understanding at {{once the}} purpose for which I had been called, I kneeled at the head while the Indian kneeled at the feet. Grasping the {{shoulders}} carefully I waited for a word or look from Big Otter, but instead he turned his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and uttered the single word,--"Come!" ...|$|E
50|$|The dog {{can turn}} his <b>head</b> {{slightly}} <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> turn the <b>head</b> completely over <b>to</b> the side, or turn completely around {{so that the}} back and tail is facing whoever the dog is calming.

6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} to live in London best,' murmured Picotee, her <b>head</b> sinking mournfully <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> 'I HATE being in Sandbourne now!' ...|$|R
25|$|Babs used exposed chains (covered by a fairing) to take {{power to}} the drive wheels. It has been rumored that the high engine cover {{required}} Parry-Thomas to drive with his <b>head</b> tilted <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> This story is not true; photographs show that the driver could see straight ahead.|$|R
6000|$|The tone {{in which}} this was said admitting of nothing more, Mr Chick relapsed into low spirits and silence. Not so Miss Tox, who, having listened to Mr Dombey with even a more {{emphatic}} attention than usual, and with a more expressive tendency of her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> now leant across the table, and said to Mrs Chick softly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg. He cocked his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and looked at it. He cocked {{his head to the}} other side and looked at it. He walked all around it, chuckling and saying to himself, [...] "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine, mine, mine, mine! Pretty, pretty, and all mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{they got}} some {{paper and a}} pen, and the king he set down and twisted his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke--and then {{for the first time}} the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|A mild choke at {{that moment}} caused the maid to fall into statuesque composure, and the painter to put his {{frowning}} <b>head</b> tremendously <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> as he stepped back {{in order to make}} quite sure that the last touch was really equal, if not superior, to Michael Angelo himself! ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly R.C. stopped short, {{with his}} <b>head</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> {{and his body}} stiffening. [...] "I heard that whistle again," [...] he said. We stood {{perfectly}} motionless for a long moment. Then from far off in the forest I heard a high, clear, melodious, bugling note. How thrilling, how lonely a sound! ...|$|R
60|$|Here another blank, intelligibly enough {{made up by}} {{the speaker}} {{touching}} his own neck with his left fore-finger, and leaning his <b>head</b> a little <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
