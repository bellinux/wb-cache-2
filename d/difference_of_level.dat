60|$|He climbed stiffly {{down the}} ladder and was rowed to a little cove. The coconut trees {{came down to the}} water's edge, not in rows, but spaced out with an ordered formality. They were like a ballet of spinsters, elderly but flippant, {{standing}} in affected attitudes with the simpering graces of a bygone age. He sauntered idly through them, along a path that could be just seen winding its tortuous way, and it led him presently to a broad creek. There was a bridge across it, but a bridge constructed of single trunks of coconut trees, a dozen of them, placed end to end and supported where they met by a forked branch driven into the bed of the creek. You walked on a smooth, round surface, narrow and slippery, and there was no support for the hand. To cross such a bridge required sure feet and a stout heart. The skipper hesitated. But he saw on the other side, nestling among the trees, a white man's house; he made up his mind and, rather gingerly, began to walk. He watched his feet carefully, and where one trunk joined on to the next and there was a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>level,</b> he tottered a little. It was with a gasp of relief that he reached the last tree and finally set his feet on the firm ground of the other side.

60|$|We did {{not return}} on board till late in the evening, for we stayed {{a long time in}} the lagoon, {{examining}} the fields of coral and the gigantic shells of the chama, into which, if a man were to put his hand, he would not, as long as the animal lived, be able to withdraw it. Near the head of the lagoon I was much surprised to find a wide area, considerably more than a mile square, covered with a forest of delicately branching corals, which, though standing upright, were all dead and rotten. At first I was quite at a loss to understand the cause; afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following rather curious combination of circumstances. It should, however, first be stated, that corals are not able to survive even a short exposure in the air to the sun's rays, so that their upward limit of growth is determined by that of lowest water at spring tides. It appears, from some old charts, that the long island to windward was formerly separated by wide channels into several islets; this fact is likewise indicated by the trees being younger on these portions. Under the former condition of the reef, a strong breeze, by throwing more water over the barrier, would tend to raise the level of the lagoon. Now it acts in a directly contrary manner; for the water within the lagoon not only is not increased by currents from the outside, but is itself blown outwards by the force of the wind. Hence it is observed that the tide near the head of the lagoon does not rise so high during a strong breeze as it does when it is calm. This <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>level,</b> although no doubt very small, has, I believe, caused the death of those coral-groves, which under the former and more open condition of the outer reef had attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth.|$|E

60|$|The pond {{rises and}} falls, but whether {{regularly}} or not, and within what period, nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is commonly {{higher in the}} winter and lower in the summer, though not corresponding to the general wet and dryness. I can remember when it was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar running into it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped boil a kettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year 1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and, on the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when I told them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they knew, which place was long since converted into a meadow. But the pond has risen steadily for two years, and now, in the summer of '52, is just five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high as it was thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the meadow. This makes a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>level,</b> at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs. This same summer the pond has begun to fall again. It is remarkable that this fluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment. I have observed one rise and a part of two falls, and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as I have ever known it. Flint's Pond, a mile eastward, allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets, and the smaller intermediate ponds also, sympathize with Walden, and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter.

5000|$|The Huainanzi has two {{versions}} of the earlier Zhuangzi zither string resonance analogy. Both Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 omit the reference to Lu Ju and his disciple who attracted yang to light a fire and yin to make ice, and each account adds a different interpretation. The shorter version refers to the Dao's mysterious ineffability.Now, one who makes something true uses the level; one who makes something straight uses the marking cord. Making true or straight without being in the line or on the level is an art that cannot be shared. When one strikes the note gong, gong responds 應; pluck the jue string, and another jue string moves 動. This is the mutual response of identical tones 同音之相應. What does not correspond to any of the five tones, but to which all twenty-five strings respond 應, is the Way, which cannot be transmitted. Thus, solitude is the lord of form 形之君; silence is the ruler of tone 音之主. (11.14, tr. Major et al. 2010: 417) The longer version adds a mystical [...] "Great Penetration" [...] associated with a Daoist Zhenren [...] "True/Perfected Person".Now when a person who tunes a se plays note gong, another gong string responds 應; when he plucks a jue string, another jue responds 動. This is the harmony of notes that are the same. But if he tunes one string eccentrically, so that it does not accord with any of the five notes and then strikes it, and all twenty-five strings the se respond 應, this is case of the sounds not yet having begun to differentiate but the ruler of all notes having already achieved its form 音之君已形. Thus one who penetrates to Supreme Harmony 太和 is as confused as person who is stupified by drink, who wanders about in a sweet daze without knowing where he has come from or where he is going. Simple and mild, he descends the vortex; simple and stupified, he reaches his end. He is like one who has not yet begun to emerge from the Ancestor. This is called the Great Penetration 大通. (6.4, tr. Major et al 2010: 220) Like the indiscernible [...] "sounds not yet having begun to differentiate", the True Person [...] "who has not yet begun to emerge" [...] resounds harmoniously with all things.
