500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] In a strong <b>head-wind,</b> umpire Pitman started the race at 3:30p.m. [...] The Light Blues made the better start, and {{slightly}} out-rating Oxford, began to pull away. [...] Rough water favoured Cambridge's style of rowing, and they were clear of Oxford by the time they passed the Mile Post. [...] The crews passed Harrods Furniture Depository with the Light Blues two lengths ahead and although the Dark Blues spurted again and again, they failed to make any inroads in the Cambridge lead, who began to pull away once again after passing under Barnes Bridge. [...] They passed the finishing post leading by two and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 20 seconds. [...] It was Cambridge's third consecutive victory, and their sixth in seven years, and took the overall record to 3430 in Oxford's favour. [...] The winning time was the fastest since the 1902 race and it was the narrowest margin of victory since the 1901 race. [...] Drinkwater described the race as [...] "a much finer struggle than those of the two previous years".|$|E

60|$|After dinner, {{the tide}} having turned and a stiff <b>head-wind</b> blowing, they brought up off Sheppey. It began to rain hard, {{and the crew}} of the Osprey, having made all snug above, retired to the cabin to resume their quarrel.|$|E
60|$|We beat {{about in}} the channel with a strong <b>'ead-wind</b> for four days, and then a tug picked us up and towed us to London.|$|R
60|$|I {{arrived here}} on Tuesday night, {{after a very}} slow passage from Halifax against <b>head-winds.</b> All the tickets {{for the first four}} {{readings}} here (all yet announced) were sold immediately on their being issued.|$|R
60|$|All serves our New World progress, {{even the}} bafflers, <b>head-winds,</b> cross-tides.

60|$|Other ships, without encountering {{these terrible}} gales, spend {{week after week}} endeavouring to turn this boisterous world-corner against a continual <b>head-wind.</b> Tacking hither and thither, in the {{language}} of sailors they polish the Cape by beating about its edges so long.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{presume that}} means he went to Victoria for the extra stores this morning; but {{how did he get}} there? It must be some distance, from what I know of the coast, and he would have a <b>head-wind</b> all the way back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] Thirlwell agreed. [...] "If I were {{steeped in}} sentiment, it wouldn't help me drive the canoe faster against a <b>head-wind</b> or carry a heavier load across a portage. That's a purely {{mechanical}} proposition. In the meantime, we're slowing up {{and will soon}} begin to drift astern." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} outside of Cape Clear upward of twenty days, still harassed by <b>head-winds,</b> though with {{pleasant}} weather upon the whole, {{when we were}} visited by a succession of rain storms, which lasted {{the greater part of}} a week.|$|R

60|$|Talcott played {{also on the}} flute, {{far better}} than I did myself; and we {{frequently}} made a trio, producing very respectable sea-music--better, indeed, than Neptune often got for his smiles. In this manner, then, we travelled our long road, sometimes contending with <b>head-winds</b> and cross-seas, sometimes becalmed, and sometimes slipping along {{at a rate that}} rendered everybody contented and happy.|$|R
6000|$|The skipper made {{a little}} {{impatient}} gesture. [...] "How long's she {{going to be getting}} there with a <b>head-wind?</b> Besides, all she could bring down would be nothing to me. I wouldn't have stayed so long, only that confounded broker told me a man called Merril was sending a steamer up." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{certainly}} a wonderful sight to see the little aeroplane, with outspread wings like a bird in flight, come sailing high over the mountains. There was a <b>head-wind,</b> and they were beating against it; otherwise {{we should not have}} had time to get to the tower before the arrival.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can take}} a hint as well as another man;" [...] and the skipper rose. [...] "In the meanwhile, I'll go ashore and stir up that broker again. You'll have a <b>head-wind</b> if you're going north, Mr. Wheelock. Expect you to come off and feed with me when you're back again. Good luck!" ...|$|E

60|$|We had {{tastes of}} bad weather and <b>head-winds,</b> of course; but, on the whole we had as fine a run as any {{reasonable}} man could expect, for sixty days. I then began to enter two remarks in the ship's Log and in my Journal; first, {{that there was an}} unusual and amazing quantity of ice; second, that the nights were most wonderfully dark, in spite of the ice.|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder whether}} those jolly lads bethink them {{of what they}} are dancing over. I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat <b>head-winds</b> round corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as you {{scholars}} have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.|$|R
60|$|The engine whirred. The assistants let go the tail. The machine labored forward, {{but once}} it left the ground it shot up quickly. The <b>head-wind</b> came in a terrific gust. The machine hung poised in air for a moment, driven back by the gale nearly {{as fast as it}} was urged forward by its frantically {{revolving}} propeller.|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} {{variables}} in 11 degrees north latitude, and 11 degrees north latitude we hugged jealously. To the south lay the doldrums. To the north lay the northeast trade {{that refused to}} blow from the northeast. The days came and went, and always they found the Snark somewhere near the eleventh parallel. The variables were truly variable. A light <b>head-wind</b> would die away and leave us rolling in a calm for forty-eight hours. Then a light <b>head-wind</b> would spring up, blow for three hours, and leave us rolling in another calm for forty-eight hours. Then--hurrah!--the wind {{would come out of}} the west, fresh, beautifully fresh, and send the Snark along, wing and wing, her wake bubbling, the log-line straight astern. At the end of half an hour, while we were preparing to set the spinnaker, with a few sickly gasps the wind would die away. And so it went. We wagered optimistically on every favourable fan of air that lasted over five minutes; but it never did any good. The fans faded out just the same.|$|E
60|$|One night Jones, {{the young}} O'Reilly, and myself were walking arm-in-arm and briskly {{up and down}} the deck. Six bells had rung; a <b>head-wind</b> blew chill and fitful, the fog was closing in with a {{sprinkle}} of rain, and the fog-whistle had been turned on, and now divided time with its unwelcome outcries, loud like a bull, thrilling and intense like a mosquito. Even the watch lay somewhere snugly out of sight.|$|E
60|$|There {{were those}} among the unregenerated who {{attributed}} the unceasing <b>head-winds</b> to our distressing choir-music. There {{were those who}} said openly that it was taking chances enough to have such ghastly music going on, {{even when it was}} at its best; and that to exaggerate the crime by letting George help was simply flying in the face of Providence. These said that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melody until they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship.|$|R
60|$|On the 22d we had light <b>head-winds.</b> A {{little before}} noon we passed, with the {{assistance}} of our oars, the Paciencia Straits, the narrowest part of the channel between Batchian and Gilolo. These were well named by the early Portuguese navigators, as the currents are very strong, {{and there are so many}} eddies, that even with a fair wind vessels are often quite unable to pass through them. In the afternoon a strong north wind (dead ahead) obliged us to anchor twice. At nigh it was calm, and we crept along slowly with our oars.|$|R
60|$|During {{each day}} the Captain {{and his wife}} were almost {{constantly}} on deck, their glasses sweeping the south-eastern horizon, hoping for the sight of two steamers coming back to Kingston. They saw vessels coming and going, but they were not the craft they looked for, and after they left the Caribbean Sea the sail became fewer and fewer. On the second day after they left Tobago Island they fell in with a small steamer apparently in distress, for she was working her way under sail and against <b>head-winds</b> towards the coast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{interrupted}} {{the captain of}} the forecastle who cared not to continue 'an inquiry in which his dreaded Commander saw fit to take a part, [...] "I dare say it is all right. I will look into my journal if I find it so, well--if not, why, it's only giving the ship a <b>head-wind,</b> until I've overhauled the Dane, and then it will be all in good time to receive the balance of the fee." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl {{was smiling}} at the {{comparison}} as they lifted the glider, with him holding the bars beneath. The plane was instantly buoyed up like a cork on water as the fifteen-mile <b>head-wind</b> poured under it. He stopped smiling. This was a dangerous living thing {{he was going to}} guide. It jerked at him as he slipped his arms over the suspended bars. He wanted to stop and think this all over. [...] "Get it done!" [...] he snapped at himself, and began to run down-hill, against the wind.|$|E
60|$|Soon after I {{left off}} as above {{we had a}} gale of wind which blew all night. For a few hours on the evening side of midnight there was no getting from this cabin of mine to the saloon, or vice versâ, so heavily did the sea break over the decks. The ship, however, made nothing of it, {{and we were all}} right again by Monday afternoon. Except for a few hours {{yesterday}} (when we had a very light <b>head-wind),</b> the weather has been constantly favourable, and we are now bowling away at a great rate, with a fresh breeze filling all our sails. We expect to be at Queenstown between midnight and three in the morning.|$|E
60|$|For {{two days}} Mrs. Cliff and Captain Burke breakfasted, dined, and supped by themselves. They had <b>head-winds,</b> {{and the sea}} was very rough, and {{although}} the yacht {{did not make the}} time that might have been expected of her in fair weather, she did very well, and Burke was satisfied. The two stewards were kept very busy with the prostrate and dejected members of the Synod, and Mrs. Cliff and the stewardess devoted their best efforts to the alleviation of the woes of Willy, which they were glad to see were daily dwindling.|$|R
60|$|All this time, {{you should}} know, the Covenant was meeting continual <b>head-winds</b> and {{tumbling}} {{up and down}} against head-seas, so that the scuttle was almost constantly shut, and the forecastle lighted only by a swinging lantern on a beam. There was constant labour for all hands; the sails {{had to be made}} and shortened every hour; the strain told on the men's temper; there was a growl of quarrelling all day long from berth to berth; and as I was never allowed to set my foot on deck, you can picture to yourselves how weary of my life I grew to be, and how impatient for a change.|$|R
60|$|At sea, a frigate {{houses and}} homes five hundred mortals {{in a space}} so {{contracted}} that they can hardly so much as move but they touch. Cut off from all those outward passing things which ashore employ the eyes, tongues, and thoughts of landsmen, the inmates of a frigate are thrown upon themselves and each other, and all their ponderings are introspective. A morbidness of mind is often the consequence, especially upon long voyages, accompanied by foul weather, calms, or <b>head-winds.</b> Nor does this exempt from its evil influence any rank on board. Indeed, high station only ministers to it the more, since the higher the rank in a man-of-war, the less companionship.|$|R
60|$|On quitting England, we {{embarked}} {{from the}} very strand where Henry V. embarked for the fruitless field of Agincourt. A fearful rumour had gone abroad that the Camilla (the steam-boat) had been shorn of a wing, {{and there were many}} rueful faces in the boat that took us off to the vessel. In plainer speech, one of the boilers was out of order, and the passage was to be made with just half the usual propelling power. At that season, or indeed at any season, the only probable consequence was loss of time. With a strong <b>head-wind,</b> it is true, the Camilla might have been compelled to return; but this might also have happened with the use of both the boilers.|$|E
60|$|After the gale the Great Eastern {{started on}} her return trip to Southampton, which she reached in safety {{on the morning}} of the 3rd November. In this, as in her {{previous}} experiences, the mighty ship was well tested, and her good and bad points in some degree proved. At the very outset the steam gear for aiding in lifting the anchors broke down, and one of the anchors refusing to let go, was broken in half. The condenser of the paddle engines seems to have been proved too small in this trip. For some time she went against a stiff <b>head-wind</b> and sea-- which is now well known to be the great ship's forte--with perfect steadiness; but on getting into the channel she rolled slowly but decidedly, as if bowing--acknowledging majestically the might of the Atlantic's genuine swell. Here, too, a wave actually overtopped her towering hull, and sent a mass of green water inboard! But her roll was peculiarly her own, and wonderfully easy.|$|E
60|$|I saw I hadn't got {{the hang}} of the steering, and so couldn't rightly tell where I {{was going to bring}} up when I started. I went afoot the rest of the day, and let my wings hang. Early next morning I went to a private place to have some practice. I got up on a pretty high rock, and got a good start, and went {{swooping}} down, aiming for a bush a little over three hundred yards off; but I couldn't seem to calculate for the wind, which was about two points abaft my beam. I could see I was going considerable to looard of the bush, so I worked my starboard wing slow and went ahead strong on the port one, but it wouldn't answer; I could see I was going to broach to, so I slowed down on both, and lit. I went back to the rock and took another chance at it. I aimed two or three points to starboard of the bush--yes, more than that--enough so as to make it nearly a <b>head-wind.</b> I done well enough, but made pretty poor time. I could see, plain enough, that on a <b>head-wind,</b> wings was a mistake. I could see that a body could sail pretty close to the wind, but he couldn't go in the wind's eye. I could see that if I wanted to go a-visiting any distance from home, and the wind was ahead, I might have to wait days, maybe, for a change; and I could see, too, that these things could not be any use at all in a gale; if you tried to run before the wind, you would make a mess of it, for there isn't anyway to shorten sail--like reefing, you know--you have to take it ALL in--shut your feathers down flat to your sides. That would LAND you, of course. You could lay to, with your head to the wind--that is the best you could do, and right hard work you'd find it, too. If you tried any other game, you would founder, sure.|$|E
60|$|Now it {{was that}} we found the {{advantage}} of the preparations already made. Little remained to be done, and that which was done, was much better done than if we had waited until the wreck was half full of water, and the seas were combing in upon her. The captain took charge of the launch, putting Mr. Marble, Rupert, Neb, myself and the cook, into the jolly-boat, with orders to keep {{as close as possible to}} himself. Both boats had sails, and both were so arranged as to row in calms, or <b>head-winds.</b> We took in rather more than our share of provisions and water, having two skillful caterers in the chief-mate and cook; and, having obtained a compass, quadrant, and a chart, for our portion of the indispensables, all hands were ready for a start, in about two hours after the ship had struck.|$|R
60|$|The long calms {{and light}} <b>head-winds</b> had {{prevented}} the vessels from making much progress {{for the few}} last days; and, by estimating the distance that was subsequently run in a course but a little south of west, it appears, notwithstanding all the encouraging signs of birds, fishes, calms, and smooth water, that {{on the morning of}} Monday, September 24th, or that of the fifteenth day after losing sight of Ferro, the expedition was about half-way across the Atlantic, counting from continent to continent, on the parallel of about 31 or 32 degrees of north latitude. The circumstance of the vessels being so far north of the Canaries, when it is known that they had been running most of the time west, a little southerly, must be imputed to the course steered in the scant winds, and perhaps to the general set of the currents. With this brief explanation, we return to the daily progress of the ships.|$|R
40|$|The Afro–Siberian Red Knot subspecies, Calidris canutus canutus, winters {{mainly on}} Banc d’Arguin, Mauritania, West Africa. An International Wader Study Group project {{carried out in}} 1979 {{suggested}} that during northward migration Red Knots cover their migration between the wintering grounds and the Siberian breeding grounds in two long-distance non-stop flights, stopping only in the Wadden Sea in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Each year Red Knots also visit staging sites along the French Atlantic coast {{in addition to the}} German Wadden Sea. Ever since 1979, the French staging sites have been counted on a regular basis and here we present the count data from these 30 years. In some years more than 20 % of the population used the French Atlantic coast as a staging site, but numbers are highly variable from one year to the next. We suggest that high numbers in France might occur when birds have to stop short of the Wadden Sea because of <b>head-winds</b> and/or a lack of tail-winds en route from West Africa. <br /...|$|R
