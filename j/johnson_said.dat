5|$|Alabama′s rush defense {{considerably}} {{improved in}} 2008. After giving up 128.4 rushing {{yards a game}} in 2007, the Crimson Tide only allowed 78.8 yards per game in 2008. “As far as one guy who has changed our team more than any, you’d {{have to go with}} Terrence,” offensive lineman Mike <b>Johnson</b> <b>said.</b> Cody was subsequently given the team’s Defensive Achievement Award for a newcomer who has {{played a critical role in}} the effectiveness of his unit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Johnson {{submitted}} the contributory negligence defense, {{he had not}} yet been able to speak to Polehinke himself. By the time newspapers reported on the court documents, <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> he had already told Royse, who criticized the statements, that he would withdraw the argument. Prior to his employment by Comair, Polehinke worked for Gulfstream International as a captain.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> {{that he had never}} actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{was born}} in Illinois to an {{academic}} and scholar mother, Dr. Cheryl Johnson-Odim, and a former Vietnam-war veteran father, Jimmy Johnson, who was an artist but worked in electronics. His parents divorced when he was 2 years old. His mother remarried a man of Nigerian descent. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> that growing up his family was based in afrocentrism and that his family celebrated Kwanzaa.|$|E
5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{established}} the Presidential Medal of Freedom on February 22, 1963, but died {{before he could}} award it. Two weeks after Kennedy's assassination, President Lyndon Johnson awarded it to Meany and thirty others on December 6, 1963. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> the award was for Meany's service to the union movement and for advancing freedom throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile {{announced}} he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball {{at the end of}} the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players.|$|E

5|$|Johnson joined League Two club Northampton Town on a one-month loan in September 2009. He {{made his}} debut {{for the club}} in a 3–0 loss against Shrewsbury Town and on 3 October 2009, scored the first goal of his {{professional}} career, in a 2–2 draw against Bradford City. Having played four games, <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> he hoped to help the club back to winning ways. On 22 October 2009, he extended his stay at Northampton until the new year, and scored his first goal on 24 October 2009 in a 4–2 win over Morecambe. The loan was extended {{until the end of}} the season in December.|$|E

On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits in a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns. Browns' manager Jack O'Connor supposedly told his third baseman Red Corriden to play back down the line all day, which allowed Lajoie easy bunt hits. Cobb complained about the move, though American League President Ban <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> that a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway and Chalmers ultimately awarded cars to both players.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} the tunnel's {{construction}} and opening coincides with PortMiami Deep Dredge Project that will see the port dredged deeper to accommodate larger ships expected following {{the completion of the}} Panama Canal expansion, now expected to be completed in 2016 (previously 2014). This will allow much larger ships, known as New Panamax, which will have a capacity of more than double that of Panamax ships to traverse the canal. This is predicted to cause a major increase in the Port of Miami's cargo traffic, which would overwhelm the intersection of Port Boulevard and Biscayne Boulevard without the tunnel. In 2009, 870,000 trucks moved cargo {{in and out of the}} port; and port officials estimate that that number will increase to around 1.4 million when larger ships start arriving. In 2010, about 800,000 TEU's were moved through the port, and port director Bill <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> that with the right marketing to major shippers, that number should double by 2020. Currently, the largest cargo ships that dock at the port have a capacity of around 4,200 TEU's (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units). After the canal expansion and port dredging, ships as large as 7,500 to 8,500 TEU's will be able to dock there.|$|E
5|$|ToeJam & Earl and its sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkatron {{together}} formed {{one of the}} Mega Drive's main series. However, creator Greg <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> that installments for the console's Mega-CD or 32X add-ons {{were never}} planned, and though rumors of a new game persisted throughout the commercial life of the Sega Saturn console, that system's poor performance in North America prevented development of a sequel. Johnson and programmer Mark Voorsanger regained the rights to ToeJam and Earl in 1995, and in November 1998 made an agreement with GT Interactive to publish a new game in the franchise for the Nintendo 64. Johnson and Voorsanger conducted research to determine whether series fans preferred the original ToeJam & Earl or its sequel; the former emerged as the clear favorite. In April 1999, however, {{it was reported that}} the deal with GT Interactive had fallen through; the publisher had decided that the series' previous game was not an encouraging success commercially, particularly in Europe. GT Interactive's restructuring and the Nintendo 64's declining commercial performance were also believed to be factors by commentators.|$|E
25|$|Senator Johnson urged Secretary of Defense Robert M.

25|$|Blacks {{were not}} given a chance at the title {{allegedly}} because Johnson felt {{that he could make}} more money fighting white boxers. In August 1913, as Johnson neared the end of his troubled reign as world heavyweight champ, there were rumors that he had agreed to fight Langford in Paris for the title, but it came to nought. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> that Langford was unable to raise $30,000 for his guarantee.|$|E
25|$|With council {{approval}} of the siting plan complete in June 2005, the council came under pressure to approve the financing package for the convention headquarters hotel. But with little movement on the issue, Marriott and RLJ Development (the development fund owned by billionaire cable executive hedge fund owner Robert L. <b>Johnson)</b> <b>said</b> on September 11, 2005, that {{they were working on}} a plan to privately finance the hotel and avoid the city council altogether. But no private financing fell into place, either.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of looting and {{disruption}} the night before, on August 16, Nixon declared {{in a press conference}} a state of emergency and implemented nightly curfews in Ferguson from midnight to 5:00a.m. Some residents at the press conference said that law enforcement officers had instigated the violence with their military-like tactics. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> that police would not enforce the curfew with armored trucks and tear gas, and that police will communicate with protesters and give them time and opportunity to leave before curfew.|$|E

25|$|On December 21, 2015, Cosby sued supermodel Beverly Johnson for defamation, {{claiming}} {{that she told}} a false story in a Vanity Fair article. This {{was the first time}} Cosby had sued a woman who has claimed assault without being sued himself first. Cosby's lawsuit accuses Johnson of lying about the incident in which she says Cosby spiked a cup of cappuccino with an unknown drug. Realizing what was happening, <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> she screamed and cursed at him several times before Cosby dragged her out and hailed a cab for her. (No sexual contact by Cosby was alleged in Johnson's version of the event.) Allegedly, she also repeated the story in subsequent interviews and in her memoirs, released on August 25, 2015.|$|E
25|$|During Walton's {{first term}} as CFA chairman, the {{commission}} became an increasingly powerful and influential voice on design issues in Washington, D.C. Walton's first term on the CFA expired in June 1967. President Lyndon B. Johnson hesitated {{at first to}} rename him because the terms of six of the commission's members were expiring at one time and <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to stagger the commissioners' terms. But Johnson realized Walton was an effective administrator, and reappointed Walton in July 1967. He also appointed John Walker, {{the director of the}} National Gallery of Art, and Chloethiel Woodard Smith, a prominent local architect. (Johnson previously reappointed Hideo Sasaki in 1966.) Johnson asked the three remaining members of the CFA to serve without reappointment for a year, at which time their commissions would expire.|$|E
25|$|After {{being denied}} a {{marriage}} license, a lesbian couple {{filed a lawsuit}} on October 30, 2013 in the Seventeenth Judicial District. The case, Brinkman v. Long, seeks to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. The couple was joined on February 18, 2014, by nine other same-sex couples who filed a lawsuit, McDaniel-Miccio v. Hickenlooper, also in state district court, seeking the same outcome. Four of the couples are raising children, and five of the couples have married in other states. The suit named Governor John Hickenlooper and Denver City Clerk Debra Johnson as defendants. Hickenlooper responded by noting Colorado's support for civil unions. <b>Johnson</b> <b>said</b> she supported marriage rights for same-sex couples but was obligated to follow the law by denying them marriage licenses. Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, a Republican, announced he would defend the state's ban.|$|E
