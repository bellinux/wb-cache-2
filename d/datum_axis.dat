40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a systematic modelling procedure {{for assessing the}} pro®le quality of concave-arc ball-end (CABE) milling cutters with a cylindrical shank. CABE milling cutters are widely used in three-axis numerical control (NC) machines for producing dies and moulds of complicated surface features. Evaluation of the contour quality of the CABE milling cutter is crucial in enhancing machining accuracy and eciency. In order adequately to describe {{the shape of the}} clamped cutter, the centre-line axis of the minimum circumscribed cylinder of the cylinder shank is taken as the referenced <b>datum</b> <b>axis.</b> The minimum circumscribed concave-arc revolving surface and the minimum circumscribed spherical surface are carefully derived in sequence. The pro®le errors and tolerances are estimated. The quality of the CABE milling cutter is assured by using the proposed modelling procedure, and several numerical examples are presented to illustrate its eVectiveness. The results indicate that the present method is feasible and can be extended to enhance the quality of various revolving cutters...|$|E
40|$|The <b>datum</b> <b>axis</b> of high {{precision}} photoelectric steady tracking platform jittering and drifting slowly often makes the output signal of fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) contain random noise. Based {{on the characteristics}} mentioned above, time series {{analysis of the data}} actually measured from FOG which is actually applied in engineering is conducted. Noise model is established by using the recursive least squares method, and it is processed with adaptive Kalman filter. With an exhaustive analysis by using the Allan variance method, it is shown that the filtering effect of Kalman algorithm that simply adapts the observation noise covariance matrix R is much better than that of normal Kalman algorithm, and the real-time performance is better than that of the Saga-Huga adaptive Kalman algorithm. For the Kalman algorithm, the amount of calculation added is small. This work has some practical value to improve the performance of photoelectric stable tracking platform. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society. All right reserved...|$|E
50|$|The 6 {{degrees of}} freedom in this example are 3 {{translation}} and 3 rotation about the 3D coordinate system. Datum A controls 3: translation along the Z axis, rotation about the x axis, and rotation about the y <b>axis.</b> <b>Datum</b> B controls 2: translation along the y axis and rotation about the z <b>axis.</b> Finally, <b>Datum</b> C controls 1 degree of freedom, namely the translation along the x axis.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Graph {{production}} by computer requires a blending of human effort in scale selection with computer precision in datum point placement. Existing techniques are designed primarily for computer scientists; the average scientific investigator, educator, or businessman tends {{to avoid them}} for {{one or more of}} the following reasons: expense, complexity, or excessive turnaround. This dissertation describes development and application of a graph preparation system designed for unsophisticated users which is moderate in cost, easy to use, and provides immediate interactive response. It is written in BASIC on a Univac 1108 and utilizes low cost Tektronix graphics terminals. Through menu selection, the user defines Scale factors, <b>datum</b> point indicators, <b>axis</b> type (linear or logarithmic), and adds optional functions which may be displayed superimposed on the data. Immediate display of the results to encourage user creativity in modification of parameters is an important feature of the system. Step-wise implementation, which maximized user input to system design, is described. Extensive modification of commercially obtained plot driving routines allowed expansion of program features in accord with user requests. Four detailed examples illustrate the use of the system by biologists and ecologists in communication of results and in analysis of data. A complete program listing and user's manual are appended...|$|R
