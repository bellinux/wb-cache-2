40|$|By iso-immunization, {{antisera}} to five rabbit γ globulin antigens were obtained. They {{are called}} A (former Da), B, C, D and E. Individual sera of 670 rabbits belonging to six separate populations were tested by precipitation methods. The {{distribution of the}} iso-antigens and their combinations into serum groups were studied. Each particular γ globulin <b>iso-antigen</b> {{was found to be}} of hereditary character; they seem to form three genetic systems: A, C and BDE, statistically independent...|$|E
40|$|Two-colour {{fluorescence}} (TRITC and FITC) {{has been}} adapted for the direct visualization of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -determined membrane antigens (MA) and to study {{their relationship to}} genetically determined <b>iso-antigens</b> (HL-A type) and to viral capsid antigens (VCA, {{as defined by the}} Henle test). The following three postulates, based on indirect deductions from previous blocking, cross-blocking and absorption experiments, could be confirmed by direct visual observation...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of iso-precipitating {{antisera}} {{produced in}} chickens in the laboratories {{of the three}} authors has shown that three distinct systems of <b>iso-antigens</b> of the blood serum of chickens exist. Two of these systems are of allotypic antigens present respectively on the IgG and IgM immunoglobulin molecules. They correspond to the systems of Skalba (1966) and are, therefore, described as GA—IgG and GA—IgM. They are identified by antibodies raised in response to immunization with bacterial agglutinates...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{response}} of normal and X-irradiated mice to skin homografts {{has been studied}} by observing {{the survival of the}} grafts and by titrating the specific iso-haemagglutinin in serial samples of the host's serum. Both expressions of the response were depressed to a degree which varied with the dose of radiation, but the haemagglutinin response of mice sensitized to the appropriate <b>iso-antigens</b> before irradiation was more radioresistant than the response of non-sensitized animals. A dose of 400 rads was sufficient to suppress haemagglutinin production completely in non-sensitized mice, while only slightly retarding the rejection of two successive skin homografts...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study reported from this laboratory (1), at least two common, qualitatively tumor-specific antigens or antigenic determinants were demonstrated {{to be present in}} adenocarcinomata of the human colon. These antigenic components were unrelated to <b>iso-antigens,</b> bacterial contaminants, or fibrin deposits. The present investigation was undertaken to determine whether the antigens found to be specific for colonic carcinomata could be detected (a) in other adult human tissues, or (b) in human embryonic and fetal tissues at various stages of gestation. Certain investigators have suggested the existence of universal tumorspecific antigens common to all forms of human malignant tumors (2 - 4), while others have attempted to classify human cancers {{on the basis of the}} particular tumor-specific antigens that they may contain (5). These concepts have, however, been challenged (6) and their general acceptance awaits further experimental study (7) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify those immunodom-inant sperm antigens recognized by antisperm antibodies (ASA) in the serum samples of infertile men and women. High-reso-lution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was employed to sep-arate human sperm proteins using isoelectric focusing or non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis, followed by PAGE. Se-rum samples from 15 infertile male subjects and 6 infertile fe-male subjects that contained ASA as assayed by the immunobead binding test (IBT) were analyzed by Western blotting followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Serum samples from 10 fertile subjects (5 males and 5 females) that were ASA negative by IBT were used as controls. The ECL blots were analyzed by computer scanning to compare the immunoreactivity between serum samples from fertile and infertile subjects and to identify the antigens unique to the sera of the infertile subjects; 98 sperm auto- and iso-antigenic protein spots were recognized by sera from infertile males and females but not from fertile subjects. Based on vectorial labeling with 125 I at the sperm surface, a sub-set of 6 auto- and <b>iso-antigens</b> was identified as possibly relevant to antibody-mediated infertility...|$|R
