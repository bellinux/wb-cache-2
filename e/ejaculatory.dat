5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median <b>ejaculatory</b> duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The <b>ejaculatory</b> duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the <b>ejaculatory</b> duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four. The cat is believed to mate throughout {{the year in the}} wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and <b>ejaculatory</b> quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity. Female estrus is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization. Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.|$|E
25|$|Within the prostate, the urethra {{coming from}} the bladder is called the prostatic urethra and merges with the two <b>ejaculatory</b> ducts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the Wolffian duct persists, and forms {{for example the}} epididymis, the ductus deferens, the <b>ejaculatory</b> duct, seminal vesicle and efferent ducts.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} lack or absence of a refractory period in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin. It is believed that the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully <b>ejaculatory,</b> multiple orgasms in an adult man was conducted at Rutgers University in 1995. During the study, six fully <b>ejaculatory</b> orgasms were experienced in 36 minutes, with no apparent refractory period. Later, P. Haake et al. observed a single male individual producing multiple orgasms without elevated prolactin response.|$|E
25|$|In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this {{duct system}} to regress. Next, androgens cause the {{development}} of the Wolffian duct system, which develops into the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and <b>ejaculatory</b> ducts.|$|E
25|$|The {{excretory}} duct of each seminal gland unites {{with the}} corresponding vas deferens {{to form the}} two <b>ejaculatory</b> ducts, which immediately pass through {{the substance of the}} prostate gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.|$|E
25|$|One can sub-divide the {{prostate}} in two ways: by zone or by lobe. It {{does not have}} a capsule; rather an integral fibromuscular band surrounds it. It is sheathed in the muscles of the pelvic floor, which contract during the <b>ejaculatory</b> process.|$|E
25|$|The {{alkalinity}} of semen helps {{neutralize the}} acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. Acidic ejaculate (pH <7.2) {{may be associated}} with <b>ejaculatory</b> duct obstruction. The vesicles produce semenogelin, a protein that causes semen to become sticky and jelly-like after ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|The {{successive}} woundings each require {{energy to}} heal, leaving less energy available for other activities. Also, the wounds provide a possible point of infection which {{can reduce the}} female's lifespan. Once in the hemolymph, the sperm and <b>ejaculatory</b> fluids may act as antigens, triggering an immune reaction.|$|E
25|$|According to Dr. Chua Chee Ann, the AFE zone redirects female <b>ejaculatory</b> fluid, {{which is}} {{expelled}} from the Skene's gland during G-spot orgasms, and turns it into vaginal lubrication. Because stimulating the AFE zone causes this mechanism and creates an erotic sensation simultaneously, full arousal occurs very quickly.|$|E
25|$|The sexes are {{distinct}} (females and males occur). Reproductive system: The penis is broad and blunt, has a weakly marked lateral lobe on its left side near the apex, {{a very small}} stylet, a penial duct running in a zigzag, and no visible trace of an <b>ejaculatory</b> duct. The female reproductive organs are of Hauffenia-type.|$|E
25|$|During male seminal emission, sperm is {{transmitted}} from the vas deferens into the male urethra via the <b>ejaculatory</b> ducts, which lie within the prostate gland. Ejaculation is the expulsion of semen from the urethra. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasm solely through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or anal intercourse.|$|E
25|$|Males can {{ejaculate}} {{multiple times}} in a row, and this {{increases the likelihood of}} pregnancy as well as decreases the number of stillborns. Multiple ejaculation also means that males can mate with multiple females, and they exhibit more <b>ejaculatory</b> series when there are several oestrous females present. Males also copulate at shorter intervals than females. In group mating, females often switch partners.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the use of buprenorphine are similar to those of other opioids and include: nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, perspiration, itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes (miosis), orthostatic hypotension, male <b>ejaculatory</b> difficulty, decreased libido, and urinary retention. Constipation and CNS effects are seen less frequently than with morphine.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} to have orgasm, or regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, is called anorgasmia or inorgasmia. If a male experiences erection and ejaculation but no orgasm, {{he is said}} to have sexual anhedonia (a condition in which an individual cannot feel pleasure from an orgasm) or <b>ejaculatory</b> anhedonia. Anorgasmia is significantly more common in women than in men, which has been attributed to the lack of sex education with regard to women's bodies, especially in sex-negative cultures, such as clitoral stimulation usually being key for women to orgasm.|$|E
25|$|In {{defining}} {{the range of}} sexual problems Masters and Johnson defined a boundary between dysfunction and deviations. Dysfunctions were transitory and experienced {{by the majority of}} people, dysfunctions bounded male primary or secondary impotence, premature ejaculation, <b>ejaculatory</b> incompetence; female primary orgasmic dysfunction and situational orgasmic dysfunction; pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) and vaginismus. According to Masters and Johnson sexual arousal and climax are a normal physiological process of every functionally intact adult, but despite being autonomic it can be inhibited. Masters and Johnson treatment program for dysfunction was 81.1% successful.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the ductus deferens and the <b>ejaculatory</b> duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral {{diverticulum}} from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} originally {{consists of}} two separate portions, each of which arises {{as a series of}} diverticular buds from the epithelial lining of the urogenital sinus and vesico-urethral part of the cloaca, between the third and fourth months. These buds become tubular, and form the glandular substance of the two lobes, which ultimately meet and fuse behind the urethra and also extend on to its ventral aspect. The median lobe of the prostate is formed {{as an extension of the}} lateral lobes between the common <b>ejaculatory</b> ducts and the bladder.|$|E
25|$|Premature {{ejaculation}} is when ejaculation occurs {{before the}} partner achieves orgasm, or a mutually satisfactory {{length of time}} has passed during intercourse. There is no correct length of time for intercourse to last, but generally, premature ejaculation is thought to occur when ejaculation occurs in under 2 minutes {{from the time of}} the insertion of the penis. For a diagnosis, the patient must have a chronic history of premature ejaculation, poor <b>ejaculatory</b> control, and the problem must cause feelings of dissatisfaction as well as distress the patient, the partner or both.|$|E
25|$|The male’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce and store spermatozoa and provide transport to the reproductive tract of the female. Sperm development is usually completed {{by the time the}} insect reaches adulthood. The male has two testes, which contain follicles in which the spermatozoa are produced. These open separately into the sperm duct or vas deferens and this stores the sperm. The vas deferentia then unite posteriorally to form a central <b>ejaculatory</b> duct, this opens to the outside on an aedeagus or a penis. Accessory glands secrete fluids that comprise the spermatophore. This becomes a package that surrounds and carries the spermatozoa, forming a sperm-containing capsule.|$|E
25|$|Infertility affects {{both men}} and women. At least 97% of men with cystic {{fibrosis}} are infertile, but not sterile and can have children with assisted reproductive techniques. The main cause of infertility in men with CF is congenital absence of the vas deferens (which normally connects the testes to the <b>ejaculatory</b> ducts of the penis), but potentially also by other mechanisms such as causing no sperm, abnormally shaped sperm, and few sperm with poor motility. Many men found to have congenital absence of the vas deferens during evaluation for infertility have a mild, previously undiagnosed form of CF. Around 20% of women with CF have fertility difficulties due to thickened cervical mucus or malnutrition. In severe cases, malnutrition disrupts ovulation and causes a lack of menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Most {{nematode}} {{species are}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals, though some, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are androdioecious, consisting of hermaphrodites and rare males. Both sexes possess one or two tubular gonads. In males, the sperm are produced {{at the end of}} the gonad and migrate along its length as they mature. The testis opens into a relatively wide seminal vesicle and then during intercourse into a glandular and muscular <b>ejaculatory</b> duct associated with the vas deferens and cloaca. In females, the ovaries each open into an oviduct (in hermaphrodites, the eggs enter a spermatheca first) and then a glandular uterus. The uteri both open into a common vulva/ vagina, usually located in the middle of the morphologically ventral surface.|$|E
25|$|The 5α-reductase inhibitors {{finasteride}} and dutasteride {{may also}} be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in patients were more severe symptoms and larger prostates. Other trials have confirmed reductions in symptoms, within 6 months in one trial, an effect that was maintained after withdrawal of the alpha blocker. Side effects include decreased libido and <b>ejaculatory</b> or erectile dysfunction. The 5α-reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their teratogenicity due to interference with fetal testosterone metabolism, and as a precaution, pregnant women should not handle crushed or broken tablets.|$|E
500|$|Bulls {{engage in}} a {{behaviour}} known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males. Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, particularly older ones. Thus these bulls have more reproductive success. Musth appears to signal to females {{the condition of the}} male, as weak or injured males do not have normal musths. For young females, the approach of an older bull can be intimidating, so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance. During copulation, the male lays his trunk over the female's back. The penis is very mobile, being able to move independently of the pelvis. Prior to mounting, it curves forward and upward. Copulation lasts about 45 seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or <b>ejaculatory</b> pause. Elephant sperm must swim close to [...] to reach the egg. By comparison, human sperm only has to swim around [...]|$|E
500|$|... "Love Is Blindness" [...] was favourably {{received}} by critics. Uncut contributor Gavin Martin rated the song five stars, calling it [...] "rapturous and unsettling." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said, [...] "its sentiments {{made it the}} perfect conclusion to Achtung Baby, describing the Edge's playing as [...] "a mournful, <b>ejaculatory</b> guitar solo, stabbing out thick emotional blues notes that linger and then fall away like tears." [...] Third Way reviewer Roland Howard described it as [...] "haunting and melodic", believing it {{to be about the}} loss of virginity. Music journalist Bill Wyman said the Edge's guitar playing on the song sounded like a [...] "dentist's drill". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as [...] "a kind of summation", calling it [...] "an elegy that compares love to 'drowning in a deep well' and wishes for it anyway." [...] Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote that it has [...] "a gospel quality, as swooning synth parts are set against block piano chords, and Bono acknowledges that mismatched lovers will suffer their inevitable fate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many Taoist {{practitioners}} {{link the}} loss of <b>ejaculatory</b> fluids to {{the loss of}} vital life force: where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue. [...] While some Taoists contend that one should never ejaculate, others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular ejaculations in order to maintain health.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median <b>ejaculatory</b> duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female.

The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis. The aedeagus can be quite pronounced or de minimis. The base of the aedeagus may be the partially sclerotized phallotheca, also called the ...|$|E
2500|$|Facesitting {{is a form}} of {{oral sex}} in which the {{receiver}} sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. Oral sex can also be performed by both partners {{at the same time in}} the so-called [...] "sixty-nine" [...] position. Spitting and/or swallowing of the <b>ejaculatory</b> fluids or giving a pearl necklace may cause different sexual stimulations. Autofellatio is a possible but rare variant; autocunnilingus may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} {{is often}} {{a side effect of}} drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and anorgasmia (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and <b>ejaculatory</b> anhedonia are also possible. Frequency of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction in long-term treatment {{has been found to be}} similar for duloxetine and SSRIs when compared in clinical trials, [...] while there is some evidence that duloxetine is associated with less sexual dysfunction than escitalopram when measured at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{traumatic}} insemination, sperm can migrate {{through the}} hemolymph [...] to the female's ovaries, resulting in fertilization. The exact mechanics vary from taxon to taxon. In some orders of insects, the male genitalia (paramere) enters the female's genital tract, and a spine at its tip pierces {{the wall of}} the female's bursa copulatrix. In others, the male penetrates the outer body wall. In either case, following penetration, the male ejaculates into the female. The sperm and <b>ejaculatory</b> fluids diffuse through the female's hemolymph. The insemination is successful if the sperm reach the ovaries and fertilize an ovum.|$|E
2500|$|An {{increased}} {{infusion of}} the hormone oxytocin during ejaculation {{is believed to}} be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is prolactin, [...] which represses dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal. Because of this, there is currently an experimental interest in drugs which inhibit prolactin, such as cabergoline (also known as Cabeser or Dostinex). Anecdotal reports on cabergoline suggest it may be able to eliminate the refractory period altogether, allowing men to experience multiple <b>ejaculatory</b> orgasms in rapid succession. At least one scientific study supports these claims, although cabergoline is a hormone-altering drug and has many potential side effects. It has not been approved for treating sexual dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|Traumatic insemination, {{also known}} as {{hypodermic}} insemination, is the mating practice in some species of invertebrates in which the male pierces the female's abdomen with his penis and injects his sperm through the wound into her abdominal cavity (hemocoel). The sperm diffuse through the female's hemolymph, reaching the ovaries and resulting in fertilization. The process is detrimental to the female's health. It creates an open wound which impairs the female until it heals, and is susceptible to infection. [...] The injection of sperm and <b>ejaculatory</b> fluids into the hemocoel can also trigger an immune reaction in the female. Bed bugs, which reproduce solely by traumatic insemination, have evolved a pair of sperm-receptacles, known as the spermalege. It {{has been suggested that}} the spermalege reduces the direct damage to the female bed bug during traumatic insemination. However, statistical experiments showed no conclusive evidence for that hypothesis; as of 2003, the preferred explanation for that organ is hygienic protection against bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Both sexes possess {{pairs of}} gonads, opening via a channel called a gonoduct into a common genital opening, the gonopore, {{which is located}} on the rear ventral side. Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue. In females, the two ovaries are joined in the middle and to the {{horizontal}} diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or egg-laying. In the former, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy [...] "womb", the uterus, in which the embryos develop. The single vagina, to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the ovipositor. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the receptacle seminis, in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods. Males possess two separate testes, along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the vesicula seminalis) and exit channel (the vasa efferentia). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the vas deferens, which in turn widens through the <b>ejaculatory</b> channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve an auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands. A penis-like structure has so far only been found in males of the genus Paraperipatus but has not yet been observed in action. As previously mentioned, males of many Australian species exhibit special structures on the head, which apparently take over certain tasks in transferring sperm to the females. In the species Euperipatoides rowelli, sperm is collected by these structures, and, when a female is encountered, the male inserts its head in the vagina.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Maydig had {{followed}} all these later {{changes in a}} sort of <b>ejaculatory</b> silence. He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced it on the table. [...] "Well!" [...] was the only expression of his feelings.|$|E
