40|$|Birth of Law No. 30 of 2004 on Notary, {{regarded}} {{as the beginning of}} reforms in the field of notary. A notary who previously carried out its duties based on the Dutch heritage regulations Reglement op Het Notaris Ambt in Indonesie (Stb. 1860 : 3) was started feels aware of its existence by the government. However, one of the impact of these laws is the extension of the authority of the notary to make the auctions minutes <b>deed</b> and the land <b>deed,</b> but as it is known in advance, making auctions minutes <b>deed</b> is the authority of the auction official, and make the land <b>deed</b> is the land <b>deed</b> official authority (known as PPAT). Based on Vendu Reglement (VR), only authorized officials that can make auctions minutes <b>deed,</b> and if the notary push him to make it, then the power of the <b>deed</b> will degrade into privately made <b>deed</b> because it is not made by the competent authority. As with the land <b>deed,</b> authorized officials to make the land <b>deed</b> is PPAT, but the authority specified in Article 2 paragraph (2) of Government Regulation No. 37 of 1998 on Land <b>Deed</b> Official. Therefore, the Notary can make land <b>deed,</b> on condition not including the <b>deed</b> contained in that Article 2 paragraph (2). How To Cite: Multazam, M. (2014).

Maude should not have conveyed the property to Thornton, because it was a life estate only, and was not hers to convey.|$|R

5000|$|Title is {{generally}} transferred in a tax <b>deed</b> sale through {{a form of}} limited warranty or quitclaim <b>deed</b> (sometimes styled as Tax <b>Deed</b> or Sheriff's <b>Deed).</b> In most jurisdictions, this type of <b>deed</b> {{is generally}} insufficient to acquire title insurance. [...] Therefore, a purchaser would most likely then need to initiate a quiet title action in order to resell the property later. However, the property can be sold from one purchaser to another using a limited warranty or another quitclaim <b>deed,</b> though usually at far less than its market value.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>deed</b> that is recorded, {{but is not}} {{connected}} to the chain of title of the property, is called a wild <b>deed.</b> A wild <b>deed</b> does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the <b>deed</b> while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated thatBecause title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a <b>deed</b> won't be discovered {{even though it was}} recorded. [...] "Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his <b>deed.</b> Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her <b>deed.</b> But because the previous <b>deed</b> (the <b>deed</b> from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's <b>deed</b> is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." [...] A <b>deed</b> that is outside the chain of title is called a wild <b>deed.</b> The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild <b>deed.</b> In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.|$|R
