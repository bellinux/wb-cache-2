His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

60|$|Had {{she really}} been wrong? Past remembrances, {{as well as}} present troubles, pleaded powerfully with Agnes for the courier's wife. 'It seems only a small favour to ask,' she said, {{speaking}} under the impulse of kindness which was the strongest impulse in her nature. 'But I {{am not sure that}} I ought to allow my name to be mentioned in your husband's letter. Let me hear again exactly what he wishes to say.' Emily repeated the words--and then offered one of those suggestions, which have a special value of their own to persons unaccustomed to the use of their pens. 'Suppose you try, Miss, how it looks in writing?' Childish as the idea was, Agnes tried the experiment. 'If I let you mention me,' she said, 'we must at least <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are to say.' She wrote the words in the briefest and plainest form:--'I venture to state that my wife has been known from her childhood to Miss Agnes Lockwood, who feels some little interest in my welfare on that account.' Reduced to this one sentence, there was surely nothing in the reference to her name which implied that Agnes had permitted it, or that she was even aware of it. After a last struggle with herself, she handed the written paper to Emily. 'Your husband must copy it exactly, without altering anything,' she stipulated. 'On that condition, I grant your request.' Emily was not only thankful--she was really touched. Agnes hurried the little woman out of the room. 'Don't give me time to repent and take it back again,' she said. Emily vanished.|$|E

5000|$|Eugenic {{policies}} have been conceptually divided into two categories. [...] Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, in vitro fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning. The movie Gattaca provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to <b>decided</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are capable of and your place in the world. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally [...] "undesirable". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning. Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for fit women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.|$|R

How are women and men {{featured}} in texts, photos, computer games, advertising and movies? Questions like these are of great importance {{when it comes to}} gender equality in society, and therefore the media is a relevant sector to reach with gender mainstreaming efforts. The media can both hinder and accelerate the development towards gender equality. They can communicate results of gender equality efforts but can also contribute to the production of gender stereotypes. There is an increasing pressure on media to step up and take measures to ensure women’s access to the media industry and to combat gender stereotypes.
