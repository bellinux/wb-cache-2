5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million <b>in</b> <b>cuts,</b> Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million <b>in</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of reedbeds for birds {{is often a}} controversial issue in discussions between conservationists, reed harvesters and managers. At the same time, data on the density and nesting success of birds <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> and uncut reed are scarce. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the density and nesting success of Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Sedge Warblers A. schoenobaenus <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> and uncut reed in a peat marsh, De Weerribben National Park in the Netherlands in 1993 - 1995. Depending on year, densities of Reed Warblers were 1. 2 - 2. 5 times higher in uncut reed than <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> reed, while densities of Sedge Warblers in uncut reed and other vegetation were 6 - 50 times higher than <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> vegetation. Reed Warblers nested 6 - 12 days earlier in uncut reed than <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> reed. No difference could be detected in laying dates of Sedge Warblers <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> and uncut vegetation, presumably because many Sedge Warblers <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> vegetation nested <b>in</b> small remnants of uncut vegetation. There were no differences in clutch size or fledging success in non-depredated nests of Reed Warblers and Sedge Warblers between cut and uncut vegetation. However, the predation rate of Reed Warbler nests <b>in</b> <b>cut</b> vegetation was 2. 2 times as high, and of Sedge Warbler nests 1. 6 times as high as in uncut vegetation. Sedge Warblers started to nest two to three weeks earlier and their nests were more often preyed upon than Reed Warblers' nests, in particular by ground predators. This may explain why Sedge Warblers more strongly preferred uncut reed than did Reed Warblers. Contrary to Sedge Warblers, Reed Warblers close to trees were parasitized by Cuckoos Cuculus canorus, which may explain why Reed Warblers nested in lower densities close to trees than farther away from trees. The results show that uncut reed is more suitable for nesting Reed Warblers and Sedge Warblers than cut reed because it allows them to nest earlier - and thus to raise on average more clutches per season - and because the birds suffer a lower predation risk...|$|R
25|$|On December 18, 2009, {{outgoing}} Governor Kaine proposed $76.8 {{billion of}} expenditures for adoption by the incoming state legislature. Kaine's budget proposed to rationalize state revenues {{by increasing the}} income tax while lowering property taxes and other fees. As incoming governor, McDonnell refused to publicly recommend any modifications to Kaine's budget and instead worked with the House of Delegates to bring Kaine's plan up for a quick vote and defeat. Privately, McDonnell advocated cutting $300 million from health programs, $730 million from K-12 education, changing the state retirement system, and requiring 10 days of furloughs for state employees, to offset budgetary shortfalls for 2010–2012. On February 17, 2010, after political pressure, McDonnell publicly released his proposed cuts. The Senate adopted a budget which restored a number of cuts to education, health and human services, and a House-Senate conference managed {{to work out a}} compromise on March 14 containing about $250 million <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> before the expiration of the legislative session. However, a number of interest groups lobbied the governor to use his amendatory veto power to alter the adopted budget.|$|E
25|$|Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), makes {{plans to}} escape Gavin and asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for money on several occasions, saying she {{is willing to}} go to prison so she can {{eventually}} reunite with her family in Walford. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he knows what she has planned. After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at The Queen Victoria pub, Gavin arrives on Albert Square. He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first. Phil realises they have gone to a local airfield, so he stops them from leaving and convinces Kathy to go back with him, leaving Gavin behind. When Phil meets Kathy at her hotel room, she agrees with him {{that there should be no}} more contact between them. After Phil leaves, it is revealed that Gavin has manipulated her into saying this. Phil goes missing after Gavin and two men confront him at his garage. After Kathy's sons, Ian and Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), discover she is alive, Gavin finds Kathy in Walford. He tells Kathy to stick to their plan and Phil will stay alive. When Kathy reunites with Ben, Kathy says that she needs all of Phil's money or Gavin will kill him, and Gavin later tells Kathy he will harm Ian and Ben if she does not get the money that night. Kathy decides to go to the police to confess to fraud and to report Phil's kidnapping. When Ian finds out, he calls Gavin, saying he knows what Gavin has done, but Gavin now knows that Kathy has not stuck to their plan. Kathy realises Gavin probably has Phil at his sister's house, but when they get there, Gavin and Phil are gone, but Phil's blood is found. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, gets back home but is covered <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> and bruises and has broken bones, and reveals to Ben that Gavin deliberately got him drinking alcohol again.|$|E
500|$|In May 2006, Baird {{was asked}} to find $1 billion <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> for 2006 and 2007.

One of the most controversial cuts was to the federal Court Challenges Program, which provided funding for Canadians to pursue rights cases in the Canadian court system. Baird argued that government funding would be redirected in a way that [...] "reflects the priorities of working families" [...] and that he [...] "just [...] think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the government's own laws in court."

Additional plans for a station in the Beacon Hill Tunnel were put on hold in November 1998, with the Sound Transit Board deciding to build the station structure and entry shaft within the available budget to allow for minimal disruptions to light rail service while the station was being constructed after the line opened. The construction of surface-level stations at Royal Brougham Way, later Stadium station, and South Graham Street in the Rainier Valley were also deferred, as part of $200 million <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> to bring the project within its original $1.8 billion budget (equivalent to $ and $, respectively, in [...] ) to build a truncated Central Link from Sea-Tac Airport to the University District.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the items}} {{passed in the}} {{legislative}} session were a bill allowing optometrists to perform eye surgery (a procedure usually reserved for ophthalmologists), {{a ban on the}} sale of a psychoactive drug marketed as [...] "bath salts", and a measure allowing community supervision and addiction treatment as jail alternatives for non-violent drug criminals. Measures that did not pass included tougher measures to curb illegal immigration advocated by Williams and raising the legal age for dropping out of high school from sixteen to eighteen, a proposal supported by Beshear. Also, the Assembly was unable to agree on whether to adopt Beshear's plan to address a shortfall in the state's Medicaid obligations or an alternative plan proposed by Williams. Beshear's plan involved moving $166 million from the second year of the biennial budget to cover the shortfall and cover the costs in the second year through savings achieved by switching to a managed care plan for Medicaid. Williams' plan, passed by the Republican majority in the state senate, called for $101 million <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> to state government spending to cover the shortfall. Without a plan in place, Beshear estimated that the state would have to cut Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers by 30 percent.|$|E

[...] On July 19, 2011, the Republican-led House passed a bill, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, {{by a margin of}} 234–190 which would require $111 billion <b>in</b> <b>cuts</b> in 2012 spending levels, exempting defense, Medicare, and Social Security from these cuts, and would limit subsequent federal spending to about 20% of the gross national product as compared to the current 24%. [...] It did not immediately increase the debt limit, but would have required Congress to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution before increasing the debt limit. [...] The bill was tabled by a vote of 51–46 in the Senate on July 22, and thus defeated.
