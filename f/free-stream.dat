Pitts, Plasma Phys. Control Fusion 48 (2006) 109] are that the plasma potential is not accounted for and that only solutions for ion quantities are considered. In this work, the equations are modified and augmented {{in order to address}} these two issues. The new equations are benchmarked against (and justified by) a numerical simulation which solves the Vlasov equation in 1 d 1 v. When the source function due to an edge localised mode is instantaneous, the modified <b>free-streaming</b> 'impulse response' equations agree closely with the Vlasov simulation results. When the source has a finite duration in time, the agreement worsens. However, in all cases the match is encouragingly good, thus justifying the applicability of the <b>free-streaming</b> approach...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} test of a <b>free-streaming</b> readout chain for the Time of Flight (TOF) Wall of the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. In order {{to contribute to the}} exploration of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, CBM aims at the measurement of rare probes, whose yields and phase space distributions are significantly influenced by their environment. Many of the possible signals, of which the antiprotons was investigated within this thesis, require an excellent Particle Identification (PID) and a new readout paradigm called <b>free-streaming.</b> In CBM, the PID for charged particles is provided by a TOF wall based on Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC). Within the thesis, a central component of the TOF readout chain, the <b>free-streaming</b> ASIC-TDC, was evaluated and pushed from the prototype level to a close to final design, for which it could be demonstrated that it fulfill all the CBM requirements: resolution, rate capability and stability. Additionally, the CBM TOF software in the CBMROOT software framework was reorganized to merge the processing and analysis of real and simulated data. A data unpacker and a realistic digitizer were implemented with a common output data format. The digitizer was used to estimate the data rates and number of components in a <b>free-streaming</b> readout chain for the full wall...|$|R
40|$|We use the cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS suites of cosmological hydrodynamical {{simulations}} {{to explore}} the separate and combined effects of baryon physics (particularly feedback from active galactic nuclei, AGN) and <b>free-streaming</b> of massive neutrinos on large-scale structure. We focus on five diagnostics: i) the halo mass function; ii) halo mass density profiles; iii) the halo mass-concentration relation; iv) the clustering of haloes; and v) the clustering of matter; and we explore {{the extent to which}} the effects of baryon physics and neutrino <b>free-streaming</b> can be treated independently. Consistent with previous studies, we find that both AGN feedback and neutrino <b>free-streaming</b> suppress the total matter power spectrum, although their scale and redshift dependencies differ significantly. The inclusion of AGN feedback can significantly reduce the masses of groups and clusters, and increase their scale radii. These effects lead to a decrease in the amplitude of the mass-concentration relation and an increase in the halo autocorrelation function at fixed mass. Neutrinos also lower the masses of groups and clusters while having no significant effect on the shape of their density profiles (thus also affecting the mass-concentration relation and halo clustering in a qualitatively similar way to feedback). We show that, with only a small number of exceptions, the combined effects of baryon physics and neutrino <b>free-streaming</b> on all five diagnostics can be estimated to typically better than a few percent accuracy by treating these processes independently (i. e., by multiplying their separate effects) ...|$|R

We study constraints from big-bang nuleosynthesis and show that the constraints are relaxed compared to the case without right-handed sneutrino. As a result, the gravitino-dark-matter scenario can become viable with relatively large value of the gravitino mass.

40|$|In the {{standard}} model neutrinos are assumed to have streamed across the Universe since they last scattered at the weak decoupling epoch when the temperature of {{the standard}}-model plasma was MeV. The shear stress of <b>free-streaming</b> neutrinos imprints itself gravitationally on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and makes the CMB a sensitive probe of neutrino scattering. Yet, the presence of nonstandard physics in the neutrino sector may alter this standard chronology and delay neutrino <b>free-streaming</b> until a much later epoch. We use observations of the CMB to constrain the strength of neutrino self-interactions G_eff and put limits on new physics in the neutrino sector from the early Universe. Recent measurements of the CMB at large multipoles made by the Planck satellite and high-l experiments are critical for probing this physics. Within the context of conventional LambdaCDM parameters cosmological data are compatible with G_eff < 1 /(56 MeV) ^ 2 and neutrino <b>free-streaming</b> might be delayed until their temperature has cooled to as low as 25 eV. Intriguingly, we also find an alternative cosmology compatible with cosmological data in which neutrinos scatter off each other until z 10 ^ 4 with a preferred interaction strength in a narrow region around G_ eff≃ 1 /(10 MeV) ^ 2 ≃ 8. 6 × 10 ^ 8 G_ F, where G_ F is the Fermi constant. This distinct self-interacting neutrino cosmology is characterized by somewhat lower values of both the scalar spectral index and the amplitude of primordial fluctuations. While we phrase our discussion here in terms of a specific scenario in which a late onset of neutrino <b>free-streaming</b> could occur, our constraints on the neutrino visibility function are very general.
