40|$|DNA evidence, linking {{perpetrators}} {{to crime}} scenes, {{is central to}} many legal proceedings. However, DNA samples from crime scenes often contain PCR-inhibitory substances, which may generate blank or <b>incomplete</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> Extensive <b>DNA</b> purification can be required to rid the sample of these inhibitors, although these procedures {{increase the risk of}} DNA loss. Most forensic laboratories use commercial DNA amplification kits (e. g., AmpFlSTR SGM Plus) with the DNA polymerase AmpliTaq Gold as the gold standard. Here, we show that alternative DNA polymerase-buffer systems can improve the quality of forensic DNA analysis and efficiently circumvent PCR inhibition in crime scene samples, without additional sample preparation. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> from 20 of 32 totally or partially inhibited crime scene saliva samples were significantly improved using Bio-X-Act Short, ExTaq Hot Start, or PicoMaxx High Fidelity instead of AmpliTaq Gold. A statistical model for unbiased quality control of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> was developed to quantify the results. Our study demonstrates the importance of adjusting the chemistry of the PCR to enhance forensic DNA analysis and diagnostic PCR, providing an alternative to laborious sample preparation protocols...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1994 Jane Moira TaupinThe innovative forensic technique of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> has been acclaimed {{as the most important}} advance in forensic science since fingerprinting. Whilst there is much anecdotal information on the impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on criminal investigation, prosecution and adjudication, there is little quantitative and control comparison data on the routine use of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> This study evaluates the effect of the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> in Victoria on a number of key points in the criminal justice system. The overall impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was low as determined by the percentage of criminal cases which utilise <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> However, in certain classes of cases its impact was measurable, most notably in sex offences committed by “strangers”. Less than one quarter of sexual offence cases of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiled</b> resulted in a contested trial, suggesting that the focus of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on the criminal justice system should swing to the pre-trial phase. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was most often used in sexual offence cases and a database comparison of these cases before and after the advent of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was examined. Whilst not statistically significant, trends indicated there were more solved cases, more guilty pleas and fewer trials after the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> but more individuals were drawn into the investigatory process. The number of trials of sexual offences in which consent was an issue was slightly greater than previously. The increase in guilty pleas with <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was only for stranger type crime. Further research is recommended as <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> becomes the cornerstone of biological forensic analysis. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Legal and criminalistic {{aspects of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> - Summary The Thesis deals with <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> {{one of the}} most {{accurate}} methods used in recent criminal science to identify individuals. It also deals with the legal aspects of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> because it raises many important legal questions. The The- sis consists of two parts. The first part is about <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> itself. The history of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> worldwide and in the Czech Republic is mentioned. The first cases solved with its contribution are described. A very important feature of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> is that it can be used not only for conviction of offenders but also for acquittal of innocent individu- als. Biological principles of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> are explained as well as possibilities of its utilization in criminal science, criminal and civil proceedings. The fact that monozy- gotic twins have identical DNA is mentioned as well as some very extraordinary occurrences such as hermaphrodites or another kind of individuals, who have two different DNA. These anomalies can cause problems with interpretation of the results. DNA databases can be used for comparison of many <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> without the necessity to repeat sample analysis. This fact caused the expansion of DNA pro- filing. A special software required for DNA databases is also shortly described. The second [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{repository}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>Profiles</b> {{held by the}} FSL prior to the commencement of the DNA Act comprises two indices, namely a Casework Index containing forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> derived from biological samples collected from crime scenes and a Reference Index containing forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of known people, including victims, suspects, volunteers and personnel. The Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 currently prevents DNA samples from being taken from convicted offenders. The <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> in the DCID are generated by analysing an AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus STR multiplex system of 9 different STR loci (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317 and D7S820) plus Amelogenin for sex determination. There were approximately 80,000 <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> on the DCID in 2007, with the number increasing to approximately 180,000 by late 2013.|$|R
2500|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> (also called <b>DNA</b> fingerprinting, DNA testing, or DNA typing) is {{the process}} of {{determining}} an individual's DNA characteristics, called a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> that is very likely to be different in unrelated individuals, thereby being as unique to individuals as are fingerprints (hence the alternative name for the technique). <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> {{should not be confused with}} full genome sequencing.|$|R
40|$|When a Y-chromosomal and a (partial) {{autosomal}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> {{are obtained}} from one crime sample, and both profiles match the suspect's profiles, {{we would like}} to know the combined evidential value. To calculate the likelihood ratio of observing the autosomal and Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> combined, we need to know the conditional random match probability of the observed autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> given the Y-chromosomal match. We examine this conditional probability in two ways: (1) with a database containing data of 2, 085 men and (2) using a simulation model. We conclude that if the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> match, we can still regard the autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> as independent from the Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> if the matching person is not a descendant of the father of the donor of the (crime) sample. The evidential value can, in that case, be computed by multiplying the random match probabilities of the individual profiles. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|In {{forensic}} science {{it is common}} practice to work on problems where the likelihood ratio is based on observing single piece of evidence given two hypotheses. However, {{in a lot of}} cases, {{there is more than one}} piece of evidence. In this thesis three problems regarding combining <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> are discussed. First, we derived a method to combine the evidential value of different partial Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of different stains. The method consists of finding a lower bound for the likelihood ratio when more than two propositions are compared and where we don't need the prior probabilities of the different propositions. Second, we made a simulation model to investigate the dendence of autosomal and Y chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> by assuming that everybody with the same Y-chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> has a common ancestor and simulating the assignment of autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> over different family tree structures. The results can be used in practice as scientific support for the assumption of independence between the Y and autosomal profile. Third, we developed a model to interpret (low-template) <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> which is able to give the likelihood of observing the <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> given any allele-combination of the donor. This model assumes that a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> is a result of a stochastic process where the input are the alleles of a possible donor. This model uses the information in peak heights without using any threshold. The model shows promising results in determining the combined evidential value of several low template <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> that were obtained from the same stain.

40|$|Background Assessment of <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> {{quality is}} vital in {{forensic}} DNA analysis, both {{in order to}} determine the evidentiary value of DNA results and to compare the performance of different DNA analysis protocols. Generally the quality assessment is performed through manual examination of the <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> based on empirical knowledge, or by comparing the intensities (allelic peak heights) of the capillary electrophoresis electropherograms. Results We recently developed a ranking index for unbiased and quantitative quality assessment of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles,</b> the forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> index (FI) (Hedman et al. Improved forensic DNA analysis through the use of alternative DNA polymerases and statistical modeling of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles,</b> Biotechniques 47 (2009) 951 - 958). FI uses electropherogram data to combine the intensities of the allelic peaks with the balances within and between loci, using Principal Components Analysis. Here we present the construction of FI. We explain the mathematical and statistical methodologies used and present details about the applied data reduction method. Thereby we show how to adapt the ranking index for any Short Tandem Repeat-based forensic DNA typing system through validation against a manual grading scale and calibration against a specific set of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> Conclusions The developed tool provides unbiased quality assessment of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> It can be applied for any <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> system based on Short Tandem Repeat markers.

40|$|Physical {{contact can}} result in the {{transfer}} of DNA from one individual to another. In cases of sexual offence this can often be {{by means of an}} aggressive or sexual act. Biological material can accumulate under the fingernail hyponychium of both the victim and/or the suspect and has the potential to provide evidence and intelligence information to the police. The incidence of mixed <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from fingernail samples of couples who co-habit was explored using AmpFlSTR® SGM Plus® (SGM Plus) (Applied Biosystems®). It was predicted that the higher incidence of contact from co-habitation and therefore the greater opportunity for DNA transfer would result in an increased level of foreign DNA from the partner under the donor's fingernails. Fingernail swabs were taken from all fingers of the left and right hands of 12 couples on three separate occasions. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were compared to both the donor and partner's reference <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> The number of reportable mixed <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained (17 %) was higher than in previous reports. In this study, the majority of non-donor alleles matched the partner's reference <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> indicating that co-habitation affected non-donor DNA obtained from fingernail swabs. The results demonstrated that as the couples spent increasing amounts of time together, the incidence of mixed <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> increased. The large variation in the incidence of foreign alleles observed within and between couples suggested that a combination of lifestyle factors were having a significant effect on whether mixed <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were observed. Further <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> using the AmpFlSTR® Y-filer® (Yfiler) PCR amplification (Applied Biosystems) was carried out to determine whether female fingernail samples that had previously given single donor profiles contained low levels of male DNA that may be detected by targeting the Y-chromosome. It was found that 63 % of the samples analysed using Yfiler produced full or partial Y-STR profiles. The Y-STR profiles were compared to partners' profiles and searched through two haplotype databases to determine the evidential value of such samples...|$|R
40|$|Forensic {{science is}} the {{application}} of a broad spectrum of sciences to answer questions of interest to a legal system. Forensic scientists use a technique called <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> to assist in the identification of individuals by their respective <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> are encrypted sets of numbers that reflect a person's DNA makeup, which can also be used as the person's identifier. The method of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> used today is based on PCR and uses short tandem repeats (STR). After DNA is extracted and amplified using PCR, genotyping is done. The different types of assays used are Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), Random Amplified Polymorphic Detection of Genomic DNA (RAPD), and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism detection (AFLP). The method used in the investigation is Short Tandem Repeats (STR) technology. Short tandem repeat (STR) technology is used to evaluate specific regions (loci) within nuclear DNA. Variability in STR regions can be used to distinguish one <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> from another. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) uses a standard set of 13 specific STR regions for CODIS.
