40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 54 - 62) The {{field project}} {{described in the}} body of this work consists of (1) the development of a modular training program for behavioral observation, (2) a literature based theoretically justified proposal for accomplishing this training with programed video tapes, and (J) the design and development of an <b>electronic</b> <b>video</b> training <b>device</b> necessitated by a future implementation of such a proposal. A model for behavioral intervention in the natural environment of the child is reviewed and a suitable assessment procedure is outlined. Precise specification of behaviors and environmental conditions through observation is seen as a significant aspect of this assessment work. Potential observers are discussed in terms of time, cost, accuracy of data collection and other factors. A training program overview is presented which aims at a combined population of university students and teachers or parents of "problem" children. The program is designed to accommodate the needs of advanced observers by additional rather than differential instructional units. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern that the {{widespread}} use of computers, mobile phones and other digital devices before bedtime disrupts our sleep with detrimental effects on our health and cognitive performance. High-speed Internet promotes the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>video</b> games and Internet addiction (e. g., online games and cyberloafing). Exposure to artificial light from tablets and PCs can alterate individuals' sleep patterns. However, there is little empirical evidence on the causal relationship between technology use near bedtime and sleep. This paper studies the causal effects of access to high-speed Internet on sleep. We first show that playing video games, using PC or smartphones, watching TV or movies are correlated with shorter sleep duration. Second, we exploit historical differences in pre-existing telephone infrastructure that affected the deployment of high-speed Internet across Germany (see Falck et al., 2014) to identify a source of plausibly exogenous variation in access to Broadband. Using this instrumental variable strategy, we find that DSL access reduces sleep duration and sleep satisfaction...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the success}} of the LP record, Goldmark spent the next two decades at CBS Laboratories working on various inventions, chief of which was EVR, the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Video</b> Recorder. This futuristic home <b>video</b> {{playback}} <b>device</b> used reels of film stored in plastic cassettes to electronically store audio and video signals, and was first announced in 1967. A B&W prototype was demonstrated in 1969 (promising color playback in future models), but the invention floundered when it proved to be difficult and costly to manufacture. CBS was also concerned about the potential of competition from home <b>video</b> <b>devices,</b> particularly those that could record â€” a fear that eventually proved prescient. As with color television, Goldmark's EVR film-based system was superseded by another technology, in this case Sony's U-Matic 3/4" [...] videocassette format in late 1971, since the cassette tape format was cheaper and more effective. However, Goldmark's vinyl long-playing records remained the standard in the music industry until the CD replaced the LP in the late 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Face {{detection}} and recognition {{is the first}} step for many applications in various fields such as identification and is used as a key to enter into the various <b>electronic</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>video</b> surveillance, and human computer interface and image database management. This paper focuses on feature extraction in an image using Gabor filter and the extracted image feature vector is then given as an input to the neural network. The neural network is trained with the input data. The Gabor wavelet concentrates on the important components of the face including eye, mouth, nose, cheeks. The main requirement of this technique is the threshold, which gives privileged sensitivity. The threshold values are the feature vectors taken from the faces. These feature vectors are given into the feed forward neural network to train the network. Using the feed forward neural network as a classifier, the recognized and unrecognized faces are classified. This classifier attains a higher face deduction rate. By training more input vectors the system proves to be effective. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental results...|$|R
