25|$|Given the {{increased}} internationalization of cuisines and food supply, foie gras is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperature than is <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Hungary was {{producing}} 80% of the world's <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> however, production rates {{are likely to}} drop in 2017 due to outbreaks of bird flu.|$|E
25|$|In Hungary, <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{traditionally}} is fried in goose fat, {{which is}} then poured over the foie gras and left to cool; it is also eaten warm, after being fried or roasted, with some chefs smoking the foie gras over a cherry wood fire.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{existing}} methods of producing <b>goose</b> liver (<b>foie</b> <b>gras),</b> Apicius devised a similar method of producing pork liver. He fed his pigs with dried figs and slaughtered {{them with an}} overdose of mulsum (honeyed wine): Pliny, Natural History 8.209.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Foie</b> <b>gras</b> is {{a popular}} and {{well-known}} delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or <b>goose</b> liver. <b>Foie</b> <b>gras</b> is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait, or pâté, and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak. French law states that [...] "Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2014, {{the whole}} of the EU {{produced}} approximately 25,000 tonnes of foie gras – 23,000 tonnes of duck foie gras and 2,000 tonnes of <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> The same year, France was producing 72% of world foie gras production of which 97% was from ducks.|$|E
25|$|Duck {{foie gras}} is the {{slightly}} cheaper and, since {{a change of}} production methods in the 1950s to battery, {{by far the most}} common kind, particularly in the US. The taste of duck foie gras {{is often referred to as}} musky with a subtle bitterness. <b>Goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is noted for being less gamey and smoother, with a more delicate flavor.|$|E
25|$|Generally, French {{preparations}} of {{foie gras}} are made over low heat, as fat melts faster {{from the traditional}} <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> than the duck foie gras produced in most {{other parts of the}} world. American and other New World preparations, typically employing duck foie gras, have more recipes and dish preparations for serving foie gras hot, rather than cool or cold.|$|E
50|$|De-boned duck breast can be grilled like steak, usually {{leaving the}} skin and fat on. Internal organs such as heart and kidneys may also be eaten; the liver in {{particular}} is often used {{as a substitute for}} <b>goose</b> liver in <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Producers outside France do {{not always}} {{force-feed}} birds to produce fattened livers considered to be <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> instead allowing them to eat freely, termed ad libitum. Interest in alternative production methods has grown recently due to ethical concerns in gavage-based <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production. Such livers are alternatively termed fatty <b>goose</b> liver, ethical <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> or humane <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> [...] The British supermarket chain Waitrose also provides a version of ethical <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> which it calls (and has been trademarked) faux gras. This {{is not to be}} confused with the American product by the same name, produced by Regal Vegan, which has the US trademark for faux gras, and is actually a vegan, nut based spread.|$|R
2500|$|City of San Diego: On January 8, 2008, the San Diego City Council {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} resolution that [...] "commends the Animal Protection and Rescue League (APRL) for raising awareness of the cruel practice of force-feeding ducks and <b>geese</b> to produce <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> commends the many San Diego restaurants that have stopped selling <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> before the California statewide ban goes into effect, and encourages San Diegans to avoid supporting this extreme form of animal cruelty." [...] The resolution also cites an independent Zogby poll finding that 85% of San Diegans favor an immediate ban on <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Judaic dietary law, Kashrut, forbade lard as {{a cooking}} medium, and butter, too, was proscribed as an {{alternative}} since Kashrut also prohibited mixing meat and dairy products. Jewish cuisine used olive oil in the Mediterranean, and sesame oil in Babylonia, but neither cooking medium was easily available in Western and Central Europe, so poultry fat (known in Yiddish as schmaltz), which could be abundantly produced by overfeeding geese, was substituted in their stead. The delicate taste of the goose's liver was soon appreciated; Hans Wilhelm Kirchhof of Kassel wrote in 1562 that the Jews raise fat geese and particularly love their livers. Some Rabbis were concerned that eating forcibly overfed geese violated Jewish food restrictions. The chasam sofer, Rabbi Moses Sofer, contended {{that it is not}} a forbidden food (treyf) as none of its limbs are damaged. This matter remained a debated topic in Jewish dietary law until the Jewish taste for goose liver declined in the 19th century. Another kashrut matter, still a problem today, is that even properly slaughtered and inspected meat must be drained of blood before being considered fit to eat. Usually, salting achieves that; however, as liver is regarded as [...] "(almost) wholly blood", broiling is the only way of kashering. Properly broiling a foie gras while preserving its delicate taste is difficult, and therefore rarely practiced. Even so, there are restaurants in Israel that offer grilled <b>goose</b> <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> [...] Foie Gras also bears resemblance to the Jewish food staple, chopped liver.|$|E

5000|$|COK joined {{organizations}} Animal Legal Defense Fund, Farm Sanctuary and Animal Protection & Rescue League, and individuals, in {{filing a}} lawsuit against the USDA for allowing the sale of <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> a diseased poultry product. The agency is required through the Poultry Products Inspection Act to condemn diseased poultry as adulterated. The force-feeding of ducks and <b>geese</b> to produce <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> results in a condition known as hepatic lipidosis or [...] "fatty liver disease," [...] in which the birds' livers swell up to ten times their normal size.|$|R
2500|$|Mirepoix USA, a top {{provider}} of <b>goose</b> and duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> alleges {{that the animal}} rights activists attack {{is a form of}} prohibition against a cuisine item. [...] Mirepoix claims that {{the use of the term}} [...] "diseased" [...] to refer to fatted liver is inaccurate and that geese and ducks naturally store dead fish in their esophagi for long periods. The ducks used in <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production, however, are a hybrid of Pekin (a type of Mallard) and Muscovy ducks, both of which are dabbling ducks and as such, subsist mainly on a diet of underwater vegetation, larvae, and various insects.|$|R
500|$|Gers, a {{department}} of France, is within this region and has high quality poultry, while La Montagne Noire and Lacaune area offers high quality hams and dry sausages.

40|$|ABSTRACT The use of {{near-infrared}} reflectance spec-troscopy (NIRS) on a {{meat product}} {{is described in}} this report. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop calibration equations to predict the chemical composition of <b>goose</b> fatty liver (<b>foie</b> <b>gras)</b> with lipid contents greater than 40 % of the fresh pate. Spectra of 52 <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> samples were collected in the visible and NIR region (400 to 2, 498 nm). Calibration equations were computed for DM, CP, lipids and fatty acids using modified partial least-squares re-gression. R 2 values were high for the total lipid content (Key words: goose fatty liver, fatty acid composition, chemical composition, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{environmental}} consequences of cereal choice and form of {{presentation of the}} diet given to <b>geese</b> reared for <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of the production of 1 kg of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{was used to examine}} several feeding strategies for substituting maize by sorghum: during the growing–finishing and/or overfeeding period; in a complete pelleted diet or as whole grains. The data come from in-field management practices on representative French goose farms for the breeding, hatching and slaughtering stages of production, and in vivo experiments for the growing–finishing and overfeeding stages. The impact categories were calculated using the CML 2 baseline method. Our data showed that the effects of cereal type on the environmental impact of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> were dependent on feed level and stage of inclusion. Birds fed exclusively with sorghum during both the growing–finishing period and the overfeeding period had lower environmental impacts than birds fed with maize, for all the potential impacts calculated (e. g. − 17 % for global warming potential). A diet presented in a simplified form during the growing–finishing period had no effect on <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> impacts when the cereal used was maize (difference between groups < 7 %), but increased them when it was sorghum (from + 16 % for water use to + 22 % eutrophication and acidification potential), due to higher bird mortality during the overfeeding period. These results suggest that changes in bird feeding practices could contribute to a more environmentally-friendly production system for <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> if animal performance is note reduced. Hence, substitution of maize by sorghum can lessen the environmental impacts of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production and thus offer a valuable alternative in response to water shortages in southern France, but its use in a simplified form hinges on prior improvement of rearing practices to limit subsequent mortality...|$|R

25|$|Raw <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (poêlé) or (with {{care and}} attention), grilled.

Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25mm (½ – 1inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center.
