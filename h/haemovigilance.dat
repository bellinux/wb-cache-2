40|$|Abstract: <b>Haemovigilance</b> {{is defined}} as a set of {{surveillance}} procedures from the collection of blood and its components to the follow–up of recipients, denoted to collect and assess information on unexpected or undesirable effects resulting from the therapeutic use of labile blood products, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. In this system the complications of blood transfusion are systematically collected and reported and data of adverse effects of blood transfusion are analyzed and a series of corrective measures are performed to prevent the recurrence of them. Another goal of <b>haemovigilance</b> is documentary collections of blood transfusion cases which eventually leads to conducting and promoting blood transfusion in hospitals. <b>Haemovigilance</b> only works if complications of blood transfusion are early detected and reported.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} goals of <b>haemovigilance</b> is to gather and analyze adverse events in {{recipients}} of blood products {{in order to improve}} blood safety. The French National Blood Service has a specific role in the management of immediate adverse events: to alert to quarantine the potentially dangerous blood products from the same donation(s), to provide blood testing for the etiologic assessment and to give transfusion advice to patients. The updating of the recipient's computer file allows a better monitoring for both immediate and delayed adverse events. Finally, the French National Blood Service's correspondent of <b>haemovigilance</b> is responsible for donor's inquiries, especially in cases of transfusion related to bacterial contamination, severe allergy, suspicion of transfusion acute related lung injury and viral seroconversion. The management effectiveness for adverse events requires a strong collaboration between all members of the <b>haemovigilance</b> network...|$|E

The development ofthe <b>haemovigilance</b> system {{is taking place}} in Slovenia from 2000 ever since Law on BloodProcurement was adopted. METHODS The data of all adverse reactions was collected from 2002 in all hospitals where bloodtransfusions were being performed. Later, the collection of data of transfusion related unexpected red cell antibodies, near-miss events and of adverse {{reactions and}} events related tothe process begining with blood donation to the issuing of blood have begun. RESULTS From 2002 to 2006 there were 697 reports collected of nearly all types of adverse reactionsand events, with no report of any long-time morbidity or transfusion related deaths. 46 reactions were severe. There were considerable differences among Slovenian hospitalsbetween the number of reports compared to the number of blood components issued,ranging from 1 to 3. 5 adverse reactions per 1000 blood components issued.

40|$|Background: A <b>haemovigilance</b> system {{makes it}} {{possible}} to identify critical points in blood transfusion chain from blood collection to the patient and to introduce new measures, thus creating conditions for better transfusion safety. Methods: Data on <b>haemovigilance</b> in Slovenia in years 2003 – 2010 were obtained from annual reports. The collected data were systematically and chronologically arranged, displayed in tables and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: From 2003 to 2010, there were 1, 333 adverse reactions reported: 511 allergic, 25 anaphylactoid, 604 febrile nonhaemolytic, 22 haemolytic reactions, 4 TRALI, 69 TACO, 11 suspected transfusion-transmitted infections and 74 cases classified as others. From 2003 – 2010, 104 (7. 8 %) reactions were considered severe. There are considerable differences among Slovenian hospitals as to the number of reports, ranging from 0. 4 to 3. 1 per 1, 000 blood components issued in 2010. Severe adverse events were reported, such as wrong blood in test tubes and incorrect blood component transfused. There were also some severe adverse reactions reported during the collection of blood from donors, defective plastic blood bags, positive test results and adverse events during the storage and distribution of blood.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access {{until after the}} conference has taken place. The {{importance}} of considering human/organisational factors when reporting transfusion incidents has been highlighted recently. The UK <b>haemovigilance</b> scheme, Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT), has established {{over the past two}} decades that most incidents are caused by human errors in the transfusion process. In order to enhance reporter’s awareness of human and organisational factors, we implemented two interventions and evaluated the effects. First, we created and incorporated a bespoke human factors investigation tool (HFIT) explicitly asking the level of contribution of individual staff member(s), the local environment or workspace, organisational or management and government or regulation. Second, we created and incorporated a self-learning package with good examples of human and organisational factors reporting within the UK national <b>haemovigilance</b> reporting database. Data from this tool have been analysed to investigate whether increased learning is possible. The main conclusion after one year’s use of the HFIT, was that incident reporters tended to attribute culpability mostly to individuals (62. 6 %). It is possible this result is due to lack of system awareness amongst incident reportersSix month initial data analysis after the inclusion of the self-learning package shows that if the incident reporter has studied the self-learning package before scoring the level of contribution associated with an incident, there is a slightly lower tendency to attribute most responsibility to individuals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} a newly implemented <b>haemovigilance</b> system in a general university hospital. We present a series of short cases, highlighting particular aspects of the reports, and an overview of all reported incidents between 1999 and 2001. Incidents related to transfusion of blood products were reported by the clinicians using a standard preformatted form, giving a synopsis of the incident. After analysis, we distinguished, on the one hand, transfusion reactions, that are transfusions which engendered signs or symptoms, and, on the other hand, the incidents where management errors and/or dysfunctions took place. Over 3 years, 233 incidents were reported, corresponding to 4. 2 events for 1000 blood products delivered. Of the 233, 198 (85 %) were acute transfusion reactions and 35 (15 %) were management errors and/or dysfunctions. Platelet units gave rise to statistically (P < 0. 001) more transfusion reactions (10. 7 per thousand) than red blood cells (3. 5 per thousand) and fresh frozen plasma (0. 8 per thousand), particularly febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions and allergic reactions. A detailed analysis of some of the transfusion incident reports revealed complex deviations and/or failures of the procedures in place in the hospital, allowing the implementation of corrective and preventive measures. Thus, the <b>haemovigilance</b> system in place in the 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, CHUV' appears to constitute an excellent instrument for monitoring the security of blood transfusion...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives A {{photochemical}} treatment process (PCT) utilizing amotosalen and UVA light (INTERCEPT (TM) Blood System) {{has been}} developed for inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites and leucocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion. The objective {{of this study was}} to further characterize the safety profile of INTERCEPT-treated platelet components (PCT-PLT) administered across a broad patient population. Materials and Methods This open-label, observational <b>haemovigilance</b> programme of PCT-PLT transfusions was conducted in 21 centres in 11 countries. All transfusions were monitored for adverse events within 24 h post-transfusion and for serious adverse events (SAEs) up to 7 days post-transfusion. All adverse events were assessed for severity (Grade 0 - 4), and causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion. Results Over the course of 7 years in the study centres, 4067 patients received 19 175 PCT-PLT transfusions. Adverse events were infrequent, and most were of Grade 1 severity. On a per-transfusion basis, 123 (0. 6 %) were classified an acute transfusion reaction (ATR) defined as an adverse event related to the transfusion. Among these ATRs, the most common were chills (77, 0. 4 %) and urticaria (41, 0. 2 %). Fourteen SAEs were reported, of which 2 were attributed to platelet transfusion (< 0. 1 %). No case of transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, transfusion-transmitted infection or death was attributed to the transfusion of PCT-PLT.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An active <b>haemovigilance</b> {{programme}} {{was implemented}} to survey adverse events (AE) associated with transfusion of platelets photochemically treated with amotosalen and ultraviolet A (PCT-PLT). The results of 5106 transfusions {{have already been}} reported. Here we report {{the results of an}} additional 7437 PCT-PLT transfusions. METHODS: The focus of this ongoing <b>haemovigilance</b> programme is to document all AEs associated with PCT-PLT transfusion. Data collected for AEs include: time of event after starting transfusion, clinical descriptions, vital signs, results from radiographs and bacterial cultures, event severity (Grade 0 - 4) and causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred patients (mean 60 years, range 1 - 96) received PCT-PLT transfusions. The majority of the patients (53. 4 %) had haematology-oncology diseases and required conventional chemotherapy (44. 8 %) or stem cell transplantation (8. 6 %). Sixty-eight PCT-PLT transfusions were associated with AE. Acute transfusion reactions (ATR), classified as an AE possibly related, probably related, or related to PCT-PLT transfusions were infrequent (n = 55, 55 / 7437 = 0. 7 %) and most were of Grade 1 severity. Thirty-nine patients (39 / 1400 = 2. 8 %) experienced one or more ATRs. The most frequently reported signs/symptoms were chills, fever, urticaria, dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting. Five AEs were considered severe (> or = Grade 2); however, no causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion was found. Repeated exposure to PCT-PLT did not increase the likelihood of an ATR. No cases of transfusion-related acute lung injury and no deaths due to PCT-PLT transfusions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Routine transfusion of PCT-PLT is well-tolerated {{in a wide range of}} patients. ATRs related to PCT-PLT transfusion were infrequent and most were of mild severity...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Haemovigilance</b> {{hinges on}} a {{systematically}} structured reporting system, which unfortunately {{does not always}} exist in resource-limited settings. We determined the incidence and pattern of transfusion-related adverse events reported to the National Blood Service Zimbabwe. Materials and methods. A retrospective review of the transfusion-event records of the National Blood Service Zimbabwe was conducted covering the period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2011. All transfusion-related event reports received during the period were analysed. Results. A total of 308 transfusion adverse events (0. 046 %) were reported for 670, 625 blood components distributed. The majority (61. 6 %) of the patients who experienced an adverse event were female. The median age was 36 years (range, 1 - 89 years). The majority (68. 8 %) of the adverse events were acute transfusion reactions consisting of febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions (58. 5 %), minor allergies (31. 6 %), haemolytic reactions (5. 2 %), severe allergic reactions (2. 4 %), anaphylaxis (1. 4 %) and hypotension (0. 9 %). Two-thirds (66. 6 %) of the adverse events occurred following administration of whole blood, although only 10. 6 % of the blood was distributed as whole blood. Packed cells, which accounted for 75 % of blood components distributed, were associated with 20. 1 % of the events. Discussion. The incidence of suspected transfusion adverse events was generally lower than the incidences reported globally in countries with well-established <b>haemovigilance</b> systems. The administration of whole blood was disproportionately associated with transfusion adverse events. The pattern of the transfusion adverse events reported here highlights the probable differences in practice between different settings.

40|$|Background. Even though blood {{transfusion}} {{is a relatively}} safe form of therapy, because of the eventual administrative errors in the transfusion chain between the blood donor and the recipient of blood, transfusion errors still occur. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} ensure an utmost extent of safety and reliability of all transfusion related procedures. The safety of {{blood transfusion}} can be improved by preventive actions, i. e. implementation of the total quality management concept, <b>haemovigilance</b> and virtual transfusion laboratory. In the resulting system, the information web, robotics, computer sciences and communication technologies ensure safe and reliable identification of the patients, blood donors, corresponding test samples and blood products. Apart form this; the modern technologies enable the automation of laboratory testing, the integrity of laboratory results and enable an optimal use of blood. Conclusions. For an improved transfusion safety in Slovenia, adoption of corresponding prevention as well as <b>haemovigilance</b> is necessary. Identification errors can be prevented by implementation of the wristbands systems with the code bars for the tagging of the patient and his biological samples, whereas the administrative errors in the blood bank and transfusion laboratory can be prevented by implementation of information systems and automation. We assume that the virtual transfusion laboratory will {{become an integral part of}} the new Slovenian transfusion web and will speed up, unify and simplify today’s methods of ordering and administering blood products. To the attending physician, it will enable the choice of optimal transfusion therapy schedule and at the same time, it will enable the supervision of individual orders, deviations and indications, all of which is needed in order to analyse and improve the quality and the costs of the treatment. These services represent the first obligatory step for the modernisation of the transfusion medicine and accordingly, of the Slovenian health system in sense of the total quality assurance. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} {{and management of}} transfusion reactions (TRs) are critical to ensure patient safety during and after a blood transfusion.

Asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals may introduce virus into the blood supply by donation, while recipients can potentially suffer severe consequences. Dengue, West Nile and chikungunya outbreaks have led to responses by blood transfusion services which can inform future planning. Reports of transfusion-associated transmission demonstrate the potentially fatal consequences of lack of <b>haemovigilance.</b> South-East Asia remains vulnerable to arboviruses with permis-sive climate and high levels of endemic transmission as well as the potential for emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases. Resource limitations constrain the use of expensive technologies for donor screening. Continued surveillance an...|$|E
40|$|Two {{separate}} {{episodes of}} transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) in thalassaemia patients caused by {{red blood cell}} transfusions from the same multiparous blood donor are reported. Both cases had the same symptomatology and occurred 10 - 60 minutes of transfusion. The patients presented dyspnea, sweating, fatigue, dizziness, fever, and sense of losing consciousness. The chest x-ray showed a pulmonary oedema-like picture with both lungs filled with fluid. The patients were treated in the intensive therapy unit. They were weaned off the ventilator and discharged following hospitalization 7 and 9 days respectively. The TRALI syndrome was diagnosed {{to be associated with}} HLA-specific donor antibodies against mismatched HLA-antigens of the transfused patients. <b>Haemovigilance</b> improvements are essential for reducing the morbidity and mortality in transfused patients. Blood from multiparous donors should be tested for the presence of IgG HLA-Class I and –Class II antibodies before being transfused in thalassaemia and other chronically transfused patients...|$|E
40|$|The acute blood {{transfusion}} reactions {{are responsible for}} causing most serious adverse events. Awareness about various clinical features of acute and delayed transfusion reactions with an ability to assess the serious reactions on time {{can lead to a}} better prognosis. Evidence-based medicine has changed today′ s scenario of clinical practice to decrease adverse transfusion reactions. New evidence-based algorithms of transfusion and improved <b>haemovigilance</b> lead to avoidance of unnecessary transfusions perioperatively. The recognition of adverse events under anaesthesia is always challenging. The unnecessary {{blood transfusion}}s can be avoided with better blood conservation techniques during surgery and with anaesthesia techniques that reduce blood loss. Better and newer blood screening methods have decreased the infectious complications to almost negligible levels. With universal leukoreduction of red blood cells (RBCs), selection of potential donors such as use of male donors only plasma and restriction of RBC storage, most of the non-infectious complications can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Audits of {{practice}} and incident reporting, most notably to national <b>haemovigilance</b> schemes, indicate that poor hospital transfusion practice is frequent and occasionally results in catastrophic consequences for patients. Improvements in practice are needed and depend on a combined approach including {{a better understanding of}} the causes of errors; a reduction in the complexity of routine procedures taking advantage of new technology systems, which enforce agreed guidelines and policies; the setting and regular monitoring of performance standards for key aspects of the hospital transfusion process, improved organisation of transfusion in hospitals and staff training; and further research on the safe and effective use of blood and alternatives to donor blood. There needs to be a greater recognition that 'transfusion safety' applies to the hospital transfusion process as well as the contents of blood bags and that resources need to be provided for the improvement of transfusion safety and management in hospitals commensurate to their importance...|$|E
40|$|Background - Iran {{is one of}} the {{countries}} located on “the thalassemia belt” with a significant annual number of thalassemia new births. Given the importance of thalassemia prevention, a program to this effect was approved in Iran in 1995. Screening of carrier couples and prenatal diagnosis were the two main elements of this program. In the present study, the authors have tried to address the impacts of prevention efforts in Iran (1989 - 2009) and also the status of new birth cases of thalassemia during the time period ranging from 1989 when the Iranian Thalassemia Society was established to 1995 when the prevention program started to run. Materials and Method - The data were obtained from the countrywide <b>haemovigilance</b> network. The data were then compared against the available information in the thalassemia treatment network of Iran and some other thalassemia associations. The available information had been collected through questionnaires and in some cases by phone calls and emails. Results - The findings show that the average thalassemia carrier prevalence rate in the country is about 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} Continuous AutoTransfusion System (C. A. T. S; Fresenius Hemotechnology, Bad Homburg v. d. H., Germany), which conserves {{allogenic}} blood, {{is reported}} in 187 patients having abdominal aortic aneurysm repair during a 9 -year period. Patients were allocated to C. A. T. S if a <b>Haemovigilance</b> technician was available. A mean of 685 mL of retrieved blood was reinfused in 101 patients receiving C. A. T. S; 61 % required 2 U or less. All control patients required 3 U or more of allogenic blood. Allogenic transfusion in C. A. T. S patients decreased significantly (P <. 0001). Mean intensive care unit stay was significantly reduced in C. A. T. S patients (P =. 042). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 18 days for C. A. T. S group and 25 days in control patients (P =. 014). The respective 30 -day mortality was 12 % versus 19 % (P =. 199). The C. A. T. S markedly reduced the amount of blood transfused, was associated with reduced intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, and was cost-effective...|$|E
