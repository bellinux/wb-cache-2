25|$|After {{the end of}} the Tonbridge bypass, the A21 climbs Castle Hill before {{becoming}} the Pembury Bypass at Longfield road junction, a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>Roundabout</b> interchange. The next junction is with the A264 road to Tunbridge Wells and the A228 to Maidstone. The road later meets the original alignment at an at-grade junction (leaving a brief gap in the central reservation) not long before it meets a double roundabout at Kippings Cross where another section of single carriageway starts.|$|E
25|$|The {{section of}} the M4 in South Wales has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and {{built-up}} areas, {{so there are some}} unusual junction layouts. Junction 27 (High Cross) is a normal <b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout</b> junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the slip road onto the motorway. Junctions 30–31 (East Cardiff) were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges at the time of construction. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct Junction 31 (A469 road). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single slip road onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at Junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1988 and 2017, the Tonbridge bypass and the Pembury bypass were {{separated}} by a [...] section of 7.3m wide single carriageway with no footways or verges. Severe congestion was frequent as this stretch carried an average of 35,000 vehicles each day, significantly higher than its original capacity, {{and the number of}} accidents occurring on this road was above the national average. There were proposals to upgrade this section of A21 to a dual carriageway standard following the Pembury bypasses completion, however they were delayed multiple times. In the 2000s, an upgrade scheme was proposed by the Highways Agency, and in 2013 it underwent public enquiry. The scheme layout followed the existing carriageway and involved the construction of a pedestrian and cycle route along its whole length, as well as upgrading the Longfield Road roundabout into a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>Roundabout</b> interchange. [...] £92million of government money was made available to the scheme in July 2013. Preparatory works started in September 2014, which involved nine hectares of ancient woodland being removed. Trees and shrubs were relocated to adjacent land and nesting boxes were installed to protect endangered species such as the dormouse.|$|E
50|$|All of the National Primary Routes {{radiating}} from Dublin begin at their junctions with the M50. The junctions were originally {{in the form}} of <b>grade-separated</b> signal-controlled <b>roundabout</b> junctions, not free-flowing interchanges. The M50 mainline itself was free-flow through all junctions. The other primary routes served are the N2 to Derry/Monaghan, N3 to Navan/Cavan/Northwest, N4/M4 to Galway/Sligo/Mayo, N7/M7 (M8) to Cork/Limerick/Waterford, and the N11/M11 to Wexford. Additional junctions along the motorway serve other suburbs of Dublin such as Ballymun, Tallaght, Naas, Dundrum, Sandyford and Cherrywood.|$|R
50|$|Freeways {{are major}} roads {{with more than}} one lane of traffic in each {{direction}} designed for higher speed operation. They have barriers or wide median strips separating traffic travelling in opposite directions, and <b>grade-separated</b> intersections without <b>roundabouts</b> or traffic lights in the main route. Some toll roads are called motorways or tollways to avoid perceived difficulties with charging people to use a freeway. Most Australian capital cities have one or more freeways across, past, or leading to them.|$|R
50|$|The section {{between the}} Petone and Normandale Overbridges was {{improved}} by the Dowse to Petone project, replacing {{three sets of}} traffic lights with a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout</b> and an overbridge.|$|E
50|$|Non-signalized designs {{include the}} cloverleaf, contraflow left, dogbone (restricted dumbbell), double {{crossover}} merging, dumbbell (grade-separated bowtie), echelon, free-flow interchange, partial cloverleaf, raindrop, single and double roundabouts (<b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout),</b> single-point urban, stack, and windmill.|$|E
50|$|The A405 {{starts at}} a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout</b> {{junction}} with the A41 at Leavesden Green. From here, it travels northeast to a crossing with Sheepcot Lane at Woodside, then east to {{a traffic light}} junction with the A412 near Garston. This 1.4-mile (2.2-km) section is known as Kingsway.|$|E
5000|$|The section from Hessle into Kingston upon Hull {{is named}} Clive Sullivan Way, after the rugby league footballer Clive Sullivan, (originally titled the South Docks Road) [...] There is a {{junction}} with Priory Way, and at Gipsyville it meets the A1166 at a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout</b> near St Andrew's Quay. Near the Albert Dock, {{there is a}} fly-over where it rejoins the former Hessle Road next to the Smith & Nephew factory to the south.|$|E
50|$|The Newbridge {{roundabout}} {{was built}} in 1970 as a flat roundabout serving the M8 Edinburgh to Glasgow motorway, the M9 Edinburgh to Stirling motorway, the A8 and the A89. One of the busiest roundabouts in Scotland, traffic congestion became intolerable and it was converted to a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout</b> interchange in 1997, becoming Junction 1 of the M9. The A8 (dual carriageway to Maybury junction only) runs from the Newbridge Roundabout into Edinburgh City Centre. The A89 road runs from Newbridge roundabout to Broxburn.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the Mungavin Avenue, Titahi Bay Road {{intersection}} in the 1960s {{enabled the}} connection of the Johnsonville-Porirua Motorway to the then new four-lane Porirua-Paremata expressway. The work included building a two-lane flyover over the railway line and Porirua stream to connect Mungavin Avenue to the newly constructed four-lane Titahi Bay Road. At a later date, a second flyover was constructed to provide four-lanes. The flyovers eliminated the level crossing and bridge over the stream to the south. In 1989, the Mungavin Avenue intersection was replaced with a <b>grade-separated</b> <b>roundabout</b> interchange, with State Highway 1 passing under the interchange. However, with the completion of this interchange, {{the northern end of}} the Johnsonville-Porirua motorway was not relocated and remains in the same location 500 metres south of Mungavin Avenue as SH1 north of this point does not meet full motorway standards.|$|E
