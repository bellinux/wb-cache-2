5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have <b>dripped</b> <b>from</b> wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E

When one died in the infirmary—hardly a noteworthy occurrence in those days—the Rebbe stood up and eulogized him for having been a great Torah scholar in Hungary. He refused to eat non-kosher food or food cooked in the non-kosher kitchen, subsisting only on bread and water during his nine months in Muldorf. Moreover, he would not eat the bread until he had ritually washed his hands, and would often wait for days to find some water for this purpose. One prisoner watched him stand beside the cement mixer {{for hours at a}} time, collecting the drops of water that <b>dripped</b> <b>from</b> the tank.|$|E

25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation <b>dripped</b> <b>from</b> the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant a reliance on preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.|$|E

For the stench given off by the impudicus was strikingly {{like that of a}} decaying corpse, the odor coming from greenish, viscous slime that carried its spores and <b>dripped</b> <b>from</b> the bell-shaped cap.

40|$|Het Nieuwe Telen (The New Growing) {{results in}} {{applying}} more screen layers that stay completely closed. In practise this causes problems with drip. In this research {{the impact of}} 2 screen layers and using screen gaps {{on the amount of}} <b>drip</b> <b>from</b> the screens or the greenhouse cover is investigated. Solutions to reduce the problems related to drip were proposed and tested in the greenhouse. During spring and winter 2016, measurements were performed at a tomato greenhouse with artificial lighting, blackout screen, energy screen and a Ventilationjet system. The daily amount of the condensation water that <b>drips</b> <b>from</b> the greenhouse ridge, gutter and the Ventilationjet was determined. In contrast to the general expectations, the drip does not come from the screens but from the greenhouse cover and from the Ventilationjets. Condensation occurred at the screens but this did not result in <b>drip</b> <b>from</b> these screens. Only 0. 2 % of the condensation against the greenhouse cover drips into the greenhouse. If this drip would be re evaporated, the energy costs for heating would increase with 0. 0008 m 3 gas /m 2 /week. Investments to reduce drip can thus only be paid back by a better crop quality and not by energy savings. The use of the inlet ventilator of the Ventilationjet system or the use of a screen gap increases the amount of condensation on a cold greenhouse cover. <b>Drip</b> <b>from</b> the greenhouse gutter was solved by applying a condensation gutter and the <b>drip</b> <b>from</b> the duct of the Ventilationjet was solved by applying a collecting tray with drain hose...|$|R

Anderson crafted the first shot after the opening credits, which involved Scully getting ready while water <b>dripped</b> <b>from</b> a sink, to create a [...] "continuation of sound, rhythmic sound", because {{it was important to}} the show's musical aspect. Anderson and series composer Mark Snow worked together in post-production; after filming, she sent Snow several CDs of music and asked him for compositions that were similar in style and feel.

The 40-minute concert comprised songs from the then-upcoming Back to Basics and other songs, including [...] "Lady Marmalade" [...] (2001) and [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002).

2500|$|Beyond the Highway 97 marker, {{visitors}} {{enter an}} area called Low Bridge Lane. [...] In this area, the ceiling drops {{to less than}} six feet (1.8m). [...] This section of the cave was created after most of the molten lava had drained {{out of the cave}} leaving hot gases trapped in the interior of the tube. [...] These gases re-heated the lava tube causing the tunnel walls to re-melt. [...] As re-melted rocks cooled, the walls were left with a shiny, glazed surface. [...] There are also volcanic stalactites in this area of the cave. [...] These formations are sometimes called lavacicles. [...] They are found in two forms. [...] Some are hollow cylindrically shaped soda straws, formed by escaping gases. [...] The others are cone shaped drip pendants formed when re-melted lava <b>dripped</b> <b>from</b> the ceiling. [...] At the end of Low Bridge area, the tube begins to narrow and the cave is divided into two tunnels with intermittent connecting passages. [...] This is the Two Tube Tunnel section of the cave. [...] Both tubes were probably active lava channels at the same time; however, the upper channel eventually drained into the lower tube as the flow subsided.|$|E
