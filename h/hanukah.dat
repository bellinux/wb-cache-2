50|$|Menchell {{continued}} to use his Jewish religion as an advantage throughout his career. Thinking critically about Jewish or “Yiddish” humor, it can be categorized as “one of self-criticism or inwardly directed ridicule.” Menchell demonstrates this stereotyped humor in many of his comic songs such as 1954’s “All I Want for Chanukah is Marilyn Monroe.” Menchell jokingly uses lyrics such as “If you wanna make me look good/ And show I’m not just John Doe/ Well all I want for <b>Hanukah</b> is Marilyn Monroe” and “If you wanna raise my prestige/And let me show that I’m no schmo/ Well all I want for <b>Hanukah</b> is Marilyn Monroe.” In a 1955 issue of Billboard, the song gets an honorable mention for being on the spotlight and {{is described as a}} “Yiddish type piece of material that is cleverly written and neatly performed. song Could do business in major population centers where there is a large Yiddish clientele for disk shops. It is also important to note that Lou Menchell credits The Mambonicks as a featured artist in this song. Mambonicks were a “toned down version of mambo, without acrobatics and was taught at dance studios, resort hotels, and nightclubs. Mambo allowed the opportunity for people of different ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds to dance as one and it is said to have brought Afro-Americans, Irish, Italians, and Jews together. By incorporating his own version of Mambonicks, Menchell is reaching a wider audience and attempting to target more than just his typical Jewish people. Menchell continues to incorporate Yiddish humor in songs such as “She Was Out With A Mambo,” which is a “parody on the Vaughn Monroe click. Through Menchell’s songs and humor he has reached a wide audience and {{made a name for himself}} in the rise of comedy.|$|E

[...] "The war has brought me to changes of attitude, the full significance of which I still cannot recognize," [...] wrote Werfel.
