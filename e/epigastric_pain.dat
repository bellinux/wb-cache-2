25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{symptoms}} {{in relation to the}} meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give <b>epigastric</b> <b>pain</b> during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2–3hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum.|$|E

The patient responded rapidly to expectant management and a repeat spiral CT scan, 3 weeks after the initial presentation, demonstrated complete re-canalisation of the vessel.
