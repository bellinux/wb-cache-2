5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and <b>glycosylation.</b> For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise {{a large number of}} secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by <b>glycosylation,</b> methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
25|$|Over 40 {{disorders}} of <b>glycosylation</b> {{have been}} reported in humans. These can be divided into four groups: disorders of protein N-glycosylation, disorders of protein O-glycosylation, disorders of lipid <b>glycosylation</b> and disorders of other <b>glycosylation</b> pathways and of multiple <b>glycosylation</b> pathways. No effective treatment is known for any of these disorders. 80% of these affect the nervous system.|$|E

40|$|Glycosyl iodides {{have proven}} to be highly {{efficient}} and stereospecific glycosyl donors. Unfortunately with such high reactivity, they possess short shelf lives. Glycosyl bromides, on the other hand, are more robust than their iodo-counterparts. But, <b>glycosylations</b> using glycosyl bromides in the absence of Lewis acid catalysts are slow. Recently, we have demonstrated conditions augmenting <b>glycosylations</b> involving glycosyl bromides to levels matching the efficiency and stereospecificity of glycosyl iodides. Results of our studies will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|A {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} <b>glycosylation</b> (previously called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome) {{is one of}} several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which <b>glycosylation</b> of a variety of tissue proteins and/or lipids is deficient or defective. Congenital disorders of <b>glycosylation</b> are sometimes known as CDG syndromes. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different organ systems (especially the nervous system, muscles, and intestines) in affected infants. The most common subtype is CDG-Ia (also referred to as PMM2-CDG) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1-phosphate.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin (AT) {{is a small}} protein {{molecule}} that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system. Antithrombin is a glycoprotein produced by the liver and consists of 432 amino acids. It contains three disulfide bonds {{and a total of}} four possible <b>glycosylation</b> sites. α-Antithrombin is the dominant form of antithrombin found in blood plasma and has an oligosaccharide occupying each of its four <b>glycosylation</b> sites. A single <b>glycosylation</b> site remains consistently un-occupied in the minor form of antithrombin, β-antithrombin. Its activity is increased manyfold by the anticoagulant drug heparin, which enhances the binding of antithrombin to factor IIa (Thrombin) and factor Xa.|$|E
50|$|Further {{experiments}} have confirmed {{the importance of}} the mucin-like <b>glycosylations.</b> Lectins directed at GP900 carbohydrate moieties (alpha-N-galactosamine) were able to block adhesion and prevent C. parvum invasion.|$|R
50|$|Tetraspanins {{are highly}} conserved between species. Some tetraspanins can have N-linked <b>glycosylations</b> {{on the long}} {{extracellular}} loop (LEL, EC2) and palmitoylations at a CXXC motif in their transmembrane region.|$|R
40|$|The {{hydroxylation}} of lysine and <b>glycosylations</b> of hydroxylysine {{were studied}} in isolated chick-embryo tendon and cartilage cells under {{conditions in which}} collagen triple-helix formation was either inhibited or accelerated. The former situation was obtained by incubating the tendon cells with 0. 6 mm-dithiothreitol, thus decreasing their proline hydroxylase activity by about 99 %. After labelling with [14 C]proline, the formation of hydroxy[14 C]proline {{was found to have}} declined by about 95 %. Since the hydroxylation of a relatively large number of proline residues is required for triple-helix formation at 37 °C, the pro-α-chains synthesized under these conditions apparently cannot form triple-helical molecules. Labelling experiments with [14 C]lysine indicated that the degree of hydroxylation of the lysine residues in the collagen synthesized was slightly increased and the degree of the <b>glycosylations</b> of the hydroxylysine residues more than doubled, the largest increase being in the content of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine. Recovery of chick-embryo cartilage cells from temporary anoxia was used to obtain accelerated triple-helix formation. A marked decrease was found in the extent of hydroxylation of the lysine residues in the collagen synthesized under these conditions, and an even larger decrease occurred in the <b>glycosylations</b> of the hydroxylysine residues. The results support the previous suggestion that the triple-helix formation of the pro-α-chains prevents further hydroxylation of lysine residues and <b>glycosylations</b> of hydroxylysine residues during collagen biosynthesis...|$|R

50|$|Baculovirus is {{normally}} used for production of glycoproteins, although the <b>glycosylations</b> {{may be different}} from those found in vertebrates.

Most of the <b>glycosylations</b> proceeded with a high stereoselectivity...|$|R
25|$|Another {{key event}} {{that takes place}} in the ER is N-linked <b>glycosylation.</b> In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex sugar moiety on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine). By far, N-linked <b>glycosylation</b> is the most abundant post-translational modification found in eukaryotic cells.|$|E

5000|$|An archaeosortase is {{a protein}} {{that occurs in}} the cell {{membranes}} of some archaea. Archaeosortases recognize and remove carboxyl-terminal protein sorting signals about 25 amino acids long from secreted proteins. A genome that encodes one archaeosortase may encode over fifty target proteins. The best characterized archaeosortase target is the Haloferax volcanii S-layer glycoprotein, an extensively modified protein with O-linked <b>glycosylations,</b> N-linked <b>glycosylations,</b> and a large prenyl-derived lipid modification toward the C-terminus. Recent work shows that either of two mutations, knockout of the archaeosortase A (artA) gene or permutation of the motif Pro-Gly-Phe (PGF) to Pro-Phe-Gly, blocks attachment of the lipid moiety as well as blocking removal of the PGF-CTERM protein-sorting domain. [...] Thus archaeosortase {{appears to be a}} , like sortase, rather than a simple protease.|$|R
25|$|The {{process is}} non-templated (unlike DNA {{transcription}} or protein translation); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, cisternae in Golgi apparatus). Therefore, <b>glycosylation</b> is a site-specific modification.|$|E
25|$|The {{same study}} also {{identified}} 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker <b>glycosylation</b> activity.
