40|$|Mass {{media have}} {{traditionally}} functioned as an intermediary system between society and political institutions. The rise of social media potentially reconfigures relations between citizens and politicians and challenges traditional media’s position. Via {{the analysis of}} Twitter traffic during the 2012 local election in Belgium, this study aims to provide insight in the way different actor types (i. e. politicians, citizens and journalists) and different media outlets (i. e. social and traditional media) are embedded in the Twittersphere. We acknowledge the platform serves as an extension, rather than an alternative for the mainstream media, with high-end Twitter users being mostly established (media) figures. Cross-media linkages often <b>include</b> <b>audiovisual</b> media, both social and traditional media. To conclude, pathways for future research are outlined...|$|R

This paper proposes a wiring system {{that enables the}} simultaneous transmission of IEEE 1394 signals and Ethernet signals along a single UTP-CAT 5 cable consisting of four twisted pairs. The requirements of this wiring system were determined by {{taking into account the}} specifications of both IEEE 1394 and Ethernet systems and the actual domestic environment. Home network adapters were developed to connect IEEE 1394 and Ethernet cable to UTP cable. Insertion loss, crosstalk, and eye-diagrams were measured to evaluate the system 2 ̆ 7 s performance. The results show that our proposed wiring system is capable of transmitting both the IEEE 1394 signal and the Ethernet signal simultaneously at 100 Mbps up to a distance of 100 m along a UTP-CAT 5 cable...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of the journalistic field: discursive strategies and journalistic forms Journalism is transforming rapidly in the 21 st century. This article argues that two complementary approaches offer Journalism Studies productive perspectives to study this process of change. Bourdieu's field theory provides a theoretical framework in which the (re-) positioning and interdependencies of established media organizations and new media can be studied fruitfully. By doing so, journalism is explored as a relational and dynamic field of forces in which agents try to maximize their power and prestige. In addition, empirical research into journalism texts, <b>including</b> <b>audiovisual</b> items, and more specific into the forms of reporting sheds light upon the discursive strategies of news media. These texts have to been studies as strategic representations of the social world. They are used to position the author and the medium they are published in as advantageously {{as possible in the}} journalistic field...|$|R

40|$|In 2007 {{the federal}} {{government}} commenced a review into the feasibility of extending the legal deposit scheme to <b>include</b> <b>audiovisual</b> and electronic material. This paper examines the history and significance of legal deposit {{as well as the}} relationship between legal deposit and cultural and technological change. It focuses on the importance of integrating electronic, and specifically online, materials into the national legal deposit system. The current Australian legal deposit scheme is discussed with reference to the 2007 review and subsequent submissions to the review. The relationship between legal deposit and the public domain is analysed, highlighting the ways in which effective deposit schemes can enhance the national public domain. The importance of a flexible and considered approach to developing an appropriate threshold for inclusion of online materials in an extended legal deposit scheme is discussed. Finally, the authors make some suggestions for ways of implementing an efficient and effective legal deposit scheme that can encompass online materials of cultural value...|$|R
