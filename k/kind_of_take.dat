500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects for}} Doctor Strange were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Method Studios, Framestore, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV, contributing to 1450 effects shots. Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals). Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on {{falls and}} concussions, Madison Hubbell said that [...] "Most of the time, the worst falls are on things we <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> for granted."

In rare cases, intensive training of spins may result in subtle concussions (Lucinda Ruh).|$|E

2500|$|Newhart {{discontinued}} {{the series}} in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, [...] "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." [...] Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, [...] "But {{some of the}} other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." [...] She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} during the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, Bell said Fear Factory {{was planning to}} write and record a [...] "full-on concept" [...] album, which was due for release in 2012. He said, [...] "We're gonna <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> a break a little bit, but we're definitely going into the studio at some point and start writing. We wanna take our time doing it. Personally...Mechanize, don't get me wrong, is a good record—I'm very proud of it—but it's gotta be better than that. I've got plans where I'd {{like to do a}} full-on concept again—story, artwork. Just make it real cerebral. But there'll definitely be another Fear Factory record, maybe in 2012." [...] On August 3, 2011, Dino Cazares said on his Twitter feed that he was working and demoing new material for the next Fear Factory album. On January 25, 2012, the band announced the new album will be titled The Industrialist. The album was again co-produced by the band with Rhys Fulber and mixed by Greg Reely.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed {{to be so much}} weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and the fighting is both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that sag point — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season".|$|E

I’ll certainly be conscious of those things but we’re all professionals, we all understand what we need to do, and we’re all kind of self-starters and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> care of ourselves very well so it shouldn’t be much different than when Doug Wheelock, the previous commander, was in charge." ...|$|E

We kind of felt like we needed to get back to what made us excited to be in this band in the beginning, and what made us happy to be doing this and working together, because you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> it for granted after a while. I think we had taken some things for granted and we weren’t really enjoying it as much. It kind of turned into work, you know?" [...] - Lead guitarist Jimmy Stafford.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of the season, creator Bruno Heller said, [...] "Every season, you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> {{a chance}} to reset things. ... Last season was almost serialized. There {{was a great deal}} of plot and story that you could follow through the whole season. We're going to need less of that this season." [...] He commented that the new season would explore Jane's {{feelings}} about finally catching his [...] "white whale", Red John: [...] "What does revenge mean? Because, as you saw in that final moment, after you've killed someone, what's left? ... That kind of bitterness and hate kills things. But then, what do you do?" ...|$|E

Weston has said: [...] "Booker Ervin, for me, was {{on the same level}} as John Coltrane. He was a completely original saxophonist.... He was a master.... 'African Cookbook', which I composed back in the early '60s, was partly named after Booker because we (musicians) used to call him 'Book,' and we would say, 'Cook, Book.' Sometimes when he was playing we'd shout, 'Cook, Book, cook.' And the melody of 'African Cookbook' was based upon Booker Ervin's sound, a sound like the north of Africa. He would <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> those notes and make them weave hypnotically. So, actually the African Cookbook was influenced by Booker Ervin." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cohen {{found the}} {{mainstream}} Hollywood film industry incompatible with his sociopolitical and artistic views. By applying the D.I.Y. ethos of Punk Rock to his film-making approach, he crafted a distinct style in his films through various small gauge formats of Super 8, sixteen-millimetre, and videotape. In {{an interview with}} web-site The Lamp, Cohen said, [...] "...it's very inspiring to me, to see people <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> something outside of the industry, outside of the music industry, and it gave me something of a template to work in film outside of the film industry. And there are certainly strains of punk that are activist and that are kind of oppositional in nature to the dominant mainstream culture... that's very inspiring to me..." ...|$|E

5000|$|MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote,"'Sacrifice' wasn't a {{flawless}} finale — I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>take</b> issue with Dean's 'I didn't mean all that crap about not trusting you' monologue because, eh, he's seemed pretty freaking sincere {{about it the}} past several seasons, which is totally fine, but let's not conveniently forget about it just because Sam was about to nobly kill himself... again. It's not fair to Dean to cheapen his sincerity and in some cases, totally justified anger/hurt. And it's not fair to Sam to basically reduce his anger/hurt to an overreaction. However, that being my only major complaint with the episode, I'd say 'Sacrifice' was pretty close to perfect. It's definitely the best finale we've had since 'Swan Song' — unless you didn't like [...] "Swan Song," [...] in which case, feel free to substitute your own favorite. 'No Rest for the Wicked,' perhaps? Also a solid choice." ...|$|E
