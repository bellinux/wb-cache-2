Following in the footsteps of pioneering {{administrative law}} scholars, a growing body of recent scholarship has begun to attend to the role of internal norms and structures in controlling agency action. This Article offers a conceptual and historical account of these internal forces as <b>internal</b> administrative <b>law.</b> <b>Internal</b> administrative <b>law</b> consists of the internal directives, guidance, and organizational forms through which agencies structure the discretion of their employees and presidents control the workings of the executive branch. It is the critical means for shaping the discretion of officials and ensuring accountability within agencies. <b>Internal</b> administrative <b>law’s</b> binding status in structuring agency decision marks it as a form of law. This Article’s project is one of recovery more than invention. The decade-long debate culminating in enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) reflected consistent recognition of internal controls’ contributions to agency accountability. Despite this history, judicial enforcement of the APA undermined <b>internal</b> administrative <b>law</b> and constrained its content by treating the agency’s articulation of internal norms that bind agency actors as triggering external judicial enforcement. At the same time, expanded White House control has made <b>internal</b> administrative <b>law</b> more centralized.
