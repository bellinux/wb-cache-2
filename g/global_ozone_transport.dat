40|$|AbstractThe ozone {{mixing ratio}} data from 1958 to 2001 from ECMWF {{was used to}} {{calculate}} <b>global</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of the ozone transport. The results are as followings: (1) The intensity of ozone transport enhances from the upper troposphere to the lower stratosphere and reaches the highest value at 30 hPa and then it decreases. The ozone vertical transport is mainly from the stratosphere to the troposphere. The OUT (ozone upward transportation) is mainly over the ocean, while the ODT (ozone downward transportation) is mainly over the mainland {{and there is a}} strong and perennial ODT center over the Eurasian Continent. (2) The ozone transportation varies with the season, and its intensity is the strongest in winter and weakest in spring. It is relatively weak in autumn and in summer. And it is mainly in the northern hemisphere in winter and in spring, while it is mainly in the southern hemisphere in autumn and in summer. (3) There is a clear about 20 -year period variability of the ozone transportation below 20 hPa...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} availability of remote sensing {{data for the}} middle atmosphere from satellites, more analyses of the middle atmosphere circulation are being published. Some of these are process studies for limited periods, and some are statistical analyses of middle atmosphere general circulation statistics. Results from the latter class of studies will be reviewed. These include analysis of the zonally averaged middle atmosphere structure, temperature, and zonal winds; analysis of planetary wave structures, analysis of heat and momentum fluxes; and analysis of Eliassen-and-Palm flux vectors and flux divergences. Emphasis is on the annual march of these quantities; Northern and Southern Hemisphere asymmetries; and interannual variability in these statistics.

The annual cycle of <b>ozone</b> <b>transports</b> in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres is presented and discussed.

40|$|The <b>Ozone</b> <b>Transport</b> Assessment Group (OTAG) has {{identified}} <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> {{as a contributor}} to ozone exceedances in the eastern U. S. EPA has issued the NOx SIP Call that requires deep NOx emission controls on major stationary sources (mainly utility sources) as a “cost-effective” approach for reducing <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> from upwind states on downwind “nonattainment”. However, the technical analyses on which EPA based their NOx SIP Call overstated the contributions of <b>ozone</b> <b>transport,</b> incorrectly evaluated the ozone contributions of the sources that were controlled in the SIP Call, inappropriately examined other levels of control, and used a measure of “cost-effectiveness ” that {{was not related to}} achieving any ozone reductions.

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> was carried out using the Transformed-Mean Eulerian (TEM) tracer continuity equation and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA- 40). In this budget analysis, the chemical net production term, which is calculated as the residual of the other terms, displays the correct features of a chemical sink and source term, including location and seasonality, and shows good agreement in magnitude compared to other methods of calculating ozone loss rates. This study provides further insight {{into the role of}} the eddy <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and underlines its fundamental role in the recovery of the ozone hole during spring. The trend analysis reveals that the ozone hole intensification over the 1980 – 2001 period is not solely related to the trend in chemical losses, but more specifically to the balance between the trends in chemical losses and <b>ozone</b> <b>transport.</b> That is because, in the Southern Hemisphere from October to December, the large increase in the chemical destruction of ozone is balanced by an equally large trend in the eddy transport, associated with a small increase in the mean transport. This study shows that the increase in the eddy transport is characterized by more poleward ozone eddy flux by transient waves in the midlatitudes and by stationary waves in the polar region. Overall, this study makes clearer the close interaction between the trends in ozone chemistry and <b>ozone</b> <b>transport.</b> It reveals that the eddy <b>ozone</b> <b>transport</b> and its long-term changes are an important natural mitigation mechanism for the ozone hole.

We estimate <b>global</b> <b>ozone</b> fields in the stratosphere and troposphere by combining the data from EOS Aura satellite with an ozone model using data assimilation. Ozone exhibits a large temporal variability in the lower stratosphere. Our previous work showed that assimilation of satellite data from limb-sounding geometry helps constrain ozone profiles in that region. We assimilated ozone data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) into the ozone system at NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). <b>Ozone</b> is <b>transported</b> within a general circulation model (GCM) which includes parameterizations for stratospheric photochemistry, tropospheric chemistry, and a simple scheme for heterogeneous ozone loss.

Comparisons with ozone sondes and occultation data show that assimilation of Aura data reproduces ozone gradients and variability in the lower stratosphere well. We proceed by separating the contributions to temporal changes in the ozone field into those that are due to the model and those that are due to the assimilation of Aura data.
