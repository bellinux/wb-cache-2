5|$|Pelvic <b>{{inflammatory}}</b> <b>disease</b> or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is {{an infection}} of {{the upper part of}} the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis.

40|$|Inflammation is {{a complex}} {{biological}} response of tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, cell damage, or irritants. Inflammation {{is considered to be}} a major cause of most chronic diseases, especially in more than 100 types of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> which include Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, Crohn's disease, colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and Parkinson's disease. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> TBK 1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase which regulates antiviral defense, host-virus interaction, and immunity. It is ubiquitously expressed in mouse stomach, colon, thymus, and liver. Interestingly, high levels of active TBK 1 have also been found to be associated with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases,</b> indicating that TBK 1 is closely related to inflammatory responses. Even though relatively few studies have addressed the functional roles of TBK 1 relating to inflammation, this paper discusses some recent findings that support the critical role of TBK 1 in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> and underlie the necessity of trials to develop useful remedies or therapeutics that target TBK 1 for the treatment of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>disease</b> of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging.

Multiple factors, including circulating inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), reactive oxygen species, oxidized LDL (low density lipoprotein), autoantibodies and traditional risk factors directly and indirectly activate endothelial cells, leading to impaired vascular relaxation, increased leukocyte adhesion, increased endothelial permeability and generation of a pro-thrombotic state.

40|$|Kai Yin, Devendra K Agrawal Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE, USA Abstract: Beyond its {{critical}} function in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D {{has recently been}} found {{to play an important}} role in the modulation of the immune/inflammation system via regulating the production of inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the proliferation of proinflammatory cells, both of which are crucial for the pathogenesis of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> Several studies have associated lower vitamin D status with increased risk and unfavorable outcome of acute infections. Vitamin D supplementation bolsters clinical responses to acute infection. Moreover, chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular <b>disease,</b> asthma, <b>inflammatory</b> bowel <b>disease,</b> chronic kidney disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and others, tend to have lower vitamin D status, which may play a pleiotropic role in the pathogenesis of the diseases.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a disease-specific {{quality of}} life instrument. We {{translated}} and adapted the questionnaire and tested its reliability and (cross-cultural) validity. METHODS: We surveyed 271 patients with <b>inflammatory</b> bowel <b>disease.</b> The <b>inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire and its dimensional scores (bowel, systemic, social and emotional) were correlated with disease activity, health care use, medication and three other indices of {{quality of life}}. RESULTS: The reliability coefficient of the <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire was high (0. 93). Patients with higher disease activity had significantly lower quality of life on all <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire dimensions (P < 0. 001). <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire scores were significantly correlated with health care use (P < 0. 01) but not with medication. Almost all <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire dimensions correlated highly (0. 43 - 0. 79, P < 0. 001) with the corresponding scales of the standard quality of life indices, except for the bowel dimension. Modified Dutch <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire scores were consistent with Canadian <b>Inflammatory</b> Bowel <b>Disease</b> Questionnaire norms.

40|$|Abstract: Inflammation is {{a complex}} {{pathological}} condition associated with exaggerated human immune system involving various activated immune cells and bio-molecules. Treatment of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> perticularly chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> such as rheumatoid arthritis, <b>inflammatory</b> bowel <b>disease</b> etc. {{has been a big}} challenge for scientists as there are no safe drugs available for cure. Current therapeutic approaches to the treatment of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases</b> are centered on cycloxygenase (both COX- 1 and 2) proinflammatory enzymes but present available drugs of this category are associated with undesirable gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects. Recent scientific advents draw out the secrets of inflammation cache and understanding the involvement of several factors acting as stimulators or inhibitors thus opening new avenues for drug discoveries. Several bio-molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines, components of signal trasduction and matrix degrading enzymes resolve inflammatory responses, might be new targets for treatment of chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review gathers recent advances in drug research focusing interleukin- 1, TNF-α, p 38 kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAP kinase, NFκB, and matrix metalloproteinases. The biological roles of these inflammatory mediators are clearly understood thus offering new targets for design of novel inhibitors for incurable <b>inflammatory</b> <b>diseases.</b> This also provides an overview of the current nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents...|$|R
