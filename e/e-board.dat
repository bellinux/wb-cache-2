The time {{is used as}} a part of the context model, which along with a user model constitutes a base for the adaptation to the user needs. We have proposed an extension of known adaptation techniques by means of the notion of time. Proposed extensions are based on the model of time, which maps a real time to a symbolic time and provides necessary operations for working with both of them. TIM implements proposed adaptation techniques. Its domain model has been created to serve as a web-based adaptive <b>e-board</b> for a university course. The <b>e-board</b> system adapts presentation of the educational module administrative information according the user characteristics and the context represented by the time of information presentation. 1...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000392786400024 International audienceFurther {{progress}} {{in the development of}} reliable biomonitoring strategies requires to better link effects in aquatic ecological systems to ambient concentrations of chemical contaminants. Among existing tools, in situ bioassays using caging method represent an interesting way to achieve this challenge. However, elaboration of adapted exposure chambers and suitable operating procedures is still required, particularly to assess ecological relevant traits such as those related to the reproduction. In such context, we developed a new device (Emergence board <b>E-Board)</b> which allows assessing in rivers the development of the Chironpmus riparius species from the early fourth instar larvae to the adult stage. The system acts as a suspended matter trap floating in the subsurface of the water equipped of an emergence trap for catching adults. The system was tested in actual field conditions. Its easy handling allowed obtaining data which demonstrated its applicability for assessing the development of the chironomids. Moreover, by adapting energy-based models (DEB) specifically developed in the laboratory for the species C. riparius, we were able to predict the growth pattern and the emergence of chironomids in real environmental conditions. The <b>E-Board</b> represents thus a promising new in situ tool in perspective of evaluation {{of the quality of the}} ecosystems...|$|E

In which, {{members of the team}} are distributed in time and space; therefore information should be well distributed to support the cooperative work between them. The research was applying analysis and design methodology. The analysis methodology was undertaken through literature study, current system observation, questionnaire survey to users to identify characteristics of the current and entailed information distribution media. The design methodology was undertaken through database, features, system, and screen layout design. Results of the research found that the information distribution media for team work which has applied distributed asynchronous co-operative work system should have the ability of private access for each member, better organization in information categorizing, structured information for task assignment, and supporting member 2 ̆ 7 s mobility. In conclusion, the application has been expected to help task assignment, distribution and organization of information in the distributed asynchronous co-operative work system to be easier and simpler...|$|E
40|$|At N. C. State University 2 ̆ 7 s D. H. Hill Library, staff oversee {{a diverse}} set of spaces and services, {{as well as}} {{technology}} channels to communicate information to users. Many of these channels are exclusive to in-building interaction, such as e-boards, physical signage, and computer kiosks. Despite this wealth of communication channels, we had not previously systematically evaluated how user needs manifest in the building, how the information we provide addresses these needs, and whether the information is received and understood. We felt {{it was necessary to}} investigate how users 2 ̆ 2 talk 2 ̆ 2 to our building, and to discover how it responds. Consider a new user visiting the library for the first time. She is faced with a perplexing array of communication channels. Physical signage is small, incomplete, or unpredictably placed. Interactive kiosks reveal selected information on spaces and services, while e-boards display a rapid rotation of library- and campus-oriented messaging. A staffed service desk with a large sign imploring, 2 ̆ 2 Ask Us! 2 ̆ 2, and a wealth of textual and computational resources typically available in a large academic library, further complicate the information landscape. Do these multiple channels make sense together to a user in need? Do they work in unison as a holistic system of resource discovery tools? In 2014, we launched a strategic initiative to deepen our understanding of the users of D. H. Hill Library and their needs once they’ve passed through our doors. Our investigation will allow us to identify common scenarios that bring users to the library space, understand the use cases for communication channels in the building, and evaluate how our users engage with and consume information about the library. By improving the effectiveness of our in-building communications, we hope to provide users with an 2 ̆ 2 epistemological roadmap 2 ̆ 2 for successfully navigating the building’s spaces and services. To date, we have completed two studies and have implemented changes based on their findings. Our work has included contextual interviews with users on their perception of space use and <b>e-board</b> communication; as well as a preliminary exploration of patron computer use and needs, to guide the design and development of a live computer availability display. Next steps include usability testing of the prototype computer availability interface, and a study of brand recognition and perception of library services. Additional studies on space usage and service discovery are in development. Our goal is to present information to users in a way that maximizes utility and comprehension, responds to the evolving library context, and demonstrates the NCSU Libraries 2 ̆ 7 ongoing dedication to technological leadership and user focus. This presentation will share the rationale behind this initiative, our methodologies and findings thus far, and changes we 2 ̆ 7 ve implemented based on this research...|$|E
