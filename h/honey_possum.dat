5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus visit Adenanthos cuneatus flowers. A 1978 field study {{conducted}} around Albany found the <b>honey</b> <b>possum</b> (Tarsipes rostratus) occasionally visited Adenanthos cuneatus, while the western spinebill much preferred the species to other flowers. A 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed that the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater pollinate it A 1985–86 field study in the Fitzgerald River National Park found that the nectar-feeding <b>honey</b> <b>possum</b> occasionally eats it. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) feeds on nectar from the flowers, and has also been observed taking dew-drops from leaves early in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos obovatus {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{as a source of}} nectar for the <b>honey</b> <b>possum</b> (Tarsipes rostratus) in winter and spring (early June to September), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by A. meisneri in late spring and summer (late October to February).|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{as a source of}} nectar for the <b>honey</b> <b>possum</b> (Tarsipes rostratus) in winter to early summer (May to December), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by Adenanthos meisneri in the summer. Several honeyeater species visit and pollinate Banksia ilicifolia. The western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus) in particular prefers this species over other banksias.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} plant species visited by <b>honey</b> <b>possums,</b> and compare this menu with our current understanding of plant susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Greater understanding of the diet of <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> in the presence of this pervasive pathogen gives us a better chance of assessing potential impacts of further spread of the pathogen on <b>honey</b> <b>possums...</b>|$|R
40|$|Euthermic <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> have {{a higher}} body {{temperature}} (Tb), basal metabolic rate and wet thermal conductance than other marsupials of similar mass. <b>Honey</b> <b>possums</b> enter torpor when cold-stressed and deprived of food. The pattern of decline in body temperature and oxygen consumption during torpor generally resembles that of other heterothermic endotherms. The duration of torpor bouts in <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> was about 10 h; torpor bouts longer than one day were not observed. The Tb, declined during torpor to within 1 - 2 °C of ambient temperature (Ta> 5 °C) and oxygen consumption rate declined dramatically. The minimal body temperature (Tb min) measured for torpid <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> was about 5 °C, because Tb was regulated at about 5 °C by <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> torpid at Ta 10 - 15 °C) and short-term torpor cycles (e. g. in dasyurids); (2) deep (Tb, min< 10 °C) and multi-day torpor cycles (e. g. in burramyids). <b>Honey</b> <b>possums</b> {{appear to have a}} third pattern of deep (Tb, min= 5 °C) but short-term torpor. The ecological reasons for this pattern of deep torpor and the apparent absence of multi-day torpor in <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> may be related to their nectarivorous diet and lack of extensive fat stores...|$|R

5|$|The {{candlestick}} banksia is pollinated by {{and provides}} {{food for a}} wide array of animals in summer months. Several species of honeyeater visit the flower spikes, as does the <b>honey</b> <b>possum,</b> which has an important role as a pollinator. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base known as a lignotuber, or from epicormic buds within its trunk. Plants may have a lifespan of 300 years. It has been widely used as a street tree and for amenities planting in urban Western Australia, though its large size generally precludes use in small gardens. A dwarf form is commercially available in nurseries.|$|E
500|$|The {{upside-down}} flower spikes drip nectar {{onto the}} ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals which are attracted to the scent. Supporting this hypothesis, the spiky leaves seem to also prevent access to foragers not at ground level. Furthermore, the individual flower structure is similar to Banksia attenuata, for which the [...] <b>honey</b> <b>possum</b> (Tarsipes rostratus) is a major pollinator.|$|E
500|$|It is {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, hence requiring a sandy soil and good drainage to grow in cultivation, its natural habitat of sandy soils in heathland being an example. [...] Its pollinators include bees, <b>honey</b> <b>possum,</b> silvereye and honeyeaters, particularly the western spinebill. [...] A.cuneatus is grown in gardens in Australia and the western United States, and a dwarf and prostrate form are commercially available.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is home to}} 90 {{species of}} birds, 18 species of lizard and 9 species of frogs as well as <b>honey</b> <b>possums,</b> {{echidnas}} and western grey kangaroos.|$|R
50|$|Native flora {{within the}} park {{includes}} shrub banksia, one-sided bottlebrush and parrot bush. Fauna includes emus, <b>honey</b> <b>possums,</b> western pygmy possums, short-beaked echidnas, western grey kangaroos, Australian bustards and many reptiles.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife of {{the coast}} {{includes}} the highly poisonous common death adder. Mammals include tiny <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> (which feed on nectar of the kangaroo paw flowers), and the endangered western quoll. Birds include the endangered western whipbird, western ground parrots, red-winged fairywren, Australian white ibis and the rare southwestern Cape Barren goose on the coast.|$|R
500|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} around Albany found the <b>honey</b> <b>possum</b> (Tarsipes rostratus) sometimes visit Banksia coccinea, {{as do the}} New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P.nigra), and western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus). Banksia coccinea flowers are visited by colletid bees Hylaeus alcyoneus and [...] H.sanguinipictus. The short-billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} Banksia species, B.brownii {{is a heavy}} {{producer}} of nectar, {{and serves as a}} food source for a range of nectariferous birds, mammals and insects. Honeyeaters such as Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (western spinebill) and Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird) are frequent visitors that often carry heavy pollen loads, making them important pollinators. Nocturnal mammals such as Rattus fuscipes (bush rat) and Tarsipes rostratus (<b>honey</b> <b>possum)</b> also carry heavy pollen loads, but the foraging behaviour of bush rats suggests that these may transfer pollen only over very short distances. [...] Invertebrate visitors include the introduced Apis mellifera (western honeybee), native bees, flies and ants; bees appear to be effective pollinators, but ants and flies forage only at the base of flowers and do not come in contact with plant pollen.|$|E

50|$|The {{prominent}} and colourful flower spikes indicate they are attractive to vertebrate pollinators, {{and they are}} visited {{by a variety of}} species, including <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> and a number of honeyeaters, including the New Holland honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, red wattlebird and western spinebill. Insects include the meat ant and European honeybee. A field study excluding pollinators showed that the spikes can set fruit without pollinators, indicating they have a degree of self-compatibility.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it contains almost the entire population of noisy scrub-birds, a large proportion of western bristlebirds and most of the western subspecies of western whipbirds. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of flesh-footed shearwaters and, probably, of great-winged petrels, as well as significant numbers of short-billed black cockatoos, Australasian bitterns, western rosellas, red-capped and rock parrots, red-winged fairywrens, western spinebills, western thornbills, white-breasted robins and red-eared firetails. [...] Hooded plovers are regularly seen. Mammals found in the IBA include Gilbert's potoroos, quokkas, western ringtail <b>possums,</b> <b>honey</b> <b>possums,</b> western brush wallabies and quendas.|$|R
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and <b>honey</b> <b>possums</b> in the garden.|$|R
50|$|The park also {{supports}} {{an array of}} mammals including short-beaked echidna, the western quoll, Gilbert’s dunnart, the <b>honey</b> <b>possum,</b> the western grey kangaroo, the western brush wallaby, Gould’s wattled bat and Mitchell’s hopping mouse.|$|E
