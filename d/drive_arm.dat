40|$|Using the MIT Serial Link Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Arm</b> as {{the main}} {{experimental}} device, various issues in trajectory and force control of manipulators were studied in this thesis. Since accurate modeling is important for any controller, issues of estimating the dynamic model of a manipulator and its load were addressed first. Practical and effective algorithms were developed fro the Newton-Euler equations to estimate the inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links. Load estimation was implemented both on PUMA 600 robot and on the MIT Serial Link Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Arm.</b> With the link estimation algorithm, the inertial parameters of the direct <b>drive</b> <b>arm</b> were obtained. For both load and link estimation results, the estimated parameters are good models of the actual system for control purposes since torques and forces can be predicted accurately from these estimated parameters. The estimated model of the direct <b>drive</b> <b>arm</b> was them used to evaluate trajectory following performance by feedforward and computed torque control algorithms. The experimental evaluations showed that the dynamic compensation can greatly improve trajectory following accuracy. Various stability issues of force control were studied next. It was determined {{that there are two}} types of instability in force control. Dynamic instability, present in all of the previous force control algorithms discussed in this thesis, is caused by the interaction of a manipulator with a stiff environment. Kinematics instability is present only in the hybrid control algorithm of Raibert and Craig, and is caused by the interaction of the inertia matrix with the Jacobian inverse coordinate transformation in the feedback path. Several methods were suggested and demonstrated experimentally to solve these stability problems. The result of the stability analyses were then incorporated in implementing a stable force/position controller on the direct <b>drive</b> <b>arm</b> by the modified resolved acceleration method using both joint torque and wrist force sensor feedbacks...|$|E

Currently, the product demand is rapidly growing and exceeding the process capacity.

The study is focusing on the simulation model of the cleaning machine. The simulation model was developed to determine the line balancing of this process with 2 k factorial design experiment by finding sub-processes which relate to cycle time of the process. According to the simulation model, the line balancing condition creates the reduction to a process time, which is related to the cycle time of process and minimizing the cycle time from 306 seconds to 257 seconds without quality changing. 特集 : Special Section for the Papers Presented at the Symposium on Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Robotics held at Noboribetsu, Hokkaido, Japan on 11 - 12 January 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{inertial}} {{parameters of}} manipulator rigid-body loads and links have been automatically estimated {{as a result}} of gen-eral movement. The Newton-Euler equations have been recast to relate linearly the measured joint forces or torques via acceleration-dependent coefficients to the inertial parame-ters, which have then been estimated by least squares. Load estimation was implemented on a PUMA 600 robot equipped with an R TI FS-B wrist force-torque sensor and on the MIT Serial Link Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Arm</b> equipped with a Barry Wright Company Astek wrist force-torque sensor. Good estimates were obtained for load mass and center of mass, and the forces and torques due to movement of the load could be pre-dicted accurately. The load moments of inertia were more difficult to estimate. Link estimation was implemented on the MIT Serial Link Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Arm.</b> A good match was ob-tained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques estimated from motor cur-rents. The match actually proved superior to predicted torques based on link inertial parameters derived by CAD modeling.
