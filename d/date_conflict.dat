40|$|To <b>date,</b> <b>conflict</b> {{exists in}} the {{literature}} on whether or not and how teachers should react to EFL learners' written grammar errors. Coded versus uncoded corrective feedback {{has been one of the}} rarely explored areas of investigation in SLA. To shed light on the factors that may explain such conflicting results, this study investigated the effect of coded and un-coded written corrective feedback with regard to possible improvements in the accuracy in writing of pre-intermediate EFL learners. It, further, sought whether such an effect would last in the long run. In the course of 14 weeks, learners’ errors in 2 groups (i. e., coded and uncoded) were reacted. A paired-samples t-test was run to analyze the obtained data. Analysis of the written pieces in the immediate post-test and delayed post test revealed that coded corrective feedback, compared to the uncoded group, had a significantly more positive influence on learners' accuracy improvement both in the short and in the long run. The findings imply that teachers should weigh the learners' abilities and interlanguage, proficiency level, and type of error before applying different feedback types. Moreover, the implications are discussed in terms of effective guidelines for teaching writing in EFL contexts...|$|E

40|$|Romantic {{relationships}} are situated within broader cultural and family contexts, {{and this may}} be particularly salient to those in intergroup relationships. This study examined young adults’ experiences with intercultural romantic relationships within the family context. A sample of ethnically diverse young adults (N = 628; Asian, Latino, and European background) reported on self and parent attitudes toward intercultural dating, own current dating status, and disapproval and conflict with parents over current and past dating status. Findings showed the importance of including cultural variations into the conceptualization of intergroup relationships, particularly for ethnic minority and recent immigrant groups. Variations by ethnic group and immigrant generational status were found across study aims. Participants of Asian background reported greater attitudinal discrepancies over intercultural dating with their parents, as well as greater rates of intercultural <b>dating</b> <b>conflict</b> with parents, than did participants of Latino background. First- and second-generation participants reported greater levels of intercultural <b>dating</b> <b>conflict</b> with parents than did third-generation participants. No differences were found by ethnic group or generational status for resolving conflict with parents over intercultural romantic relationships, however young adult men reported resolving conflict significantly more than young adult women. Findings show that the family context in response to intercultural dating relationships is important and varied across ethnic and generational status groups, and have implications for how we conceptualize intergroup romantic relationships...|$|R

Dynamic CE changes almost instantly, hence {{it needs to be}} constantly monitored and updated (e.g. physical location of a person, participants available dates, number of <b>date</b> <b>conflicts</b> in a meeting request).

However, Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} cultural and generational differences in views on intergroup dating relationships {{among members of}} younger and older generation South Asian and European Canadians {{and the role of}} mainstream and heritage cultural identities in shaping these views. In response to a scenario describing an intergroup <b>dating</b> <b>conflict</b> between a young adult and his or her parents, as well as on self-report measures of attitudes toward intergroup dating, South Asian Canadians and members of the older generation exhibited less favorable views on intergroup dating compared to European Canadians and members of the younger generation. Moreover, Canadian identity was consistently associated with more favorable views on intergroup dating, and this relationship was stronger for the South Asians. By comparing members of younger and older generation immigrants to their majority culture counterparts, the study adds a developmental layer to views on minority-majority group romantic relationships...|$|R

50|$|This mound was {{supposed}} to be the burialplace of Dathí, the last pagan High King of Ireland. It appears to be an embanked burial mound with an overall diameter of 40 m, with opposed entrances on the east and west. There is a pillar stone of red sandstone atop the mound, the stone standing 1.85 m high. Macalister’s investigations in 1913 revealed that the mound was carved out of a natural gravel ridge, and furthermore, limited excavation in 1981 confirmed this. No graves were found at this excavation, although charcoal samples retrieved suggest a building date of between 200 BC - 200 AD. This <b>date</b> <b>conflicts</b> with the legend of this being Dathí’s final resting place, as he {{was supposed}} to have died around 429 AD, at least 200 years later than the creation of this site.|$|R
