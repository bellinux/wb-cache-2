500|$|The initial {{powerplant}} {{selected for}} the single-engined F-16 was the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 afterburning turbofan, {{a modified version of}} the F-15's F100-PW-100, rated at 23,830lbf (106.0kN) thrust. During testing, the engine was found to be prone to compressor stalls and [...] "rollbacks", wherein the engine's thrust would spontaneously reduce to idle. Until resolved, the Air Force ordered F-16s to be operated within [...] "dead-stick landing" [...] distance of its bases. It was the standard F-16 engine through the Block 25, except for new-build Block 15s with the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU). The OCU introduced the 23,770lbf (105.7kN) F100-PW-220, later installed on Block 32 and 42 aircraft: the main advance being a Digital <b>Electronic</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>Control</b> (DEEC) unit, which improved reliability and reduced stall occurrence.

2500|$|In 1981 Alfa Romeo {{developed}} {{in collaboration with}} the University of Genoa a semi-experimental Alfetta version, fitted with a modular variable displacement engine and an <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> unit. Called Alfetta CEM (Controllo Elettronico del Motore, or Electronic Engine Management), it was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The [...] 2.0-litre modular engine featured fuel injection and ignition systems governed by an engine control unit, which could shut off two of four cylinders as needed in order to reduce fuel consumption. An initial batch of ten examples were assigned to taxi drivers in Milan, to verify operation and performance in real-world situations. According to Alfa Romeo during these tests cylinder deactivation was found to reduce fuel consumption by 12% in comparison to a CEM fuel-injected engine without variable displacement, and almost by 25% in comparison to the regular production carburetted 2.0-litre. After the first trial, in 1983 a small series of 1000 examples was put on sale, offered to selected clients; 991 examples were produced. Despite this second experimental phase, the project had no further developments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine was}} {{developed}} from the 2.7litre 90Â° V6 'biturbo' used in the B5 S4. It displaced [...] and had five valves per cylinder. The parts code prefix was 078 and the identification codes were: early version, 2000 (EU2 compliant): ASJ, and later version, 2000-01 (to EU3 standard): AZR. [...] This engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). [...] It featured enlarged intake and smaller exhaust ports on the two Cosworth cast aluminium alloy ALSi7mg cylinder heads, two parallel BorgWarner K04-series turbochargers, two larger side-mounted intercoolers (SMICs), dished piston crowns, stronger connecting rods, larger intake ducting, enlarged exhaust system, and a re-calibrated engine management system. [...] The modifications increased the engine's output from [...] and [...] of torque in S4 form to [...] at 7,000revolutions per minute (rpm) and [...] at 6,000rpm. [...] The engine was controlled by a Bosch Motronic ME7.1 <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> unit (ECU), using a Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic drive by wire throttle. [...] The engine had multipoint sequential fuel injection, a MAF, six individual single-spark coils and NGK longlife spark plugs.

40|$|Abstract: Much {{progress}} has been made in the area of <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> since their introduction in the 1980 âs.

25|$|In the United States all {{motor vehicle}} {{gasoline}} is unleaded {{and is available}} in several grades with different octane rating; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. The maximum octane rating in California is generally 91. At high altitudes in the Mountain States and the Black Hills of South Dakota, regular unleaded can be as low as 85 octane; this practice is now increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> standard in recent decades.|$|R
2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, a {{year after}} Mitsubishi {{developed}} its own variable valve timing technology, the MIVEC-MD variant was introduced. The revived MD technology was now in its second generation with improved <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> enabling the switch from 4 to 2 cylinders to be made almost imperceptibly. In MD mode, the MIVEC engine utilizes only two of its four cylinders, which reduces significantly the energy wasted due to pumping losses. In addition, power loss due to engine friction is also reduced. Depending on conditions, the MIVEC-MD system can reduce fuel consumption by 10-20 percent; although some of this gain is from the variable valve timing system, not from the variable-displacement feature. Modulated Displacement was dropped around 1996.|$|R

50|$|The {{temperature}} of the cooling air may range from well below freezing to 50 Â°C. Further, while engines in long-haul boat or rail service may operate at a steady load, road vehicles often see widely varying and quickly varying load. Thus, the cooling system is designed to vary cooling so the engine is neither too hot nor too cold. Cooling system regulation includes adjustable baffles in the air flow (sometimes called 'shutters' and commonly run by a pneumatic 'shutterstat); a fan which operates either independently of the engine, such as an electric fan, or which has an adjustable clutch; a thermostatic valve or just 'thermostat' that can block the coolant flow when too cool. In addition, the motor, coolant, and heat exchanger have some heat capacity which smooths out temperature increase in short sprints. Some <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> shut down an engine or limit it to half throttle if it overheats. Modern <b>electronic</b> <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> adjust cooling based on throttle to anticipate a temperature rise, and limit engine power output to compensate for finite cooling.|$|R
