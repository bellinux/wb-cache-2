Often, these relationships are not easily spotted by search engines {{because they are not}} explicit. Still, when searching for content, users would certainly appreciate to receive results indicating all resources that are somehow related to their topic of interest without having to explicitly request for it.

In this chapter, Talageri alleges [...] "Professor Witzel inventing evidence, suppressing inconvenient data, following an inconsistent methodology, retrofitting data into pre-conceived notions, contradicting himself again and again, and using misleading language". Witzel later wrote a review of Talageri's book. He based it on Talageris' alleged ignorance of the long-established structure of the Rigveda (Oldenberg 1888, English 2003.

The {{aim of this study}} was to translate and assess the reliability and validity of the CAMPHOR for German-speaking populations. Methods Three main adaptation stages involved; translation (employing bilingual and lay panels), cognitive debriefing interviews with patients and validation (assessment of the adaptation’s psychometric properties). The psychometric evaluation included 107 patients with precapillary PH (60 females; age mean (standard deviation) 60 (15) years) from 3 centres in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Results No major problems were found with the translation process with most <b>items</b> easily <b>rendered</b> into acceptable German. Participants in the cognitive debriefing interviews found the questionnaires relevant, comprehensive and easy to complete. Psychometric analyses showed that the adaptation was successful. The three CAMPHOR scales (symptoms, activity limitations and quality of life) had excellent test-retest reliability correlations (Symptoms[*]=[*] 0. 91; Activity limitations[*]=[*] 0. 91; QoL[*]=[*] 0. 90) and internal consistency (Symptoms[*]=[*] 0. 94; Activity limitations[*]=[*] 0. 93; QoL[*]=[*] 0. 94). Predicted correlations with the Nottingham Health Profile provided evidence of the construct validity of the CAMPHOR scales.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] One of the {{suggestions}} {{made in the}} literature regarding older adults' episodic memory decline {{is that it is}} caused by their reduced ability to bind together components of an episode and retrieve the binding (termed an associative deficit). The purpose of the current research is to assess whether the age-related associative memory deficit is at least partially mediated by stereotype threat, which has been shown to negatively affect performance {{on a wide variety of}} cognitive tasks, including memory performance of older adults. To date the effects of stereotype threat on older adults' memory performance have only been shown using tests of item memory, and between subject manipulations. The question assessed in the current research is whether older adults' associative memory will be affected by stereotype threat more than <b>item</b> memory, <b>rendering</b> it one potential factor underlying the associative deficit. To answer this question, three experiments were conducted, which used an item-associative recognition memory paradigm while manipulating stereotype threat both within and between subjects. The first two experiments attempted to establish the baseline effect by directly comparing item and associative memory in younger and older adults under induced stereotype threat, reduced stereotype threat, and no stereotype threat (i. e. control) conditions. While a baseline age-related associative deficit was not shown in the control condition, inducing stereotype threat did have a significant negative effect on older adults' associative memory performance without affecting item memory performance [...] suggesting that stereotype threat does increase the age-related associative deficit. The third experiment further assessed the stage of processing [...] encoding, retrieval, or both [...] during which the effect of stereotype threat on older adults' memory occurs. Results showed that when stereotype threat was induced only at retrieval, memory performance was in line with performance with the reduced stereotype threat and control conditions, suggesting that this effect of stereotype threat occurs primarily during encoding of the information...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between working memory (WM) and attention {{is a highly}} interdependent one, with evidence that attention determines the state in which items in WM are retained. Through focusing of attention, an item might be held in a more prioritized state, commonly termed {{as the focus of}} attention (FOA). The remaining items, although still retrievable, are considered to be in a different representational state. One means to bring an item into the FOA is to use retrospective cues ("retro-cues") which direct attention to one of the objects retained in WM. Alternatively, an item can enter a privileged state once attention is directed towards it through bottom-up influences (e. g., recency effect) or by performing an action on one of the retained items ("incidental" cueing). In all these cases, the item in the FOA is recalled with better accuracy compared to the other items in WM. Far less is known {{about the nature of the}} other items in WM and whether they can be flexibly manipulated in and out of the FOA. We present data from three types of experiments as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to early visual cortex to manipulate the item inside FOA. Taken together, our results suggest that the context in which items are retained in WM matters. When an item remains behaviorally relevant, despite not being inside the FOA, re-focusing attention upon it can increase its recall precision. This suggests that a non-FOA item can be held in a state in which it can be later retrieved. However, if an <b>item</b> is <b>rendered</b> behaviorally unimportant because it is very unlikely to be probed, it cannot be brought back into the FOA, nor recalled with high precision. Under such conditions, some information appears to be irretrievably lost from WM. These findings, obtained from several different methods, demonstrate quite considerable flexibility with which items in WM can be represented depending upon context. They have important consequences for emerging state-dependent models of WM...|$|R
40|$|Everything {{around us}} is {{immersed}} in culture. Culture does not only entail values, norms and lifestyle patterns as merely symbolical or ideological entities specific {{to a particular}} society, but it also comprises artifacts, i. e. material goods produced by its members (Giddens 1994). Avid readers of genre fiction stemming from various countries and cultures have certainly come across such entities: they are usually names, objects or phenomena rooted in the source culture. Swedish popular fiction, for instance, opens a gateway to the world where many implicit and explicit references to Swedish culture are to be found. But how does one recognize what might be perceived as typical of a particular foreign culture? The {{answer to that question}} is relatively simple: an item could be considered culture-specific when it is brought into contact with another culture (cf. Franco Aixelá 1996). How these <b>items</b> are <b>rendered</b> in translation appears to be one of the greatest challenges literary translators may face in their professional careers. As intercultural mediators, translators play an indispensable role in constructing cultural identities since they are largely responsible for how the source culture is depicted in the target text. Hence, it is essential to examine items representative of a specific source culture in translations intended for other cultural markets. The primary objective of this study was to investigate potential similarities and differences in how culture-specific <b>items</b> were <b>rendered</b> in the English and Croatian translations of Jens Lapidus’ breakout novel Snabba Cash, as well as to identify the translation techniques and strategies employed. Although the topic of CSIs in general has hitherto been addressed by many influential scholars (Ivir 1987, Florin 1993, Franco Aixelá 1996, Pedersen 2007 etc.), there are very few relevant studies dealing with culture-specific items in translation from Swedish into English and/or Croatian (Grundler 2012, Takáč 2015). Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to contribute to this area of translation studies by offering fresh and helpful insights that could be used in further research of the phenomenon. Given that the novel about Stockholm’s underworld garnered great attention in Sweden, achieving remarkable success on the market, which swiftly turned Lapidus into a bestselling author on the well-established Swedish crime fiction scene, the choice of Snabba Cash as the primary research material is not particularly surprising. Although usually perceived as “low-brow” and “market-oriented” (Storm 2016 : 10), meaning they appeal to the widest range of consumers as they are produced, sold and translated very quickly and cheaply, crime novels make a vast majority of today’s translation production and, as such, may reveal more about the decision-making process than translations of “high-brow” literature (ibid.). Praised by critics, Lapidus’ approach to writing crime fiction differs from the traditional Swedish one: he portrays the world of criminals, gangs, and brats from their own perspectives, describing them as whole individuals made of flesh and blood. Three life stories are intertwined in the novel. Johan Westlund, a. k. a. JW, a student of economics, earns money by driving an illegal taxicab and selling cocaine in order to climb the social ladder and sneak into Stockholm’s upper-class social circles. Drug dealer Jorge Salinas Barrio, originally from Chile, is on the run from both the police and the Serbian mafia. Having escaped from the Österåker prison, his mind is set on fleeing the country as soon as possible. Lastly, Mrado Slovovic, a Serbian hatchet man, manages his boss Radovan’s money laundering business, while fantasizing about a good life for his daughter Lovisa and himself. What connects these three life stories to one another is, of course, a burning desire to earn easy money. Linguistically, this novel is even more enthralling, as Lapidus allows for a clash of different languages and writing styles: Rinkebysvenska vs. legal Swedish, journalistic writing vs. economics jargon (Lundberg 2006). In Snabba Cash, the dialogues between characters who come from an immigrant background are partially written in förortssvenska, a multiethnic variety of Swedish, which illustrates the darker side of Swedish society more realistically. Consequently, this study, though to a lesser extent, also provides preliminary findings on how various lexical, syntactic and pragmatic features characteristic of this specific linguistic variety can be transferred into English and Croatian. Widely spoken in the immigrant suburbs of large cities such as Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö, it clearly represents the values promoted by Sweden as a multicultural country, which makes the variety “equally Swedish” as any other culture-specific item. As suggested by Ulla-Britt Kotsinas (2005), it has never been easier to move long distances. We live in an era of globalization where state boundaries have been redrawn and large groups of people have been displaced. While many have abandoned their homelands for political and/or economic reasons, others have moved to new countries to seek adventures. As early as in the 1960 s, the first large wave of immigrants from Greece, Turkey, and the former Yugoslavia arrived in Sweden to enter the labor market. At first, they lived in industrial towns, but soon they moved to cities, eventually settling in the so-called “concrete ghettos”, i. e. suburban areas surrounding Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö built during the miljonprogrammet (“The Million Program”), a public housing program implemented in Sweden between 1965 and 1974. People from all corners of the world eventually came to live there. In the 1980 s, it became obvious that many young people who grew up in the immigrant, predominantly western, suburbs of Stockholm spoke a different variety of Swedish. Consequently, many people concluded that they did not speak “properly”, referring to the variety as “broken Swedish”. The suburban youth, however, took pride in how they spoke and named the variety rinkebysvenska after Rinkeby, a district in western Stockholm with a high concentration of people of immigrant ancestry, boasting about how broad their vocabulary was, as it comprised lexemes from many immigrant languages. Since the large-scale immigration into the Stockholm area during the 1970 s and 1980 s, other popular terms with geographical connotations, such as rosengårdska (Malmö) and gårdstenska (Gothenburg) have come into use. In addition, even terms carrying social connotations have emerged, e. g. miljonsvenska after miljonprogrammet, betongsvenska as a reference to the aforementioned “concrete ghettos” or blattesvenska, where blatte is used pejoratively to describe dark-skinned immigrants. In this respect, förortssvenska can be seen as a borderline case between a dialect and a sociolect. But there is a third possibility: the variety can be classified as a multiethnic socio-dialect (Bijvoet and Fraurud 2006), or a multiethnolect (Quist 2009). The reasoning behind such a terminology is clear: a multiethnolect denotes a linguistic variety that stems from a multiethnic community where speakers have many different native languages, but share one common, contact language. In the case of förortssvenska, this contact language is naturally a variety of Swedish that takes on the characteristics of the speakers’ native languages. The multiethnolect is distinguishable from the standard variety of Swedish with regard to several aspects such as phonology (pronunciation, word boundaries, prosodic features, and vowel length), morphosyntax (concord, the use of prepositions, word order), lexis (förortsslang) and pragmatics (discourse particles). As for culture-specific items, the research questions asked in the beginning were as follows: 1) What culture-specific items can be found in the novel and its translations into English and Croatian? 2) How did the translators <b>render</b> these culture-specific <b>items</b> in their respective translations? 3) Are there any substantial differences between the English and Croatian translations? 4) Which global translation strategies can be established in the translations? In accordance with previous research (Grundler 2012, Takáč 2015) and my own assumptions regarding culture-specific items in translations of popular literature, the following four hypotheses were formed: 1) Both the target culture and the target language influence how culture-specific <b>items</b> are <b>rendered</b> in translation. 2) How culture-specific <b>items</b> are <b>rendered</b> in translation depends on their type. 3) With respect to culture-specific items, the English translation is predominantly exoticized. 4) The Croatian translation is more educational than the novel’s English translation. The primary material for the analysis included the Swedish original, Snabba Cash (2006) and its respective translations into English, entitled Easy Money, and Croatian, under the name Laka lova. The novel was first translated for the American market in 2011 by Astri von Arbin Ahlander. The version examined in this paper is a mere republication of the American translation that was put on the British market in 2012 by the well-known publisher Pan Books. The Croatian publishing company V. B. Z. d. o. o. launched the novel in Danilo Brozović’s translation onto the Croatian market that same year. As the main objective of this study was to conduct an in-depth, comparative analysis of the novel and its respective translations into English and Croatian with a special emphasis on culture-specific items, I decided to look at the first hundred pages of the Swedish original, where many items surfaced for the first time. However, it seemed too demanding to carry out an analysis of all culture-specific items, as such approach would suggest going beyond the usual scope of a diploma thesis. The study was conducted in several steps. In the first step, the focus was|$|R

To accomplish this on the fresh side of the business, the organization procures and slaughters all of their own animals. The type of animal that Johnsonville Sausage procures is called a “fancy sow”. This type of sow averages 500 pounds and has had three or more litters of piglets. Johnsonville Sausage is the largest procurer {{of this type of}} sow accounting for 23 % of the overall market. The largest contributor to the finished product cost is the meat. Over the last two years, the organization’s business has been faced with a number of challenges related to mass liquidations within the hog industry as well as increased sow prices due to lower supplies. Specifically, these issues have impacted the expected profitability as an organization and lead Johnsonville Sausage to question whether the supply projections within the industry will meet future growth needs. Because of these factors, Johnsonville Sausage is looking at how they can create more value for the sow that is slaughtered in order to utilize the whole animal to its highest potential, increase overall profitability to the organization and increase available sow supply within the industry. Within the business today, 55 % of a sow that is harvested goes towards making the meat formulations (batter) utilized in fresh sausage production. The other 45 % of the sow can be broken down into three key areas: sales credits, drop credits and <b>rendering.</b> <b>Items</b> within these three areas are classified as by-products and are sold to industries such as human consumption, pet food, pharmaceutical, medical, academia, commercial fishing and rendering to name a few. The issue that Johnsonville Sausage faces is how to define new channels, create new products, and increase customer base and volume for those parts of the sow that are not utilized in fresh sausage production thus driving increased value for these by-product items. In conjunction with this, how do they create more profitability for those items that are consistently harvested and sold today? The focus of this research was to create a project portfolio for the by-product business within Johnsonville Sausage. The goal of the portfolio was to identify industries and projects that would drive the greatest profit maximization for the by-product business and in return achieve the greatest return per sow. To accomplish this, optimization models and net present value (NPV) analyses were utilized. Utilizing the tools, I found that within Johnsonville Sausage’s existing by-product business, they have the opportunity to increase profitability by 54 % from what was achieved in 2010. In conjunction with this, a NPV analysis on a further processed pork loin was conducted. Results of this analysis proved that creating this type of concept for Johnsonville Sausage was a more value added solution financially as compared to the traditional manner in which pork loins are sold today...|$|R
50|$|Oral {{account of}} Burtersett, July 1965: The hamlet of Burtersett or 'Butterside' {{came into being}} soon after the Norman Conquest of Britain. The area of land in Wensleydale west of Bainbridge was {{considered}} waste, but when William the Conqueror commissioned {{a survey of the}} land he had conquered, waste lands were classed as King's Forests. This large area including Raydalside was also King's Forest.Some years later the North side of this forest was given to the Abbot of Savigny in Normandy on condition he sent twelve monks to minister to the spiritual needs of the French soldiers stationed at Richmond. The rest of the area was policed by twelve foresters or gamekeepers. Two head foresters resided at Bainbridge and ten ordinary foresters settled in clearings up and down the Forest of Wensleydale. Each of these ten foresters had a side to patrol, they made clearings and fenced in certain land and made homes and farmsteads within the side they had to patrol. Butterside was one clearing; Apperside, Counterside, and Marside others. Other clearings were where no villages have grown such as Snaigside, Widdleside, Grayside and Raydalside.From such humble beginnings Burtersett developed but up to about 1800 it consisted of a few scattered farms, the most substantial being 'Hillary Hall' where John Hillary, an early convert of George Fox, resided. Sir Edmund Hillary, the New Zealand climber who was the first man to scale Mount Everest, is a direct descendant of John and Mary Hillary of Hillary Hall, Burtersett.In about 1860 suitable stone was found in the hills adjoining the village and quarries were opened. In the 1870s the railroad was extended to Hawes linking Wensleydale with the outside world and this gave a vigorous demand for this kind or stone. The lead mines in Swaledale were closing down and many Swaledale lead miners came to Burtersett in search of work. During the last 30 years of the nineteenth century the quarry owners built 17 new houses for their workers and restored others which had fallen into decay. The opening up of the quarries more than doubled the population of the village.In 1876 the Congregationalists built a Chapel for public worship and to be used on weekdays as a day school for the younger children. The older children went to Hawes Council School. A day school teacher was appointed.Methodism has been very strong amongst the lead miners in Swaledale and when they brought their families to Burtersett they soon saw the need for a Wesleyan Chapel for worship. In 1870 a small chapel was built and soon a very good choir was established. There was also a good choir at the lndependent chapel but the choirs always united for any special events at their respective chapels. These choirs were in constant demand as a United choir at many chapels in Wensleydale and sometimes in Swaledale if transport could be arranged. About 1904 the Wesleyan chapel was found to be too small for the congregation and it was extended and renovated.At this time the decline of the quarries came and many families had to leave Burtersett to find work. In 1912 devotional services were discontinued by the Congregationalists but the Sunday School continued well into the 1940s. Some of the old farms are still in use today. Middlegate farm dates back to 1663. Miss Florence Bone, the Authoress, lived at Fell View and was a Sunday School teacher for many years.From 1890 to 1914 a very vigorous United Band of Hope was being supported by the members of both denominations and a great day of the year was Whit Wednesday. Members of the Buttersett United Band of Hope joined with Hawes and Gayle at Hawes Town Foot and marched behind one of the two brass bands to Hardrow scaur. Here they were joined by Bands of Hope from Askrigg, Bainbridge, Marsett and sometimes Aysgarth and Carperby with their respective Brass Bands. Supporters came from Swaledale and the Eden Valley. Speeches were given and musical <b>items</b> were <b>rendered</b> by the choirs. The united crowd sang Temperance songs and Hymns. Games were arranged for the children and picnic teas were provided by the Band of Hope committee. The brass bands played selections throughout the afternoon and evening.In 1927 a Village Institute was formed in the Congregational Chapel. The {{men and women of the}} village formed a 'Black and White' Minstrel team and gave concerts. These were held in a loft over a stable in Lowgate, village dances were also hold there. Hot pie suppers and Mill suppers were also arranged. The village water taps are still to be seen, but as the years progressed the water was carried into the farms and houses. Today water is carried from the beck for two old cottages which are still occupied. The old candle mill is still to be seen - candles were made by William Metcalfe, who was called 'Candle Willie'. 14 to 16 candles weighed a pound and these cost 2½d. The candles were used up at the quarries and in the houses. Later paraffin lamps came into use. Hurricane lamps were used in the stables, home and chapels. Electricity was installed in 1951.The village shop dates back to about 1865. At one time there were two shops in Burtersett. 'Bump Knitting' with thick yarn was done by the women, they made stockings, jumpers and jackets. In the early dayes there was one public house but this had lost its licence before 1900. Nineteen Kits, 18 gallons of milk in each, were taken by float to Hawes then by train to Manchester. English was taught in the schools but mostly Yorkshire Dialect was spoken in the villages (wat thou doing with wishing, put it down in chair).An alteration was made in the Wesleyan chapel in 1935. A panel was taken out of the woodwork and made into a door, to enable coffins to be taken into the chapel for funerals.During the last 20 years many old families have died off, and many people have left the village. Sixteen houses have been sold for holiday homes, or for people to come to when they retire. The new population comes from Bradford, Doncaster, Middlesbrough, Ripon, Harrogate, down South and abroad.All the farms are occupied and doing well. Milk is now sent to Wensleydale Dairy where butter and cheese are made. The Burtersett Women's Institute was formed in 1952 and it is held in the Village Institute. The Women's Institute, with the help of the ladies in the village, hold a Christmas Party every year and every year children receive presents. In 1964 there were 33 children.The anniversary of the Church is held each year, also the Harvest Festival and sale. It will be the Centenary of the Church in five years' time.|$|R
40|$|My aim in {{this chapter}} is to outline some of the {{substantive}} and psychometric bases on which we can build a science of assessment that {{takes advantage of the}} enormous potential inherent in the digital computer and in artificial intelligence. Some of these foundations are within the traditions of classical assessment. But others represent urgently needed areas of explication and research. It is my view, in the tradition of Cronbach (1954), that developers of computer software for testing should listen to what psychometricians say, and, as well, psychometricians should be sensitive to new research ideas waiting to be solved that arise out of the experience of preparing software for test interpretation. This is particularly true because some of classical test theory based on fixed sets of <b>items</b> is <b>rendered</b> obsolete by the prospect of adaptive testing. The fact that psychometricians and authors of interpretive software are rarely prone to listen to one another brings to mind a quotation from the world-weary French novelist and philosopher, Andre Gide, cited by Block (1978) : 2 ̆ 2 It has all been said before, but you must say it again, since nobody listens. 2 ̆ 2 Some Preconditions for Valid Computer Assisted Test Interpretation Accurate test interpretations depend on valid data. Stated another way, the validity of the score data set an upper bound for the accuracy of test interpretations. This sounds like such a truism as to appear almost trivial. But surprisingly little attention has been directed at this issue by those who write and write about computer software for test interpretation. For example, in a recent book devoted to computer-based test interpretation (Butcher, 1987) there is scant attention directed at fundamental questions about the reliability of scores or indexes forming the bases for interpretations. I would like to outline five preconditions for valid computer-assisted test interpretations and to discuss each in turn. These preconditions point both to the traditional wisdom of testing that can be incorporated appropriately into thinking about test interpretations, and, as well, to areas of needed research. Let me list the five: (1) Interpretations should, in general, be built around constructs of broad import; (2) Interpretations should bear an explicit substantive relationship to the constructs underlying the measures employed; (3) Where predictions are made about specific behaviors, both the reliability of the assessment data and the reliability of the criterion to be predicted should be taken into account; (4) The implications of evaluative biases both in the assessment situation and in outcomes need to be given explicit attention; and (5) Attention needs to be directed to base rates, both in the assessment situation and in outcome situations. I would like to discuss each of these points in turn. The Usefulness of Personality Constructs With regard to the importance of theory-based constructs, I do not know whether I should say a great deal or very little. There is a substantial literature in personality and social judgment bearing on this topic. But there is an unfortunate tendency for psychologists to consider new areas such as computerized test interpretation in isolation as if little were to be gained from treating it {{as part of a larger}} assessment endeavor. But there is something to be learned from the knowledge and controversies of personality and assessment. One of the most controversial issues in the personality literature over the past two decades is the question of whether or not there are broad personality traits or dispositions. One of the strongest advocates of the position that there are not is Walter Mischel, who has argued forcefully that what appear to be broad behavioral consistencies are in fact illusory. The evidence proffered in support of this position and its implications for computerized assessment warrant careful examination. Mischel and Peake (1982) presented evidence that they believed failed to support the existence of broad traits of conscientiousness and friendliness. They intercorrelated behaviors purportedly representing each of these traits and interpreted mean intercorrelations of the order of. 13 as evidence indicative of doubt about the existence of broad traits. But their analyses and interpretations are illustrative of the sort of ad hoc theorizing that is tempting when constructing computerized-based test interpretation systems. Mischel and Peake merely assumed that certain behaviors were linked to the traits of conscientiousness and friendliness without providing any explicit bases in the form of definitions or classification rules for their categorization. Nor did they fully consider the importance of aggregating data prior to inferring broadly based personality dispositions. lackson and Paunonen (1985) undertook a reconceptualization and reanalysis of the Mischel and Peake data on conscientiousness, distinguishing separate dimensions of studiousness, punctuality, and academic diligence by conceptual and empirical means. We estimated reliabilities for 20 behaviors relevant to our reinterpreted dimensions of. 93,. 95, and. 86, respectively. A major import of these findings is that in drawing inferences about behavior from sample observations, the steps in construct validation (Jackson, 1971; Loevinger, 1957; Wiggins, 1973) do not only apply to tests, but apply equally to other formal and informal assessment situations, such as might be involved in combining behavioral 2 ̆ 2 signs 2 ̆ 2 in a computerized interpretation. The whole assessment procedure should be evaluated. A number of our conclusions (Jackson 2 ̆ 6 Paunonen, 1985) have special relevance to automated test interpretations. First, in drawing an inference about a respondent based on the magnitude of a score representing a trait or disposition, a crucial aspect of construct validation is the explicit definition of traits and of situations, including their theoretical and empirical implications, and their differentiation from other related traits. Second, the structure of behavioral representations of traits and of different situations should be evaluated in a multidimensional framework. For example, if the bases for linking predicted behaviors to scores on a test is expert clinical judgment, it would be fitting to provide expert judges with a set of construct-based trait definitions and to instruct them to perform a multidimensional scaling of these traits and a larger set of predicted behavioral exemplars. Third, a crucial step in the appraisal of the predictability of behavior is its evaluation in a multitraitmulti method context in which situations are also carefully defined and empirically studied. As an initial step in such an undertaking it is appropriate to employ scales or scores that possess appropriate levels of convergent and discriminant validity. If differential predictions are to be made on the basis of scale scores, or if profile shape is the basis for classification, it can be demonstrated that predictions or classifications will be more accurate if the constituent scales are minimally intercorrelated and discriminantly valid. This is often difficult to achieve because many measures of personality, particularly those of psychopathology, share a large common component reflecting general psychopathology or self-evaluation. The presence of such a large elevation component, while perhaps facilitating the classification of the person 2 ̆ 7 s results into a global category of psychopathology, militates against accuracy in differential prediction, for example, of specific manifestations of psychopathology. The simple implication of the foregoing is that good automated test interpretation systems depend on good tests, a point to which I shall return...|$|R
40|$|Automatic pattern mining from {{databases}} and {{the analysis of}} the discovered patterns for useful information are important and in great demand in science, engineering and business. Today, effective pattern mining methods, such as association rule mining and pattern discovery, have been developed and widely used in various challenging industrial and business applications. These methods attempt to uncover the valuable information trapped in large collections of raw data. The patterns revealed provide significant and useful information for decision makers. Paradoxically, pattern mining itself can produce such huge amounts of data that poses a new knowledge management problem: to tackle thousands or even more patterns discovered and held in a data set. Unlike raw data, patterns often overlap, entangle and interrelate {{to each other in the}} databases. The relationship among them is usually complex and the notion of distance between them is difficult to qualify and quantify. Such phenomena pose great challenges to the existing data mining discipline. In this thesis, the analysis of patterns after their discovery by existing pattern mining methods is referred to as pattern post-analysis since the patterns to be analyzed are first discovered. Due to the overwhelmingly huge volume of discovered patterns in pattern mining, it is virtually impossible for a human user to manually analyze them. Thus, the valuable trapped information in the data is shifted to a large collection of patterns. Hence, to automatically analyze the patterns discovered and present the results in a user-friendly manner such as pattern post-analysis is badly needed. This thesis attempts to solve the problems listed below. It addresses 1) the important factors contributing to the interrelating relationship among patterns and hence more accurate measurements of distances between them; 2) the objective pruning of redundant patterns from the discovered patterns; 3) the objective clustering of the patterns into coherent pattern clusters for better organization; 4) the automatic summarization of each pattern cluster for human interpretation; and 5) the application of pattern post-analysis to large database analysis and data mining. In this thesis, the conceptualization, theoretical formulation, algorithm design and system development of pattern post-analysis of categorical or discrete-valued data is presented. It starts with presenting a natural dual relationship between patterns and data. The relationship furnishes an explicit one-to-one correspondence between a pattern and its associated data and provides a base for an effective analysis of patterns by relating them back to the data. It then discusses the important factors that differentiate patterns and formulates the notion of distances among patterns using a formal graphical approach. To accurately measure the distances between patterns and their associated data, both the samples and the attributes matched by the patterns are considered. To achieve this, the distance measure between patterns has to account for the differences of their associated data clusters at the attribute value (i. e. item) level. Furthermore, to capture the degree of variation of the items matched by patterns, entropy-based distance measures are developed. It attempts to quantify the uncertainty of the matched <b>items.</b> Such distances <b>render</b> an accurate and robust distance measurement between patterns and their associated data. To understand the properties and behaviors of the new distance measures, the mathematical relation between the new distances and the existing sample-matching distances is analytically derived. The new pattern distances based on the dual pattern-data relationship and their related concepts are used and adapted to pattern pruning, pattern clustering and pattern summarization to furnish an integrated, flexible and generic framework for pattern post-analysis which is able to meet the challenges of today’s complex real-world problems. In pattern pruning, the system defines the amount of redundancy of a pattern with respect to another pattern at the item level. Such definition generalizes the classical closed itemset pruning and maximal itemset pruning which define redundancy at the sample level. A new generalized itemset pruning method is developed using the new definition. It includes the closed and maximal itemsets as two extreme special cases and provides a control parameter for the user to adjust the tradeoff between the number of patterns being pruned and the amount of information loss after pruning. The mathematical relation between the proposed generalized itemsets and the existing closed and maximal itemsets are also given. In pattern clustering, a dual clustering method, known as simultaneous pattern and data clustering, is developed using two common yet very different types of clustering algorithms: hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. Hierarchical clustering generates the entire clustering hierarchy but it is slow and not scalable. K-means clustering produces only a partition so it is fast and scalable. They can be used to handle most real-world situations (i. e. speed and clustering quality). The new clustering method is able to simultaneously cluster patterns as well as their associated data while maintaining an explicit pattern-data relationship. Such relationship enables subsequent analysis of individual pattern clusters through their associated data clusters. One important analysis on a pattern cluster is pattern summarization. In pattern summarization, to summarize each pattern cluster, a subset of the representative patterns will be selected for the cluster. Again, the system measures how representative a pattern is at the item level and takes into account how the patterns overlap each other. The proposed method, called AreaCover, is extended from the well-known RuleCover algorithm. The relationship between the two methods is given. AreaCover is less prone to yield large, trivial patterns (large patterns may cause summary that is too general and not informative enough), and the resulting summary is more concise (with less duplicated attribute values among summary patterns) and more informative (describing more attribute values in the cluster and have longer summary patterns). The thesis also covers the implementation of the major ideas outlined in the pattern post-analysis framework in an integrated software system. It ends with a discussion on the experimental results of pattern post-analysis on both synthetic and real-world benchmark data. Compared with the existing systems, the new methodology that this thesis presents stands out, possessing significant and superior characteristics in pattern post-analysis and decision support...|$|R
