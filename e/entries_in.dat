5|$|In 2009, {{the station}} had 27,004 entries, making the station among the system's least-used. This {{amounted}} to only 52 boardings per weekday in 2009, representing a 71.6 percent decrease from the station's 1990 ridership.

The increase in ridership at the station and the nearby Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station since 2010 {{has been attributed to}} the end of off-track betting at the racetrack in 2010, and the opening of the casino in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Matrices do {{not always}} have all their <b>entries</b> <b>in</b> the same ring– or even in any ring at all.

40|$|In a {{successive}} Cournot oligopoly, we {{show the}} welfare effects of <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the final goods market with no scale economies but with cost {{difference between the}} firms. If the input market is very concentrated, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the final goods market always increases welfare. If the input market is moderately concentrated, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the final goods market reduces welfare if the entrant is moderately cost inefficient than the incumbents. If the input market is highly competitive, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the final goods market reduces welfare if the entrant is very much cost inefficient than the incumbents. Hence, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> the final goods market is more desirable under a concentrated input market. It follows from our analysis that entry increases the profits of the incumbent final goods producers if their marginal costs are sufficiently lower than the entrant’s marginal cost.
