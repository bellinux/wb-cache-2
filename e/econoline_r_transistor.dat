40|$|Abstract. A {{low-power}} 1 Kb {{phase change}} {{random access memory}} (PCRAM) chip is designed. The chip uses 1 T 1 <b>R</b> (one <b>transistor</b> one resistor) structure and titanium nitride (TiN) bottom electrode (BE) for reducing power consumption. Besides, the write property of the chip is improved by employing a ramp down pulse generator. The chip is fabricated in 130 nm CMOS standard technology. The test result shows a 56 % power reduction based on TiN BE compared with tungsten (W) BE, which predicts a new direction to realize the commercialization of PCRAM...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{its high}} carrier {{mobility}} and saturation velocity, graphene has attracted enormous attention in recent years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In particular, high-performance graphene <b>transistors</b> for radio-frequency (<b>r.</b> f.) applications are of great interest 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Synthesis of large-scale graphene sheets of high quality and at low cost has been demonstrated using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods 14. However, very {{few studies have been}} performed on the scaling behaviour of transistors made from CVD graphene for r. f. applications, which hold great potential for commercialization. Here we report the systematic study of top-gated CVD-graphene <b>r.</b> f. <b>transistors</b> with gate lengths scaled down to 40 [*]nm, the shortest gate length demonstrated on graphene r. f. devices. The CVD graphene was grown on copper film and transferred to a wafer of diamond-like carbon. Cut-off frequencies as high as 155 [*]GHz have been obtained for the 40 -nm transistors, and the cut-off frequency was found to scale as 1 /(gate length). Furthermore, we studied graphene <b>r.</b> f. <b>transistors</b> at cryogenic temperatures. Unlike conventional semiconductor devices where low-temperature performance is hampered by carrier freeze-out effects, the r. f. performance of our graphene devices exhibits little temperature dependence down to 4. 3 [*]K, providing a much larger operation window than is available for conventional devices...|$|R

30|$|The {{transistors}} M 1, M 2, M 3, M 4, M 5, M 6, M 7, M 8, M 9, M 10, M 11 and M 12 {{represent the}} function (a’b’) XOR c i.e. the function P. The transistors M 14, M 15, M 16 and M 17 represent {{the function of}} inverter i.e. the function <b>R.</b> The <b>transistors</b> M 26, M 27, M 28, M 29, M 30, M 31, M 32 and M 33 represent the function a XOR b i.e. the function Q. Thus, a total of 24 transistors are required to implement the Reversible Gate 2 using adiabatic logic. The average amount of power dissipated by the proposed implementation at a frequency of 50  MHz is 113  mW while the same implementation using CMOS GDI logic dissipates a power of 40  W at 50  MHz.|$|R
5000|$|The Thing is {{mentioned}} in the Hawkwind bio book 'Space Daze' [...] {{and also in the}} book about the John Peel Sessions. When they first formed in the mid 1980s, {{they were part of the}} thriving NYC Noise Rock art scene (Live Skull, Unsane, Sonic Youth, White Zombie, Angel Rot, etc.), later morphing into a more progressive acid rock sounding band over the years. The Thing are written about in various rock history books as being one of the very first bands from the 1980s to emerge from the Noise Rock scene to develop the a musical style later known as Stoner Rock. Originally the band called their music [...] "Psychedelic Punk" [...] and later [...] "Acid Core". The Thing were doing a different type of post-punk music, while most bands at the time were still doing either Cro-mags / Agnostic Front styled hardcore punk or Sonic Youth influenced experimental/weird music. The Thing mixed no wave noise, acid rock, metal, 70s rock, psychedelic, progressive rock, and Gothic Rock. In the last decade or so, it has become known as STONER ROCK. A year or two after they started playing live, fellow NJ artists Monster Magnet (and NY bands: Bench, Blood Farmers, Hed, and others) also began playing a similar style of music, which later influenced Kyuss (leading to Fu Manchu and Queens of the Stone Age). Groups such as White Zombie and Tool also later became very popular as they went on to further develop a sound that The Thing had helped develop. Even one of My Bloody Valentine 's guitarists cited The Thing's [...] "texture guitar" [...] as a major influence, after meeting The Thing guitarist, Sal Canzonieri. Their live shows were attended by many well known bands, such as The Pixies (who wrote a song about hearing their music called [...] "The Thing", which they released on the album Complete 'B' Sides), Lemmy from Motorhead, Milk, Th' Faith Healers, Silverfish, and Von Lmo (The Thing guitarist Sal Canzonieri later played with Von Lmo in an updated version of <b>Red</b> <b>Transistor),</b> and others. The Thing opened for Happy Mondays at CBGB and outdrew them. The show featured many special effects that were later used by bands such as White Zombie.|$|R
50|$|Red, {{a famous}} singer {{in a city}} called Cloudbank, is {{attacked}} by the Process, a robotic force commanded by {{a group called the}} Camerata. She manages to escape and comes into possession of the mysterious Transistor—the great sword-like weapon she was to be assassinated with. The Transistor is buried into the chest of a man, now slumped over and dead; though his consciousness and voice seem to have been absorbed into the Transistor itself along with Red's voice. The Camerata continue to track <b>Red</b> and the <b>Transistor</b> down with the Process, wanting the weapon for some yet-unknown cause.|$|R
50|$|The game {{opens with}} the player character, Red, {{kneeling}} {{by the body}} of an unknown {{man who has been}} killed with a glowing great sword—the titular <b>Transistor.</b> <b>Red</b> is a singer, and the attack which killed the man has also stolen her voice, sealing it inside the Transistor. The dead man's consciousness has also been absorbed into the sword, and through it, he is able to speak to Red and act as the game's narrator. As Red makes her way out of the district in which the game starts, she comes into conflict with an army of robotic intelligence known as the Process.|$|R
2500|$|Figure3 shows a bipolar {{current mirror}} with emitter {{resistors}} {{to increase its}} output resistance.. That is, the resistors RE cause negative feedback that opposes change in current. In particular, any change in output voltage results in less change in current than without this feedback, which means the output resistance of the mirror has increased. [...] Transistor Q1 is diode connected, {{which is to say}} its collector-base voltage is zero. Figure4 shows the small-signal circuit equivalent to Figure3. Transistor Q1 is represented by its emitter resistance rE ≈ VT/IE (VT = thermal voltage, IE = Q-point emitter current), a simplification made possible because the dependent current source in the hybrid-pi model for Q1 draws the same current as a resistor 1/gm connected across <b>r.</b> The second <b>transistor</b> Q2 is represented by its hybrid-pi model. Table 1 below shows the z-parameter expressions that make the z-equivalent circuit of Figure2 electrically equivalent to the small-signal circuit of Figure4.|$|R
5000|$|As Red {{enters the}} Highrise district, the Process becomes more {{aggressive}} in their actions, attacking the entire city; {{this leads to the}} Process becoming public knowledge. Asher Kendrell, another member of the Camerata, publicly apologizes for the Camerata's actions and reveals their involvement in the Process invasion, {{going so far as to}} contact and apologize to Red for all that the Camerata has done to her, the mysterious man in the Transistor, and the dozens of other influential figures who have been Processed and destroyed. It becomes apparent that the Camerata are no longer in control of the Process, and that the current situation is very different from their intended vision. After fighting past numerous Process enemies, including a massive creature referred to as the [...] "Spine" [...] whose mere presence severely affects the man in the <b>Transistor,</b> <b>Red</b> reaches the hideout of the Camerata in Bracket Towers only to find that Grant and Asher have committed suicide.|$|R

5000|$|Red {{makes her}} way to her former {{performance}} stage, in Cloudbank's Goldwalk district, where it is revealed that the Process is being controlled by the Camerata, a sinister group of high-ranking officials. They {{were the ones who}} attacked Red, though the attack was thwarted when the man in the Transistor stepped in front of the blow. As Red travels, she discovers several Cloudbank citizens who have been [...] "integrated" [...] by the Process and absorbs their trace data into the Transistor, expanding the weapon's functionality. Upon reaching the stage where she performed that night, Red encounters Sybil Reisz, the Camerata member who had befriended her before the assassination attempt, in a corrupted Process-like form. It is revealed that Sybil was in love with Red, and that she arranged for the attack in an attempt to cause the man's death and have Red to herself. After defeating Sybil and absorbing her consciousness into the <b>Transistor,</b> <b>Red</b> uses Sybil's knowledge of the Camerata to locate their leader—one of the administrators of Cloudbank, Grant Kendrell.|$|R
5000|$|After resolving to {{hunt down}} the final member of the Camerata, Royce Bracket, and then escape the city, Red and her {{companion}} find themselves traveling back through the starting portion of the game which has now been [...] "Processed" [...] into a blocky, white facsimile of its original form. Upon reaching {{the starting point of}} the game, Royce approaches Red through a robotic proxy and offers a truce {{in order for them to}} work together to stop the Process. Royce reveals that the Transistor is a [...] "remote-control" [...] to manipulate the changing landscape and environment of Cloudbank. It is the central part of the apparatus used by the city's administrators, including the late Grant, to change the city to fit the whims of the people. After fighting through the completely Processed district of Fairview, in which the Process has evolved a humanoid form and the laws of physics only loosely apply, Red arrives at the Cradle, the system that the Transistor powers in order to manipulate the Process—which is suggested to be an integral part of the system to rearrange and change Cloudbank—and stop the invasion. After <b>Red</b> places the <b>Transistor</b> in the Cradle, she and Royce are absorbed into it. In the Transistor's virtual realm, now armed with a Transistor of his own, Royce informs Red that only one of them can escape back to Cloudbank and repair the city. He apologizes to Red for this and the two clash.|$|R
