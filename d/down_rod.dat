The backing band on the album also {{included}} Ron Wood, Ian McLagan, Keith Emerson, and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer). Waller's relationship with Stewart and Wood served him well, as he {{would go on to}} join them on the next Stewart album, Every Picture Tells a Story. The coupling meant that Waller played percussion on Stewart's transatlantic chart topping hit single, [...] "Maggie May".|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{different}} animal models, photoreceptor degeneration {{was correlated}} to an abnormal increase in cGMP concentration. The cGMP-induced photoreceptor toxicity was demonstrated {{by applying the}} phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine on retinal explants. To assess the role of cGMP-gated channels in this cGMP toxicity, the Ca(2 +) channel blockers verapamil and L- and D-diltiazem, which block cGMP-gated channels with different efficacies, were applied to in vitro animal models of photoreceptor degeneration. These models included: (i) adult rat retinal explants incubated with zaprinast, a more specific inhibitor of the rod phosphodiesterase than 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine and (ii) rd mouse retinal explants. Photoreceptor apoptosis was assessed by terminal dUTP nick end labelling and caspase 3 activation. Effects of the blockers on the synaptic rod Ca(2 +) channels were measured by patch-clamp recording. In the zaprinast-induced photoreceptor degeneration model, both diltiazem isomers rescued photoreceptors whereas verapamil had no influence. Their neuroprotective efficacy was correlated to their inhibition of cGMP-gated channels (l-diltiazem>d-diltiazem>verapamil= 0). In contrast, all three Ca(2 +) channel blockers suppressed rod Ca(2 +) channel currents similarly. This suppression of the currents by the diltiazem isomers was very weak (16. 5 %) at the neuroprotective concentration (10 microm). In rd retinal explants, both diltiazem isomers also slowed <b>down</b> <b>rod</b> degeneration in contrast to verapamil. L-diltiazem exhibited this effect at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 microm. This study further supports the photoreceptor neuroprotection by diltiazem particularly in the rd mouse retina, whereas the absence of neuroprotection by verapamil further suggests the role of cGMP-gated channel activation in the induction of photoreceptor degeneration...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alcohol-related driving {{accidents}} and fatalities occur most frequently at nighttime and at dawn, that is, a mesopic lighting {{condition in which}} visual processing depends on both rod and cone photoreceptors. The temporal functions of the rod and cone pathways are critical for driving in this lighting condition. However, how alcohol influences the temporal functions in the rod and cone pathways at mesopic light levels is inconclusive. To address this, this study investigated whether an acute intoxicating dose of alcohol impairs rod- and/or cone-mediated critical fusion frequency (CFF; the lowest frequency of which an intermittent or flickering light stimulus is perceived as steady). Methods: In Experiment I, we measured the CFFs for 3 types of visual stimuli (rod stimulus alone, cone stimulus alone, and the mixture of both stimuli types), under 3 illuminant light levels (dim illumi-nance: 2 Td; low illuminance: 20 Td; and medium illuminance: 80 Td) in moderate–heavy social drin-kers before and after they consumed an intoxicating dose of alcohol (0. 8 g/kg) compared with a placebo beverage. In Experiment II, we examined whether the illuminance level (dark vs. light) of the visual area surrounding the test stimuli alters alcohol’s effect on the temporal processing of rods and cones. Results: The results showed that compared with placebo, alcohol significantly reduced CFFs of all stimulus types at all illuminance levels. Furthermore, alcohol intoxication produced a larger impairment on rod-pathway-mediated CFFs under light versus dark surround. Conclusions: These results indicate that alcohol intake slows <b>down</b> <b>rod</b> and cone-pathway-mediated temporal processing. Further research may elucidate whether this effect {{may play a role}} in alcohol-re-lated injury and accidents, which often occur under low-light conditions...|$|E

40|$|The stress {{concentrations}} arising in the fillets of fan and turbine blades, tie <b>down</b> <b>rods,</b> and bolt heads from axially symmetric centrifugal or {{static force}} loadings are treated two dimensionally by photoelastic and theoretical methods. The {{effects of the}} fillet radius, {{the height of the}} base, the mode of application of retention forces, and the distance between the retention reactions and fillet tangencies are considered. The stress concentration factor, K, was found to increase with decreasing radius and decreasing base height and, for small radii, to decrease at first with the distance between the reaction and fillet tangency but, in general, to increase with this distance. Comparisons with other experiments and stress concentration configurations are also made. An approximate theoretical solution is derived by selecting a convenient region from the whole base and replacing, where necessary, the exact boundary conditions with relaxed or integral conditions. The problem is formulated in terms of the classical Airy stress function. Agreement between theory and experiment is reasonable...|$|R
