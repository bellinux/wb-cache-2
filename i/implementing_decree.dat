5000|$|In March 2005 the {{government}} issued an <b>implementing</b> <b>decree</b> (Decree 22) that provided further guidance on the Ordinance on Religion and Belief. Like the ordinance, the decree explicitly bans forced renunciations of faith. It also delineates specific procedures by which an unrecognized religious organization can register its places of worship, its clerics, and its activities and thus operate openly. It further provides procedures for these groups {{to apply for}} official recognition from {{the government}} to gain additional rights. The decree specifies that a religious organization must have 20 years of [...] "stable religious operation" [...] {{in the country in}} order to be recognized by the government. It also states that past operation in the country can be counted toward this requirement. The decree further sets out specific time periods for the government to consider requests from religious organizations and requires officials to give organizations an explanation in writing for any application that is rejected.|$|E
50|$|<b>Implementing</b> <b>Decree</b> 22 also clarifies the {{procedures}} through which religious organizations and individual religious congregations can seek official recognition. Recognized religious denominations, in principle, {{are allowed to}} open, operate, and refurbish places of worship, train religious leaders, and obtain permission for the publication of materials. To obtain official recognition, a denomination must first receive national-level registration. According to the legal framework, a religious organization must pass through three legal stages to receive national-level registration. First, it must apply for and receive registration in each local administrative area in which it operates. Registration requires a congregation to file information with relevant provincial authorities about its structure, leadership, and activities. Authorities then have 45 days to raise questions or concerns. National-level registrations have a 60-day consideration period. The CRA must issue a license before an organization is considered registered. Once a congregation is registered at the local level, it can apply for provincial and then national-level registration. Following a minimum 1-year waiting period, the eligible organization can apply for recognition and must receive Government approval of its leadership, its structure, and the overall scope of its activities.|$|E

The 2006 law paved the way for hitting recalcitrant companies with financial penalties, as set out in an article in the 2009 law on pensions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{issue of}} brownfields is {{currently}} a very significant factor affecting the sustainable development of the society and construction business themselves since unbuilt areas are ranked amongst the most important non-renewable sources. Despite of this undoubted significance of the topic, brownfields are hitherto not adequately supported by the Czech legislation. Due to this fact, there exists no uniform and consistent terminology and classification of this business in the Czech Republic; opinions and research approaches of various scientific and research teams are highly fragmented, and {{last but not least}} it makes education with respect to this topic of the expert community as well as general public very difficult. Currently, brownfields are discussed within land-use planning and laws and implementing Decrees (Act no. 183 / 2006 Coll., the Building Act, and its <b>implementing</b> <b>Decree</b> no. 500 / 2006 Coll.) only in general terms, and they can only be included in more general categories such as “areas for redevelopment and reuse” (brownfields intended for revitalization to the level of “environment close to nature” cannot be included), or in some cases there are very specific categories such as “pit-heap, dump, stock-pile, etc. ” (future land for regeneration / redevelopment) or “old burdens and contaminated areas” (brownfields without burden and contamination cannot be included).

40|$|This chapter covers {{parts of}} Asia where {{there have been}} very {{significant}} recent developments in intellectual property (IP) law.

The developments in the individual countries are discussed {{in the context of an}} “Asian development model,” which has often combined short and generalized laws with numerous <b>implementing</b> <b>decrees</b> and administrative discretion. This has allowed for the selective adaptation of IP models from elsewhere, with some countries now strongly promoting higher IP standards to their regional neighbors. However, different historical pathways to development and local circumstances suggest that it is difficult to develop regional role models for others or to explain differences about IP exclusively with the divide between “developed” and “developing” countries...|$|R

This {{is the first}} framework law on pastoralism ever voted in Burkina Faso. The <b>implementing</b> <b>decrees</b> of this act were adopted {{five years after the}} law was passed. Several types of pastoral areas (village grazing land, forests, fallow fields, fields after harvest, stock routes, etc.) and rights of access to water and crop residues are guaranteed by the state and by the local community who are held responsible for the protection of these resources. Herd mobility is also recognized by the law. However, it is channelled in stock routes and hindered by a compulsory transhumance certificate. In practice, the law is not applied. The state fails to protect rangelands and regional stock routes from the extension of cropland by surrounding farmers or migrants, which jeopardizes the mobile herders’ territorialities as confirmed by two pieces of evidence we collected during our field survey.|$|R
