By then, many of Iraq's ashraf had accepted Umayyad sovereignty, and following the Umayyad victory in the Battle of Maskin, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> Mus'ab and Ibn al-Ashtar were slain, Umayyad rule in Iraq was reestablished.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E

Waiting for Rivoli was the British HMS Victorious, commanded by John Talbot, who chased Rivoli and captured her in a four-hour battle <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> sides suffered heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Gould {{was first}} capped for Wales against England {{in the opening}} game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. He joined his brother Bob in the side, and played at fullback, his {{preferred}} position at the time. Played under the captaincy of Newport team-mate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.|$|E

5|$|Jennings slowly {{began to}} chip away at Rutter's record, first by winning $714.29 in 2006 {{as part of the}} Mob on NBC's 1 vs. 100. A year later, Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the $100,000 top prize by {{defeating}} Ogi Ogas in the final round. Finally, on October 10, 2008, Jennings passed Rutter by winning $500,000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. He extended the record by winning $300,000 in The IBM Challenge, where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy! event. Rutter won $200,000 in the challenge, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity.

United secured top spot in the group with a 2–1 win at home to Sporting in their fifth game. They travelled to Roma for the final group game, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> teams were already guaranteed to progress; it finished as a 1–1 draw, with Gerard Piqué scoring his second goal for the club before Mancini's equaliser. United finished with 16 points, the most of all the group winners.|$|E

This resulted in a melee <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing to control their players.

After the match, Punk proceeded to deliver his finisher, the Go To Sleep, on Burke and sarcastically apologized before leaving the ring alone, becoming a fan favorite again. At Judgment Day, Punk defeated Burke in his first singles match on a pay-per-view. Punk then went on to One Night Stand and teamed up with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in a tables match to defeat the New Breed.|$|E

5|$|Promiscuity, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> {{males and}} females mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel, the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E

They develop a friendship <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} the leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, {{assigning}} portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet. While the Liberal-Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in Corio in Victoria, and later that year in Capricornia (Queensland). The November half-Senate election saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year. These federal victories, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>both</b> Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms.|$|E
