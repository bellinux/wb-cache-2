Fernando Alonso failed {{to make it into}} Q3, the seventh time that season.

Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in 14th place, meaning that he - like Button - was unable to take the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> his ten-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches.

The doctor was astounded that Dominguez was still playing football as X-rays and MRI scans revealed that he had three herniated disks and further complications in his spinal canal.

His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E

5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a {{saprophytic}} fungus that fruits singly or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch.

It was the most {{expensive}} road construction project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now £).

5|$|The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> {{occupation}} and {{activity in the}} Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period. It is known {{that there was a}} moderate occupation of the area during the Early Postclassic period, between AD 1000 and AD 1250. Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San José and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.|$|E

5|$|The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the {{clitoris}} was {{alluded to}} by Masters and Johnson in 1966, but {{in such a}} muddled fashion that the significance of their description became obscured; in 1981, the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Clinics (FFWHC) continued this process with anatomically precise illustrations identifying 18 structures of the clitoris. Despite the FFWHC's illustrations, Josephine Lowndes Sevely, in 1987, described the vagina as more of the counterpart of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a {{moderate}} tornado outbreak spawned by the cyclone's outer bands. The event spanned August26–31, 2005, with 57tornadoes touching down across 8states. One person died and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central Mississippi to Pennsylvania, with Georgia sustaining record monetary damage {{for the month}} of August. Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain. Furthermore, an indeterminate number of waterspouts likely formed throughout the life cycle of Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the required federal appropriations became clear.

Essai de solution pratique (The Labour Problem in the Dutch Yeast and Alcohol Factory.

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was eliminated due to a failure in communication, which meant he did not have enough time left for another fast lap {{at the end of the}} session. With the track still damp when qualifying began, times improved with every passing lap, with the drivers being able to switch from intermediate to slick tyres at the end of the first session. While the two Manor drivers once again qualified at the end of the grid, Jenson Button was also eliminated in Q1, leaving him with time penalties in the race, not being able to take the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> his 25-place grid penalty.|$|E

5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the original gospel is unknown; {{according to a}} list of canonical and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E

Part of the cave system opened as a show cave in 1927 following exploratory work by Herbert E. Balch.

The cave is noted for the Witch of Wookey Hole– a roughly human shaped stalagmite that legend says is a witch turned to stone by a monk from Glastonbury. It has also been used as a location for film and television productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{state and}} federal governments also had {{conflicts}} on the economic front.

In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the <b>full</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists.
