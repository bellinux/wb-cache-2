6000|$|Then, {{when all}} was done, {{while we were}} still {{standing}} silently around, it came into Mr. Trigg's mind to improve the occasion. Assuming his schoolroom expression he looked round at us and said solemnly: [...] "That's the end. Every dog has his day and so has every man; and the end {{is the same for}} both. We die like old Caesar, and are put into the ground and have the <b>earth</b> <b>shovelled</b> over us." ...|$|R
60|$|About noon {{that day}} old Caesar, dead and stiff, {{was taken by}} one of the workmen to a green open spot among the old peach trees, where his grave had already been dug. We {{followed}} our schoolmaster and watched while the body was lowered and the red <b>earth</b> <b>shovelled</b> in. The grave was deep, and Mr. Trigg assisted in filling it, puffing very much over the task and stopping at intervals to mop his face with his coloured cotton handkerchief.|$|R
50|$|At another time, while meditating on {{the banks}} of the Cauvery river, he was carried away by a sudden flood. Weeks later, when some villagers were digging near a mound of <b>earth,</b> their <b>shovels</b> struck his body. He woke up and walked away.|$|R
60|$|The others saw the cunning of the suggestion, and so {{the trench}} was {{lengthened}} to accommodate the corpse, {{and in the center}} a deeper hole was excavated for the box, which was first wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place, which brought its top about a foot below the bottom of the grave. <b>Earth</b> was <b>shovelled</b> in and tramped down about the chest until the bottom of the grave showed level and uniform.|$|R
6000|$|Had it {{not been}} for the thought of Paquíta waiting for me over there in Montevideo, I could have said, [...] "O good friend Sweet Potato, and good friends all, let me remain for ever with you under this roof, sharing your simple pleasures, and, wishing for nothing better, forget that great crowded world where all men are striving to conquer Nature and death and to win fortune; until, having wasted their miserable lives in their vain endeavours, they drop down and the <b>earth</b> is <b>shovelled</b> over them!" ...|$|R
5000|$|A cut scene {{shows the}} {{kidnapper}} (as yet unidentified) placing an unconscious Nick in a Plexiglas coffin, throwing in his loaded service pistol, {{a set of}} glow sticks—one already lit—and a dictaphone. The coffin lid closes and <b>earth</b> is <b>shovelled</b> on top of it. Grissom and the team review: there was no trace on the coffee cup or the evidence bag, although there was ether on a white fiber present on Nick's stab vest. In the corridor, Hodges grapples with a delivery man, who had just delivered a package marked [...] "RE: Stokes." [...] Grissom hurries into the layout room, carrying the package.|$|R
60|$|But {{where were}} my labours to end? The {{want of a}} plough {{to turn up the}} <b>earth,</b> or <b>shovel</b> to dig it, I conquered by making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow I {{supplied}} myself, with dragging over the corn a great bough of a tree. When it was growing I was forced to fence it; when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrash it, part it from the chaff, and save it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind it, sieve to dress it, yest and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work to find some expedient for every one of these necessaries against the next harvest.|$|R
6000|$|Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, {{the gate}} is [...] passed, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the [...] hearse uncloses, The coffin is passed out, lowered, and settled, the whip is {{laid on the}} [...] coffin, the <b>earth</b> is swiftly <b>shovelled</b> in, The mound above is {{flattened}} with the spades--silence, A minute, no one moves or speaks--it is done, He is decently put away--is there anything more? ...|$|R
60|$|The child remained, {{for some}} minutes, {{watching}} the deaf old {{man as he}} threw out the <b>earth</b> with his <b>shovel,</b> and, often stopping to cough and fetch his breath, still muttered to himself, {{with a kind of}} sober chuckle, that the sexton was wearing fast. At length she turned away, and walking thoughtfully through the churchyard, came unexpectedly upon the schoolmaster, who was sitting on a green grave in the sun, reading.|$|R
60|$|While {{the meal}} was being cooked the British and Punjaub dead were carried out {{to the spot where}} the grave had been dug. The troops had a hearty meal, and then marched out from the village. They were drawn up round the graves, and the bodies were laid reverently in them. Captain Mallett said a few words over them; the <b>earth</b> was then <b>shovelled</b> in and levelled, and the troops marched to a wood a mile distant, where they halted until {{the heat of the day}} was over. They {{returned}} by the direct road to the camp, which they reached at midnight.|$|R
6000|$|Overpowered {{with these}} {{absorbing}} and transcendent introspections, he approached his now odious home upon Pig and Sow Point {{by way of}} the old meeting-house. There of a sudden he came upon his patron, Captain Obadiah, superintending the burial of the last of three victims of his odious commerce, who had died that afternoon. Two had already been interred, and the third new-made grave {{was in the process of}} being filled. Two men, one a negro and the other a white, had nearly completed their labor, tramping down the crumbling <b>earth</b> as they <b>shovelled</b> it into the shallow excavation. Meanwhile Captain Obadiah stood near by, his red coat flaming in the slanting light, himself smoking a pipe of tobacco with all the ease and coolness imaginable. His hands, clasped behind his back, held his ivory-headed cane, and as our hero approached he turned an evil countenance upon him, and greeted him with a grin at once droll, mischievous, and malevolent in the extreme. [...] "And how is our pretty charmer this afternoon?" [...] quoth Captain Obadiah.|$|R
60|$|On the Monday that succeeded the Sabbath mentioned, the {{corporal}} had all his men at work, early, pinning together his palisades, {{making them}} up into manageable bents, and then setting {{them up on}} their legs. As the materials were all there, and quite ready to be put together, the work advanced rapidly; {{and by the time}} the sun drew near the western horizon once more, Castle Meal was surrounded by its bristling defences. The whole was erect and stay-lathed, waiting only for the <b>earth</b> to be <b>shovelled</b> back into the trench, and to be pounded well down. As it was, the palisades offered a great increase of security to those in the chiente, and both the females expressed their obligations to their friends for having taken this important step toward protecting them from the enemy. When they retired for the night, everything was arranged, so that the different members of the party might know where to assemble within the works. Among the effects of Gershom, were a conch and a horn; the latter being one of those common instruments of tin, which are so much used in and about American farm-houses, to call the laborers from the field. The conch was given to the men, that, in case of need, they might sound the alarm from without, while the horn, or trumpet of tin, was suspended by the door of the chiente, in order that the females might have recourse to it, at need.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{we were at}} last summoned, {{the fire}} had been burning {{for more than four}} hours. The pit was filled with a {{white-hot}} mass shooting out little tongues of white flame, and throwing out a heat beside which the scorching sun was a pleasant relief. A number of men were engaged, with long poles to which a loop of thick vine had been attached, in noosing the pieces of unburnt wood by twisting the pole, like a horse's twitch, until the loop was tight, and dragging the log out by main force. When the wood was all out there remained a conical pile of glowing stones {{in the middle of the}} pit. Ten men now drove the butts of green saplings into the base of the pile, and held the upper end while a stout vine was passed behind the row of saplings. A dozen men grasped each end of the vine, and with loud shouts hauled with all their might. The saplings, like the teeth of an enormous rake, tore through the pile of stones, flattening them out towards the opposite edge of the pit. The saplings were then driven in on the other side and the stones raked in the opposite direction, then sideways, until the bottom of the pit was covered with an even layer of hot stones. This process had taken fully half an hour, but any doubt as to the heat of the stones at the end was set at rest by the tongues of flame that played continually among them. The cameras were hard at work, and a large crowd of people pressed inwards towards the pit as the moment drew near. They were all excited except Jonathan, who preserved, even in the supreme moment, the air of holy calm that never leaves his face. All eyes are fixed expectant on the dense bush behind the clearing, whence the Shadrachs, Meshachs and Abednegos of the Pacific are to emerge. There is a cry of [...] "Vutu! Vutu!" [...] and forth from the bush, two and two, march fifteen men, dressed in garlands and fringes. They tramp straight to the brink of the pit. The leading pair show something like fear in their faces, but do not pause, perhaps because the rest would force them to move forward. They step down upon the stones and continue their march round the pit, planting their feet squarely and firmly on each stone. The cameras snap, the crowd surges forward, the bystanders fling in great bundles of green leaves. But the bundles strike the last man of the procession and cut him off from his fellows; so he stays where he is, trampling down the leaves as they are thrown to line the pit, in a dense cloud of steam from the boiling sap. The rest leap back to his assistance, shouting and trampling, and the pit turns into the mouth of an Inferno, filled with dusky frenzied fiends, half seen through the dense volume that rolls up to heaven and darkens the sunlight. After the leaves, palm-leaf baskets of the dracaena root are flung to them, more leaves, and then bystanders and every one join in <b>shovelling</b> <b>earth</b> over all till the pit is gone, and a smoking mound of fresh earth takes its place. This will keep hot for four days, and then the masawe will be cooked.|$|R
