5|$|At a VA {{hospital}} in Fort Evanston, Maryland, Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans makes his third suicide attempt; {{he claims that}} a mysterious figure will not let him die. Stans attempts to <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> a tub of scalding water, but is rescued by the hospital staff and subsequently is disfigured due to the hot water. Stans again claims that the mysterious figure will not let him die.|$|E
5|$|July 10, 2005– Hurricane Dennis makes {{landfall}} {{just west}} of Navarre Beach as a major hurricane, producing moderate rainfall and 9tornadoes throughout the state. 2people <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico, and the hurricane was indirectly responsible for twelve other fatalities. Damage in the state totals about $1.5billion (2005USD, $1.89billion 2017USD).|$|E
5|$|July 11, 1996- Hurricane Bertha {{parallels}} {{the east coast}} of Florida about 175miles (280km) offshore, producing a storm tide of 2feet (0.6m) at Jacksonville Beach, as well as rip currents along the coast. Two people <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> rip currents in Miami Beach, and one pilot dies indirectly due to the storm when an evacuating military jet crashes into a house.|$|E

The seed of the Chola dynasty is brought back to their motherland by the messenger as prophesied.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

5|$|McDowell's {{original}} {{script is}} far less comedic and much darker; the Maitlands' car crash is depicted graphically, with Barbara's arm being crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> the river. A reference to this remained in all versions of the script, as Barbara remarks that her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner, the Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack the Deetzes by tangling them to their chairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or <b>drown.</b> <b>In</b> one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December, at {{approximately}} 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Gračanica. During the advance, {{one of the}} tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the river crossing at Šišinec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and started to fall back to Šišinec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. Since {{there was no way}} to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed by one of the force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the river crossing to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> very cold water. The command post of the brigade fell back to Galdovo, while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Minh {{engaged in}} counter-propaganda campaigns {{in an attempt}} to deter the exodus from the north. They moved through the neighbourhoods of Hanoi and Haiphong on a daily basis, passing out their pamphlets. Evacuees {{reported}} being ridiculed by the Viet Minh, who claimed that they would be sadistically tortured before being killed by the French and American authorities in Haiphong. The communists depicted the personnel of Task Force 90 as cannibals who would eat their babies, predicting disaster in the jungles, beaches and mountains of South Vietnam. They further said that the Americans would throw them overboard to <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> the ocean. The Viet Minh boasted to the emigrants that it was a high and futile risk, asserting that the 1956 reunification elections would result in a decisive communist victory. The communist efforts were helped by the fact that many French or State of Vietnam offices in the north evacuated their personnel and sold or otherwise left behind their printing facilities, many of which fell into Viet Minh hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{heavy rains}} caused {{two people to}} <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> Charlotte. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek, and a woman drowned while in her car. Also in North Carolina, {{tropical}} rains related to Danny caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek, spilling about 2,500 gallons (9,500L) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Island, and parts of Cape Cod, {{in addition to the}} coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts. The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension happening on the service to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July.|$|E

5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|Risk {{can vary}} with {{location}} depending on age. Children between 1 and 4 usually <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> home swimming pools. Drownings in natural water settings increase with age. More {{than half of}} drownings among those 15 years and older occurred in natural water environments.|$|E
25|$|A brick annex, {{designed}} by W.R. Lowery, was constructed against the high school's south side in 1913 {{at a cost}} of $200,000. At this time, the boiler system was moved from the basement of the high school to the area between the main building and the annex. An urban legend (which may have begun as early as the 1910s) began to circulate that the old boiler room was turned into a swimming pool, and that a student drowned in the pool—leaving the high school haunted. An investigation in the 1990s revealed that although student Grant Mill from Great Falls High School did <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> 1915, he did not <b>drown</b> <b>in</b> a fictitious pool in the basement but rather in the Missouri River. The clock tower was removed in 1916 after its massive weight began to compromise the building.|$|E
