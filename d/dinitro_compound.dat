40|$|This thesis {{describes}} new nitro-chemistry {{in studies}} {{related to a}} possible synthesis of Vitamin B 12 as proposed by J. W. Cornforth. Some of the Vitamin B 12 intermediates possess special nuclear magnetic resonance properties when examined as their nitronate anions. Some synthetic studies of fluorinated compounds as potential substrates for glyceroldehydrase, an enzyme requiring 5 ' -deoxyadenosyl cobalamin (Coenzyme B 12), are also described [...] The Introduction discusses the chemical synthesis of corrins, together {{with some of the}} prominences of the Eschenmoser-Woodward synthesis of Vitamin B 12. A brief account of the possible synthesis of Vitamin B 12 proposed by Cornforth is also given. The chemistry of the related B 12 coenzymes is summarised in a section on the enzymatic reactions requiring a 5 ' -deoxyadenosyl cobalamin as a cofactor, The current proposals for the mechanism of action of glyceroldehydrase and dioldehydrase are also compared. The Cornforth approach to Vitamin B 12 was to utilise the reaction of an anion with a germinal bromonitro or <b>dinitro</b> <b>compound</b> in order to join precursors of ring A and ring D. Chapters I and II describe the synthesis of suitable precursors and models for these radical-anion coupling reactions, and attempts to realise an intermolecular coupling of ring A and ring D intermediates. The synthesis of 4 -carboxamidodiethylmalonyl- 3 -methyl- 3 -(2 ', 2 ' -brornonitroethyljcyclo-hexanone ethylene ketal and 4 -(2 ', 2 ' -dinitro) n -butoxycarbonyl- 3 -(2 ' -nirroethyl) - 3 -methyl ccyclohexanone are described together with attempts to use these intermediates for intramolecular coupling purposes. In chapter I, the attempted coupling of hindered geminal halogenonitroso compounds with nitronate anions is also described. Attempts to incorporate an intramolecular Michael addition into the synthesis, for the linking of ring A and ring D precursors are the subject of chapter III. The synthesis of amide derivatives of Hagemann's ester (4 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -methyl cyclohex- 2 -enone) containing a nitro-enamide residue as the 4 -substituent,to examine this scheme was unsuccessful. The corresponding hydrazide analogues, for example, 3 -methyl cyclohex- 3 -ene- 1 -one ethylene ketal 4 -carboxylic acid 3 '-nitrobutylidene hydrazide, are more readily accessible and some reactions are described. In chapter IV, interesting long range deshielding effects are noted in the 1 H n, m. r. spectra of the nitronate anions derived from 4 -alkoxycarbonyl- 3 - methyl- 3 -(2 '-nitroethyl) cyclohexanones, ring A precursors for coupling studies. The deshielding effect associated with the nitronate anion is a useful probe in conformational analysis, and shows the axial conformer of 2 -substituted cyclo- hexane nitronate anions to be preferred. Also the 13 C n. m, r. spectra of several nitronate anions show large solvent dependent chemical shift difference which correlate with differing electronic distibution in the anions in solvents of different protonating ability. Chapter V is an account of the synthesis of potential substrates and inhibitors for the enzyme glyceroldehydrase. 3, 3, 3 -Trifluoro- 1, 2 -propanediol is a substrate for the enzyme and is converted to 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropionaldehyde isolable as its 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hydrazone. Attempts to synthesise authentic 3, 3, 3 -trifluoro- propionaldehyde and the effects of the CF 3 group are also discussed. The reaction between 3, 3, 3 -trifluoro- 1, 2 -propanediol and glyceroldehydrase is readily monitored by 19 F n. m. r. allowing an examination of reaction intermediates. The synthesis of several bromopropanols and some preliminary investigations as to their reactions with glyceroldehydrase are also noted. ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis centres around our desire to use triphenylene as the scaffold for building new molecular materials. This has been approached in three different ways; firstly a twin linked by pyrrole units, secondly by twinning with triazoles, and finally via the formylation of triphenylene. A tetra-hexyloxysubstituted dipyrrolyltriphenylene twin had previously been synthesised in the group, however characterisation was difficult and therefore a twin with improved solubility was designed. The synthesis of tetra-decyloxysubstituted dipyrrolyltriphenylene was completed successfully, but the twinning of the compound could not be achieved. One possible explanation was interference of the long alkyl chains in the neighbouring positions to the pyrrole units. A new target precursor was designed with just two alkyl chains on the triphenylene. Previous work in the group had shown difficulties in the synthesis of the di-hexyloxysubstituted triphenylene, however with careful manipulations the synthesis was successful. New complications were found with the solubility of the di-hexyloxysubstituted dipyrrolyltriphenylene {{that could not be}} overcome. At this point crystals of the tetra-hexyloxysubstituted dipyrrolyltriphenylene twin had been obtained and full characterisation achieved. With the explosion of Click chemistry in the recent years, a twin linked by triazoles was targeted. The twin was designed from a tetra-hexyloxysubstituted diazidetriphenylene, coupled with di-hexyloxysubstituted diacetylenetriphenylene. The diacetylene triphenylene was synthesised successfully following on from the work achieved in the first project. Two routes were explored for the synthesis of the diazide. The first, a direct conversion of the dibromide to the diazide, gave no reaction. The second route was a series of manipulations starting from the dinitrotriphenylene. Some difficulties were found with the reduction of the <b>dinitro</b> <b>compound</b> to the diamine, however these were overcome using carefully controlled conditions. The corresponding diamide was synthesised to allow for full characterisation, as the diamine was found to decompose rapidly. Crystals were grown of the diamide and the x-ray structure was obtained, this showed an unexpected structure. The expected 3, 6 -substitution pattern had not been formed, in fact we had synthesised the 1, 8 -bisimide- 2, 7, 10, 11 -tetrakis(hexyloxy) triphenylene. As the triazole linked triphenylene twin was not accessible, the diacetylenetriphenylene was twinned with itself. High dilution conditions were followed and the twin was successfully isolated. The twin showed no mesophase behaviour and remained stable beyond 300 oC. The third part of the thesis is based on the formylation of tetra-hexyloxysubstituted triphenylene. The formation of the triphenylene dialdehyde had previously eluded our group, however following a new protocol gave a successful synthesis. There were a number of potential compounds to investigate from this versatile precursor. We chose to target BODIPY-triphenylene hybrid compounds. Two compounds were designed, one from the dialdehyde where the BODIPY fragment would be attached via the central meso-carbon, and one from the dipyrrole where the BODIPY would be attached via the alpha positions of the pyrrole. Kryptopyrrole was used in the synthesis from the dipyrrole, to attempt to discourage potential polymer formation, however the reactions were not successful. The bis-BODIPYtriphenylene via the dialdehyde was successfully synthesised and the compound was observed for potential mesophase behaviour; it was seen to melt with decomposition at 150 - 160 oC. Finally, the triphenylene dialdehyde was used to synthesise a twin linked by diamines. The novel twinned structure has a central “void” region that we know to disfavour columnar organisation. The compound was observed for potential mesophase behaviour, and the twin was seen to exhibit only a stable nematic discotic mesophase up to 300 oC...|$|E

This synthetic route has provided high molecular weight POX of new chemical structure, is economically and synthetically more favorable than other routes, and allows for facile chemical structure variation due to the large variety of activated aromatic dihalides which are available...|$|R
40|$|The acute {{toxicity}} and bioconcentration factor {{of a series}} of nitrobenzene derivatives was determined for the guppy. Toxicity is found to be determined by both hydrophobicity (expressed by the octanol/water partition coefficient) and rate of reduction of the nitro group (expressed by either electrochemical halfwave reduction potential or Hammett σ values). The {{acute toxicity}} of mononitro compounds can be adequately described by hydrophobicity, and their bioconcentration factor is found to be approximately equal to the octanol/water partition coefficient. The <b>dinitro</b> <b>compounds</b> that are likely to be most easily reduced are found to have substantially lower bioconcentration factors than expected, accompanied by a marked increase in toxicity. Electrochemical reduction potentials are found to be a better descriptor of toxicity than Hammett σ− values. Nitroanilines do not fit the QSARs established for nitrobenzene derivatives. These compounds are probably to be considered aniline derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Both {{primary and}} {{secondary}} amines react with 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene to give derivatives of 1 -alkylamino- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene. These compounds are important intermediates for the synthesis of a diverse range of products. The methodology reported {{in the present study}} involves either the room temperature reaction or heating at 70 °C in ethanol in the presence of triethylamine. This transformation occurs via a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The 1 -alkylamino- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene derivatives were obtained in greater than 90 % purified yield. The selective reduction of <b>dinitro</b> <b>compounds</b> is an important synthetic strategy for the synthesis of intermediates for dyes, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The use of SnCl 2 as a suspension in EtOAc is a promising method for the regio- and chemo-selective reduction of 1 -alkylamino- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenes to 1 -alkylamino- 2 -amino- 4 -nitrobenzenes. These products are useful intermediates in organic synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Part I. The {{effect of}} 5 mol % of m- and p-dinitrobenzenes upon {{the rate of}} {{reaction}} of p-nitrocumyl chloride with sodium benzenesulfinate, sodium azide, sodium nitrite and sodium cyanide was studied. Except in two instances, definite rate retardation was observed. A radical anion-radical chain mechanism is proposed for these reactions. ^ Part II. Nitrobenzenes substituted by six different electron withdrawing groups, namely, benzoyl, carbalkoxy, cyano, nitro, benzenesulfonyl and trifluoromethyl, have been studied {{and a variety of}} nucleophiles have been employed. With one exception, the nitro group is exclusively displaced under very mild condition. The yields of pure, isolated products range from 60 % to 92 %. ^ Part III. A non-basic reducing agent, calcium amalgam, for the transformation of vicinal <b>dinitro</b> <b>compounds</b> bearing cyano, ester, keto and ether groups into functionalized tetra-substituted olefins, has been developed. Olefin formation takes place at room temperature and gives pure products in 65 - 87 % yields. ...|$|R

Purification of the di(hydroxyphenyl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazole monomers was accomplished by recrystallization.

40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} rates and product distributions {{have been studied}} for two groups of compounds: nitro- and difluoramino-substituted six-membered rings and 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazines. The mass spectra of these compounds were also examined using electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry (MS). A collision induced dissociation (CID) study of the major EI peaks was carried out using tandem mass spectrometer. The mass fragmentation pathways were constructed and discussed. ^ Geminal-bis(difluoramino) compounds were observed to be slightly more stable than the corresponding geminal <b>dinitro</b> <b>compounds,</b> and they released more heat during decomposition. Where a nitramine functionality was present, the nitroso analog was observed as a major decomposition product. The decomposition pathways of gem-bis(difluoramino) and gem-dinitro compounds exhibited similarities. Both experienced homolytic loss of one NX 2 group followed by the rearrangement of the remaining NX 2. Where X was oxygen, the well-known nitro/nitrite rearrangement, followed by loss of NO, resulted in a C=O bond. Where X was fluorine, there were two possibilities; loss of fluorine radical leaving C=NF or loss of HNF resulting in =C-F; the latter pathway was the one mainly observed. ^ The mass fragmentation study on these compounds indicated the two nitramines with a six-member ring structure underwent initial loss of a geminal substituent; loss of a nitramine nitro group was the secondary step. The two cyclohexane structures showed similar initial fragmentation pathways, featuring the successive losses of nitro or difluoramino groups. ^ The thermal and electron-impact stabilities of eight 3, 6 -substituted- 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazines were investigated in the same fashion. Major EI peaks were also investigated by tandem mass techniques to construct fragmentation pathways. No tetrazine ring structures were maintained under electron impact ionization nor under conditions of {{thermal decomposition}}. Under electron impact, all the tetrazines examined shared the same initial fragmentation pathways: elimination {{of two of the}} nitrogen atoms as N 2 from the tetrazine ring and cleavage of the remaining N-N bond. This pathway was also applicable to thermal decomposition; however, the main route involves dissociation of the substituent on the tetrazine carbon, in some cases assisted by proton transfer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} of mono- and dinitroaromatic compounds {{was measured in}} sewage effluent maintained under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Most of the nitrobenzene, 3 - and 4 -nitrobenzoic acids, and 3 - and 4 -nitrotoluenes {{and much of the}} 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -dinitrobenzenes disappeared both in the presence and absence of oxygen. Under anaerobiosis, 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene and 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoic acid disappeared slowly, but no loss was evident in 28 days in aerated sewage. Aromatic amines did not accumulate during the aerobic decomposition of the mononitro compounds. They did appear in nonsterile, but not in sterile, sewage incubated aerobically with the <b>dinitro</b> <b>compounds</b> and anaerobically with all the chemicals. Analysis by gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that aniline was formed from nitrobenzene, toluidine was formed from 3 - and 4 -nitrotoluenes, and aminobenzoic acid was formed from 3 - and 4 -nitrobenzoic acids under anaerobiosis, and that nitroaniline was formed from 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -dinitrobenzenes, aminonitrotoluene resulted from 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene, and aminonitrobenzoic acid was a product of 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoic acid under both conditions. The isomeric forms of the metabolites were not established. Aniline, 4 -toluidine, and 4 -aminobenzoic acid added to sewage disappeared from aerated nonsterile, but not from sterile, sewage or sewage in the absence of oxygen. 2 -Nitroaniline, 2 -amino- 3 -nitrotoluene, and 2 -amino- 5 -nitrobenzoic acid added to sewage persisted for at least 60 days in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Gas chromatographic and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses demonstrated that acetanilide and 2 -methylquinoline were formed from aniline, 4 -methylformanilide and 4 -methylacetanilide were formed from 4 -toluidine, 2 -methylbenzimidazole was a product of 2 -nitroaniline, and unidentified benzimidazoles were formed from 2 -amino- 3 -nitrotoluene in the absence of oxygen, and that 2 -nitroacetanilide and 2 -methyl- 6 -nitroacetanilide were formed from 2 -nitroaniline and 2 -amino- 3 -nitrotoluene, respectively, in {{the presence or absence of}} oxygen. It is suggested that the transformations of widely used nitroaromatic compounds should be further studied because of the persistence and possible toxicity of products of their metabolism...|$|R
