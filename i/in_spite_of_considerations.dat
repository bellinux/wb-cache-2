The procedure and validation of Crassostrea rhizophorae embryonic development test have shown that it meets the same precision as other U. S. EPA tests, where EC 50 is generally used as a toxicological endpoint. However, the recognition that EC 50 {{is not the best}} endpoint to assess contaminant effects led U. S. EPA to recently suggest EC 25 as an alternative to estimate xenobiotic effects for pollution prevention. To provide reliability to the toxicological test results on C. rhizophorae embryos, the present work aimed to establish the critical effect level for this test organism, based on its reaction to reference toxicants, by using the statistical method proposed by Norberg-King (Inhibition Concentration, version 2. 0).

40|$|The rating agencies' {{and bank}} supervisors' records of prompt {{identification}} of banking problems in emerging markets {{has not been}} satisfactory. This paper suggests that such deficiencies {{could be explained by}} the use of financial indicators that, while appropriate for industrial countries, do not work in emerging markets. Among the conclusions, this paper shows that the most commonly used indicator of banking problems in industrial countries, the capital-to-asset ratio, has performed poorly as an indicator of banking problems in Latin America and East Asia. This is because of (a) severe deficiencies in the accounting and regulatory framework and (b) lack of liquid markets for bank shares, subordinated debt and other bank liabilities and assets needed to validate the "real" worth of a bank as opposed to its accounting value. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> these problems, an appropriate set of indicators for banking problems in emerging markets can be constructed. But such a system should be based not on the quality of banks loans or on levels of capitalization, but on the general principle that good indicators of banking problems are those that reveal the "true" riskiness of individual banks because they are based on markets that work rather than just relying on accounting figures. Of the alternative indicators proposed in this paper, interest rate paid on deposits and interest rate spreads have proven to be strong performers. In contrast to the interpretation of banks' spreads in industrial countries, low spreads in emerging markets have not always indicated an increased in bank efficiency. Instead, low spreads have often reflected the high-risk taking behavior of weak banks. A difficulty that rating agencies may encounter in considering the suggested approach in this paper is that the methodology implies that the appropriate indicators of banks' performance evolve over time as markets develop and that, given large differences among emerging markets, a single set of indicators will not "fit all". The basic principle that "indicators work where markets work" is the leading guide to the selection <b>of</b> effective indicators. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> these <b>considerations,</b> we believe that in facing the trade-off between "uniformity across countries" and "effective indicators", rating agencies would be better off by focusing on the latter. ...|$|R

The comparison {{is done for}} seven road safety related areas: alcohol and drugs, speeds, protective systems, daytime running lights, vehicles (passive safety), roads, and trauma management, on basis of the theory presented in Hakkert, Gitelman and Vis 1 (2007), using the data obtained from the collaborating countries (see Vis and Van Gent 2 (2007). When indicator values are available but not comparable due to e. g. lack of data quality, this is explained. In general, comparing the countries' performances is difficult. The main reasons are the lack of data, suspicious quality of the data, or the incomparability of the (seemingly similar) data due to different circumstances of measurement.

In a number of cases, the choice for a specific performance indicator depends on the availability of data. This has, for example, been the case for the indicator for alcohol usage; while the optimal indicator would concern the usage rate of alcohol in the general driver population, the unavailability of data in a number of the (larger) country, has led to a more indirect indictor.

30|$|The present study, {{even though}} used a {{retrospective}} design, followed a rigorous classification {{of the class}} II patients and selected a well-matched control group. For both groups, the whole observational term was within the pre-pubertal growth phase. Having the class II patients included herein characterised by a retruded mandible, the main issue to be addressed {{is whether or not}} this treatment protocol is able to enhance mandibular growth on the sagittal plane. In this regard, total mandibular length measured by the Co-Gn (or Co-Menton/Pogonion) distance is a primary parameter. However, one of the major confounding problems in cephalometrics is the use of both Co and Articulare (Ar) as the posterior end point in measuring mandibular total length. Indeed, measurements with Ar as an end point, such as Ar-Gn, might give significant values for supplementary mandibular growth, without a corresponding increase in Co-Gn [15]. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> this <b>consideration,</b> several <b>of</b> the previous investigations on functional treatment for class II patients used Ar as the posterior mandibular end point when dealing with different class II appliances [5] or specifically regarding the FR- 2 [7]. In the present investigation, the total mandibular length, as Co-Gn, underwent very similar mean increases of 4.1 and 4.0 mm in either the treated and control groups, respectively. Similar results with no or minimal effects of FR- 2 treatment on mandibular length (as Co-Gn or Co-Pogonion) were seen by previous investigations [15, 32, 33]. However, these studies did not specify which growth phase the patients had during treatment [15, 32, 33] or had an unmatched control group [15]. On the contrary, McNamara et al. [3] reported a supplementary increment of 3.6 mm/ 2 years in mandibular length (Co-Gn) in patients treated in the late mixed and early permanent dentitions, presumably with several of these patients treated during the pubertal growth phase. Petrovic et al. [12] reported an additional increase in Co-Pogonion ranging from 0.8 to 5.5 mm/year depending on different biological growth categories in subjects treated with the FR- 2 at the pubertal growth phase. Freeman et al. [11] reported a total increase in Co-Gn of 3.0 mm in subjects treated by FR- 2 as compared to untreated controls over a 10 -year-long follow-up. These subjects showed a pre-pubertal and a post-pubertal growth phase {{at the beginning and end}} of the treatment, respectively [11].|$|R

30|$|Our {{observations}} {{concerning the}} morphology of epithelial cells {{correspond to the}} published validation study [1] where the viability of these cells over 4  days was documented. Later in the course, apoptotic features, like the condensation of nuclear chromatin and autophagy, are seen. The occurrence of lysosomes, glycogen, and lipid bodies increased during culture time, which {{is meant to be}} a sign of degeneration. On the other hand, we detected an increased number of lipid granules in epithelial cells stimulated by progesterone. According to Dallenbach [7], this feature seems to be a sign for increased cell activity; the epithelial cells stay intact for a longer time in culture than stromal cells do. The production of prolactin and IGF-bp 1 similarly rises after the addition of progesterone. At the beginning of the culture, proteins are secreted from apoptotic vesicles, as well as synthesised de novo by the cells, and accumulate in supernatant. After 48 and 96  h, prolactin and IGF-bp 1 are destroyed by proteases released by necrotic cells. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> this <b>consideration,</b> further studies, e.g., with purified epithelial cells in primary culture, are required to clarify whether epithelial markers (e.g., glycodelin) also increase in vitro with the addition of progesterone and whether the development of lipid bodies due to progesterone is a truly stromal cell-mediated event. Stromal cells seem to be severely affected morphologically during the early culture phase by apoptotic features and later by excessive necrosis. The production of prolactin declined, probably due to proteases secreted by necrotic cells at the same time. Studies with a protease inhibitor should clarify this consideration. Despite the overall degenerative state, a fraction of stromal cells seems to develop into predecidual cells without the addition of progesterone. To our knowledge, this has not been described to date. The development of decidual cells during pregnancy (i.e., exposure to high progesterone levels), however, has been studied, and the induction of decidualisation of stromal cells, together with increased prolactin production, by progesterone was confirmed [4, 8 – 11]. A single short application of progesterone induces development of stromal cells to decidual cells [12]. In this study, we have identified areas with decidualised stromal cells in progesterone-added culture. Using light and transmission electron microscopy together with the TUNEL method, we could show that the tissue is protected in presence of progesterone and that stromal cells remain morphologically intact for an extended time. The inhibition of apoptosis by progesterone has been demonstrated previously [13]. Based on our observations, stromal cells are viable for 7  days in culture in presence of progesterone at 200  ng/mL.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{presentation}} of Mike Davies' idea of the polyvalent façade [1], {{the vision of a}} multifunctional building skin has produced a number of technological developments taking first steps in this direction. Switchable façades with electrochromic or gasochromic glazing have been investigated for many years. Research has mainly concentrated on material and device development [2]. Large-area chromogenic devices are in the discussion for building applications. Recently a large European project has treated the architectural and technical integration of switchable devices into buildings as well as durability and lifecycle aspects [3]. Glazing companies still balk at the risk of a market introduction of glazings which can change its colour dynamically and thus change characteristic properties like total solar energy transmittance and visual transmittance. In this situation it might seem hazardous to try and incorporate even more functions into a glazing unit than the mentioned technologies. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> these <b>considerations,</b> it has been the goal of this research to develop a glass façade system that actively controls not only visual light transmission and the solar energy transmission but may even incorporate further processes in the building envelope The extraction and provision of heat within the transparent façade, i. e. at the interface between the artificial interior and natural exterior environments, offers the possibility to completely control the energy flows and comfort conditions at the façade. For this purpose, a four-layer glazing element with two fluid-filled cavities and one gas-filled cavity between the panes was designed (see Figure 1). The outer liquid layer in cavity I reduces the solar irradiation by absorption even in the clear state. Excess solar heat gains are kept outside. During periods of very high solar radiation, the clear fluid in the outer cavity I is replaced by a coloured one thus increasing absorption. In cavity III the liquid layer holds the surface temperature constant at room temperature - in summer it can be cooled down whereas in winter heat can be added to the room. A heat pump could be used for providing the temperature levels needed for these purposes. These large-area, transparent heating and cooling elements show uniform temperatures over their entire surface, which leads to an increased interior comfort range since convection is reduced due to large areas with uniform temperatures. The gas-filled chamber II in the middle, along with the Low-E coating of the third glass pane, further reduces energy transmission in winter (heat losses) and during the summer (solar gains). Shading, heating and cooling therefore {{become an integral part of}} the glazed transparent building envelope which is adaptable to the requirements of the different seasons (Figure 2) Of course this vision is not without risk. It has to be transformed from an idea to a reliable technological system before it can be used by designers and engineers to produce completely different buildings...|$|R

It {{is considered to}} be an engineered structure and the pavement is expected to serve its designed life and meet the performance criteria for better economy. Various materials constitute the different layers of the pavement and their characterization becomes important for durability. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> these <b>considerations</b> however, many factors contribute to early pavement failure and improper material characterization is just one of them. The Bituminous mix which is used for the surface and binder courses is formed as a conglomeration of the binder, graded aggregates and voids which forms a stable mixture which can resist wear and tear as well as heavy wheel loads when used in the field. The bituminous mix needs to meet the volumetric requirements to attain stability. When bitumen is mixed with aggregates in a heated condition, the binder forms a coating around the aggregate particle which is termed as Asphalt film thickness (AFT) which is not measured but calculated. Bitumen due to its visco-elastic nature should be used at the optimum and the specified temperature to provide a minimum uniform film thickness to ensure proper bonding in the Bitumen mastic. Fillers {{play a major role in}} determining the properties and the behaviour of the mixture, especially the binding and aggregate interlocking effects. The filler has the ability to increase the resistance of particle to move within the mix matrix and/or works as an active material when it interacts with the asphalt cement to change the properties of the mastic. Mineral fillers serve a dual purpose when added to asphalt mixes, the portion of the mineral filler that is finer than the thickness of the asphalt film blends with asphalt cement binder to form a mortar or mastic that contributes to improved stiffening of the mix. In the present study the film thickness was determined by Hveem method by determining the total surface area and the effect of fillers thereon is discussed. The effect of types of fillers in varying percentage, in the performance of hot-mix-asphalt is also studied. Three types of fillers namely, Hydrated lime, Ordinary Portland Cement, and Fly ash were used as fillers in the present study. Their percentage by weight of aggregates was varied as 2 %, 4 % and 6 % to study their effect on the mix prepared for BC Grade II. The optimum binder content was determined for the various fillers and moisture susceptibility of bituminous mixtures was evaluated [...] The results of film thickness determination reveals that an average film thickness of 6 μm is obtained for all fillers which is necessary for durability of the mixes. The Fatigue results show that Lime at 4 % can be used for enhanced performance and 2 % is recommended, when cement or fly ash is used as filler material...|$|R
