5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} going to be a success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, <b>just</b> <b>big</b> enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E

500|$|The single, [...] "Say I", is an {{inspirational}} and motivational record; Milian {{wanted to make}} a record that would be an inspiration to both her and her fans. Focusing on an urban audience, Milian said the record was [...] "way more an urban record than anything I've ever done." [...] The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets, and thought his rap was [...] "a very real message. It pertained to his life." [...] The track, [...] "Twisted", {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the album. Lyrically, the song is about liking someone so much that you [...] "can't even go about [...] day in a normal way". Milian compared the urban vibe of both tracks and said they were huge records, [...] "where the music is <b>just</b> <b>big</b> and the hook is <b>just</b> <b>big</b> and you can’t help but sing [...]" ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with MTV News, regarding the collaboration with Usher, Steve Angello commented, [...] "We met Usher couple of years ago, we did the AMA's together and then we came to hang-out in Ibiza. We were in Atlanta and we were all working together for five days. He has always been a great artist and he always knows what he wants so it is a good collaboration all in all.

500|$|In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon {{opened his}} first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players {{the finer points}} of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man who is <b>just</b> <b>big,</b> maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, {{make it easier for the}} entire team." [...] He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. [...] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.|$|E
500|$|Oswald's {{head was}} interred in Durham Cathedral {{together}} with the remains of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (a saint with whom Oswald became posthumously associated, although the two were not associated in life; Cuthbert became bishop of Lindisfarne {{more than forty years}} after Oswald's death) and other valuables in a quickly made coffin, where it is generally believed to remain, although there are at least four other claimed heads of Oswald in continental Europe. One of his arms is said to have ended up in Peterborough Abbey later in the Middle Ages. The story is that a small group of monks from Peterborough made their way to Bamburgh where Oswald's uncorrupted arm was kept and stole it under the cover of darkness. They returned with it to Peterborough and in due time a chapel was created for the arm - Oswald's Chapel. This - minus the arm - can be seen to this day in the south transept of the cathedral. When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - <b>just</b> <b>big</b> enough for a monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald's Arm 24 hours a day, every day of the year. [...] The monk had to stand because the tower is not large enough for him to sit - sitting could lull him to sleep - and they knew what could happen when no-one was watching.|$|E

Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke.

2500|$|When compared, {{groundwater}} {{heat pumps}} {{are generally more}} efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil. Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized. This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity, and the overall system {{has been designed to}} be <b>just</b> <b>big</b> enough to handle a [...] "typical worst case" [...] cold spell, or is simply undersized for the load. One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop, is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop. There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; one way is to make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot. A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized, by ensuring soil thermal properties and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design.|$|E
2500|$|The November 1958 London Motorcycle {{show was}} used to launch the Minicar Mark F. As with the change from the Mark C to D, the {{designation}} was primarily to denote significant mechanical progression from the Mark E rather than any notable difference in the cars external appearance.

2500|$|The first concerted Mongol {{invasion}} of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons {{along with other}} more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats. Jin scholar Liu Qi (劉祈) recounts in his memoir, [...] "the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [...] advanced." [...] The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (huo jian 火箭) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket. Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, [...] "From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (震天雷). Whenever the [...] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes." [...] A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the History of Jin: [...] "The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li , burning an expanse of land {{more than half a}} mu , and the fire can even penetrate iron armor." [...] A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: [...] "When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, <b>just</b> <b>big</b> enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time." [...] Furthermore, he wrote, [...] "When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away." ...|$|E
