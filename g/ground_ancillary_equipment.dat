40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{a powerful}} tool for structural studies of samples in special sample environments because of the high penetrating power of neutrons compared to x-rays. The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) offers its users a variety of sample environments for pulsed neutron scattering and diffraction experiments. At the present time over 80 % of all experiments performed at the IPNS invoke some type of <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> to control the sample environment. These include closed-cycle refrigerators, cryostats, furnaces, magnets, and pressure cells. There are also devices for automatic sample changing, positioning, and orientating. Most instruments have at a minimum, a dedicated closed cycle refrigerator (10 K to RT) configured for the instrument's typical sample dimensions and scattering angles. Standardization in instrument sample well dimensions, process control equipment, and control software has made multi-instrument use of many of the furnaces and cryostats possible. General use, multi-instrument equipment is maintained by the facility's technical staff. Instrument dedicated equipment is maintained by the respective instrument scientist with help from the <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> group. The design and upgrading of equipment is done by the <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> engineer with the oversight and input of instrument scientists, instrument engineer, and technical staff. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> conception and design is science driven, with the instrument scientists and even users providing the initial input for design criteria...|$|R
40|$|Liquid mixed, {{high-level}} {{radioactive waste}} has been stored in underground single-shell tanks at the US Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) Hanford Site. After retrieval of the waste from the single-shell tanks, the DOE will proceed with closure of the tank farm. The 241 -AX Tank Farm includes four one-million gallon single-shell tanks in addition to sluice lines, transfer lines, ventilation headers, risers, pits, cribs, catch tanks, buildings, well and associated buried piping. This equipment is classified as <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment.</b> This document addresses the requirements for regulatory close of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> in the Hanford Site 241 -AX Tank Farm. The options identified for physical closure of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> include disposal in place, disposal in place after treatment, excavation and disposal on site in an empty single-shell tank, and excavation and disposal outside the AX Tank Farm. The document addresses {{the background of the}} Hanford Site and <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> in the AX Tank Farm, regulations for decontamination and decommissioning of radioactively contaminated equipment, requirements for the cleanup and disposal of radioactive wastes, cleanup and disposal requirements governing hazardous and mixed waste, and regulatory requirements and issues associated with each of the four physical closure options.
