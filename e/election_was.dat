50|$|The {{last major}} round of local {{government}} <b>elections</b> <b>was</b> held in 2006 when <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> held in 288 of the then 330 local authorities. <b>Elections</b> <b>were</b> not held in the remainder due to the ongoing civil war.

40|$|Abstract One of {{the common}} {{normative}} assumptions about <b>elections</b> <b>is</b> that competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> inherently good, and non-competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> problematic. This paper challenges that assumption. At the level of individual elections, competitive elections pro-duce either sub-optimal results or trivially optimal results, but competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> never uniquely optimal. In aggregation, competitive elections {{for a set of}} offices are inher-ently sub-optimal. From a procedural perspective, the circumstances in which competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> appropriate are rare, and from a diagnostic perspective, we cannot conclude that there are problems in the electoral system based on a lack of competition. In the context of social choice theory, competitive <b>elections</b> <b>are</b> not inherently good...|$|R

5|$|As the 15th Lok Sabha {{was due to}} {{complete}} its constitutional term on 31 May 2014, a general <b>election</b> <b>was</b> called by the Election Commission for {{the constitution of the}} 16th Lok Sabha. The <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014. The Congress party had won the previous two elections in 2004 and 2009, and so was campaigning to win the election for the third consecutive time. The result of this election were declared on 16 May, before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential <b>election</b> <b>was</b> settled by the Electoral College, but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential <b>election</b> <b>was</b> decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E

5|$|In January 1141 William {{was elected}} Archbishop of York. Originally, the cathedral chapter of York had elected Waltheof in 1140, but that <b>election</b> <b>was</b> set aside {{because one of}} Waltheof's {{supporters}} had made an uncanonical gift to secure Waltheof's election. Then Henry of Blois tried to secure the see for Henry de Sully, another nephew of Stephen and Henry's. Sully's <b>election</b> <b>was</b> opposed by Pope Innocent II, who refused to confirm him as archbishop while he retained his post as Abbot of Fécamp. It was only at a third election, held in January 1141, that William was selected. Whether {{he had been a}} candidate in the previous two elections is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{had been}} limited {{to a maximum of}} seven years under the Septennial Act 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act to limit Parliament to five years, {{beginning}} the first meeting of Parliament after the election. In practice, no <b>election</b> <b>was</b> absolutely forced by that limitation; until the Septennial Act was repealed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, all parliaments were dissolved by the Monarch under the Royal Prerogative on request of the Prime Minister. It should be noted, however, that the five-year maximum duration in the amended Septennial Act referred to the lifetime of the Parliament, and not to the interval between general elections. For example, the 2010 general <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held five years and one day after the 2005 general election, whilst the 1992 general <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held on 9 April 1992 and the next general <b>election</b> <b>was</b> not held until 1 May 1997. The reduction in Parliament length was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the Commons. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in contrast, calls for general elections every five years (unless called sooner, as in 2017), and provides for dissolution of Parliament only by operation of law prior to each election; it abolished dissolution under the Royal Prerogative.|$|E

5|$|The general <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held on 27 April. Menem won {{the first}} round with 24.5 percent of the vote, {{followed}} by Kirchner with 22.2 percent. The conservative Ricardo López Murphy finished third, substantially behind the two main candidates. Since Menem was well short of the threshold required to win, a runoff <b>election</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for 18 May. He had a negative public image, and polls showed Kirchner receiving 60 to 70 percent of the vote. To avoid a humiliating defeat, Menem {{pulled out of the}} runoff in a move criticized by the other candidates. The judiciary declined requests for a new election and refused to sanction a runoff election between Kirchner and López Murphy, although López Murphy said he would not participate. The <b>election</b> <b>was</b> validated by the Congress, and Kirchner became president on 25 May 2003. Kirchner's 22.2 percent is the lowest vote percentage ever recorded for an Argentine president in a free election.|$|E

5|$|A second Legislative Council <b>election</b> <b>was</b> held in 1951 {{with the}} number of elected seats {{increased}} to nine.

While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore, the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel, proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head of government and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a parliamentary system. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.|$|E
