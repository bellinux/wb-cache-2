The bristles increase the surface area of the tongue available for the uptake of nectar.|$|R
50|$|During {{his life}} Hearder {{developed}} many alternative experimental procedures which were usable {{by those with}} sight impairments. These procedures included steadily moving a paper strip through an induction coil's spark gap, enabling him to feel perforation holes and thus estimate the coil's frequency, which also sounded as an audible tone. In 1858, when Hearder was asked to advise on the faulty Atlantic Cable prior to {{the departure of the}} cable ship Agamenmnon from Plymouth's Keyham Dockyard, Hearder reported testing the cable by <b>inserting</b> his <b>tongue</b> into the 2500-mile-long circuit to determine the electrical resistance of the wire.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the fawn-breasted {{brilliant}} mainly {{consists of}} nectar. It defends quality nectar flowers from other nectarivores, including insects such as bumblebees. When feeding it hovers before the flower or hangs from it, and <b>inserts</b> its <b>tongue</b> up to 13 times per second. It will also visit bird feeders and will drink water from fountains and bird baths. It takes small insects and spiders for extra protein. The female catches {{large quantities of}} insects during breeding because they are an important food for the chicks. The bird catches insect prey by hawking, picking them from plants, and plucking them from spider webs.|$|R
50|$|Warwolves have slick, smooth {{skins and}} have sharp claws on each paw. The Warwolves {{have the power}} to drain the life essence of a victim by <b>inserting</b> their <b>tongues</b> into an orifice, causing the victim's {{skeleton}} and internal organs to discorporate, leaving behind an intact skin. Warwolves can wear the actual skin and clothing of the victim to masquerade as that person, altering their shape to resemble the prey perfectly. Warwolves can also mimic the voices of their victims or of other persons. A group of Warwolves can together psionically create an inter-dimensional portal and merge into a single being while retaining their individual heads and psyches.|$|R

According to Hurt, Cormack used to remove his two false front teeth and <b>insert</b> his <b>tongue</b> into boys' mouths. Hurt also said that Cormack used to rub the boys' faces with his stubble. Hurt said that the experience affected him [...] "hugely". According to the interviewer, Sholto Byrnes, he and Hurt have a mutual friend who had earlier made the same allegations to Byrnes.|$|R
25|$|Four paired {{intrinsic}} {{muscles of}} the <b>tongue</b> originate and <b>insert</b> within the <b>tongue,</b> running along its length. They are the superior longitudinal muscle, the inferior longitudinal muscle, the vertical muscle, and the transverse muscle. These muscles alter {{the shape of the}} tongue by lengthening and shortening it, curling and uncurling its apex and edges as in tongue rolling, and flattening and rounding its surface. This provides shape and helps facilitate speech, swallowing, and eating.|$|R

40|$|Although oral {{piercing}} {{has been an}} uncommon practice in the Western world, the insertion of metal objects into intra-oral and peri-oral pierced sites is growing in popularity. Tongue piercing is one such practice whereby a metal barbell is <b>inserted</b> into the <b>tongue</b> after piercing with a 14 - 16 gauge needle. Pain, swelling and infection are the most serious consequences associated with this procedure. Other adverse outcomes include mucosal or gingival trauma, chipped or fractured teeth, increased salivary flow, calculus build-up, and interference with speech, mastication and swallowing. This article presents a case report on tongue piercing and highlights the procedure involved. Special attention is given to complications and dental implications associated with such an unusual practice...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Petra Collins and was released on July 26, 2017. The video opens with three shots of {{what appears to be}} Gomez soaking wet with her hair dripping seductively over her face in mirror images then shows Gomez in a pale-yellow dress, carrying bags of groceries similar to the song's cover artwork, on a seemingly normal suburban street, in a role that appears to be a beleaguered housewife, as noted by Stereogum. As the video progresses, Gomez takes part in a range of strange activities. Inside a suburban home, the singer is seen soaking wet (similar to the opening shots earlier) in a dining table with water sprinkling as if it is raining, with candles in the scenery. Then she eats soap, finds a broken glass of wine and proceeds to taste one of the broken fragments, puts lipstick over her teeth, ties a rope around her tongue into a bow, <b>inserting</b> her <b>tongue</b> through an eyelash curler and then writhes around on the kitchen floor, while Gucci Mane raps his verse in a smoky lit underground basement. The clip ends with a shot of Gomez smiling inside an industrial freezer.|$|R
50|$|A manananggal {{can also}} be a sorceress that visits villages and barrios. To feed, the self-segmenter chooses an {{isolated}} place where she will leave her lower torso while she hunts at night. When she separates from her lower torso, she then gains her ability to fly. She then goes off in search of houses where pregnant women reside. Upon choosing a suitable victim, the Manananggal alights on the house and <b>inserts</b> her <b>tongue</b> through the roof. The tongue is long, hollow and extremely flexible. She uses it to puncture the womb of the sleeping woman and to suck out the fetus. At other times, she seduces men with her beauty and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats the insides, like the heart, stomach or the liver. Sunlight is deadly to the Manananggal when she is in her monstrous form.If her two halves are still separate with the coming of dawn, she will be destroyed. According to legend, to destroy the Manananggal, one should search for the lower torso that she leaves behind during her nightly hunts. Salt, ash, and/or garlic should then be placed on the exposed flesh, preventing the monster from combining again and leaving it vulnerable to sunlight. Small containers of salt, ash and raw rice, and the smell of burning rubber are said to deter the Manananggal from approaching one's house.|$|R
40|$|Nectarivory {{has evolved}} {{independently}} eight times among birds. In the neotropics specialized nectarivory evolved in hummingbirds and flowerpiercers (genus Diglossa). Flowerpiercers are nectar-robbers of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Because flowerpiercers and hummingbirds {{are found in}} the same habitats feeding on the nectar of the same flowers, they provide us with a unique opportunity to understand the pressures that nectarivory imposes on animals. Flowerpiercers present beaks that have a long hook at the tip of their maxilla. The hook is used to hold tubular flowers in place while they stab them by projecting their lower mandible. Then, they <b>insert</b> their <b>tongues</b> in the puncture and extract nectar. I investigated the following questions: (1) What is the function of the flowerpiercer's hook, and which are the consequences of its evolution? (2) Are the digestive traits of flowerpiercers convergent with those of hummingbirds? (3) How do digestive traits affect sugar selection by nectar feeding birds? And (4) What are the effects of Diglossa baritula's physiology and behavior over its annual cycles? I found that nectarivorous flowerpiercers evolved from a frugivorous ancestor with a hookless beak. The evolution of a hooked bill allowed flowerpiercers to become efficient nectar-robers, but hindered their efficiency to feed on fruit. Using a phylogenetically informed approach, I found that the digestive traits of flowerpiercers and hummingbirds are not convergent. Unlike hummingbirds which have astounding intestinal sucrase activity levels, flowerpiercers had low sucrase activity. Nectar intake in D. baritula seems to be limited by its ability to digest sucrose. I also found that sugar preferences in nectar-feeding birds are concentration-dependent. At lower concentrations birds preferred hexoses, whereas at higher concentrations they preferred sucrose. Although nectar composition and concentration are often discussed as two different floral traits, they have a synergistic effect on the sugar preferences of nectar-feeding birds. D. baritula individuals exhibit biannual reproductive and molting cycles that are synchronized with flower and fruit abundance in the mountains of Mexico. The ability to rob nectar appears to have molded the evolution of the most important morphological, physiological and behavioral traits of D. baritula...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Compare the {{efficiency}} of three techniques for tongue cleaning, by comparison {{of the amount of}} tongue coating removed by each technique. Methods: Tongue cleaning was performed using an Oral B 30 (Procter&Gamble, São Paulo, Brasil) toothbrush; a Saude Bucal (Odomed, São Paulo, Brasil) tongue scraper, and a new tongue cleaning technique, consisting of a tongue cleaner with bristles and a scraping edge and a Halitus® (Halitus, Campinas, Brasil) tongue cleaning spray solution. The study design used 15 healthy volunteers who were submitted to each of the tongue cleaning techniques, once every 21 days. The volunteers were instructed to abstain from any procedure to clean their tongues, for 48 hours before the application of each technique. At each scheduled time, a dental professional performed a single standardized tongue cleaning procedure using one of the cleaning methods, and <b>inserted</b> the removed <b>tongue</b> coating into a test tube. Results: The results were obtained by weighing the tube test with tongue coating after the cleaning procedure (final weight) deducting the weight of the empty tube test (initial weight). The findings showed that the new tongue cleaning technique (combination of a tongue cleaner with brush and scraper plus a tongue cleaning spray solution) was statistically superior in removing tongue coating when compared with the tongue scraper or toothbrush, probably due to the technique and materials used. Conclusion: The tongue cleaning procedure, when performed within a specific technique, associated with products that improve the cleaning action, makes possible to reach better results, allowing the removal of more tongue coating...|$|R
5000|$|A {{terrestrial}} salamander catches {{its prey}} by flicking out its sticky tongue in {{an action that}} takes {{less than half a}} second. In some species, the tongue is attached anteriorly {{to the floor of the}} mouth, while in others, it is mounted on a pedicel. It is rendered sticky by secretions of mucus from glands in its tip and on the roof of the mouth. High-speed cinematography shows how the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) positions itself with its snout close to its prey. Its mouth then gapes widely, the lower jaw remains stationary, and the tongue bulges and changes shape as it shoots forward. The protruded tongue has a central depression, and the rim of this collapses inward as the target is struck, trapping the prey in a mucus-laden trough. Here it is held while the animal's neck is flexed, the tongue retracted and jaws closed. Large or resistant prey is retained by the teeth while repeated protrusions and retractions of the tongue draw it in. Swallowing involves alternate contraction and relaxation of muscles in the throat, assisted by depression of the eyeballs into the roof of the mouth. Many lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have more elaborate feeding methods. Muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to store elastic energy in springy connective tissue, and actually [...] "shoot" [...] the hyoid bone out of the mouth, thus elongating the tongue. Muscles that originate in the pelvic region and <b>insert</b> in the <b>tongue</b> are used to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to their original positions.|$|R
40|$|Eight muscles {{invest the}} human tongue: four {{extrinsic}} muscles have external origins and <b>insert</b> into the <b>tongue</b> body and four intrinsic muscles originate and terminate within the tongue. Previously, we noted minimal {{activation of the}} genioglossus tongue muscle during impeded protrusion tasks (i. e., having subjects push the tongue against a force transducer), suggesting that other muscles {{play a role in}} the production of tongue force. Accordingly, we sought to characterize genioglossus tongue muscle activities during impeded and unimpeded protrusion tasks (i. e., having subjects slowly and smoothly move the tongue out of their mouth). Electromyographic (EMG) and single motor-unit potentials of the extrinsic genioglossus muscle were recorded with tungsten microelectrodes and EMG activities of intrinsic tongue muscles were recorded with hook-wire electrodes inserted into the anterior tongue body. Tongue position was detected by an isotonic transducer coupled to the tongue tip. Protrusive force was detected by a force transducer attached to a rigid bar. Genioglossus and intrinsic tongue muscles were simultaneously active in both impeded and unimpeded protrusion tasks. Genioglossus whole muscle EMG and single motor-unit activities changed faithfully as a function of tongue position, with increased discharge associated with protrusion and decreased discharge associated with retraction back to the rest position. In contrast, during the impeded protrusion task drive the genioglossus muscle remained constant as protrusion force increased. Conversely, intrinsic tongue muscle activities appropriately followed changes in both tongue position and force. Importantly, we observed significantly higher levels of intrinsic muscle activity in the impeded protrusion task. These observations suggest that protrusion of the human tongue requires activation of the genioglossus and intrinsic protrudor muscles, with the former more important for establishing anterior–posterior tongue location and the latter playing a greater role in the generation of protrusive force. A biomechanical model of these actions is provided and discussed...|$|R
