5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the <b>factory</b> <b>settings,</b> or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E

50|$|Foxton {{technology}} {{includes a}} highly advanced clock generation and distribution network. With this technology, the processor continuously measures total power draw, processor loads, voltage, and clock distribution quality {{across the entire}} device, {{and is able to}} produce extremely fine clock-to-voltage granularity under dynamic conditions. As a result, Foxton enables a processor to override <b>factory</b> adjusted <b>settings,</b> which are set at relatively high voltage levels at any given frequency to ensure stability against random voltage variances. By dynamically controlling voltage and frequencies across the entire device, Foxton is able to optimize performance for specific workloads, while ensuring that power consumption remains below specified thresholds.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of manufacturing systems {{becomes more and}} more significant in today’s factories due to the increasingly competitive market. As the rise of energy price, energy saving also becomes vital. The first step to increase efficiency and decrease energy use is to achieve real-time monitoring of the systems at the shop floor. Then the optimization of efficiency and energy use becomes possible. The use of modern information technologies is essential considering the large amount of information generated by the low level facilities. This thesis work presents the selection of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to improve the awareness of different manufacturing assets including those related to energy and efficiency. The implementation relies on Service Oriented Architecture deployed by web services and the further processing of the generated events by the application of an Event Processing Language based on rules. The processed data are displayed on web as graphics and updated in real time. On the other hand, in order to fully exploit the potential of optimization algorithms for efficiency and energy savings in <b>factory</b> automation <b>settings,</b> it is needed to bring together engineers that have knowledge of signal processing algorithms with shop floor engineers that are experienced with real manufacturing processes and <b>factory</b> automation <b>settings.</b> This thesis work exposes the captured raw data and KPIs as a web service so that third party applications can acquire the data via URLs for their own use. The InfoStore is currently populated with data regarding equipment IPC- 2541 state events, process/cell/production energy consumption, process/pallet production time, etc regarding a multi robot production line located at the premises of the Factory Automation Systems and Technology laboratory...|$|R

40|$|Hewlett Packard {{recently}} released a new security patch to fix an authentication bypass vulnerability in specific network printers. The Enterprise Security Office is using {{this opportunity to}} remind agencies {{of the importance of}} securing network printers in general. Network printers are frequently overlooked when securing office networks; sometimes left with default configurations and not patched, they represent a risk to the office network environment. Network based printers are much more than just a print device. They typically have full operating systems, hard drives, and a full complement of communication services. Built-in services such as ftp, tftp, e-mail, web server, and snmp are increasingly the target of choice for hackers wanting to remain undetected and to gain a foothold in the office network. Because network printer devices are frequently left unsecured with default passwords and utilizing <b>factory</b> default <b>settings</b> they are easy targets. Example attacks against printers include bridging between networks (i. e wireless to LAN or vice-versa), sniffing network traffic to steal sensitive data, redirection and spoofing of network traffic, malware distribution and email spam generation.

25|$|Some groups, such as PETA, promote vegetarianism {{as a way}} {{to offset}} poor {{treatment}} and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry. These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in <b>factory</b> and industrialised <b>settings,</b> and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing. However, the working conditions of agricultural workers as a whole, particularly non-permanent workers, remain poor and well below conditions prevailing in other economic sectors. Accidents, including pesticide poisoning, among farmers and plantation workers contribute to increased health risks, including increased mortality. According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous jobs in the world.|$|R

50|$|The {{start of}} World War II in 1939 {{effectively}} {{marked the end}} of Eckersley's partnership with Lombers, as they joined different military services and there was a decline in demand for commercial advertising. This led Eckersley to create posters for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), aimed at workers in <b>factories</b> and industrial <b>settings</b> that often supported the military in someway. These posters are striking in their bluntness; with little text it is the illustration that catches the eye. Most use block colours and cut out shapes to form the designs. Having originally joined the Royal Air Force and being charged with cartographic work, Eckersley was transferred to the Publicity Section of the Air Ministry, this allowed him to work from home and take commercial commissions again, for example from the General Post Office. In 1948 his contribution was recognised with the granting of an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to poster design. During the war the realisation of the posters ability to communicate complex messages was recognised, as propaganda messages were successfully conveyed by posters and mass media was developed.|$|R
