5000|$|Syntactic {{interoperability}} is {{a prerequisite}} for semantic interoperability. Syntactic interoperability refers to the packaging and transmission mechanisms for data. In healthcare, HL7 has been in use for over thirty years (which predates the internet and web technology), and uses the pipe character (|) as a <b>data</b> <b>delimiter.</b> The current internet standard for document markup is XML, which uses [...] "< >" [...] as a <b>data</b> <b>delimiter.</b> The data delimiters convey no meaning to the data other than to structure the data. Without a data dictionary to translate the contents of the delimiters, the data remains meaningless. While there are many attempts at creating data dictionaries and information models to associate with these data packaging mechanisms, none have been practical to implement. This has only perpetuated the ongoing [...] "babelization" [...] of data and inability to exchange of data with meaning.|$|E
