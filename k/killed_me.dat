Despite their great legacy, the Bothy Band only {{recorded}} three studio albums during their brief career: The Bothy Band (1975), Old Hag You Have <b>Killed</b> <b>Me</b> (1976), and Out of the Wind – Into the Sun (1977). A live album After Hours was released in 1979. Their first album quickly established them as an important new band. Their second album, Old Hag You Have <b>Killed</b> <b>Me,</b> expanded their following considerably. In 1977, they released their final studio album, effectively establishing their reputation and legacy within the Irish traditional music community.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} torture porn, and its boom during {{the mid to}} late 2000s, led to a cross over into genres other than horror. This became evident with the release of many crime thrillers, {{particularly}} the 2007 film I Know Who <b>Killed</b> <b>Me</b> starring Lindsay Lohan, and the 2008 film Untraceable, starring Diane Lane and Billy Burke. The British film WΔZ, starring Stellan Skarsgård and Selma Blair, and its US counterpart Scar, starring Angela Bettis and Ben Cotton continued to facilitate this hybrid form of torture porn, which was also to a lesser degree, evident in films such as Rendition (2007) starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Law Abiding Citizen (2009), and Unthinkable (2010) starring Samuel L. Jackson.|$|E
25|$|On April 2011, Hatfield {{announced}} her intention {{to work on}} a new album via fan-funding platform website PledgeMusic, from which she asked for her fans to help fund the project in exchange for personal artwork and memorabilia ranging from posters, CDs, demos, one of Juliana's First Act guitars (used during the recording sessions) and even locks of her hair. The project also included donations for the Save a Sato foundation to which Hatfield is a major contributor. Fan response was enthusiastic, going over 400% from the original project cost. The album was originally going to be titled Speeches Delivered to Animals and Plants, in reference to a passage in the John Irving novel The World According to Garp, but later Hatfield herself changed it for the title There's Always Another Girl, in reference to a song in the album of the same name she'd written as a defense for Lindsay Lohan after watching her flop I Know Who <b>Killed</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Corleonesi {{were also}} indicted in the Trial of the 114 {{related to the}} First Mafia War that {{resulted}} in the Ciaculli Massacre, that was also prepared by Terranova. During an interrogation preparing the trial, Leggio refused to answer questions. When in response to one of them, Leggio replied that he could not even recall his own name or his parents, Terranova instructed the clerk: “Write that Leggio does not know whose son he is.” Leggio was infuriated with the implication that he was a bastard. The incident {{was the beginning of a}} deep hatred by Leggio for Terranova. “Leggio actually had foam on his lips; he would have <b>killed</b> <b>me</b> on the spot if he could,” Terranova told his wife. The prosecution appealed successfully against the Catanzaro verdict that had acquitted Leggio and had him tried in absentia in 1970. This time Leggio was found guilty, although he had left jail after the Catanzaro trial, given the time they had already spent in detention while awaiting trial, and it was not until 1974 that Leggio was finally captured again and taken into custody.|$|E

Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship.

Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on.
