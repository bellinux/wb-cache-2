5|$|Established {{during the}} 1964 state highway renumbering, SR104 was formed {{out of four}} highways, {{themselves}} created in 1937: Secondary State Highway9E (SSH9E) from Discovery Bay to Port Gamble, Primary State Highway21 (PSH21) from Port Gamble to Kingston, SSH1W within Edmonds, and SSH2B from Edmonds to Lake Forest Park. PSH21 was originally part of State Road21, added to the state highway system in 1915 to connect the Port GambleShine <b>ferry</b> to the Kingston <b>ferry</b> landing. The EdmondsKingston <b>ferry</b> {{at the end of}} State Road21 has been in operation under various companies since 1923 and was served by the 14-car City of Edmonds. SSH9E extended from Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow initially and was moved south and extended to the South Point <b>ferry</b> landing in the late 1940s. The bridge replaced the South PointLofall <b>ferry</b> when it opened in 1961, but the <b>ferry</b> was re-used during the construction of the second Hood Canal Bridge after the first bridge sank in 1979 and before the new bridge opened in 1982. The EdmondsKingston <b>ferry</b> was added to the state <b>ferry</b> system in 1951 before it was incorporated into SR104 in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Prior to NYC <b>Ferry,</b> {{there had}} been many ferries that traversed the East River and Hudson River, {{although}} by the 1960s, almost all <b>ferry</b> services citywide had been discontinued due to the popularity of road and rail transit across the rivers. Ferries in New York City saw a revival in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of two studies in 2011 and 2013 that showed the impacts of these recent ferries, the city officially proposed its own <b>ferry</b> service in 2013, separate from existing New York City <b>ferry</b> systems such as NY Waterway, New York Water Taxi, and the Staten Island <b>Ferry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several ferries in the New York City {{area were}} {{affected}} when plans for NYC <b>Ferry</b> were made public. NY Waterway would give over its East River route to NYC <b>Ferry.</b> New York Water Taxi remained separate, but was to eliminate 200 jobs; it had stated {{that if it}} did not win the contract with the city to operate NYC <b>Ferry,</b> then it would shut down. Since the company did not win the NYC <b>Ferry</b> contract, it had been expected to shut down in October 2016, but continued operations {{through the end of the}} year before being purchased by Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises in January 2017. The city-owned Staten Island <b>Ferry</b> remains a separate entity. In addition, the <b>ferry</b> service would add 155 jobs to the New York Harbor area.|$|E
5000|$|Coastal-class <b>ferries,</b> {{also known}} as the [...] "Super-C class", are {{currently}} the largest double-ended <b>ferries</b> in the world, while the two single-ended Spirit-class <b>ferries</b> are the largest in the BC <b>Ferries</b> fleet.

The Block Island Fast <b>Ferry,</b> a high-speed catamaran to Block Island, runs several daily round trips during the summer months. The Fishers Island <b>Ferry</b> offers year-round local service to Fisher's Island, about 5 miles offshore, with multiple daily trips.|$|E
5|$|The Richmond Turnpike Company {{started a}} {{steamboat}} service from Manhattan to Staten Island in 1817. Cornelius Vanderbilt bought {{the company in}} 1838, and it was sold to the Staten Island Railroad Company in 1864. The Staten Island <b>Ferry</b> was then sold to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1884, and the City of New York assumed control of the <b>ferry</b> in 1905. The <b>ferry,</b> which still operates, was {{at one point the}} only commuter <b>ferry</b> within the entire city, after the discontinuation of the Hoboken <b>ferry</b> in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ferry</b> {{marks the}} {{starting}} point of the Great River Race and is on the course of the Twickenham Regatta. As the <b>ferry</b> has right-of-way over rowed craft, the races have to be carefully timed to ensure that the <b>ferry</b> does not interfere with their running.|$|E

5|$|The {{first part}} of the link, between Stord and Sveio, {{including}} the Stord Bridge and Bømlafjord Tunnel, was taken into use on 27 December 2000. The official opening and the National Road 542 opening took place on 30 April 2001. The opening of the first stage allowed two <b>ferry</b> services to be replaced, the Skjersholmane–Valevåg <b>Ferry,</b> which connected Stord to Sveio, and the Skjersholmane–Utbjoa <b>Ferry,</b> which connected Stord to Vindafjord. With the opening of the Bømlo connection, the two remaining ferries could be closed: the Sagvåg–Siggjarvåg <b>Ferry,</b> which connected Stord with Bømlo, and the Mosterhamn–Valevåg <b>Ferry,</b> which connected Bømlo to Sveio. The Langevåg–Buavåg <b>Ferry,</b> which connects the southern part of Bømlo to Sveio, was not closed. In 2000, the four closed <b>ferry</b> services transported 884,216 vehicles and 1,935,875 people.|$|E
5|$|The initial toll {{for cars}} was 3s (15p) {{for a single}} journey across the bridge, or 4/6 (22½p) for a return, while for lorries it was 14s (70p) and £1 respectively. The Saltash <b>Ferry</b> closed, but the Torpoint <b>Ferry</b> {{remained}} in operation; management of the <b>ferry</b> and the bridge is shared so the two crossings are not in direct competition with each other.|$|E

50|$|Wharf 3 is {{exclusively}} used by <b>ferries</b> on the Manly service. When the Freshwater class <b>ferries</b> {{were introduced}} in the 1980s, the wharf was rebuilt to accommodate their onboard gangways. It has a mezzanine level allowing <b>ferries</b> to disembark passengers from their upper decks. It also houses an office for Harbour City <b>Ferries.</b> To better accommodate the larger <b>ferries,</b> wharf 3 is built higher from the water and this combined with differently configured Opal card readers, means only Manly <b>ferries</b> can use the wharf.|$|R
40|$|Race is a {{dominant}} theme in South Carolina history. African Americans played a dual {{role in the}} history of South Carolina <b>ferries.</b> On one hand, they operated the <b>ferries,</b> first as slaves and later as freedmen; on the other hand, laws restricted their use of the <b>ferries.</b> Operating <b>ferries</b> was a skilled position that brought esteem; yet, <b>ferries</b> also were a place where slaves could escape. During Jim Crow, African Americans continued to work on <b>ferries,</b> but when they rode as passengers, they did so in separate sections of the boats. Segregation however did not dissuade African Americans from using <b>ferries</b> to connect their worlds to wider audiences. In the Progressive era, for example, modern <b>ferries</b> opened travel to the Sea Islands, integrating the largely isolated Gullah culture into the larger state. Often overlooked by historians and archaeologists, <b>ferries</b> played an important part in the transportation network that developed during the colonial period, and continued to operate until the twentieth century. Underwater archaeologist Christer Westerdahl argues that <b>ferries</b> and inland road networks were important because {{they were part of a}} larger maritime cultural landscape that includes ports, harbors, wharfs, and other structures. <b>Ferries</b> were “the first transit point at which river-based cultural area [met] the outer world ” (Westerdahl 1992 : 6). <b>Ferries</b> i...|$|R
