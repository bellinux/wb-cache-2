5|$|Overall, {{the risk}} of sinkholes {{occurring}} in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> is high and unpredictable. One recent, similar sinkhole had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 metres deep. The 2007 <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> sinkhole was formed by fluid from a sewer eroding uncemented volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits underlying <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b> The hazards around the pipe have since then been mitigated, by improved handling of the city's wastewater and runoff. Several rainstorms {{also contributed to the}} sinkhole's collapse, as stormwater percolated into the ground, further dissolving the rocks beneath <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b> The 2010 sinkhole was formed for similar reasons.|$|E
5|$|Stela 20 {{was found}} in Complex P, in Group H, and {{was moved to the}} Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sinkhole}} formed due to volcanic pumice deposits, {{upon which}} <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed {{long enough to}} create the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis also says that the <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b> Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.|$|E

5|$|Stela 3 bears a non-Maya calendrical date, {{one of the}} glyphs is cipactli, a {{crocodile}} head used to represent {{the first day of}} the 260-day calendar in central Mexico. This stela once stood next to Stela2 but was removed to a museum in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stela 3 {{is badly}} damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found {{somewhere on the}} San Isidro Piedra Parada {{plantation}} although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b> The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.|$|E

5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} upper part of the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could possibly be a better solution. This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E
5000|$|On April 5, 1993, a Boeing 767-200 {{operating}} as TACA Flight 510, overran the runway at <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City's</b> La Aurora International Airport {{due to an}} inability to brake on the flooded runway.|$|R

Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women. Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed. Haugen, President of IJM, went on to be named a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Hero in the 2012 US DoS TIP Report.|$|E
5|$|The Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología ("National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology") in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> {{displays}} {{a number of}} fine stelae, including three 9th-century stelae from Machaquilá, an 8th-century stela from Naranjo and other stelae from Ixtutz, Kaminaljuyu, LaAmelia, Piedras Negras, Seibal, Tikal, Uaxactun and Ucanal. The Museo Nacional de Antropología ("National Museum of Anthropology") in Mexico City has {{a small number of}} Maya stelae on display. The San Diego Museum of Man in California contains replicas of the stelae from Quiriguá that were made in 1915 for the Pacific-California Exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} the 1991 UNCAF Nations Cup {{qualifying}} competition for Central America {{took place in}} <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> on January 26, 1991. Six teams entered {{to compete for the}} three remaining places in the competition, alongside eventual host Costa Rica. The teams were divided into three groups of two. As the host nation of the event, Costa Rica qualified automatically. The qualifying process began in April 1991 and concluded in May 1991. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage, the three group winners qualified for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The sinkhole's {{collapse}} in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City's</b> Zona 2 left at least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at risk. Because {{of the role}} played by sewage pipes in the sinkhole's collapse, Sam Bonis, along with other geologists, has demanded that the government inspect the sewer system more regularly.|$|R

One {{of these is the}} country's most distinguished literary prize, the Miguel Ángel Asturias National Prize in Literature. In addition, <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City's</b> national theatre, the Centro Cultural Miguel Ángel Asturias, is named after him.|$|R

5|$|Within the Quichean sub-branch K'iche' (Quiché), the Mayan {{language}} {{with the largest}} number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 K'iche' Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the Cuchumatán mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b> The famous Maya mythological document, Popol Vuh, is written in an antiquated K'iche' often called Classical K'iche' (or Quiché). The K'iche' culture was at its pinnacle {{at the time of the}} Spanish conquest. Q'umarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del Quiché, was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is spoken by 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two municipios of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of K'iche'. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as K'iche'. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> westward to the northern shore of Lake Atitlán. Tz'utujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán. Other members of the K'ichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in El Quiché department, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 people in Sipacapa, San Marcos.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Congress in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City,</b> Guatemala on January 26, 1991, the {{qualification}} rounds for {{the inaugural}} CONCACAF Gold Cup was decided upon. Since Costa Rica {{were given a}} bye into the competition due to its first place standing at the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which {{also served as a}} qualification phase for the FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy in 1990, they weren't required to participate in the preliminary stages. However, the final qualification round of the Central American zone had two bids: the United States and Costa Rica. Costa Rica won the bid and was named by CONCACAF and UNCAF as the host nation of the inaugural UNCAF Nations Cup tournament on February 19, 1991.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, {{the editor}} of El Imparcial, the main {{opposition}} newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters {{reaching out to the}} leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts to rig them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit their fear of the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City</b> in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} in 1944 left {{many of the}} biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Arévalo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened the labor movement {{to the point where}} Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing the repressive vagrancy law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Arévalo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b> From the beginning, the new unions that were formed fell into two camps, those that were communist and those that were not. The repressive policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Under Guatemalan law, Maya stelae {{and other}} archaeological {{artefacts}} are {{property of the}} Guatemalan government {{and may not be}} removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquilá Stela2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove. The stela itself was cut into pieces, with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in Belize, where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California. There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions. The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Árbenz's resignation, {{his family}} {{remained}} for 73 {{days at the}} Mexican embassy in <b>Guatemala</b> <b>City,</b> which was crowded with almost 300 exiles. During this period, the CIA initiated {{a new set of}} operations against Árbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. The CIA obtained some of Árbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after doctoring the documents. The CIA also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as Árbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, Jacobo Árbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry he had bought for his wife, María Cristina Villanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of Árbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced largely by the CIA's campaign.|$|E
