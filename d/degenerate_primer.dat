50|$|Array CGH {{has been}} {{implemented}} using {{a wide variety}} of techniques. Therefore, some of the advantages and limitations of array CGH are dependent on the technique chosen.The initial approaches used arrays produced from large insert genomic DNA clones, such as BACs. The use of BACs provides sufficient intense signals to detect single-copy changes and to locate aberration boundaries accurately. However, initial DNA yields of isolated BAC clones are low and DNA amplification techniques are necessary. These techniques include ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR), <b>degenerate</b> <b>primer</b> PCR using one or several sets of primers, and rolling circle amplification. Arrays can also be constructed using cDNA. These arrays currently yield a high spatial resolution, but the number of cDNAs is limited by the genes that are encoded on the chromosomes, and their sensitivity is low due to cross-hybridization. This results in the inability to detect single copy changes on a genome wide scale. The latest approach is spotting the arrays with short oligonucleotides. The amount of oligos is almost infinite, and the processing is rapid, cost-effective, and easy. Although oligonucleotides do not have the sensitivity to detect single copy changes, averaging of ratios from oligos that map next to each other on the chromosome can compensate for the reduced sensitivity. It is also possible to use arrays which have overlapping probes so that specific breakpoints may be uncovered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{multiplex}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (MP-PCR) is a quick and an inexpensive technique in molecular biology for amplify-ing multiple DNA loci in a single Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). One of the criteria to achieve highly specific reaction products {{is to keep the}} concentration of the amplification primers low. In research, the dilemma associated with primer minimization for MP-PCR reac-tions has been formulated as the Multiple <b>Degenerate</b> <b>Primer</b> Selection Problem (MDPSP). MDPSP is related to the earlier <b>Degenerate</b> <b>Primer</b> Design (DPD) problem that has proven to be NP-complete. This paper formulates a new, so far, unexplored variant, the Multiple <b>Degenerate</b> <b>Primer</b> Selection Problem with Errors (MDPSPE) and introduces algo-rithm DPS-HDE for solving this new version. Implementing DPS-HDE on randomly generated datasets greatly reduced the number of primers in the output and the time of execution. Furthermore, we also introduce a new exact algorithm, DPS-HDR for solving the earlier MDPSP and compare the algorithm’s performance on randomly generated datasets with DPS-HD, thus far the most efficient algorithm for solving MDPSP introduced by Balla et al. in [2].

40|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) is widely used to uncover new information about genes and genomes, but is limited {{in that it is}} highly dependent on the use of specific and sensitive primers to yield good results.

40|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) is sensitive to mismatches between primer and template, and mismatches can lead to inefficient amplification of targeted regions of DNA template. In PCRs in which a <b>degenerate</b> <b>primer</b> pool is employed, each primer can behave differently. Therefore, inefficiencies due to different primer melting temperatures within a <b>degenerate</b> <b>primer</b> pool, in addition to mismatches between primer binding sites and primers, {{can lead to a}} distortion of the true relative abundance of targets in the original DNA pool. A theoretical analysis indicated that a combination of primer-template and primer-amplicon interactions during PCR cycles 3 - 12 is potentially responsible for this distortion. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel amplification strategy, entitled "Polymerase-exonuclease (PEX) PCR", in which primer-template interactions and primer-amplicon interactions are separated. The PEX PCR method substantially and significantly improved the evenness of recovery of sequences from a mock community of known composition, and allowed for amplification of templates with introduced mismatches near the 3 ' end of the primer annealing sites. When the PEX PCR method was applied to genomic DNA extracted from complex environmental samples, a significant shift in the observed microbial community was detected. Furthermore, the PEX PCR method provides a mechanism to identify which primers in a primer pool are annealing to target gDNA. Primer utilization patterns revealed that at high annealing temperatures in the PEX PCR method, perfect match annealing predominates, while at lower annealing temperatures, primers with up to four mismatches with templates can contribute substantially to amplification. The PEX PCR method is simple to perform, is limited to PCR mixes and a single exonuclease step which can be performed without reaction cleanup, and is recommended for reactions in which <b>degenerate</b> <b>primer</b> pools are used or when mismatches between primers and template are possible...|$|E

We used either previously published primers {{which have been}} claimed able to amplify all possible gene copies, or newly designed primers located at conserve domain of each gene to isolate these floral symmetry gene copies. For example, for isolating CYC homologues from C. ramondioides, a pair of Geseneriaceae specific primers, GcycFS and GcycR, were used for amplifying CYC homologues (Möller et al. 1999). For RAD, primers were design from conserved MYB domain with all available GenBank sequences from Gesneriaceae species and Antirrhinum. Similarly, DIV primers were design from conserved R 2 and R 3 domain. To isolate CYC homologues from C. ramondioides, The PCR products were then cloned into pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega, USA) and 8 clones were sequenced for checking numbers of CYC homologues of C. ramondioides.

Conserved sites are found by comparing sequences and so the usefulness {{of a set of}} primers depends crucially on how well the known sequences represent the target group including unknown sequences. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a method for assessing the apparent stability of consensus sequences at sites over time using deposition dates from Genbank. We tested the method using 17 conserved sites in potyvirus genomes. The accumulation of knowledge of sequence variants over 20 years caused 'consensus decay' of the sites. Rates of decay were rapid at all sites but varied widely and as a result, the ranking of the most conserved sites changed. The discovery and reporting of sequences from previously unknown and distinct species, rather than from strains of known species, dominated the decay, indicating it was largely a sampling effect related to the progressive discovery of species, and recent virus mutation was probably only a minor contributing factor. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We showed that in the past, the sampling bias has misled the choice of the most conserved target sites for genus specific <b>degenerate</b> <b>primers.</b> The history of sequence discoveries indicates primer designs should be updated regularly and provides an additional dimension for improving the design of <b>degenerate</b> <b>primers...</b>|$|R
