Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves.

25|$|In 1984, The Mystery of Life's Origin {{was first}} published. It was co-authored by chemist and creationist Charles B. Thaxton with Walter L. Bradley and Roger L. Olsen, the {{foreword}} written by Dean H. Kenyon, and {{sponsored by the}} Christian-based Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE). The work presented scientific arguments against current theories of abiogenesis and offered an hypothesis of special creation instead. While the focus of creation science had until that time centered primarily on the criticism of the fossil evidence for evolution and validation of the creation myth of the Bible, this new work posed the question whether science reveals that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> living systems were far too complex to have developed by natural, unguided processes.|$|E
25|$|Citation: On 26 August 1967, Colonel Day {{was forced}} to eject from his {{aircraft}} over North Vietnam when it was hit by ground fire. His right arm was broken in 3 places, and his left knee was badly sprained. He was immediately captured by hostile forces and taken to a prison camp where he was interrogated and severely tortured. After causing the guards to relax their vigilance, Col. Day escaped into the jungle and began the trek toward South Vietnam. Despite injuries inflicted by fragments of a bomb or rocket, he continued southward surviving only on a few berries and uncooked frogs. He successfully evaded enemy patrols and reached the Bến Hải River, where he encountered U.S. artillery barrages. With {{the aid of a}} bamboo log float, Col. Day swam across the river and entered the demilitarized zone. Due to delirium, he lost his sense of direction and wandered aimlessly for several days. After several unsuccessful attempts to signal U.S. aircraft, he was ambushed and recaptured by the Viet Cong, sustaining gunshot wounds to his left hand and thigh. He was returned to the prison from which he had escaped and later was moved to Hanoi after giving his captors false information to questions put before him. Physically, Col. Day was totally debilitated and unable to perform <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> task for himself. Despite his many injuries, he continued to offer maximum resistance. His personal bravery in the face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy. Col. Day's conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{intricate}} designs of the Transformers, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts; each of Ironhide's guns {{are made of}} ten thousand parts. Bumblebee uses a piece below his face-plate as an eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the characters' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten. According to Bay, [...] "The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement"; that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities. Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to look [...] "cool", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing {{was the key to}} making the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies. Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.|$|E
500|$|At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky {{was visited}} by Tatiana Melnik, née Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, {{the head of}} the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the {{daughter}} of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though [...] "the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was." [...] In a letter, Melnik wrote: [...] "Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration... <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight." [...] Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state. Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to [...] "aid the patient's weak memory" [...] or as part of a deliberate charade, Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> kinetochores {{consist of}} more than 19 {{different}} proteins. These 19 different proteins interact in mysterious ways: grasping on to one another, contracting to different movements, etc. Many of these proteins are conserved between eukaryotic species, including a specialized histone H3 variant (called CENP-A or CenH3) which helps the kinetochore associate with DNA. Other proteins in the kinetochore attach it to the microtubules (MTs) of the mitotic spindle. [...] There are also motor proteins, including both dynein and kinesin, which generate forces that move chromosomes during mitosis. [...] Other proteins, such as Mad2, monitor the microtubule attachment {{as well as the}} tension between sister kinetochores and activate the spindle checkpoint to arrest the cell cycle when either of these is absent.|$|E
2500|$|Though Hoyle {{declared}} himself an atheist, this apparent {{suggestion of a}} guiding hand {{led him to the}} conclusion that [...] "a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and ... there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature." [...] He would go on to compare the random emergence of <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> cell without panspermia to the likelihood that [...] "a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein" [...] and to compare the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of amino acids to a solar system full of blind men solving Rubik's Cubes simultaneously. Those who advocate the intelligent design (ID) belief sometimes cite Hoyle's work in this area to support the claim that the universe was fine tuned in order to allow intelligent life to be possible. Alfred Russel of the Uncommon Descent community has even gone so far as labeling Hoyle [...] "an atheist for ID".|$|E
