5|$|A public {{survey in}} October 2008 {{revealed}} 62% of adults would vote Yes in a referendum to extend civil marriage to same-sex couples. A {{breakdown of the}} results shows that support is strongest among younger people and in urban areas. Women were more supportive at 68% compared to 56% of men. There was slightly less support for same-sex couples being given the right to adopt. A total of 58% of those under 50 believe same-sex couples {{should be able to}} adopt, falling to 33% among the over-50s. A total of 54% believe the definition of the <b>family</b> <b>unit</b> in the Irish Constitution should be changed to include same-sex families.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses {{a significant amount of}} weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a <b>family</b> <b>unit</b> until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.|$|E
5|$|Carmella was {{the second}} member of the Cammeniti family to appear in Neighbours, after her father, Rocco (Robert Forza). She was later joined by her mother, sister, and two cousins. She had long-standing {{relationships}} with Marco Silvani (Jesse Rosenfeld) and Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin), {{the father of her}} daughter, Chloe (Sarah May). When Blair resigned from the serial in 2007 in order to pursue new projects, the producers arranged for a separated Carmella and Oliver to reunite. The two briefly returned three years later, to consolidate their <b>family</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
25|$|OPP’s {{research}} revealed {{two significant}} factors; first, there was unlimited demand for {{products and services}} of these <b>family</b> <b>units.</b> Second, the <b>family</b> <b>units</b> were extremely competitive (on account of very low over heads and very cheap and docile labour). The working <b>family</b> <b>units</b> of Orangi were completely integrated with the main Karachi markets. In fact many units are supplying goods to famous firms, who just put their labels and make big profits. What is required is to support their initiatives.|$|R

5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a <b>family</b> <b>unit</b> and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at this point that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a <b>family</b> <b>unit</b> for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a <b>family</b> <b>unit</b> of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{as they were in}} a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E

5|$|Naming is a {{symbolic}} {{tradition of the}} islands' Maori population. Names form a link not only to ancestors, descendents, and friends, but to titles and land, as well as events and relationships. Dreamed or created, name change {{are not limited to}} events, such as birth, marriage, and death, but can also occur in association with a bad omen. First names are interchangeable between men and women, while surnames can vary from person to person within a <b>family</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until the 1990s, {{the breed}} was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so {{relatively}} few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter {{and as a}} watchdog, and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter. It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the <b>family</b> <b>unit.</b> Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua, the two are often compared.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional <b>family</b> <b>unit.</b> In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E

5000|$|Helots {{lived in}} <b>family</b> <b>units</b> and could, at least [...] de facto, {{contract}} unions among themselves. Since helots {{were much less}} susceptible than other slaves in Greek antiquity to having their <b>family</b> <b>units</b> dispersed, they could reproduce themselves, or at least maintain their number. Probably not insignificant to begin with, their population increased {{in spite of the}} crypteia, other massacres of helots (see below), and losses in war. Simultaneously, the population of Spartiate citizens declined.|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all forms of}} {{economic}} activity in the modern boundaries of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Northern Britain in the fifth century, until the advent of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century, including agriculture, crafts and trade. Having between a fifth or sixth of the arable or good pastoral land and roughly the same amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture.

5|$|Although Triceratops are {{commonly}} portrayed as herding animals, {{there is currently}} little evidence that they lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals, to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. Another, more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups. In 2012, a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a <b>family</b> <b>unit,</b> but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus, particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a <b>family</b> <b>unit,</b> but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E

5|$|The social {{structures}} of the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eaters {{have been described as}} more complex than for any other bird species. The birds exist in colonies located on nesting cliffs, and have a stable structure all year round. These colonies typically contain five to 50 burrows, occasionally up to 200, and are composed of clans of two or three pairs, their helpers, and their offspring. The helpers are male offspring from a previous year. Within the colony, the males alternate between guarding their mate and attempting to make forced copulations with other females. The females in turn attempt to lay eggs in their neighbour's nests, an example of brood parasitism. Some individuals also specialise in kleptoparasitism, stealing prey collected by other colony members. The colony's daily routine is to emerge from the nesting holes or roosting branches soon after dawn, preen and sun themselves for an hour, then disperse to feed. Feeding territories are divided by clan, with each clan defending its territory from all others of the same species, including clans of the same colony. The clans return to the colony before dusk, and engage in more social behaviour before retiring for the night. Colonies are situated several hundred metres apart and {{have little to do with}} each other, although young individuals may disperse between colonies. As such these species can be thought to have four tiers of social kinship, the individual pair, the <b>family</b> <b>unit,</b> the clan and the colony as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Family reunification (which {{can also}} be a form of resettlement) is a {{recognized}} reason for immigration in many countries.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Assets and Debts Survey of 1984 and the Survey of Financial Security of 1999, we {{document}} the evolution of wealth inequality in Canada between 1984 and 1999. Our main findings are as follows: 1) wealth inequality has increased between 1984 and 1999, 2) the growth in wealth inequality {{has been associated with}} substantial declines in real average and median wealth for young couples with children and recent immigrants, 3) real median wealth and real average wealth rose much more among <b>family</b> <b>units</b> whose major income recipient is a university graduate than among other <b>family</b> <b>units,</b> 4) real median and average wealth fell among <b>family</b> <b>units</b> whose major income recipient is aged 25 - 34 and increased among those whose major income recipient is aged 55 and over, 5) the aging of the Canadian population over the 1984 - 1999 period has tended to reduce wealth inequality, 6) diverging changes in permanent income do not explain {{a substantial portion of the}} growing gap between low-wealth and high-wealth <b>family</b> <b>units.</b> Factors that may have contributed to rising wealth inequality - which cannot be quantified with existing data sets - include differences in the growth of inheritances, inter vivos transfers, rates of return on savings and number of years worked full-time. In particular, rates of return on savings may have increased more for wealthy <b>family</b> <b>units</b> than for their poorer counterparts as a result of the booming stock market during the 1990 s.
