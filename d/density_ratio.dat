500|$|Because {{titanium}} alloys have {{high tensile strength}} to <b>density</b> <b>ratio,</b> high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|E

Comput. Phys. 231 (2012), no. 17, 5788 – 5804. Summary: “We present an efficient time-stepping scheme for simulations of the coupled Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard equations for the phase field approach. The scheme has several attractive characteristics: (i) it {{is suitable for}} large <b>density</b> <b>ratios,</b> and numerical experiments with <b>density</b> <b>ratios</b> up to 1000 have been presented; (ii) it involves only constant (time-independent) coefficient matrices for all flow variables, which can be pre-computed during pre-processing, so it effectively overcomes the performance bottleneck induced by variable coefficient matrices associated with the variable density and variable viscosity; (iii) it completely de-couples the computations of the velocity, pressure, and the phase field function. Strategy for spectral-element type spatial discretizations to overcome the difficulty associated with the large spatial order of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is also discussed. Ample numerical simulations demonstrate that the current algorithm, together with the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard phase field approach, is an efficient and effective method for studying two-phase flows involving large <b>density</b> <b>ratios,</b> moving contact lines, and interfacial topology changes. ...|$|R

40|$|Bayes {{classifiers}} for functional data pose a challenge. This {{is because}} probability density functions {{do not exist}} for functional data. As a consequence, the classical Bayes classifier using density quotients needs to be modified. We propose to use <b>density</b> <b>ratios</b> of projections on a sequence of eigenfunctions that are common to the groups to be classified. The <b>density</b> <b>ratios</b> can then be factored into <b>density</b> <b>ratios</b> of individual functional principal components whence the classification problem is reduced to a sequence of nonparametric one-dimensional density estimates. This is an extension to functional data {{of some of the}} very earliest nonparametric Bayes classifiers that were based on simple <b>density</b> <b>ratios</b> in the one-dimensional case. By means of the factorization of the density quotients the curse of dimensionality that would otherwise severely affect Bayes classifiers for functional data can be avoided. We demonstrate {{that in the case of}} Gaussian functional data, the proposed functional Bayes classifier reduces to a functional version of the classical quadratic discriminant. A study of the asymptotic behavior of the proposed classifiers in the large sample limit shows that under certain conditions the misclassification rate converges to zero, a phenomenon that has been referred to as "perfect classification". The proposed classifiers also perform favorably in finite sample applications, as we demonstrate in comparisons with other functional classifiers in simulations and various data applications, including wine spectral data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, and yeast gene expression data...|$|R
