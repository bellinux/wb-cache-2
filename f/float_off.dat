5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her <b>float</b> <b>off</b> the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will <b>float</b> <b>off</b> into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings <b>float</b> <b>off</b> the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E

25|$|The {{starboard}} wingtip was {{the first}} to make impact with the water, severing the right wing between the number 3 and 4 engines. The impact caused the tail to break off and <b>float</b> <b>off</b> 50 yards from the main wreckage. The main fuselage now floated at an angle of 45 degrees with the rear open fuselage pointing towards the sky.|$|E
25|$|Plastoglobuli {{form when}} a bubble appears between {{the layers of}} the lipid bilayer of the {{thylakoid}} membrane, or bud from existing plastoglubuli—though they never detach and <b>float</b> <b>off</b> into the stroma. Practically all plastoglobuli form {{on or near the}} highly curved edges of the thylakoid disks or sheets. They are also more common on stromal thylakoids than on granal ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{extracted}} ore {{is treated}} at the Kennecott smelter at nearby Magna, Utah. The ore is {{run through a}} concentrator, where huge grinding mills reduce it to the consistency of face powder. Flotation then separates the gangue from the metalliferous particles, which <b>float</b> <b>off</b> as a 28-percent concentrate of copper along with lesser amounts of silver, gold, lead, molybdenum, platinum and palladium. A selective flotation step separates the molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide) from the chalcopyrite.|$|E
50|$|The Aasta Hansteen spar will be {{built on}} its side in the Dry Dock on barges. Once built it will be <b>floated</b> <b>off</b> the barges and then floated onto the heavy {{transport}} ship, Dockwise Vanguard and shipped to a fjord in West Norway. The Vanguard will then be partially submerged allowing the spar to be <b>floated</b> <b>off</b> the ship. The Spar will be upended in the fjord and towed vertically to the Aasta Hansteen field and anchored to the sea bed.|$|R

25|$|The {{lightweight}} demand helmets {{in general}} use by surface-supplied divers are integrally ballasted for neutral buoyancy in the water, {{so they do}} not <b>float</b> <b>off</b> the diver's head or pull upwards on the neck, but the larger volume free-flow helmets would be too heavy and cumbersome if they had all the required weight built in. Therefore, they are either ballasted after dressing the diver by fastening weights to the lower parts of the helmet assembly, so the weight is carried on the shoulders when out of the water, or the helmet may be held down by a jocking strap and the harness weights provide the ballast.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperatures}} {{needed to}} break down dioxin are typically not reached when burning plastics outdoors in a burn barrel or garbage pit, causing high dioxin emissions as mentioned above. While plastic does usually burn in an open-air fire, the dioxins remain after combustion and either <b>float</b> <b>off</b> into the atmosphere, or may remain in the ash {{where it can be}} leached down into groundwater when rain falls on the ash pile. Fortunately, dioxin and furan compounds bond very strongly to solid surfaces and are not dissolved by water, so leaching processes are limited to the first few millimeters below the ash pile. The gas-phase dioxins can be substantially destroyed using catalysts, some of which can be present as part of the fabric filter bag structure.|$|E
500|$|Deep in the {{southern}} waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn {{that there is a}} warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Carl's sound technician as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. The matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word [...] "Kong". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack and return to the ship. They lighten their load to <b>float</b> <b>off</b> the rocks and carry out repairs, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, a [...] tall gorilla. The crew returns fully armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann and flees into the jungle. Ann wins Kong over with juggling and dancing, and begins to grasp Kong's intelligence and capacity for emotion.|$|E

2500|$|Graphite is mined by both {{open pit}} and {{underground}} methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation. This may {{be carried out}} by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and [...] "marks" [...] (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the [...] "marked" [...] gangue particles <b>float</b> <b>off</b> with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue).|$|E
