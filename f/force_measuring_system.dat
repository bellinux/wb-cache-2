If a force in a definite direction is to be detected, a force feed-in system is necessary. Its task is to separate forces from other directions. In the case of low force measurement the feed-in system has a significant influence on {{the accuracy of the}} whole <b>force</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>system.</b> This paper analyses the requirements for the force feed-in system depending on the properties of the force sensitive element.

Three categories of tillage <b>force</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>systems</b> were built by several researchers: Sensors incorporated in the tillage tools, a separate frame between the tractor and the tool and the installation of transducers in the three-point hitch-mechanism. In the present work a system from the third category was built, calibrated and tested in the field. The innovation in this system {{is its ability to}} calculate the three orthogonal components of the tillage effort in relation with the tool penetration. A dynamic calculus program was developed to take into consideration the changes of the three-point hitch-mechanism geometry during the tillage operation.

40|$|In January of 1935, {{definite}} {{steps were}} taken in a two part program to modernize the ten-foot wind tunnel of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. Part one {{of the program was}} the design and construction of a new wind tunnel rigging system based on concepts originally laid down by Dr. A. L. Klein, Associate Professor at the same institution. Part two of the program, to be carried on intensively immediately after completion of part one, will be the development of an entirely new <b>force</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> to replace the present modified steelyard type balances. In this paper the general problem of wind tunnel testing and equipment will be briefly outlined with the bulk of the discussion then given over to the problems concerning the evolution and design of a specific wind tunnel rigging system. As the system is not yet complete in its final form obviously there can be no description of the project as a finished piece of work. Also, it has been thought inadvisable to present only the system as it exists at present, therefore all the various features or principles that have been considered will be discussed and reason for their discard or adoption made clear. The result should then be a guide or at least an aid to the completion of part one of the modernizing program. In a latter section of the paper some of the desired features of the contemplated <b>force</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> will be set down in the hope that they may be a skeletal set of requirements for {{the second part of the}} modernizing program. ...|$|E

End-effector development is a key technology for transplanting plug seedlings. Most existing end-effectors have problems with holding root plugs or releasing plugs. An efficient end-effector driven by a linear pneumatic cylinder was designed in this study, which could hold root plugs firmly and release plugs easily. This end-effector with four needles could clamp the plug simultaneously while the needles penetrate into the substrate. The depth and verticality of the needles could be adjusted conveniently for different seedling trays. The effectiveness of this end-effector was tested by a combinational trial examining three seedling nursery factors (the moisture content of the substrate, substrate bulk density and the volume proportion of substrate ingredients). Results showed that the total transplanting success rate for the end-effector was 100 %, and the root plug harm rate was below 17 %. A <b>force</b> <b>measure</b> <b>system</b> with tension and pressure transducers was installed on the designed end-effector. The adhesive force FL between the root plug and the cell of seedling trays and the extrusion force FK on the root plug were measured and analyzed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} uninjured and recurrent sprained ankles during single leg standing, {{both with}} and without visual input, and the contribution of related proprioceptive feedback in this event. METHODS: A <b>force</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> was used for monitoring reaction forces in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions during single leg standing.

RESULTS: Foot-ground reaction forces in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were the same in normal and sprained ankles of each subject while standing with either open or closed eyes. However, standing with closed eyes, irrespective of the ankle status, always produced significantly higher reaction forces than those obtained with open eyes (P < 0. 05).

Methods: Thirty-one children with class III malocclusion were investigated and their perioral <b>forces</b> were <b>measured</b> at rest and during swallowing under natural head position by a custom-made miniperioral <b>force</b> computer <b>measuring</b> <b>system.</b> Results: The resting pressures exerted on the labial side and palatine side of the upper left incisor, {{as well as the}} labial side and lingual side of the lower left incisor, were 0 g/cm 2, 0 g/cm 2, 0. 57 g/cm 2 and 0. 23 g/cm 2, respectively. Correspondingly, the swallowing forces were 2. 87 g/cm 2, 5. 97 g/cm 2, 4. 09 g/cm 2 and 7. 89 g/cm 2, respectively. No statistical difference between muscular pressure and gender existed. During swallowing, the lingual forces were significantly higher than the labial forces (P< 0. 01), however, at rest there was no significantly different force between these two sides. Compared to the normal occlusion patients, children with class III malocclusion had lower perioral forces. The upper labial resting forces (P< 0. 01), the lower labial resting forces (P< 0. 05) and all the swallowing pressures from the lips and the tongue (P< 0. 01) showed statistical differences between the two different occlusion conditions. Meanwhile, no significant difference was found for the resting pressure from the tongue between class III malocclusion and normal occlusion. Conclusion: Patients with class III malocclusion have lower perioral forces and this muscle hypofunction may be secondary to the spatial relations of the jaws.

As can be seen, the results reveal one common feature, i. e. the higher the compressional properties the higher the seam sewability index (less sewing troubles). By providing reinforcement the technical textiles improve the performance of paved roads, and others...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a quantitative biomechanical evaluation method for contact forces exerted during a manual examination and treatment technique used in a learning environment. The evaluation was based on three-dimensional (3 D) force component data. METHODS: A hand-/palm-held computerized 3 D <b>force</b> component <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> was used during a simple feedback experiment involving 20 second-year university students of physiotherapy who delivered 5 sets of graded perpendicular manual push forces on the sensor part of the system, which was placed on the padded surface of an examination/treatment table. In an effect study with a multiple time-series design, a randomly chosen subgroup of subjects received concurrent visual 3 D kinetic/dynamic force-time feedback. RESULTS: The students delivered graded perpendicular forces with good intrasubject consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient [3, 1]: mean, 0. 80; range, 0. 76 - 0. 88) but with poor intersubject consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient [2, 1]: mean, 0. 38; range, 0. 15 - 0. 74). A temporary performance improvement in forward-backward force direction deviations from the perpendicular in the subgroup given feedback indicates that students are sensitive to feedback training. CONCLUSION: An evaluation tool using 3 D contact force component measurement enables the assessment of the overall magnitude of the manual contact force as well as its directional aspect. Compared with existing evaluations based on 1 -dimensional force components, this 3 D system allows for a more complete and, at the same time, more specific quantitative evaluation of the manual contact forces. Three-dimensional dynamic/kinetic augmented feedback has the additional potential of helping students and practitioners to improve their palpation and force delivery skills. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Methods for {{hardness}} measurement on elastomers {{are characterized by}} a set-up where indenters with various defined geometries are pressed under defined test forces into the surface of testing material. The hardness value represents {{the resistance of the}} material to the rigid indenter and is calculated from the indentation depth of the indenter in the to be tested material. The test methods IRHD and Shore are the most common methods used in the field of rubber {{hardness measurement}}s. Appropriate hardness measuring instruments are spread world wide. A periodic verification has to be carried out to assure the accuracy of these measuring instruments. Direct and indirect verification methods are recommended to be used. For the indirect method rubber hardness reference blocks are used. This indirect verification method is especially appropriate for the daily check of hand held rubber hardness testers. On the other side the direct verification of test <b>force,</b> depth <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> and indenter geometry is suited for the periodic calibration of rubber hardness testers. For the rubber hardness reference blocks their accurate hardness reference value and the long-term stability are the most important characteristics. In this paper the long-term behaviour of hardness of rubber blocks which at present are available on the market and are made by different producers is presented. For the measurements the Shore and IRHD hardness standard devices in the PTB have been used. In order to determine the relationship between hardness and time under the specified conditions a regression analysis of the obtained measurement results was carried out. The results of this analysis can be used for the improvement of quality assurance systems in the field of rubber hardness measurements...|$|R
