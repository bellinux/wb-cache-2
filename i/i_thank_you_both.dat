If a vacancy should not occur shortly I will place you in another regiment until one may happen in your own corps. To you, sergeant, I give a commission as officer. You will take that rank at once, and will be a supernumerary in your regiment till a vacancy occurs. Such promotion has been well and worthily won by you both." ...|$|E

However, while <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> just as much as if the bargain was made, and Rivenoak, {{or any of the other}} vagabonds, was here to accept and close the treaty, there's two principal reasons why it can never come to pass, which may be as well told at once, in order no onlikely expectations may be raised in you, or any onjustifiable hopes in me." ...|$|E

40|$|Inspiring My Motivation Daily iii Acknowledgements I {{would like}} to thank my family and friends for inspiring me to {{research}} a topic I was passionate about and for their willingness to listen to me talk about it relentlessly for months. Without their love and support I would not have felt compelled to challenge myself beyond what I thought I was capable of. Additionally, special thanks go to my thesis committee for all their support and hard work on this project. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> to Michael DeAngelis for your helpful feedback and encouragement, both during the early stages of development as well as throughout the writing process. Also, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> to Luisela Alvaray for your invaluable feedback on content that challenged and encouraged my research to surpass my own expectations. <b>I</b> cannot <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> enough for your dedication to improving my work and aiding my academic curiosity...|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th, inclosing {{the letter}} of HON. John Minor Botts, was duly received. The latter is {{herewith}} returned according to your request. It contains {{one of the many}} assurances I receive from the South, that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort to break up the Union. The people of the South have too much of good sense and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least so I hope and believe. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> for your own letter and a sight of that of Mr. Botts.|$|E

Never have they shown greater courage and endurance. Well may Monk say that, {{after four days}} of incessant {{fighting}} and four nights spent in the labour of repairing damages, the strength of all has well-nigh come to an end, and that he himself can write but a few lines to tell me of what has happened, leaving all details for further occasion. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> gentlemen, for {{the speed with which}} you have brought me this welcome news, and for the services of which the Duke of Albemarle speaks so warmly. This is the second time, Sir Cyril, that my admirals have had occasion to speak of great and honourable service rendered by you. Lord Oliphant, the Earl, your father, will have reason to be proud when he hears you so highly praised. Now, gentlemen, tell me more fully than is done in these despatches as to the incidents of the fighting. I have heard something of what took place in the first two days from an officer who posted up from Harwich yesterday." ...|$|E

40|$|Where do I even begin? There are so {{many people}} without whom this thesis would never have come into existence. Let me start with the primary {{mathematical}} con-tributors. This list must, of course, begin with my amazing advisor Wolfgang Ziller. Between the weekly individual meetings and the department’s worst kept secret, the ”secret seminar”, I had just the right impetus to keep making progress not only on my thesis, but in my understanding of geometry as a whole. To the secret seminar crowd, both current and past- Lee, Marco, Ricardo, Chenxu, John, Martin, Corey, Will, Jeffrey, Luigi, and all the other more sporadic attenders, I am sure I have plagued you with more questions than I should have and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for <b>both</b> your answers and your patience. To the rest of the math department, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> as well for you ear at pizza seminar and your help, especially during my first and second year classes. To the office staff, Janet, Monica, Paula, and Robin, without you all, the de-partment would cease functioning.

To my mother Margarita Vargas and my grandfather Jose Vargas, I owe you a debt of gratitude for all that you have taught me and continue to teach me every day about kindness, love, and unconditional support. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> to my son Derek and my partner Will, without whom I would not be who or where I am today. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> and love <b>you</b> <b>both</b> more than <b>you</b> will ever know.

Acknowledgements This dissertation {{would not have}} been possible without training, assistance, and encouragement from several key people that I have been fortunate enough to interact with over the past seven years. First and foremost I would like to thank my graduate advisor, Mathew Leibold, for his patience, financial support, and good nature. Thanks also to my dissertation committee members, especially Tim Keitt, Sahotra Sarkar, and Christine Hawkes for being accessible. My undergraduate advisor, David Ribble, gave me an excellent foundation in ecology and conservation biology that carried me through graduate school. To you, I dedicate chapter four.

Since {{you have}} done my wife and myself the honour of {{drinking}} our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won't expect a speech from a man who, when he sees a Post, says [...] "that's a Post," [...] and when he sees a Pump, says [...] "that's a Pump," [...] and {{is not to be}} got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick. If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it. I am not your man. However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind's daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused. So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don't, I can't help it. I do feel independent. Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind's daughter. I am very glad to be so. It has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me. At the same time - not to deceive you - I believe I am worthy of her. So, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> on <b>both</b> our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found.
