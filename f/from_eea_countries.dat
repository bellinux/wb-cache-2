50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} universities and colleges in Sweden, the oldest and largest of which are situated in Uppsala, Lund, Gothenburg and Stockholm. In 2000, 32% of Swedish people held a tertiary degree, making the country 5th in the OECD in that category. Along with several other European countries, the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, although a recent bill passed in the Riksdag will limit this subsidy to students <b>from</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> and Switzerland.|$|E
5000|$|The National Supervisory Authority of Welfare and Health (Valvira) {{declared}} that the new tobacco marketing ban (effective 1 January 2012) would also cover e-cigarettes, resulting in that Finnish stores or web stores can't advertise e-cigarettes because they might look like regular cigarettes. In theory, e-cigarettes with nicotine-free cartridges may still be sold, {{as long as their}} images and prices are not visible. Ordering from abroad remains allowed. Sale of nicotine cartridges is currently prohibited, as nicotine is considered a prescription drug requiring an authorization that such cartridges do not yet have. However, the Finnish authorities have decided that nicotine cartridges containing less than 10 mg nicotine, and e-liquid containing less than 0.42 g nicotine per bottle, may be legally brought in from other countries for private use. If the nicotine content is higher, a prescription from a Finnish physician is required. From a country within the European Economic Area a maximum of one year's supply may be brought in for private use when returning to Finland, while three months' supply may be brought in from outside the EEA. Mail-order deliveries <b>from</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries,</b> for a maximum of three months' supply, are also allowed.|$|E
40|$|We ask how two {{reforms of}} {{migration}} law (EEA accession in 1994 and the integration agreement regulation in 2003) impacted on the education structure of migrants to Austria. To identify {{the effects of}} these reforms, we use the fact that EEA accession affected only migrants <b>from</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries,</b> while third country citizens were unaffected and that the opposite is the case for the integration agreement regulation. We find robust evidence that the share of low educated permanent migrants from the EEA to Austria reduced relative to the share of low educated permanent migrants from other countries due to Austria's EEA accession. With respect to the reform of residence law in 2003 our results are less robust. Most of them, however, point to an increased share of low skilled permanent migrants...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} long-term international migration to the UK; we explore {{the extent to which}} migration is driven by macroeconomic variables (GDP per capita, unemployment rate) as well as law and policy (the existence of "free movement" rights for EEA nationals). We find a very large impact from free movement within the EEA. We also find that macroeconomic variables 2 ̆ 013 UK GDP growth and GDP at origin 2 ̆ 013 are significant drivers of migration flows; evidence for the impact of the unemployment rate in countries of origin, or of the exchange rate, however, is weak. We conclude that, while future migration flows will be driven by a number of factors, macroeconomic and otherwise, Brexit and the end of free movement will result in a large fall in immigration <b>from</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> to the UK...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the fiscal impact of immigration on the UK economy, {{with a focus}} on the period since 1995. Our findings indicate that, when considering the resident immigrant population in each year from 1995 to 2011, immigrants from the European Economic Area (EEA) have made a positive fiscal contribution, even during periods when the UK was running budget deficits, while Non-EEA immigrants, not dissimilar to natives, have made a negative contribution. For immigrants that arrived since 2000, contributions have been positive throughout, and particularly so for immigrants <b>from</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries.</b> Notable is the strong positive contribution made by immigrants from countries that joined the EU in 2004. Much of the economic literature over the last two decades, responding to concerns about the impact of immigration on labour markets, has focussed on immigration’s possible impact on native workers ’ wages and their employment (Card, 1990, 2001; Altonji and Card, 1991; Borjas, 2003; Dustmann et al., 2005, 2013; Manacorda et al., 2012; Ottaviano and Peri, 2012). A possibly even larger concern in the public debate on migration, however, is whether immigrants contribute their fair share to the tax and welfare systems. Indeed, in their analysis of attitudinal data, Dustmann an...|$|E

5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline <b>from</b> any <b>EEA</b> member <b>country</b> to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours, {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|R
