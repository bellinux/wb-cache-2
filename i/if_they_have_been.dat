5|$|In state-run institutions, {{students}} {{only need}} pay registration fees; {{there are no}} tuition fees. Private institutions, however, charge fees. All students are eligible to some financial support from the Icelandic Student Loan Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student must begin to repay this money two years after completing their study programme. In addition to Icelandic students, students from the European Union or EEA-EFTA member states are also eligible to apply for loans, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> working in their trade {{in the country for}} at least one year.|$|E
5|$|Rotating the map using {{a compass}} is {{essential}} for ensuring an army moves in the desired direction. The order of a moving unit will not be carried out until the unit has reached its destination or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed before arriving there. Each order carried out is announced through the game's command box, which is situated {{at the bottom of}} the screen. Actions such as battles and unit losses are also announced. In order to attack the enemy from a distance, the player is able to order a unit to commence shelling, which will neutralise an enemy unit if successful. The game features no sound.|$|E

5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and log book keeping, {{and the lack of}} a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about {{to run out of}} ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

While glass and sharp plastic are considered sharps waste, their handling methods can vary.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{forfeiture}} law {{was also}} amended to allow authorities to seize all {{foreign and domestic}} assets from any group or individual that is caught planning to commit acts of terrorism against the U.S. or U.S. citizens.

25|$|As in {{complaints}} upon witchcrafts, {{there may}} be matters of inquiry which do not amount unto matters of presumption, and {{there may be}} matters of presumption which yet may not be matters of conviction, so it is necessary, that all proceedings thereabout be managed with an exceeding tenderness towards those that may be complained of, especially <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> persons formerly of an unblemished reputation.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} the Act is that the House of Lords can delay those Bills that it could {{formerly}} veto. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sent up to the House of Lords at least one month {{before the end of}} the Session, Money Bills can be delayed for up to one month after being sent up, and other Bills can be delayed for up to one year after being sent up. The period for which Bills other than Money Bills could be delayed was originally two years. The Speaker was given the power to certify which bills are classified as money bills.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 2013 Essex Police {{launched}} the ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative {{as part of}} a concerted effort {{to find new ways to}} tackle hate crime in Essex. The launch was marked by a conference in Chelmsford, hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organisations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was ‘Report it to Sort it’ and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.|$|E
25|$|Let no one {{demand to}} be made a knight while {{he is in the}} Hospital, unless this had been promised him before he took the habit of a religious, and then only if he has reached the age at which he might have become a knight if he had {{remained}} in the world. Nevertheless the sons of noblemen, especially <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> brought up in the Hospital, when they have reached military age, may, with the consent of the Master and of the Prior (coinandeor, comandatore), and with the approval of the brethren of the House, be invested with the insignia of knighthood.|$|E

25|$|This species exists {{mostly in}} {{tropical}} areas with distinct rainy seasons, {{and the young}} hatch near {{the time of the}} first rains of the summer (July–August), after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother American crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young American crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> covered. Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up with her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} used grading system is the International Scale of River Difficulty, where {{whitewater}} (either an individual rapid, or the entire river) is classed in six categories from class I (the easiest and safest) to class VI (the most difficult and most dangerous). The grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid, with grade I referring to flat or slow moving water with few hazards, and grade VI referring to the hardest rapids which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers, and are rarely run. Grade-VI rapids are sometimes downgraded to grade-V or V+ <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> run successfully. Harder rapids (for example a grade-V rapid on a mainly grade-III river) are often portaged, a French term for carrying. A portaged rapid is where the boater lands and carries the boat around the hazard.|$|E
