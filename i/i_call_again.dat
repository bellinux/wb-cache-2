6000|$|... "Let's hope he will not," [...] said Paul gayly; then, {{anxious to}} evade the {{gratitude}} which, since his munificence, he had seen beaming in the old negro's eye and evidently trying to find polysyllabic and elevated expression on his lips, he said hurriedly, [...] "I shall expect to find you with the colonel when <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>again</b> {{in a day or}} two," [...] and smilingly departed.|$|E
6000|$|I am a poor feeble creature. The doctor caught me, or I {{should have}} {{dropped on the}} grass. It was not a fainting-fit. I only shook and shivered so that I {{was too weak to}} stand up. Encouraged by the doctor, I {{recovered}} sufficiently to be able to ask him where Philip was to be taken to. He said: [...] "To the hospital. No poisoner can follow my patient there. Persuade him to let me take him away, when <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>again</b> in an hour's time." ...|$|E
60|$|Early in {{the evening}} <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again</b> at Mrs. Gardley's house, and to my delight I was {{informed}} that the lady I desired to see was at home.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} <b>I</b> <b>called</b> to inquire how Mrs. Eyrecourt was getting on. The report was favorable. Three days later <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again.</b> The report was still more encouraging. I was also {{informed}} that Mrs. Romayne {{had returned to}} Ten Acres Lodge.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again</b> {{the next}} morning, and {{introduced}} Mrs. ------, who, I believe, accompanied the ladies about town. This simplicity in Mr. ------'s manner puzzles and teases me; for, {{in spite of}} it, there {{was a sort of}} self-consciousness, as if he were being looked at,--as if he were having his portrait taken.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} {{sorry to}} hear it," [...] Laverick answered. [...] "In that case, <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again</b> when Mademoiselle Idiale has recovered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he {{will make}} an {{appointment}} with me, and <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again.</b> If he will name an hour, I will come at his own time." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were still}} two persons at our disposal. Lady Rachel might help us, as I believed, if {{she chose to}} do it. As for old Toller, I {{suggested}} (on reflection) that the lawyer should examine him. The lawyer declined to waste any more of my money. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again</b> on Lady Rachel. This time, I was let in. I found the noble lady smoking a cigarette and reading a French novel.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no right}} to ask any more questions. I left no message nor any name, and I had no excuse for saying <b>I</b> would <b>call</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, if you please, that <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again</b> as {{soon after}} one o'clock as possible. I {{particularly}} {{wish to see}} Mrs. Lecount. My name is Miss Garth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And possibly,' said Stephen, 'I {{may leave}} here {{altogether}} to-morrow; I don't know. So that if <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>call</b> <b>again</b> {{before returning to}} London, don't be alarmed, will you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|But it fell on unheeding ears. Snettishane {{was still}} in the dark ages. As she paused for breath, he said threateningly, [...] "To-night <b>I</b> shall <b>call</b> <b>again</b> like the raven." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{might have}} {{suspected}} other people of purposely denying themselves to me. But {{it was impossible}} to suspect Rachel. I left word that <b>I</b> would <b>call</b> <b>again</b> at six o'clock that evening.|$|R
60|$|Once a large {{flight of}} crane went {{sweeping}} by {{high in the}} sky, a royal, swift scythe reaping the clouds. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> to them in their own tongue, and they answered. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again</b> and again, {{and they began to}} waver and talk among themselves; and at last, having decided that this voice from below should be heeded, they broke rank and commenced sweeping round and round in great circles, seeking the lost one whose cry rose from afar. Baffled and angered, they rearranged themselves at last in long regular lines, and swept on into the north.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I will leave this letter for him," [...] she said. [...] "It is {{from his brother}} in Paris. Say that <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again</b> or let him know my address in London." ...|$|R
60|$|There came no response, {{and after}} some moments, {{becoming}} alarmed, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> to her <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{ordinary}} case {{of nervous}} exhaustion," [...] he pronounced. [...] "The patient {{appears to have}} had a very severe shock lately. He will be all right with proper diet and treatment, and a complete rest. <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again</b> to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is no worse," [...] {{reported}} Doctor Garrison. [...] "I {{hope to see}} him {{improved by}} this afternoon. <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again</b> about three o'clock." [...] And then he left directions with the nurse as to what should be done.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again</b> in {{the evening}} he was better; so much better that, against the doctor's orders, he had talked to her quite cheerfully and {{hopefully}} for an hour, until suddenly raising her bowed head in his two hands, he said, [...] "Do you know, dear, that in looking for help and influence there was one, dear, I had forgotten; one who is very potent with kings and councilors, and I think, love, I shall ask Him to interest Himself in my behalf. It is not too late yet, darling, and I shall seek Him to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord Polloch {{was most}} civil," [...] I assured him. [...] "He thanked {{me very much}} for coming to see him. He hoped that <b>I</b> would <b>call</b> <b>again</b> {{immediately}} on his return from Scotland, and--I have no doubt that by this time he has forgotten all about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are {{laughing}} at me; but nevertheless I am very glad that it is settled. Pray tell her from me that <b>I</b> shall <b>call</b> <b>again</b> as soon as ever she is Mrs. Fletcher, though I don't think she repaid either {{of the last two}} visits I made her." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{reached the}} stone enclosure, and passed {{up through the}} flower-garden. To my great surprise, Hilda was not there. As a rule, she came to meet me, with her sunny smile. But perhaps she was tired, or the sun on the road might have given her a headache. I {{dismounted}} from my mare, and {{called one of the}} Kaffir boys {{to take her to the}} stable. Nobody answered.... <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again.</b> Still silence.... <b>I</b> tied her up to the post, and strode over to the door, astonished at the solitude. I began to feel there was something weird and uncanny about this home-coming. Never before had I known Klaas's so entirely deserted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no; not exactly; but <b>I</b> {{intend to}} <b>call</b> <b>again.</b> He's close enough himself, is Mr. Mason. But his lady, Mrs. M.! Lord love you, Mr. Moulder, {{that is a}} woman!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good," [...] said Ladislaw, {{beginning}} {{to lose his}} diffidence in the interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had altered her face. [...] "My address is on my card. But if you will allow me <b>I</b> will <b>call</b> <b>again</b> to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon {{is likely to be}} at home." ...|$|R
5000|$|Arndt paired his {{antisemitism}} {{with his}} anti-French views, calling the French [...] "the Jewish people" [...] ("das Judenvolk"), or [...] "refined bad Jews" [...] ("verfeinerte schlechte Juden"). In 1815 he {{wrote of the}} French: [...] "Jews... <b>I</b> <b>call</b> them <b>again,</b> not only for their Jewish lists and their penny-pinching avarice, but even more because of their Jew-like sticking together." ...|$|R
6000|$|I told Meg <b>I</b> would <b>call</b> <b>again</b> to see George. Two evenings later I asked Lettie to lend me a dog-cart {{to drive}} {{over to the}} [...] "Hollies." [...] Leslie was away {{on one of his}} {{political}} jaunts, and she was restless. She proposed to go with me. She had called on Meg twice before in the new large home.|$|R
5000|$|... “After 9-11 <b>I</b> {{started getting}} <b>calls</b> <b>again.</b> <b>I</b> was {{assigned}} to produce a documentary on the war. I went to Iraq three times. I {{saw a lot of}} things there,” Ando says. “Reds…. The color red…A lot of red.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Amenda never volunteered statements. She {{answered}} the question put to her and then stopped dead. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> downstairs to her on one occasion, before I understood her peculiarities, to {{ask her if she}} knew the time. She replied, [...] "Yes, sir," [...] and disappeared into the back kitchen. At the end of thirty seconds or so, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> down <b>again.</b> [...] "I asked you, Amenda," [...] I said reproachfully, [...] "to tell me the time about ten minutes ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{doctor had}} gone out, and the servant {{was unable to}} say {{positively}} at what time he would be back. I went into his study, and wrote a line preparing him for the news I had brought with me, which I sealed up, with Armadale's letter, in an envelope, to await his return. Having told the servant <b>I</b> would <b>call</b> <b>again</b> in an hour, I left the place.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first of}} it {{happened}} day before yesterday," [...] said Peter Peterson. [...] "I {{was up to}} {{the very end of the}} lake, in a little cove, looking for wild turkeys. I was tired out and I rested against a tree and went into a doze. All at once I felt something cross my face. What it was I couldn't make out. I jumped up and just them I heard somebody cry out: 'I am dead! Who will bury me!' or something like that. I thought somebody was fooling me, and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> back: 'Who is there?' Then, as true as I am sitting here, I heard somebody in the air laugh at me! <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again,</b> 'Who are you?' And the party, or ghost, or whatever it was answered: 'They murdered me! Who will bury me!' Then I got scared and leaped into my canoe and paddled away. When I was out on the lake I looked back into the woods, but I could not see a soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus I {{talked to}} myself, mad with the {{thoughts}} of the joy that would soon be mine; and at intervals I stood still and made the forest echo with my calls. [...] "Rima! Rima!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>again</b> and again, and waited for some response; and heard only the familiar night-sounds--voices of insect and bird and tinkling tree-frog, and a low murmur in the topmost foliage, moved by some light breath of wind unfelt below. I was drenched with dew, bruised and bleeding from falls in the dark, and from rocks and thorns and rough branches, but had felt nothing; gradually the excitement burnt itself out; I was hoarse with shouting and ready to drop down with fatigue, and hope was dead: and at length I crept back to my hut, to cast myself on my grass bed and sink into a dull, miserable, desponding stupor.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said I, and as I {{still stood}} {{gazing at the}} piazza floor, she remarked that if <b>I</b> wished to <b>call</b> <b>again</b> she {{would go out and}} speak to the coachman and ask him if {{anything}} had been said to him about the time of the party's return.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> was <b>called</b> in <b>again,</b> {{my uncle}} counted out {{into my hand}} seven-and-thirty golden guinea pieces; the rest was in his hand, in small gold and silver; but his heart failed him there and he crammed the change into his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} that I had {{finished}} my speech {{the sun was setting}} and everyone was tired out. I was ordered to withdraw under guard, while the court consulted, which it did for a long while. Then <b>I</b> was <b>called</b> forward <b>again</b> and the commandant said: ...|$|R
60|$|Searching {{backwards}} in my memory, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> to life <b>again</b> {{the domestic}} {{history of the}} six weeks. It looks, on retrospection, miserably dull and empty of incident. I wonder when I contemplate it now, how we got through that weary interval--how we bore that forced inaction, that unrelieved oppression of suspense.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a very}} urgent {{message for}} the countess' ears alone," [...] replied Rokoff. [...] "Tell her that she must arise and slip {{something}} about her {{and come to the}} telephone. <b>I</b> shall <b>call</b> up <b>again</b> in five minutes." [...] Then he hung up his receiver. A moment later Paulvitch entered.|$|R
