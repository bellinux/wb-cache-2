5|$|Oryzomys couesi and {{at least}} six more {{narrowly}} distributed species with peripheral distributions together form the O.couesi group within the genus Oryzomys. The eighth species of the genus, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) is {{the only member of}} its own group (unless western populations are classified as a separate species, O.texensis). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating <b>in</b> <b>contributions</b> by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{had hoped}} to award the charter for the Canadian Pacific Railway in early 1872, but {{negotiations}} dragged on {{between the government and}} the financiers. Macdonald's government awarded the Allan group the charter in late 1872. In 1873, when Parliament opened, Liberal MP Lucius Seth Huntington charged that government ministers had been bribed with large, undisclosed political contributions to award the charter. Documents soon came to light which substantiated what came to be known as the Pacific Scandal. The Allan-led financiers, who were secretly backed by the United States's Northern Pacific Railway, had donated $179,000 to the Tory election funds, they had received the charter, and Opposition newspapers began to publish telegrams signed by government ministers requesting large sums from the railway interest at the time the charter was under consideration. Macdonald had taken $45,000 <b>in</b> <b>contributions</b> from the railway interest himself. Substantial sums went to Cartier, who waged an expensive fight to try to retain his seat in Montreal East (he was defeated, but was subsequently returned for the Manitoba seat of Provencher). During the campaign Cartier had fallen ill with Bright's disease, which may have been causing his judgment to lapse; he died in May 1873 while seeking treatment in London.|$|E
5|$|The genus Oryzomys {{currently}} includes {{about eight}} species distributed {{from the eastern}} United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.peninsulae {{is part of the}} O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of this section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the group's true diversity. Oryzomys was previously a much larger genus, but most species were progressively removed in various studies, culminating <b>in</b> <b>contributions</b> by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that excluded more than forty species from the genus. Oryzomys and many of the species removed from it are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is {{classified}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which is distributed from the eastern United States (marsh rice rat) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating <b>in</b> <b>contributions</b> by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than 40 species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over 100 species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, most of which occur in South and Central America. In the United States, the marsh rice rat is the only oryzomyine rodent except for Oryzomys couesi in a small area of southern Texas; the only other sigmodontines present are several species of cotton rats (Sigmodon) in the southern half of the country.|$|E
