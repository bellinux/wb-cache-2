Microalgae have attracted major interest as a sustainable source for biodiesel production on commercial scale. This dissertation is comprised of four chapters. The first chapter describes an updated literature survey on biodiesel and advancement and applications of mass spectrometry particularly in biodiesel analysis. The second chapter describes the screening of six microalgal species, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Scenedesmus acuminatus, Nannochloropsis sp., Anabaena sp., Chlorella sp. and Oscillatoria sp., isolated from fresh and marine water resources of southern Pakistan for biodiesel production and the GC-MS analysis of their fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Fatty acid profiling of the biodiesel, obtained from various microalgal oils showed high content of C- 16 : 0, C- 18 : 0, C- 18 : 1 ?cis- 9, C- 18 : 1 ?cis- 11 and 10 -hydroxyoctadecanoic acid. A method for absolute quantification of three important saturated FAMEs (C- 14 : 0, C- 16 : 0 and C- 18 : 0) by GC-MS/MS using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode was employed in the biodiesel samples obtained from various microalgal oils. The results suggested that locally found microalgae can be sustainably harvested {{for the production of}} biodiesel at commercial scale. This offers the tremendous economic opportunity for an energy-deficient nation like Pakistan [Chemistry Central Journal 2012, 6 : 149]. The third chapter describes a quantification method for saturated and unsaturated FAMEs by GC-MS/MS in MRM. The developed method was validated in the various biodiesels and their B- 2, B- 5 and B- 20 blends. The procedure is sensitive, selective and reproducible. The main advantage of the developed GC-MS/MS method is the effective separation and quantification of FAMEs in very complex samples of biodiesel-diesel blends and biodieselbiodiesel blends [Analytical Methods 2015, 7 (8) : 3372]. The forth chapter describes the quantification of glycerol in various biodiesel samples through post-derivatization by HPLC using diode array detector. Glycerol was converted into a UV active product i. e. <b>Glyceryl</b> <b>tribenzoate</b> through simple and effective esterification using benzoyl chloride and copper chloride as catalyst under mild condition. The developed HPLC-DAD method is sensitive, selective, reproducible and successfully applied for the quantification of glycerol in pure biodiesel [Submitted in Analytical Methods]...|$|E
