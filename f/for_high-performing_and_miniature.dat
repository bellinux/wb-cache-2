40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{specific}} {{examples of the}} educational promises and problems that arise as multiliteracies pedagogical initiatives encounter conventional institutional beliefs and practices in mainstream schooling. This paper documents and characterizes {{the ways in which}} two specific digital learning initiatives were played out in two distinctive traditional schooling contexts, as experienced by two different student groups: one comprising an elite mainstream and the other an excluded minority. By learning from the instructive complications that arose out of attempts by innovative and well-meaning educators to provide students with more relevant learning experiences than currently exist in mainstream schooling, this paper contributes fresh perspectives and more nuanced understandings of how diverse learners and their teachers negotiate the opportunities and challenges of the New London Group's vision of a multiliteracies approach to literacy and learning. We conclude by arguing that, where multiliteracies are understood as “garnish” to the “pedagogical roast” of traditional code-based and print-based academic literacies, they will continue to work on the sidelines of mainstream schooling and be seen only as either useful extensions or helpful interventions <b>for</b> <b>high-performing</b> <b>and</b> at-risk students respectively...|$|R

30|$|The {{logic of}} this image {{analysis}} is as follows. The appearance of the mask stimuli and the face stimuli can be summarized by generating an average image for each stimulus category (an average mask and an average face). Systematic differences between these two categories can then be visualized by subtracting the average face from the average mask to create a difference image. This difference image indicates which regions of the stimulus are most informative for mask/face classification. Our hypothesis is that high-performing participants tracked this information more closely than low-performing participants. To test this hypothesis, we used categorization responses from Experiment 2 to generate difference images <b>for</b> the <b>high-performing</b> <b>and</b> low-performing subgroups. This allowed us to compare the perceptual difference images (based on participants’ categorization of the stimuli) against the physical difference image (based on the actual stimulus categories). By undertaking this comparison for different slices of the image, {{we were able to}} quantify participants’ tracking of category-level regularities across different face regions.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, Burgard {{was placed}} on New York State's list of {{consistently}} low-achieving {{high schools in the}} state. The school's current graduation rate is 44%, below state standards, and saw a drop in on test scores on Regents exams in all subject areas except Earth science New state requirements state that schools on the list that do not show improvement must either convert to a charter school, replace the building principal and at least 50% of its staff, create incentive pay <b>for</b> <b>high-performing</b> staff <b>and</b> implement staff development for teachers that do not, or close entirely. Superintendent James Williams initially announced that he would keep Principal Florence Schimert-Krieter in place at Burgard despite the fact that doing so would cost the school and district federal funds, approximately two million dollars per year for three years. Following a visit by the state education department, Williams announced that he would remove Krieter as well as the principals at two other Buffalo high schools, with the changes taking effect October 15, 2010. Around that time, it was announced that Burgard had failed to meet the requirements for those grants, and would not receive that funding.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNumerous {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed to allow legged robots to learn to walk. However, {{the vast majority of}} these algorithms is devised to learn to walk in a straight line, which is not sufficient to accomplish any real-world mission. Here we introduce the Transferability-based Behavioral Repertoire Evolution algorithm (TBR-Evolution), a novel evolutionary algorithm that simultaneously discovers several hundreds of sim-ple walking controllers, one for each possible direction. By taking advantage of so-lutions that are usually discarded by evolutionary processes, TBR-Evolution is sub-stantially faster than independently evolving each controller. Our technique relies on two methods: (1) novelty search with local competition, which searches <b>for</b> both <b>high-performing</b> <b>and</b> diverse solutions, and (2) the transferability approach, which com-bines simulations and real tests to evolve controllers for a physical robot. We evaluate this new technique on a hexapod robot. Results show that with only a few dozen short experiments performed on the robot, the algorithm learns a repertoire of con-trollers that allows the robot to reach every point in its reachable space. Overall, TBR-Evolution opens a new kind of learning algorithm that simultaneously optimizes all the achievable behaviors of a robot...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{the growing}} rate of global wind power and overall {{benefits}} of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbines, the future demand <b>for</b> <b>high-performing</b> NdFeB magnet <b>and</b> its constituent elements is likely to increase. Future deployment of wind power generation may be affected by potential disruptions in supply and price rises of critical rare earth elements. By evaluating the substitution options for the rare earths permanent magnet-based wind turbines at the material and component levels, this paper shows that substitution has a real potential to alleviate {{the pressure on the}} supply of rare earths in the wind industry. Rare earth-free turbines with good efficiency levels were already developed and could be further adopted. Alternatively, the future demand for rare earths, in particular for dysprosium, could be reduced by improving material efficiency. The future market share of rare earth-based wind turbines will most likely depend on the evolution of the price of rare earths and the techno-economic advantages of PMSG in comparison to alternative technologies that use no rare earths elements.

The food economy is broken into its four major sectors: food processing, wholesale grocery, retail supermarket, and restaurant. Industry incremental effects are not significantly different between low and high performers except in processing. On average, high performance has been more sustainable than low performance. Corporate and segment sustainability rates were larger for high performers as compared to low performers. Within the retail industry, there is no significant difference between sustainability rates of high and low performers. High performers in the retail industry had significantly greater industry, business-segment, and total-sum sustainability rates than the other three sectors, suggesting the retail sector has important characteristics that merit further research.

40|$|Weanalysed {{sensitivity}} of high-density arrays of self-assembled gold nanoparticle clusters towards trace analyte detection and quantitative determination by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) employing an aromatic thiol as probe molecule. Periodic nanoscale arrays of gold nanoparticle clusters consisting {{of an average}} of 18 nanoparticles per cluster, and exhibiting mean inter-particle and inter-cluster separations below 10 nm were prepared using electrostatic self-assembly on block copolymer templates. The concentration dependent scaling of SERS intensities and the lowest detection limits on the cluster arrays on silicon substrate was probed using 1 -naphthalenethiol (NT) as test molecule. The substrates show a detection limit of 10 nM along with high sensitivity to changes in NT concentration, which we attribute to high density of hot-spots uniformly organised across the surface. The capability for facile realisation of such arrays without a clean room environment or expensive tools makes the approach suitable for adoption <b>for</b> economic <b>and</b> <b>high-performing</b> SERS sensors...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new high-efficiency magnets and/or electric traction motors using {{a limited amount of}} critical rare earths or none at all is crucial for the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and related applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and e-bikes. For these applications, we estimated the short-term demand <b>for</b> <b>high-performing</b> NdFeB magnets <b>and</b> their constituent rare earths: neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium. In 2020, EV, HEV and e-bike applications combined could require double the amount used in 2015. To meet the global deployment target of 7. 2 million EVs sales in 2020 proposed by the International Energy Agency, the demand for NdFeB in the EV sector might increase by up to 14 times in only 5 years (2015 - 2020). Due to concerns about the security of supply of rare earths some manufacturers have decided to develop and adopt alternative solutions. By assessing up-to-date available component substitutes, we show that the permanent magnet synchronous-traction motor (PSM) remains the technology of choice, especially for hybrid vehicles (HEV and PHEV). Better material efficiency and a larger adoption of motors free of rare earths have the potential to reduce the pressure on rare earths supply for use in electric road transport applications. However even if such substitution measures are successfully implemented, the demand growth for rare earths in the EV sector is expected to increase significantly by 2020 and beyond. JRC.

40|$|Public {{transit systems}} in the United States often face {{multiple}} policy objectives. Typically, stakeholders desire frequent service on an extensive network, but funding and other resources are constrained, creating complicated relationships between service effectiveness goals and business efficiency goals. Using data from the National Transit Map (NTM), this study evaluated the general performance of transit systems across 294 Urbanized Areas (UZAs) in the US, which were stratified into six peer groups based on population. Transit efficiency and effectiveness were compared by developing a composite business efficiency index score and a composite service effectiveness index score for each urbanized area. The scores were generated using a fuzzy logic extension of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which allows automated weighting of the measures. The NTM currently includes a limited set of performance measures, and each transit agency’s data {{are associated with the}} largest urban area it serves; consequently, it is perhaps best-suited <b>for</b> identifying <b>high-performing</b> UZAs <b>and</b> less suitable for identifying the weakest performers.

40|$|Nowadays in the European {{framework}} {{the good}} practices <b>for</b> <b>high-performing</b> buildings realization <b>and</b> retrofitting are copious, but what emerges {{is the lack}} of information and data sharing about them. There are indeed no official sources for notes deriving from this kind of buildings and, moreover, there is shortage of quantitative and comparable data. In a process oriented to a large-scale diffusion of nZEBs on the market, the existing good practices of actual case studies of highperforming buildings should be kept as market benchmarks and reveal to be precious sources of information. In the light of the above, the need of a harmonized database to collect and share data deriving from different building typologies and climatic zones plays a fundamental role. Due to the weakness of the existing databases and to the necessity of having practical guidelines to design nZEBs, at Italian level, an AiCARR teamwork is targeting the development of a design guide for nZEBs in Mediterranean region, based on different national experiences. In order to reach this target the workgroup has created a detailed database, useful to collect and share information about single high-performing buildings. Its main purpose is to record nZEBs, which have been already built, with available monitored data and that represent concrete models for future designing. Because of the still scarcity of monitored nZEBs, the database is suitable not only for realized monitored buildings but also for those that are still in a design phase.

It analyses {{the development of the}} specific industry character: role of open industry standards as pathways for innovation, the continuous leadership of vertically integrated incumbent system integrating vendors, the regionalization of communication markets, and the development of telecom regulations. It shows how the equipment industry’s continuous massive R&D efforts (i. e. 3 G, HSPA, HSPA+ and 4 G wireless systems) enabled the smartphone revolution, whilst the intensive competition among wireless operators trickled down to the incumbent equipment vendors in terms of a lethal mix of requirements <b>for</b> <b>high-performing</b> equipment <b>and</b> very competitive pricing, a combination which undermined vendor’s margins. In the process, industry incumbents shared new generations of technologies with new innovative Asian entrants through the open standards regime, leading to more global and heated competition. As the competition developed from “regionalized and moderate” to “globalized and intensive”, both European incumbents and Asian entrants explored services and software as new areas of profitable growth. In particular, the paper analyses how the industry players, in stiff competition with the ‘IT giants’ and platform leaders of the Internet economy, are seeking leadership in cloud and Internet-of-Things through the launch of the 5 th Generation wireless services, to be standardized in 2020. To explain the competitive outcomes in the different periods outlined above we need to link two levels of the analysis: 	Firm Level Sources of Competitiveness 	 		Strategic commitments and business models 		Governance of internal resource allocation and the social organizational integration of knowledge, capabilities and resources within the company, as well as with external suppliers and partners 		Financial resource commitments 	 	 	Standards and the Industry Architecture 	 		Governance of wireless standard setting processes, regional and global 		Governance of and business models for knowledge integration of evolving technologies within generations of standards 		Short-term and long-term impact of industry architecture on firm level performance...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2015. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisors: C. Daniel Frisbie, Lorraine F. Francis. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 161 pages. In printed electronics, electronic inks are patterned onto flexible substrates using roll-to-roll (R 2 R) compatible graphic printing methods. For applications where large-area, conformal electronics are necessary, printed electronics holds {{a competitive advantage}} over rigid, semiconductor circuitry, which does not scale efficiently to large areas. However, in order to fully realize the true potential of printed electronics, several manufacturing hurdles need to be overcome. Firstly, minimum feature sizes produced by graphic printing methods are typically greater than 25 µm, which is at least {{an order of magnitude}} higher for dense, high performing electronics. In this thesis, conductive features down to 1. 5 µm are demonstrated using a novel inkjet printing-based process. Secondly, high-resolution printed conductors usually have poor current-carrying capacity, especially for longer wires in large-area applications. This thesis explores the fundamentals of aerosol-jet printing and reveals the regime for printing high-resolution lines with excellent current carrying capacity. Additionally, a novel manufacturing process is demonstrated, which can process 2. 5 µm wide conductive wires with linear resistances as small as 5 Ω mm- 1. Another challenge for printed electronics manufacturing is to deal with topography produced on the substrate surface by printed features. Besides complicating the subsequent use of contact-printing methods, surface topography is a source of poor device yields as well. This thesis describes two novel methodologies of creating topography-free printed surfaces. In the first method, nanometer-level smooth, planarized silver lines are obtained using a transfer printing approach. In the second method, open microchannels, imprinted in plastic substrates, are filled with a controlled amount of metal using liquid-based additive processes, to obtain conductive wires flush with the substrate surface. Finally, this thesis addresses the issue of overlay alignment, which is the most significant challenge of printed electronics manufacturing. Multi-layered electronic devices require alignment of multiple layers of different materials with micron-level tolerances, which is a daunting task to accomplish on deformable, moving substrates in R 2 R production formats. This thesis describes a novel, self-aligned manufacturing strategy for printed electronics that relies on capillary flow of inkjet-printed inks within open micro-channels. Multi-level trench networks, pre-engineered on the substrate surface, are sequentially filled with different inks which, upon drying, form stacked layers of electronic materials. Using this approach, fully self-aligned fabrication of all the major building blocks of an integrated circuit is demonstrated. Overall, this thesis presents several new manufacturing avenues <b>for</b> realizing <b>high-performing</b> <b>and</b> dense electronics on plastic by R 2 R processing...|$|R
