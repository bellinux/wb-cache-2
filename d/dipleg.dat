However, the <b>dipleg</b> employed in this work has a larger diameter and longer length than those used in others’ research. Furthermore, the exit of <b>dipleg</b> was submerged deeply into the bubbling fluidized bed in this work. So while the particle mass flux was increasing, the whole shape of pressure profile gradually became smooth, and the pressure difference between the <b>dipleg</b> inlet at its top and <b>dipleg</b> outlet at its bottom increased. Consequently, the pressure buildup range for balancing the negative pressure extended from the just dense flow pattern region in the lower region to the whole <b>dipleg</b> length, forming the dense conveying flow regime as shown in Fig.  5.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} on the downflow of fine catalysts (d 50 = 44 μm) in a straight vertical cyclone <b>dipleg</b> (diameter 80 mm, height 4. 6 m) to clarify various types of powder flow which can exist in the <b>dipleg</b> and to measure the amount of gas entrainment down the <b>dipleg</b> under {{a wide range of}} operating conditions. In addition, the radial profiles of solids velocity and solids volume fraction were measured at various heights along the <b>dipleg.</b> The axial pressure profiles show that the flow in the <b>dipleg</b> can be divided in regions: inlet, dilute and dense. A flow diagram shows the occurrence of various flow types depending on operating conditions. The flow in the dense region can be fluidized (preferred) or packed. In the dilute region, the solids velocity is higher than the terminal falling velocity of a single particle. This indicates the existence of clusters, the size of which has been estimated. Gas carry-under is generally not significant when the dense region has developed. Once there is a dilute region only, the gas carry-under can become as large as 20 times the volumetric solids flow. The radial profiles of solids velocity and solids volume fraction show that going from <b>dipleg</b> top to <b>dipleg</b> bottom, the rotating annular flow at the <b>dipleg</b> top (cyclone outlet) transforms into a more or less uniform plug flow, both with respect to velocity and to local concentration...|$|E

Time mean pressure and time series of pressure fluctuations were measured at different axial positions in the <b>dipleg</b> with particle mass fluxes ranging from 50.0 to 385.0  kg m− 2  s− 1. The experimental {{results showed that the}} time mean pressure in the <b>dipleg</b> increased progressively from the top section to the bottom section. The experimental phenomena displayed that the fluidization patterns in the <b>dipleg</b> can be divided into two types on the whole, namely the dilute–dense coexisting falling flow and the dense conveying flow along the <b>dipleg.</b> In the dilute–dense coexisting falling flow, the dilute phase region was composed of a length of swirling flow below the inlet of <b>dipleg</b> and a dilute falling flow above the dense bed level.

The pressure fluctuations were closely related to the fluidization patterns inside the <b>dipleg.</b> In the dilute–dense coexisting falling flow, the pressure fluctuations in the dilute flow region originated from particle clusters, propagating downward as a pressure wave; however, the pressure fluctuations in the dense flow region originated from rising gas bubbles, propagating upward. When the dense conveying flow was formed in the <b>dipleg,</b> the pressure fluctuations originated mainly from instability of the feed and the compressed gas, propagating downward. The standard deviation of the pressure fluctuations indicated that the intensity of pressure fluctuations first increased and then decreased with increasing particle flux.|$|E
30|$|In gas–solid {{circulating}} fluidized (CFB) beds, {{the particles}} are collected by cyclones {{and then returned}} into a fluidized bed along a cyclone <b>dipleg</b> (dip-leg) conveying system. In the cyclone <b>dipleg,</b> the particles are conveyed mainly under gravity action from a low-pressure top section to a high-pressure bottom region in which the flow behavior {{is different from that}} in the riser or in the downcomer, although they have the same tubular structure. One of the flow characteristics in the <b>dipleg</b> is that the particle velocity is greater than gas velocity, so the direction of slip velocity between gas and particles is upward. Another one is the particle flow is usually against a negative pressure gradient. These two characteristics lead to the complexity of fluidization pattern and flow instability in the <b>dipleg,</b> which demonstrates that there are more than one different fluidization pattern coexisting and distinctive pressure fluctuations in the <b>dipleg</b> (Kunni and Levenspiel 1991; Hoffmann and Stein 2002; Cortés and Gil 2007).|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{a series}} of {{experiments}} were conducted with a catalyst powder in a pilot-plant scale CFB unit, to examine the pressure behavior in a 150 -mm inner diameter (i.d.) and 9000 -mm height cyclone <b>dipleg</b> under {{a wide range of}} operating conditions. The time mean pressure and the time series of pressure fluctuations in the cyclone <b>dipleg</b> are discussed based on the measured pressure data. In addition, the pressure fluctuation mechanism was also studied.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} pressure behaviors of a catalyst powder flowing down in a <b>dipleg</b> with 150  mm i.d. and 9000  mm high. The experimental phenomena displayed that the fluidization regimes in the <b>dipleg</b> could {{be divided into two}} types on the whole: the dilute–dense coexisting falling flow and the dense conveying flow. In the dilute–dense coexisting falling flow, the dilute phase region was composed of a length of swirling flow below the inlet of <b>dipleg</b> and a dilute falling flow above the dense bed level. As particle mass flux increased, the fluidization regimes gradually developed into dense conveying flow. Meanwhile, the time mean pressure increased progressively. The time series of pressure fluctuations showed that there existed a gas-particle flow instability in the <b>dipleg,</b> which consisted of low frequency with high amplitude and high frequency with low amplitude. The former was caused by the falling particle clusters, the latter {{was the result of the}} other factors, such as bubbles rising in the dense flow, instability feed, and compressed gas. The results indicated that the particle mass flux had strongly influence on the time mean pressure and pressure fluctuations.|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the interaction}} and the coupling among gas-particle flow and unstable feed created {{the complexity of}} local pressure fluctuations. On the other hand, the pressure fluctuations could produce an alternating load to induce the vibration of the cyclone and <b>dipleg.</b> Sometimes the alternating load could induce resonance vibration of the cyclone system and possibly cause a fatigue fracture of the cyclone shell or support rod (Zheng et al. 2011). So, the pressure fluctuation in the <b>dipleg</b> has the potential harm to {{the operation of the}} cyclone system.|$|E
30|$|Many {{researchers}} have studied diplegs, including Geldart et al. (1993), Li et al. (1997), Wang et al. (2000 a,b), and Gil et al. (2002). Their emphases {{were focused on}} measuring the axial pressure distribution along the <b>dipleg</b> axial height and the fluidization regime transitions in the <b>dipleg.</b> Wang et al. (2000 a,b) and Leung and Wilson (1973) investigated the gas-particle flow instability in the <b>dipleg,</b> {{and the effect of}} particle mass flux and negative pressure on the instability. Srivastava et al. (1998) and Zhang et al. (1998) found that under certain operating conditions the particle circuit manifested instability characterized by low frequency oscillations of particle circulation rates, and this instability originated in the standpipe. However, little work has been done on gas-particle flow instability involving the cyclone dipleg; furthermore, the relationship between the pressure fluctuations and the fluidization regime transitions, and the effect particle mass flux on the pressure fluctuations, is rarely reported.|$|E
30|$|The {{pressure}} fluctuations {{were related}} to the particle mass flux and fluidization pattern inside the <b>dipleg.</b> When G s was small (such as G s <  50.0  kg m− 2  s− 1), the pressure fluctuation in Fig.  7 a was of high frequency and low amplitude in the dilute falling flow, and low frequency and high amplitude in the dense flow. The former was caused by the falling particle clusters interacting with the up flowing gas, and the latter was caused by the bubbles rising in the dense flow. As G s increased, the particles had a greater tendency to increase the population of clusters rather than to increase the cluster size, resulting in the pressure fluctuation with high frequency and low amplitude, as shown in Fig.  7 b. However, the particle feed from the cyclone into the <b>dipleg</b> showed considerable instability, which caused the pressure fluctuation with low frequency and high amplitude. Meanwhile, the surface of the dense flow moved up and down unsteadily, showing significant pressure fluctuations with low frequency and high amplitude. When G s increased (such as G s >  350.0  kg m− 2  s− 1) to form dense conveying flow, the pressure fluctuations are shown in Fig.  7 c. The down-flowing clusters of particles fall inside the <b>dipleg,</b> and as a result, quantities of gas were carried downwards by the particles, which has been proven by the measured results of Geldart et al. (1993) and Li et al. (1997). Gas-particle flow in the <b>dipleg</b> was flowing against negative pressure, and the slip velocity was upward to balance the negative pressure, resulting in compression of the carried gas. The gas was compressed and expanded alternately to induce the particle concentration and the pressure non-uniformity. Therefore, the pressure fluctuations are attributed to the unstable feed and the compressed gas.|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{behavior of}} a number of ultrafine powders in a circulating fluidized bed was investigated. Different ultrafine powders displayed different fluidization behaviors in the <b>dipleg</b> and the powder return system, but their hydrodynamic behaviors in the riser were almost the same. The addition of coarse particles could improve the quality of fluidization, showing, in addition, that for the powder return system the V-valve was much better than the inclined butterfly-valve, because blockage might occur in the latter. Ultrafine powders could be easily recovered from the exhaust vent by cyclones due to the formation of agglomerates. Fan-shaped baffles in the <b>dipleg</b> could suppress slugging and ensure stable operation. Experimental voidage profiles in the riser showed that the voidage was low at the bottom and high at the upper part. There was, however, a relatively dense zone at the top because of exit effect. Such axial voidage profile in a riser was successfully calculated by using a two-phase model. The reason for non-uniform distribution of voidage was also discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The fast-bed riser, because of its high and relatively uniform gas velocity, serves to adjust the size, especially the size distribution of the agglomerates, that is, further capture of discrete micro-scale discrete particles for the smaller agglomerates to make them larger, and attrition of over-size agglomerates to make them smaller. Uniform agglomerates of a given average size ensures stable fluidization, minimizing the danger of deposition of macro-scale lumps of agglomerates to lead to blockage as well as defluidization elsewhere in the loop.

Os resultados experimentais obtidos nos dois casos foram comparados aos valores previstos por modelos analíticos. Foram utilizados três tipos de esferas de vidro, três tipos de partículas de FCC (catalisador usado no craqueamento catalítico do petróleo) e um tipo de rocha fosfática. As velocidades do gás no leito foram de 0, 26, 0, 31 e 0, 36 m/s; operando nessas velocidades, o leito apresentou um regime de fluidização rápida, similar ao usado em sistemas circulantes. As partículas foram caracterizadas obtendo-se suas velocidades de mínima fluidização. Observou-se que pelo incremento da velocidade do gás aumentasse o fluxo de arraste das partículas; para partículas do tipo Geldart A quanto maior a fração de sólidos do tipo Geldart C maior o fluxo de arraste e para part´&# 305;culas do tipo C, quanto menor o diâmetro médio, menor o fluxo de arraste.

The particles were characterized and their minimum fluidization velocities were inferred. It was possible to observe that with the increasing of the gas velocity in the bed, the entrainment flux increases; for Geldart A particles, when the fraction of Geldart C solids is higher, the entrainment flux increases and for Geldart C materials, when there is a decrease in mean diameter, the entrainment flux is smaller.

The entrained gas flow rate in the downcomer incorporating a riser was determined by using a gas tracer technique.

40|$|The {{transport}} reactor development unit (TRDU) {{was modified}} to accommodate oxygen-blown operation {{in support of}} a Vision 21 -type energy plex that could produce power, chemicals, and fuel. These modifications consisted of changing the loop seal design from a J-leg to an L-valve configuration, thereby increasing the mixing zone length and residence time. In addition, the standpipe, <b>dipleg,</b> and L-valve diameters were increased to reduce slugging caused by bubble formation in the lightly fluidized sections of the solid return legs. A seal pot was added {{to the bottom of the}} <b>dipleg</b> so that the level of solids in the standpipe could be operated independently of the <b>dipleg</b> return leg. A separate coal feed nozzle was added that could inject the coal upward into the outlet of the mixing zone, thereby precluding any chance of the fresh coal feed back-mixing into the oxidizing zone of the mixing zone; however, difficulties with this coal feed configuration led to a switch back to the original downward configuration. Instrumentation to measure and control the flow of oxygen and steam to the burner and mix zone ports was added to allow the TRDU to be operated under full oxygen-blown conditions. In total, ten test campaigns have been conducted under enriched-air or full oxygen-blown conditions. During these tests, 1515 hours of coal feed with 660 hours of air-blown gasification and 720 hours of enriched-air or oxygen-blown coal gasification were completed under this particular contract. During these tests, approximately 366 hours of operation with Wyodak, 123 hours with Navajo sub-bituminous coal, 143 hours with Illinois No. 6, 106 hours with SUFCo, 110 hours with Prater Creek, 48 hours with Calumet, and 134 hours with a Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous coal were completed. In addition, 331 hours of operation on low-rank coals such as North Dakota lignite, Australian brown coal, and a 90 : 10 wt% mixture of lignite and wood waste were completed. Also included in these test campaigns was 50 hours of gasification on a petroleum coke from the Hunt Oil Refinery and an additional 73 hours of operation on a high-ash coal from India. Data from these tests indicate that while acceptable fuel gas heating value was achieved with these fuels, the transport gasifier performs better on the lower-rank feedstocks because of their higher char reactivity. Comparable carbon conversions have been achieved at similar oxygen/coal ratios for both air-blown and oxygen-blown operation for each fuel; however, carbon conversion was lower for the less reactive feedstocks. While separation of fines from the feed coals is not needed with this technology, some testing has suggested that feedstocks with higher levels of fines have resulted in reduced carbon conversion, presumably due to the inability of the finer carbon particles to be captured by the cyclones. These data show that these low-rank feedstocks provided similar fuel gas heating values; however, even among the high-reactivity low-rank coals, the carbon conversion did appear to be lower for the fuels (brown coal in particular) that contained a significant amount of fines. The fuel gas under oxygen-blown operation has been higher in hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentration since the higher steam injection rate promotes the water-gas shift reaction to produce more CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 } at the expense of the CO and water vapor. However, the high water and CO{sub 2 } partial pressures have also significantly reduced the reaction of (Abstract truncated...|$|E
30|$|When G s {{was small}} (such as G s <  50.0  kg m− 2  s− 1), the {{fluidization}} {{pattern in the}} <b>dipleg</b> was featured by the coexistence of dilute falling flow and dense flow. In the upper dilute region, the pressure fluctuations originated from the particle clusters flowing downwards and the unstable feed from the cyclone. While in the bottom dense region, the local pressure fluctuations originated from the local bubbles and unstable discharge. With increasing G s, the particle concentration increased. The pressure fluctuation mainly resulted from the unstable feed, the friction between particles and wall, the gas compressed by particles, etc. The pressure fluctuation intensity reached a maximum during the fluidization pattern being transformed (while G s =  200.0 – 250.0  kg m− 2  s− 1). With further increase of G s (such as G s >  350.0  kg m− 2  s− 1), the gas-particle flow evolved into dense conveying flow. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuations gradually decreased. The {{reason is that the}} increasing particle mass flux can reduce the possibilities of forming a non-uniform distribution of particle concentration and causing pressure fluctuations. It was clear that the influence of gas turbulence was weakened and the interaction between particles or clusters was dominant as particle flux increasing. The continuous agglomeration of particles and the crush of clusters led to the fluctuation of dynamic pressure.|$|E

When utilized for electrical power generation, these plants will operate with efficiencies greater than 60 % while producing near zero emissions of traditional stack gas pollutants. The new process partially gasifies coal at elevated pressure producing a coal-derived syngas and a char residue. The syngas {{can be used to}} fuel the most advanced power producing equipment such as solid oxide fuel cells or gas turbines or processed to produce clean liquid fuels or chemicals for industrial users. The char residue is not wasted; it {{can also be used to}} generate electricity by fueling boilers that drive the most advanced ultra-supercritical pressure steam turbines. The unique aspect of the process is that it utilizes a pressurized circulating fluidized bed partial gasifier and does not attempt to consume the coal in a single step. To convert all the coal to syngas in a single step requires extremely high temperatures ({approx} 2500 to 2800 F) that melt and vaporize the coal and essentially drive all coal ash contaminants into the syngas. Since these contaminants can be corrosive to power generating equipment, the syngas must be cooled to near room temperature to enable a series of chemical processes to clean the syngas. Foster Wheeler's process operates at much lower temperatures that control/minimize the release of contaminants; this eliminates/minimizes the need for the expensive, complicated syngas heat exchangers and chemical cleanup systems typical of high temperature gasification. By performing the gasification in a circulating bed, a significant amount of syngas can still be produced despite the reduced temperature and the circulating bed allows easy scale up to large size plants. Rather than air, it can also operate with oxygen to facilitate sequestration of stack gas carbon dioxide gases for a 100 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of syngas and char produced by the PGM can be tailored to fit the production objectives of the overall plant, i. e., power generation, clean liquid fuel production, chemicals production, etc. Hence, PGM is a robust building block that offers all the advantages of coal gasification but in a more user friendly form; it is also fuel flexible in that it can use alternative fuels such as biomass, sewerage sludge, etc. The PGM consists of a pressurized circulating fluidized bed (PCFB) reactor together with a recycle cyclone and a particulate removing barrier filter. Coal, air, steam, and possibly sand are fed to the bottom of the PCFB reactor and establish a relatively dense bed of coal/char in the bottom section. As these constituents react, a hot syngas is produced which conveys the solids residue vertically up through the reactor and into the recycle cyclone. Solids elutriated from the dense bed and contained in the syngas are collected in the cyclone and drain via a <b>dipleg</b> back to the dense bed at the bottom of the PCFB reactor. This recycle loop of hot solids acts as a thermal flywheel and promotes efficient solid-gas chemical reaction...|$|E
