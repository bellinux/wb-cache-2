25|$|On August 11, 2015, Lessig {{announced}} that he had launched an <b>exploratory</b> <b>campaign</b> for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by Labor Day 2015. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in The New York Times and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media. His campaign was focused on a single issue: The Citizen Equality Act, a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access. As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.|$|E

40|$|During severe {{oil price}} downturns, many {{operating}} companies {{reduce or eliminate}} large investments with long time horizons such as <b>exploratory</b> drilling <b>campaigns.</b> This reduction in investments forces rig and drilling services providers to reduce their bids to be competitive. The result of this is lower initial investment in {{the oil and gas}} projects. In this research, a valuation approach is implemented to study the impact of this investment reduction on the decision-making process for executing <b>exploratory</b> drilling <b>campaigns</b> during low oil price periods. It is demonstrated that postponing exploration campaigns during low oil price periods does not necessary maximize value creation. Value creation from investment in low price periods results from the combination of uncertainty and flexibility. The analysis of the value of flexibility (optionality) is usually referred to as Real Options Valuation (ROV). In this work, one of the most versatile approach for valuing options is applied: The Least-Square Monte Carlo Method (LSM). Two uncertainties were considered: oil price and drilling cost. Among the different oil price models, the two-factor stochastic price process developed by Schwartz and Smith (2000) was chosen because of its balance between realism and ease of communication to the managers. Drilling cost is modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process. By implementing a delayed correlation between the drilling cost and the oil price, the cost reduction observed in the market is accounted for. In this research, it is shown how real option valuation can be used to determine the optimal time to start the <b>exploratory</b> drilling <b>campaign.</b> Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by including the correlation between the drilling cost and the oil price, the optimal time to execute the investment is during the year with the lowest expected oil price. The impact of this correlation is studied through the use of sensitivity analyses of the project value with respect to the correlation factor and the parameters in the stochastic price model. It is concluded that considering this correlation leads to more realistic project value estimations, resulting in portfolio decisions that maximize stakeholder value. The key contribution of this thesis is the use of option valuating methods to demonstrate that value will be created by initiating the <b>exploratory</b> drilling <b>campaigns</b> during low oil price periods. The real option model developed in this research is applicable to all types of exploration projects in the petroleum industry...|$|R
30|$|As {{currently}} practiced, {{the exploration}} model {{that the oil}} and gas industry follows condemns it to a long and onerous process, before reaching conclusions regarding the prospectivity potential of those regions. The process of identification of prospective areas and risk reduction assessments, conducted prior to drilling the first exploratory well, can take years and require investments on a scale that the industry cannot currently justify. Due to the cost, delay and risk involved in such <b>exploratory</b> <b>campaigns,</b> many possibly attractive areas are left unexplored for long periods. Historically, in times of crises, paradigms have been broken and new business models have been adopted. Faced with a difficult economic scenario and the challenge of immense frontier areas to be prospected, together with high exploratory project risks, {{the oil and gas}} industry again needs to break a paradigm and adopt a new exploration model. A new exploration model should allow a faster, less expensive and more direct way of assessing the prospectivity of large exploratory areas and of identifying oil and gas leads. New and emerging technologies are the key to achieving this change. If the industry is to overcome the current market difficulties that are holding back exploratory projects, and resume large-scale prospecting activity in frontier areas, it must aggressively break the paradigm of the current exploration model. That involves adopting a new exploration model and appropriate technologies.|$|R
40|$|Chachimbiro and Chacana {{geothermal}} {{fields are}} located in the Andes ridge in the north of Ecuador. Previous prefeasibility studies of geology, geochemistry and geophysics were reviewed and the acquired information was used to generate different scenarios for volumetric assessment of the geothermal fields depending on the results from resistivity models and geothermometers. Chachimbiro was treated as a high-temperature field in the volumetric assessment, supported by the presence of a high-temperature resistivity structure. Chacana was treated in a similar way, but as an intermediate- to low-temperature system. Using similar processes with different scenarios may help to advance them to the next stages of exploration. The true conditions of the fields must be discovered by drilling. With an <b>exploratory</b> drilling <b>campaign,</b> the estimation of the models would partly be fixed to more accurate parameters...|$|R

30|$|The {{study area}} lies around the {{petroleum}} provinces of the Egyptian Offshore Nile Delta basin. The existing exploration data are sparse, and any effort {{made on the}} strati-structural interpretation is challenging for <b>exploratory</b> drilling <b>campaigns,</b> even with meager well control. Keeping in view the issues and major challenges, the authors propose new methodologies, tools and {{new insights into the}} interpretation of the existing data and information, to make the study area more attractive for investors and detailed exploration studies. The published geological work existing within the vicinity of the study area is an added value to the new insights of current interpretation and knowledge acquisition. Pliocene–Pleistocene section is the main target in the study area, since it has quality reservoirs, holding commercial hydrocarbons. Pre-salt source rocks may have charged the reservoirs in the study area. Structural complexities and heterogeneities at target levels are likely to impact the seismic wavelet property intricacies and thus the data processing qualities. Post- and pre-salt tectonics {{in the northern part of}} Sinai, the Nile Cone, and how they affect the structural framework and the seismic interpretation work in the study area are described. For the purpose of understanding the combinational trapping mechanism, stratigraphic features and the structural geology are integrated using new tools and technologies. Several strati-structural plays are interpreted in the study area that support the detailed exploration campaigns, and the existing major hydrocarbon plays associated within shelf, slope and deep-marine geological events in nearby offshore regions. Diapir salt, rotated fault blocks and growth faults within syn-sediment systems are other plays to be investigated. The study is an effort of compiled work from many published sources, putting all ideas into a positive perspective and has better understanding of new opportunities, leads and prospects for investment purposes in the Nile Delta offshore basin.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} urbanization {{level of}} many {{countries around the}} globe {{has led to a}} rapid increase of mobility demand in cities. Although public transport may play an important role, there are still many people relying on private vehicles, and, especially in urban areas, motorcycles and scooters can combine handling and flexibility with lower cost of operation compared to passenger cars. However, in spite of their lower fuel demand, they might significantly contribute to air pollution, lagging behind cars in terms of emission performances. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide the scientific community with the results of an <b>exploratory</b> test <b>campaign</b> on four different motorcycles, converted from gasoline to CNG by means of an after-market conversion kit. A fifth motorcycle, similarly converted from gasoline to LPG, was also tested. These vehicles are powered by 4 -strokes engines with a displacement ranging from 50 to 250 cm 3 and a power ranging from 3. 0 to 16. 5 kW. They have been tested over the relevant phases of the ECE- 47, ECE- 40 and WMTC driving cycles, with both gasoline and gaseous fuel. Gaseous emissions results show the dependence of HCs, CO, CO 2, NOx and CH 4 on the engine displacement, fuel, injection and catalyst technology. Additionally the energy efficiency and the environmental impact of the different tested configurations have been analyzed in terms of equivalent energy consumption and GWP. The results suggest that the CNG fuel with the appropriate injection technology might be a viable solution to combine low cost of operation with low gaseous emissions and global warming impact. The tests underline the need of an optimized setup of the conversion kit to avoid unwanted increase of the emissions. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{are about}} 175 {{abandoned}} mining sites in Portugal, of which about 60 are old uranium workings. The Castelejo mine {{is an old}} uranium located about 2 km W of Vila Cortês da Serra, in Guarda district, on the River Mondego basin. In geologic terms, the mine is located in medium-grained two-mica monzonitic granite, with porphyroidal tendency. Exploitation started with two open cast mines between 1979 and 1990 which produced about 132 tonnes U 3 O 8. From 1992, production started {{to be carried out}} through the in situ H 2 SO 4 leaching of the mine’s low-grade materials. The superficial and groundwater circulation are structurally conditioned by the intense fracturing in the area. Two <b>exploratory</b> geophysical field <b>campaigns</b> were conducted in order to characterize the fracturing. The first was a VLF survey that allowed us to identify major fault systems that may provide paths for groundwater flow. From the second campaign, which was an RMT survey conducted at a fault gauge which records the mine natural gradient flow, we obtained the resistivities and thicknesses of the weathered granite material. The profiles obtained show that resistivity declines with increasing depth. This fact may arise from natural causes – the material which fills the fault gauge is more weathered at depth than on the surface – or it may indicate contamination at depth, due to acid mine drainage...|$|R
