25|$|The {{discharges}} manifest as <b>filamentary</b> {{transfer of}} electrons (micro discharges) in {{a gap between}} two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric insulator must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.|$|E
25|$|This {{computation}} {{using the}} induced EMF method {{is identical to}} the computation of the mutual impedance between two dipoles (with infinitesimal conductor radius) separated by the distance a. Because the field at or beyond the edge of an antenna's cylindrical conductor at a distance a is only dependent on the current distribution along the conductor, and not the radius of the conductor, that field is used to compute the mutual impedance between that <b>filamentary</b> antenna and the actual position of the conductor with a radius a. This then supplies the self-impedance of the conductor itself.|$|E
25|$|Birkeland {{currents}} {{are also}} one of a class of plasma phenomena called a z-pinch, so named because the azimuthal magnetic fields produced by the current pinches the current into a <b>filamentary</b> cable. This can also twist, producing a helical pinch that spirals like a twisted or braided rope, and this most closely corresponds to a Birkeland current. Pairs of parallel Birkeland currents will also interact due to Ampère's force law: parallel Birkeland currents moving {{in the same direction}} will attract each other with an electromagnetic force inversely proportional to their distance apart whilst parallel Birkeland currents moving in opposite directions will repel each other. There is also a short-range circular component to the force between two Birkeland currents that is opposite to the longer-range parallel forces.|$|E
25|$|The primary break rate of {{sparking}} Tesla coils is slow {{compared to}} the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over {{a short period of}} time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap Tesla coil, the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the Tesla coil during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create <b>filamentary</b> multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of Tesla coil air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.|$|E
500|$|Striations or string-like structures, {{also known}} as Birkeland currents, [...] are seen in many plasmas, like the plasma ball, the aurora, lightning, {{electric}} arcs, solar flares, and supernova remnants. They are sometimes associated with larger current densities, and the interaction with the magnetic field can form a magnetic rope structure. High power microwave breakdown at atmospheric pressure also leads {{to the formation of}} <b>filamentary</b> structures. [...] (See also Plasma pinch) ...|$|E
500|$|Surrounding and {{stretching}} between galaxies, {{there is a}} rarefied plasma that is organized in a galactic <b>filamentary</b> structure. This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe. It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 105K to 107K, which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons {{to escape from the}} hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 105 K is often called [...] "warm" [...] in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state. When gas falls from the <b>filamentary</b> structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 108K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.|$|E

This spans a diameter of [...] and contains 35,000solar masses of material, which is both larger and less massive than the Orion Nebula. At a distance of , {{this is one of}} the nearest active star forming regions. Located in this region, about 10° to the northeast of Aldebaran, is an asterism NGC 1746 spanning a width of 45 arcminutes.|$|E

Alternative spiral structures have been proposed such as a single spiral arm or a flocculent pattern of long, <b>filamentary,</b> and thick spiral arms.|$|E

2500|$|ACTA2 {{codes for}} an α-actin {{located in the}} smooth muscle, and also in {{vascular}} smooth muscle. It has been noted that the MYH11 mutation could be responsible for at least 14% of hereditary thoracic aortic aneurisms particularly Type 6. This is because the mutated variant produces an incorrect <b>filamentary</b> assembly and a reduced capacity for vascular smooth muscle contraction. [...] Degradation of the aortic media has been recorded in these individuals, with areas of disorganization and hyperplasia as well as stenosis of the aorta’s vasa vasorum. The number of afflictions that the gene is implicated in is increasing. It has been related to Moyamoya disease and {{it seems likely that}} certain mutations in heterozygosis could confer a predisposition to many vascular pathologies, such as thoracic aortic aneurysm and ischaemic heart disease. The α-actin found in smooth muscles is also an interesting marker for evaluating the progress of liver cirrhosis.|$|E
2500|$|The vortex {{method is}} a grid-free {{technique}} for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were {{developed as a}} grid-free methodology {{that would not be}} limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements – in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the N-body problem (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the fast multipole method (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms. [...] They are especially well-suited to simulating <b>filamentary</b> motion, such as wisps of smoke, in real-time simulations such as video games, because of the fine detail achieved using minimal computation.|$|E
