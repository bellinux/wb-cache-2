5|$|The {{work of the}} Great Sejm did not {{end with}} the passing of the Constitution. The Sejm {{continued}} to debate and pass legislation building on and clarifying that document. Among the most notable acts passed after the 3 May was the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and <b>indivisibility</b> of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state, and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Mutual Declaration strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union, while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.|$|E
5|$|To further {{enhance the}} Commonwealth's {{integration}} and security, the constitution abolished the erstwhile union of Poland and Lithuania {{in favor of}} a unitary state. Its full establishment, supported by Stanisław August and Kołlątaj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies.

Related acts included the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and <b>indivisibility</b> of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies.

5|$|The Antankarana were {{originally}} {{a branch of}} the Sakalava royal line called the Zafin'i'fotsy (children of silver). This group split off from the Sakalava in the 16th century following a dispute with the Zafin'i'mena (children of gold) that ended with the latter's exclusive right to the kingship. Having been refused the right to the throne, the Zafin'i'fotsy left the Sakalava homeland on the southwestern coast to settle just north of the boundaries of Sakalava control. The first Antankarana king, Kozobe (1614–39), claimed {{a large part of the}} island's north as his territory, which he split into five provinces each ruled by one of his sons. This territory was rapidly reduced from the south by Zafin'i'mena prince Andriamandisoarivo, who led violent campaigns into bordering Antankarana territory to expand the frontiers of what was to become the Sakalava Kingdom of Iboina at the end of the 17th century. Many Zafin'i'fotsy nobles were killed or quickly surrendered to the advancing Sakalava armies, but oral history celebrates several who resisted, including Andriamanpangy, a descendent of Kozobe. His son Andriantsirotso (1692–1710) founded the Antankarana kingdom, leading the Zafin'i'fotsy further north into the area now protected as Ankarana Reserve and declaring his sovereignty over the north. He was accepted as king both by his own people and by the communities already living in the north, who united together under the name Antankarana (people of the Ankarana rocks). The Sakalava warred with the nascent Antankarana kingdom in its continued effort to claim sovereignty over the territory, but the Antankarana hid themselves in natural shelters formed by the rocks and caves of Ankarana. Eventually they were forced to take refuge at Maroantsetra, a town ruled by a relative named Raholo; Andriantsirotso was able to repel the Sakalava three years later with the support of Raholo's soldiers. Throughout this period Andriantsirotso established the foundations for the kingdom by organizing military cooperation among clans, establishing an administration, developing economic regulations and introducing customs that reinforced a hierarchical social order. According to oral history, at the point when Andriantsirotso was preparing to return to his own capital, a mysterious eight-year-old girl named Tsimatahodrafy arrived in Maroantsetra. She revealed herself to be a sorceress and instructed Andriantsirotso on the rituals to perform en route to ensure his safe return and the establishment of a strong kingdom, including the continuing practice of tying a mat to two tsitakonala trees planted outside the king's house to indicate a royal residence and symbolize the <b>indivisibility</b> of the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} re-examines {{the concept}} of returns to scale vis-à-vis economies of scale since the writings of Adam Smith by relating the former to {{the concept of}}　production unit and the latter {{to the concept of}} firm. To date, the economic theory　underlying DEA models has never been explored in any systematic manner. Hence one observes a significant divergence between the econometric and the DEA approaches for the estimation of production frontier. An attempt is made here to examine the DEA model of efficiency measurement and its application from an economic viewpoint. We show here that the presence of <b>indivisibilities</b> in all multi-stage production processes makes the technology structure non-convex, and therefore, the standard convex DEA production models (e. g., CCR and BCC) fail to exhibit scale economies due to such <b>indivisibilities.</b> However, the non-convex technology embedded in FDH model helps revealing process <b>indivisibilities</b> arising from task-specific processes whereas a homogeneous characterization of production function fails to achieve the same.

50|$|The {{assumption}} of convex production sets plays {{a pivotal role}} in neoclassical economic theory. If the production possibility set is convex then any efficient production plan will be supported by a set of competitive prices. The simplex method proposed by George Dantzig is an effective device for discovering these prices from the underlying linear programming problem. Unfortunately, such prices will no longer exist when the production set displays increasing returns to scale, <b>indivisibilities,</b> or other forms of nonconvexity. The most important example of a production set with <b>indivisibilities</b> is an activity analysis model in which all activity levels are constrained to be integers rather than arbitrary real numbers. Production sets with <b>indivisibilities</b> represents the most extreme form of nonconvexities in production and correspond to integer rather than ordinary linear programming problem. In this case, there is no simple test, like the pricing test arising from convex production sets, to verify whether a production plan is optimal or not.|$|R
40|$|A {{major theme}} of {{economic}} {{theory is that}} optimality, {{at the level of}} the firm or the economy as a whole, can be reached by profit maximization using competitive prices. The conclusion requires the assumption that the production possibility set be convex and is not valid if production displays economies of scale based on significant <b>indivisibilities.</b> The paper provides a specific quantity test for detecting optimality in the presence of <b>indivisibilities</b> and suggests that it may be useful to view the large firm as an algorithm for solving programming problems in which some of the variables assume integral values. ...|$|R
