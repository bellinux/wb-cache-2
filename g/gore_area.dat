40|$|Raised {{pavement}} markers {{have been}} installed on approximately 1, 500 miles of highways {{during the past}} five years. Installations have included supplements to lanelines and edgelines, replacement of lanelines with raised markers, and in <b>gore</b> <b>area</b> delineation. In addition, use of markers as a traffic control measure at lane drops (Research Report No. 384) {{was the subject of a}} study in which the effectiveness of reducing erratic movements was shown. Another study (Report No. 425) dealt with the operational applicability of raised markers and their effectiveness with respect to brightness "' 1 d durability. This study, to evaluate raised markers at high-hazard locations, was conducted in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration in accordance with Basic Agreement DOT-FH- 11 - 9279 (copy included in the Appendix). A series of horizontal curves on US 68 in Mercer County and a narrow bridge over the Kentucky River on KY 627, near Boonesboro, were the sites of the instalhitions. Visual observations, speed data, encroachment data, and accident data were used to evaluate effectiveness. Because pressure sensitive, markers failed to adhere to the pavement and because of snowplow damage, five installations were made at the two sites between October 1977 and August 1978. Considerable emphasis was placed on documentation of the markers during various light and weather conditions. Results provided sufficient data to support recommendations for delineation at similar sites on th...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Most highway engineers agree that freeway exit lane drops create problems in terms of safety and efficiency. A driver can create a hazardous situation when making a sudden lane change out of or into an exit-only lane. Since left exits already violate driver expectancy, the potential for a hazardous situation is greatly increased if the exit lane drop occurs {{on the left side of}} the freeway. As might be expected, a left exit lane drop is a far more serious problem than either of its individual components; more drivers are affected, interactions in the traffic stream are more turbulent, and the potential for confusion and accidents is substantially greater. Exit-only signs and pavement markings are two methods used to communicate an exit lane drop to motorists. Signs are a required treatment in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices while pavement markings are an optional treatment. Sign treatments include diagrammatic signs, modified diagrammatic signs, the use of the black-on-yellow EXIT ONLY panel on conventional signs, and other signs. Markings include alternative <b>gore</b> <b>area</b> treatments and wider, closely-spaced lane lines. The objective of this paper was to determine if these lane drop markings in conjunction with raised pavement markers improve motorist operations at left exit lane drops. To determine the effectiveness of the markings, driver behavior was examined during daylight and evening hours before and after the lane drop markings were installed. Driver behavior was measured using frequency of lane changes and erratic maneuvers, the positions of these behaviors, and the time of day. The before-and-after data indicated that the lane drop markings were an effective treatment at the left exit lane drop. Traffic maneuvers and lane changes were both significantly reduced between the before and after periods. The data also indicated that motorists Performed their lane changes, into and out of the exit-only lane, further upstream of the gore in the after period than in the before period. It is believed that the uniqueness of the lane drop markings further emphasized a changing situation to motorists (i. e. an exit lane drop), and encouraged those drivers who desired to either enter or leave the exit-only lane to merge quicker. Awareness of the impending lane drop also encouraged fewer erratic maneuvers. Consistent use of standardized markings treatments can provide several benefits such as improved driver expectancy at exit lane drops...|$|E

Precambrian rocks are biotite gneiss, the Boulder Creek Granodiorite, granophyre dikes, and quartz veins. The Boulder Creek Granodiorite intrudes the biotite gneiss, and both of these units are cut by north-northwest-trending, granophyre dikes and quartz veins. Biotite gneiss {{contains}} structure elements of a northwest and a northeast fold system. Lineations and foliations in the Boulder Creek Granodiorite are generally concordant to the northeast fold system of the gneiss. Late Paleozoic to Mesozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary formations, in ascending order and with their approximate thicknesses, are the State Bridge Formation, 15 feet; the Chinle and Chugwater Formations undivided, 0 - 95 feet; the Sundance Formations 0 ?- 100 feet; the Morrison Formation, 250 feet; the Dakota Sandstone, 225 feet; the Benton Shale, 340 feet; the Niobrara Formation, 600 feet; and the Pierre Shale.

In 1854, Sir George Gore hired Bridger as a hunting guide out of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The Gore expedition traveled through the central Colorado mountain range before heading north into the Yellowstone <b>area.</b> <b>Gore</b> practiced a policy of heavy treading on the land, hauling 30 wagons and more than 50 servants on his expedition of 6,000 miles.

50|$|The summit <b>area</b> (<b>Gore</b> Mountain) {{contains}} the Straightbrook and High Peaks areas, on {{either end of}} the summit ridge that the Cloud trail follows. Straightbrook is served by a quad chairlift to the Gore summit and contains The Rumor, the resort's steepest trail which is also usually considered the most difficult. The Straightbrook Quad is just south of the lift line of Gore's old gondola, which went from base to summit when it operated (from 1967 to 1999). Under the two lift lines is the Double Barrel glade. Like The Rumor, which is on the same slope, Double Barrel is double-black-diamond terrain. Its difficulty is {{compounded by the fact that}} it is often filled with boulders and moguls. The popular Chatiemac trail on the south side of Straight Brook is used to access several marked glades and unmarked backcountry trails. The High Peaks area is on the other side of the summit and is served by a double chair, one of the mountain's first. It is known for its expert trails and glades.|$|R

40|$|The Florida Department of Transportation used {{a series}} of changeable-message signs that functioned as freeway guide signs to divert traffic to Universal Theme Park via one of two {{eastbound}} exits based on traffic congestion at {{the first of the}} two exits. An examination of crashes along the entire route indicated a statistically significant increase in crashes at the first eastbound exit following the actuation of the system. Furthermore, all of the crashes occurred in close proximity to the exit <b>gore</b> (the crosshatched <b>area</b> at exits that drivers are not supposed to enter or traverse) at the first exit. In Experiment 1, behavioral data were collected using an alternating treatments design. These data revealed that reassigning the exit signs was effective in producing a change in the percentage of drivers using each of the two exits. These data also showed that the reassignment of the theme park exit was associated with an increase in the percentage of motor vehicle conflicts that consisted of vehicles cutting across the exit gore. An analysis revealed that the method used for switching the designated or active theme park exit on the series of changeable-message signs led to the presentation of conflicting messages to some motorists, thus resulting in erratic driving behavior (cutting across the exit gore). In Experiment 2, the treatment evaluated the use of a phased method of switching the designated theme park exit to eliminate the delivery of conflicting messages. The new method for switching the designated theme park exit was not associated with an increase in motorists cutting across the exit gore...|$|R
