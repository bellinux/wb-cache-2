Of the three segments, Jacobson found [...] "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] to be the weakest. He wrote [...] " [...] other than a good ending, it simply doesn’t have a lot going for it" [...] and added that it is the most dated of the three. He continued, [...] "'Diddily' offers a fun horror spoof, and 'Xena' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> superhero bit with plenty of cleverness."

[...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh.
