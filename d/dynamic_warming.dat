40|$|Objective: Cold allodynia {{occurs as}} a major symptom of neuropathic pain states. It remains poorly treated with current analgesics. Ciguatoxins (CTXs), ichthyosarcotoxins that cause ciguatera, produce a large {{peripheral}} sensitization to dynamic cold stimuli in Aδ-fibers by activating sodium channels without producing heat or mechanical allodynia. We used CTXs as a surrogate model of cold allodynia to dissect the framework of cold allodynia–activated central pain pathways. Methods: Reversible cold allodynia was induced in healthy male volunteers by shallow intracutaneous injection of low millimolar concentrations of CTX into the dorsal skin of the forefoot. Cold and warm stimuli were delivered to the treated and the control site using a Peltier-driven thermotest device. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired with a 3 T MRI scanner using a blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) protocol. Results: The CTX-induced substantial peripheral sensitization to cooling stimuli in Aδ-fibers is particularly retrieved in BOLD changes due to dynamic temperature changes and less during constant cooling. Brain areas that responded during cold allodynia were almost always located bilaterally and appeared in the medial insula, medial cingulate cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, frontal areas, and cerebellum. Whereas these areas also produced changes in BOLD signal during the <b>dynamic</b> <b>warming</b> stimulus on the control site, they remained silent during the warming stimuli on the injected site. Interpretation: We describe the defining feature of the cold allodynia pain percept in the human brain and illustrate why ciguatera sufferers often report a perceptual temperature reversal.

30|$|Peak torque (MVC) was {{elevated}} 30  min after FR, {{which was}} also higher than 30  min post-rest. The decline in MVC on D 24 and D 48 of the rest condition {{can be interpreted as}} another marker of the fatiguing effect of the test protocol. It follows that lower neural drive required to complete the submaximal task following FR, compared to rest, indicates less demand on the muscle and, as such, has enabled maintenance of MVC following consecutive days of FR. Previous studies have reported no alteration in strength or performance [6, 49] or improved performance through combining FR with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> up compared to a <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> up alone [13]. The present study is the first to report an improvement in MVC following FR alone.

When force output is important, these findings suggest that for optimal effect, FR should be performed ≥[*] 30  min prior to activity.|$|R
5000|$|Conditioning of the {{shoulder}} area involves full body exercises through {{a full range of}} motion. Exercises that are light to moderate activity over a 30-60 minute time period should increase cardiac output, which in-turn helps carry more oxygen saturated blood throughout the body. Regular running or an upper body ergometer are examples of full body exercise to increase cardiovascular endurance for proper conditioning. The more blood that the heart can pump throughout the body helps endurance performance by supplying the body with more nutrients and oxygen for a prolonged period of time. In addition to conditioning the heart; a good dynamic warm-up, particular to a sport, should be in place to help prevent shoulder injury. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> ups for upper and lower body can be considered a form of conditioning. The athlete can stretch and perform small movements in multiple directions to increase neurovascular response which satisfies <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> ups. The increase in blood flow and neurological feedback will help with physiological and mechanical components for sport performance. This also helps with the exchange of oxygen from the blood to the tissues and synapses of the neurons happening quicker which leads to enhanced performance.|$|R

40|$|The {{equatorial}} {{edge of the}} Western Pacific Warm Pool is operationally {{identified by}} one isotherm ranging between 28 ° and 29 °C, chosen to align with the interannual variability of strong zonal salinity gradients and the convergence of zonal ocean currents. The simulation of this edge is examined in 19 models from the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5), over the historical period from 1950 to 2000. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> pool edge (DWPE), where the zonal currents converge, {{is difficult to determine}} from limited observations and biased models. A new analysis technique is introduced where a proxy for DWPE is determined by the isotherm that most closely correlates with the movements of the strong salinity gradient. It can therefore be a different isotherm in each model. The DWPE is simulated much closer to observations than if a direct temperature-only comparison is made. Aspects of the DWPE remain difficult for coupled models to simulate including the mean longitude, the interannual excursions, and the zonal convergence of ocean currents. Some models have only very weak salinity gradients trapped to the western side of the basin making it difficult to even identify a DWPE. The model&# 8217;s DWPE are generally 1 &# 8211; 2 °C cooler than observed. In line with theory, the magnitude of the zonal migrations of the DWPE are strongly related to the amplitudes of the Nino 3. 4 SST index. Nevertheless, a better simulation of the mean location of the DWPE does not necessarily improve the amplitude of a model&# 8217;s ENSO. It is also found that in a few models (CSIROMk 3. 6, inmcm and inmcm 4 -esm) the warm pool displacements result from a net heating or cooling rather than a zonal advection of warm water. The simulation of the DWPE has implications for ENSO dynamics when considering ENSO paradigms such as the delayed action oscillator mechanism, the Advective-Reflective oscillator, and the zonal-advective feedback.

40|$|Introduction: A warm up is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based warm ups are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game warm up routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based warm up of shorter duration and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a warm up that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH warm up would be superior to the Cll warm up with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll warm up routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each warm up, players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the warm ups and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between warm ups (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between warm ups for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH warm up as significantly better than the Cll warm up (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH warm up in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> up resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined warm up. The vertical jump result of no difference between warm ups contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll warm up mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4].

40|$|Background:  A {{fundamental}} {{relationship between}} power and strength exist {{and is the}} foundation of power output. Vertical jump and weightlifting have many similarities including movement biomechanics. Both countermovement jump and weightlifting exercises uses stretch shortening cycle. Squat jump generally produce lower jump height then countermovement jump and do not include the stretch shortening cycle.   Few studies have investigated if there is a correlation between one-repetition maximum in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement jump and squat jump and investigated if the result is equal in men and women. Aim:  The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if there was a correlation between one-repetition maximum in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement jump and squat jump. The secondary purpose was to investigate if the correlation between one-repetition in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement jump and squat jump was equal in men and women. Method:  Seventeen healthy subjects (n= 17), nine males and eight women (age; 32. 6 ± 9. 4) completed the study. The study included two sessions, the first session was a one-repetition maximum test in clean and the second session was a vertical jump test including countermovement and squat jump. Both sessions included a <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> up and the one-repetition maximum test also included a specific warm up. Result: The result showed a very strong significant correlation between one-repetition maximum in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement jump (r= 0. 77, p= 0. 000) and squat jump (r= 0. 72, p= 0. 001) in the combined group of men and women. When separating men and women the result showed no statistically significance moderate to strong correlations between one-repetition maximum in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement jump (men: r= 0. 45, p= 0. 229; women: r= 0. 59, p= 0. 121) and squat jump (men: r= 0. 40, p= 0. 320; women: r= 0. 46, p= 0. 209). Conclusion:  Findings from this study show that there is a very strong significant correlation between one-repetition maximum in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement and squat jump in the combined group of men and women. When separating men and women the result was in the range of a moderate to strong correlation but not statistically significant. Therefore more research is needed in this area and a larger sample size is recommended to further investigate if the correlation is equal between one-repetition maximum in clean and maximal jump height in countermovement and squat jump in men and women...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and application of}} process-based diagnostics is fundamental in improving {{our understanding of the}} simulation of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) behaviours by coupled general circulation models (CGCMs). Several theoretical frameworks have potential utility as diagnostics; however, their accuracy in describing the dynamics governing ENSO evolution has not yet been systematically evaluated. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of a number of theoretical frameworks - the unified oscillator, Bjerknes stability index, and heat budget equation - to assess their representation of ENSO dynamics and capacity to diagnose ENSO behaviours in CGCMs. The unified oscillator description of ENSO was first investigated for its accuracy in replicating the ENSO cycle simulated by flux-forced output from the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator ocean model (ACCESS-OM). The unified oscillator equations for anomalous sea surface temperature, thermocline depth, and zonal wind stress tendencies were unable to capture the structure, amplitude, and period of the corresponding tendencies in ACCESS-OM. Furthermore, the unified oscillator was considerably less effective than the simple delayed oscillator model in replicating the simulated ENSO cycle. It was concluded that the overly simplified formulation of the unified oscillator limits its power as a diagnostic of ENSO behaviours. This thesis also evaluated the effectiveness of the Bjerknes stability index in representing ENSO ocean feedbacks. Output from ACCESS-OM was used to calculate the Bjerknes stability index feedbacks, which were compared with the corresponding heat budget equation feedbacks. Due to the assumption of linearity in its derivation and an oversimplification of the relationship between ENSO variables, the Bjerknes stability index feedbacks correlated poorly with the original heat budget feedbacks. Therefore, the Bjerknes stability index could not necessarily be relied upon to accurately quantify ENSO dynamics. It follows that in its current form, and compared with the heat budget equation, the Bjerknes stability index has limited utility as a diagnostic tool, particularly in the context of intercomparisons between models that are inherently nonlinear. Finally, the heat budget equation was employed to diagnose the realism of El Niño evolution simulated by an ACCESS coupled model (ACCESS-CM 1. 3). The heat budget equation for the tropical Pacific was calculated in ACCESS-CM 1. 3 and the ocean feedbacks benchmarked against the corresponding terms calculated in ACCESS-OM. Instead of simulating the central Pacific El Niño type, the ACCESS-CM 1. 3 captured a double peaked event with warming centres evolving concurrently in the eastern and western Pacific. The separation between the two peaks arose due to a westward bias in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>warm</b> pool edge. Coupling biases in ACCESS-CM 1. 3 also modified the magnitude, location, and timing of the heat budget dynamics during El Niño evolution relative to ACCESS-OM. Finally, some double peaked events in ACCESS-CM 1. 3 were erroneously categorised as central Pacific El Niños by standard SST metrics. This thesis highlights the importance of considering multiple diagnostics, including those that inherently account for spatial and temporal variability such as the tropical Pacific heat budget equation, when evaluating ENSO behaviours in CGCMs...|$|R

The mechanical behavior and impact toughness of the Grade 5 Ti alloy in a coarse-grained state, and in an ultrafine-grained (UFG) state produced by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) with subsequent deformation-and-thermal treatments via extrusion and warm upsetting in isothermal conditions, were studied extensively. It is shown that a strong refinement of α-grains (less than 250 nm) in the alloy by ECAP and extrusion leads to high strength but with low values of the uniform elongation and lower impact toughness. It is demonstrated that, in order to increase the impact toughness of UFG Ti alloys, it is possible to use approaches realizing ductility enhancement associated with an increase of the strain hardening capacity. An enhancement in the impact toughness of the UFG alloy through an increase in the uniform tensile elongation of the sample is achieved by the preservation of the ultrafine size of α-grains (about 800 nm) with predominantly high-angle boundaries and a decrease in the dislocation density due to recovery and <b>dynamic</b> recrystallization during <b>warm</b> upsetting...|$|R

The effect of these 2 regime changes on plankton indicators was assessed and checked against previous studies. The 1998 change represents {{a shift in the}} abundance and seasonal patterns of dinoflagellates and the dominant zooplankton group, the neritic copepods. Furthermore, environmental factors such as air temperature, wind speed and the North Atlantic water inflow were identified as potential drivers of change in seasonal patterns, and the most-likely environmental causes for detected changes were assessed. We suggest that a change in the balance of dissolved nutrients driven by these environmental factors was the cause of the latest change in plankton community structure, which in turn could have affected the North Sea fish communit...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{abundance}} of wild salmon (Salmo salar) in the North Atlantic has declined markedly {{since the late}} 1980 s {{as a result of}} increased marine mortality that coincided with a marked rise in sea temperature in oceanic foraging areas. There is substantial evidence to show that temperature governs the growth, survival, and maturation of salmon during their marine migrations through either direct or indirect effects. In an earlier study (2003), long-term changes in three trophic levels (salmon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton) were shown to be correlated significantly with sea surface temperature (SST) and northern hemisphere temperature (NHT). A sequence of trophic changes ending with a stepwise decline in the total nominal catch of North Atlantic salmon (regime shift in ∼ 1986 / 1987) was superimposed on a trend to a <b>warmer</b> <b>dynamic</b> regime. Here, the earlier study is updated with catch and abundance data to 2010, confirming earlier results and detecting a new abrupt shift in ∼ 1996 / 1997. Although correlations between changes in salmon, plankton, and temperature are reinforced, the significance of the correlations is reduced because the temporal autocorrelation of time-series substantially increased due to a monotonic trend in the time-series, probably related to global warming. This effect may complicate future detection of effects of climate change on natural systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Subtropical marine {{low cloud}} {{sensitivity}} to an idealized {{climate change is}} compared in six large eddy simulation (LES) models as part of CGILS. July cloud cover is simulated at three locations over the subtropical Northeast Pacific Ocean which are typified by cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) under well-mixed stratocumulus, cool SSTs under decoupled stratocumulus, and shallow cumulus clouds overlying warmer SSTs. The idealized climate change includes a uniform 2 K SST increase with corresponding moist-adiabatic warming aloft and subsidence changes, but no change in free-tropospheric relative humidity, surface wind speed, or CO 2. For each case, realistic advective forcings and boundary conditions are generated for the control and perturbed states which each LES runs for 10 days into a quasi-steady state. For the control climate, the LESs correctly produce the expected cloud type at all three locations. With the perturbed forcings, all models simulate boundary-layer deepening due to reduced subsidence in the warmer climate, with less deepening at the warm-SST location due to regulation by precipitation. The models do not show a consistent response of liquid water path and albedo in the perturbed climate, though the majority predict cloud thickening (negative cloud feedback) at the cold-SST location and slight cloud thinning (positive cloud feedback) at the cool-SST and warm-SST locations. In perturbed climate simulations at the cold-SST location without the subsidence decrease, cloud albedo consistently decreases across the models. Thus, boundary-layer cloud feedback on climate change involves compensating thermodynamic and <b>dynamic</b> effects of <b>warming,</b> and may interact with patterns of subsidence change. 1...|$|R

40|$|Understanding and {{predicting}} warming {{effects on}} vegetation {{is a key}} challenge of the 21 st century. To date, warming experiments have been limited to isolated laboratory studies, which have been criticised as too small-scale and overly simplistic {{because they were not}} conducted in a natural context. As such, understanding the future consequence of warming using a natural environment and across an effective timeframe has become a key goal of vegetation <b>dynamic</b> studies. <b>Warming</b> experiments in undisturbed settings are particularly important for understanding the complex responses of vegetation to warming within a multifunctional ecosystem. Furthermore, a natural setting approach can include other variables that will improve the current understanding of the effects of warming on vegetation. Through the course of this thesis, I developed a warming experiment to utilise natural thermal gradients in a geothermal ecosystem spanning a wide range of soil temperatures from 18 - 56 °C. First, I used historical aerial photographs from 1975 to 2016 to review the change in vegetation distribution around geothermal surface features, correlating the change with thermal infrared images captured in 2009 and 2014. This review revealed that as the geothermal features cool, vegetation growth and development is enhanced. Thus, examining the response of vegetation to changes in thermal gradients provided a means of simulating warming. Second, I used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to capture thermal infrared and standard colour imagery to address the knowledge gap in remote sensing data. I demonstrated the use of a small, cost effective UAV and highlighted techniques in sampling, processing and analysing images captured by UAV. Third, after investigating the historical response of vegetation to geothermal features, I set up a field experiment to investigate vegetation regeneration and root biomass responses to the soil temperature gradients and other geothermally associated conditions (soil chemistry). I found that although other conditions did limit vegetation establishment and growth, the thermal gradient had the most dominant effect. Given the important role that vegetation plays in the ecosystem, it is vital to understand any unpredictable changes and then to apply appropriate actions within an appropriate timeframe. This thesis addresses a critical gap in experimental soil warming, making use of a geothermal system. Warming experiments within geothermal gradients demonstrate how small-scale experiments can be used to inform future vegetation responses to warming. Using the geothermal system as the natural setting for a warming experiment also provides the opportunity to replicate similar studies around the world to improve our understanding of local area vegetation dynamics...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from a {{comprehensive}} submillimeter spectral survey toward the source Orion South, based on data obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory, covering the frequency range of 480 to 1900 GHz. We detect 685 spectral lines with signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) > 3 σ, originating from 52 different molecular and atomic species. We model each of the detected species assuming conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. This analysis provides {{an estimate of the}} physical conditions of Orion South (column density, temperature, source size, and V LSR). We find evidence for three different cloud components: a cool (T ex ˜ 20 - 40 K), spatially extended (> 60 ″), and quiescent (ΔV FWHM ˜ 4 km s- 1) component; a warmer (T ex ˜ 80 - 100 K), less spatially extended (˜ 30 ″), and dynamic (ΔV FWHM ˜ 8 km s- 1) component, which is likely affected by embedded outflows; and a kinematically distinct region (T ex > 100 K; V LSR ˜ 8 km s- 1), dominated by emission from species that trace ultraviolet irradiation, likely at the surface of the cloud. We find little evidence for the existence of a chemically distinct “hot-core” component, likely due to the small filling factor of the hot core or hot cores within the Herschel beam. We find that the chemical composition of the gas in the cooler, quiescent component of Orion South more closely resembles that of the quiescent ridge in Orion-KL. The gas in the <b>warmer,</b> <b>dynamic</b> component, however, more closely resembles that of the Compact Ridge and Plateau regions of Orion-KL, suggesting that higher temperatures and shocks also have an influence on the overall chemistry of Orion South...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to select the most effective warm asphalt additives for mix practice based on a series of laboratory testing programs such as density, Marshall stability, freeze-thaw splitting strength, dynamic stability, and bending beam strain. The experimental design of warm mix asphalt included the use of three commonlyused additives, two typical aggregate gradations, one crushed aggregate, and one modified asphalt. Results showed that: (1) the bulk specific gravity and air voids of all the mix specimens were similar to those of controls; (2) the Marshall stability and flow values of the warm stone mastic asphalt were 6. 8 %– 26. 6 % and 3. 5 %– 10. 3 %% higher than those of controls, respectively, and those of the warm asphalt concrete were 6. 1 %– 15. 6 % and 6. 5 %– 9. 7 % higher than those of controls, respectively; (3) the indirect tensile strength of two types of mixtures was 1. 7 %– 14. 4 % lower than that of controls, and the average tensile strength ratio of the warm stone mastic asphalt and asphalt concrete was 4. 3 % and 1. 3 % higher than that of controls, respectively; (4) the <b>dynamic</b> stability of <b>warm</b> mix specimens was 10. 8 %– 16. 6 % lower than that of the controls; (5) the average bending failure strain of warm stone mastic asphalt was 7. 6 % higher than that of the controls, and that of warm asphalt concrete was 12. 8 % lower than that of the controls; (6) Overall, warm asphalt mixtures with Sasobit and Rediset had relatively best performances required in Southeast China, where rutting and stripping are the main failures of asphalt pavement...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the early Eocene {{was a time of}} extreme global warmth, extending to the high latitudes. However, there are discrepancies between the results of many previous modelling studies and the proxy data at high latitudes, with models struggling to simulate the shallow temperature gradients of this time period to the same extent as the proxies indicate. Vegetation-climate feedbacks {{play an important role in}} the present day, but are often neglected in paleoclimate modelling studies and this may be a contributing factor to resolving the model-data discrepancy. Here we investigate these vegetation-climate feedbacks by carrying out simulations of the early Eocene climate at 2 × and 4 × pre-industrial atmospheric CO 2 with fixed vegetation (homogeneous shrubs everywhere) and dynamic vegetation. The results show that the simulations with <b>dynamic</b> vegetation are <b>warmer</b> in the global annual mean than the simulations with fixed shrubs by 0. 9 °C at 2 × and 1. 8 °C at 4 ×. In addition, the warming when CO 2 is doubled from 2 × to 4 × is 1 °C higher (in the global annual mean) with dynamic vegetation than with fixed shrubs. This corresponds to an increase in climate sensitivity of 26 %. This difference in warming is enhanced at high latitudes, with temperatures increasing by over 50 % in some regions of Antarctica. In the Arctic, ice-albedo feedbacks are responsible for the majority of this warming. On a global scale, energy balance analysis shows that the enhanced <b>warming</b> with <b>dynamic</b> vegetation is mainly associated with an increase in atmospheric water vapour but changes in clouds also contribute to the temperature increase. It is likely that changes in surface albedo due to changes in vegetation cover resulted in an initial warming which triggered these water vapour feedbacks. In conclusion, dynamic vegetation goes some way to resolving the discrepancy, but our modelled temperatures cannot reach the same warmth as the data suggests in the Arctic. This {{suggests that}} there are additional mechanisms, not included in this modelling framework, behind the polar warmth...|$|R
