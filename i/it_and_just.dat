It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny." ...|$|E

She recalled one meeting, [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration", because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see."

Big Boi was introduced to Yelawolf's music through his younger brother and invited him to record after seeing him perform. The track [...] "Follow Us" [...] features Vonnegutt, an act from Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label. He originally proposed a rock-influenced track for Yelawolf, but was persuaded by him to send the instrumental for [...] "You Ain't No DJ". According to Yelawolf, he [...] "wrote like 64 bars and turned in the huge verse", which was edited down to 16 and eight-bar parts of his original verse for the finished song. Big Boi also attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate with singer-songwriter Kate Bush, and managed to work with funk music pioneer George Clinton on [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", an experience he related to [...] "Dorothy {{going to see the}} Wizard of Oz.

500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>just</b> did it on 4 track".|$|E

I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles.
