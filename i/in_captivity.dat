5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. <b>In</b> <b>captivity,</b> a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of their}} , the Germans began {{repatriating}} Flemish prisoners of war in August 1940. By February 1941, 105,833 Flemish soldiers had been repatriated. Gradually, more prisoners were released, but 67,000 Belgian soldiers were still <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> by 1945. Many prisoners of war were forced to work in quarries or in agriculture and around 2,000 died <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> White cockatoos are more commonly found <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Fossas are {{occasionally}} held <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> in zoos. They first bred <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> in 1974 {{in the zoo}} of Montpellier, France. The next year, at a {{time when}} there were only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the Duisburg Zoo in Germany acquired one; this zoo later started a successful breeding program, and most zoo fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>captivity,</b> Campbell's dwarf hamsters breed {{throughout}} the year, with no fixed breeding season, {{but a large}} number are born in the summer months. In the wild, three to four litters are produced each year, {{with an average of}} eight offspring per litter. <b>In</b> <b>captivity,</b> females can have between one and 18 litters per year, with one to nine offspring per litter.|$|E

5|$|These snakes do well <b>in</b> <b>captivity,</b> {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down <b>in</b> <b>captivity,</b> always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

5|$|A hamster <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, {{which have}} high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b>|$|E
