50|$|Big molecules, {{also called}} high {{molecular}} weight, HMW molecules, are mostly oligomers or polymers of small molecules or chains of amino acids. Thus, within pharma sciences, peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides constitute the major categories.Peptides and proteins are oligomers or polycondensates of amino acids linked {{together by a}} carboxamide group. The threshold {{between the two is}} as at about 50 amino acids. Because of their unique biological functions, a significant and growing part of new drug discovery and development is focused on this class of biomolecules. Their biological functions are determined by the exact arrangement or sequence of different amino acids in their makeup. For the synthesis of peptides, four categories of fine chemicals, commonly referred to as peptide building blocks (PBBs), are key, namely amino acids (=starting materials), protected amino acids, peptide fragments and peptides themselves. Along the way, the molecular weights increase from about 102 up to 104 and the unit prices from about $100 up to $105 per kilogram. However, {{only a small part of}} the total amino acid production is used for peptide synthesis. In fact, L-glutamic acid, D, L-methionine, L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine are used in large quantities as food and feed additives. About 50 peptide drugs are commercialized. The number of amino acids that make up a specific peptide varies widely. At the low end are the dipeptides. The most important drugs with a dipeptide (L-alanyl-L-proline) moiety are the “-pril” cardiovascular drugs, such as Alapril (lisinopril), Captoril (captopril), Novolac (<b>imidapril)</b> and Renitec (enalapril). Also the artificial sweetener Aspartame (N-L-α-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester) is a dipeptide. At the high end there is the anticoagulant hirudin, MW ≈ 7000, which is composed of 65 amino acids.|$|E

MethodsThirty-four subjects with diabetic nephropathy were enrolled in the present study. All the subjects had hypertension and urinary albumin index (UAI) < 1, 000 mg/g creatinine. They were divided into three groups. Group 1 of 16 subjects was initially treated with <b>imidapril</b> (5 – 10 mg). Group 2 of eight subjects had losartan (50 – 100 mg) added to consecutive therapy with <b>imidapril.</b> Group 3 of 10 subjects had <b>imidapril</b> (5 – 10 mg) added to consecutive therapy with losartan. Blood pressure and UAI were determined before and 3 and 6 months after the start of the present study. ResultsBlood pressure was significantly decreased in Group 1 subjects. Blood pressure was also reduced in Groups 2 and 3, but its reduction was not significant. <b>Imidapril</b> significantly reduced UAI in Group 1, from 213. 1 ± 46. 6 to 111. 6 ± 35. 6 (p < 0. 001) and 114. 5 ± 35. 4 mg/g creatinine (p < 0. 01) 3 and 6 months after <b>imidapril</b> treatment, respectively. The addition of losartan further reduced UAI in Group 2, who had been treated with <b>imidapril.</b> UAI decreased from 328. 8 ± 87. 3 to 185. 3 ± 51. 4 (p < 0. 05) and 244. 8 ± 88. 3 mg/g creatinine 3 and 6 months after the addition of losartan, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Renal aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) is {{critical}} for main-taining water balance and is associated with hypertension. Anti-hypertensive drugs, including <b>imidapril,</b> improve kidney function; however, it remains unclear whether these effects are mediated through the regulation of AQP 2. In this study, the effects of <b>imidapril</b> on AQP 2 expression in the kidneys and excretion in urine were assessed in hypertensive rats. Hypertension was induced in 24 rats, which were randomized into a control group, treated with water only, and an <b>imidapril</b> treatment group (n= 12 per group). Blood and urine samples were collected from all rats to determine blood pressure (BP), serum Na+, urine volume and urine osmolality after 8 weeks of treatment. Molecular and immunological techniques were {{used to measure the}} expression of AQP 2 in the kidneys. Urine AQP 2 concentration was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The concentration of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), a regulator of AQP 2 was detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Hypertensive rats treated with <b>imidapril</b> exhibited reduced BP and 24 -h urine osmolality, with a concomitant increase in 24 -h urine volume, compared with control hypertensive rats (P< 0. 05). Additionally, the expression of Aqp 2 mRNA, detected by RT-PCR, and AQP 2 protein, detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot-ting, in renal tissue significantly decreased (P< 0. 05). Finally, urine AQP 2 concentration increased while plasma AVP concen-tration decreased following <b>imidapril</b> treatment (P< 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>imidapril</b> and the calcium antagonist amlodipine on endothelial function before and after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. BACKGROUNDThere are limited data on whether and how long endothelial function is improved after initiation of ACE inhibitor treatment and how the grade of endothelial function further progresses after improvement of endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension. METHODSThe forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured in 25 patients with essential hypertension and in 25 normotensive subjects by using strain-gauge plethysmography during reactive hyperemia (RH) (280 mm Hg for 5 min) and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (NTG, 0. 3 mg). RESULTSThe FBF of patients with essential hypertension during RH was significantly less than that of normotensive subjects. The increase in FBF after sublingual NTG was similar in both groups. Both <b>imidapril</b> (n = 13) and amlodipine (n = 12) significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic after eight weeks of treatment from the pretreatment values. Forearm vascular resistance was significantly decreased after two weeks of treatment. <b>Imidapril</b> significantly augmented RH after 12 weeks of treatment from the pretreatment values (31. 6 ± 5. 7 to 38. 2 ± 6. 0 ml/min per 100 ml tissue, p < 0. 05), whereas amlodipine did not alter RH for each treatment period. The ability of <b>imidapril</b> to improve RH was maintained throughout the 48 -week treatment period. There was no significant difference in RH at 12, 24 and 48 weeks. The increase in FBF after sublingual administration of NTG was similar in all treatment periods for the two groups. The infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, abolished the enhancement of RH in hypertensive patients treated with <b>imidapril.</b> CONCLUSIONSThese findings suggest that the ACE inhibitor <b>imidapril</b> augments RH after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with essential hypertension and that this ACE inhibitor-induced augmentation of RH may be due to an increase in NO...|$|E

We utilized two mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced type 1 diabetic CD- 1 mice and type 2 diabetic nephropathy model db/db mice. Intervention with the ACE inhibitor <b>imidapril,</b> oral AcSDKP, or <b>imidapril</b> + oral AcSDKP combination therapy increased urine AcSDKP levels.

AcSDKP oral administration, either AcSDKP alone or in addition to <b>imidapril,</b> ameliorated glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Plasma cystatin C levels were higher in both models, at euthanasia, and were restored by all the treatment groups. The levels of antifibrotic miRs, such as miR- 29 or let- 7, were suppressed in the kidneys of both models; all treatments, especially the combination of <b>imidapril</b> + oral AcSDKP, restored the antifibrotic miR levels to a normal value or even higher.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} dose-related {{clinical and}} neurohumoral effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{in patients with}} chronic heart failure (CHF), we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of three doses (2. 5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg) of the long-acting ACE inhibitor <b>imidapril.</b> BACKGROUND: The ACE inhibitors have become a cornerstone {{in the treatment of}} CHF, but whether high doses are more effective than low doses has not been fully elucidated, nor have the mechanisms involved in such a dose-related effect. METHODS: In a parallel group comparison, the effects of three doses of <b>imidapril</b> were examined. We studied 244 patients with mild to moderate CHF (New York Heart Association class II-III: +/- 80 %/ 20 %), who were stable on digoxin and diuretics. Patients were treated for 12 weeks, and the main end points were exercise capacity and plasma neurohormones. RESULTS: At baseline, the four treatment groups were well-matched for demographic variables. Of the 244 patients, 25 dropped out: 3 patients died, and 9 developed progressive CHF (3 / 182 patients on <b>imidapril</b> vs. 6 / 62 patients on placebo, p < 0. 05). Exercise time increased 45 s in the 10 -mg group (p = 0. 02 vs. placebo), but it did not significantly change in the 5 -mg (+ 16 s), and 2. 5 -mg (+ 11 s) <b>imidapril</b> group, compared to placebo (+ 3 s). Physical working capacity also increased in a dose-related manner.

Treatment of 3 weeks infarcted animals with <b>imidapril</b> (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1) for a period of 5 weeks improved the left ventricle function and decreased the attenuation of inotropic response to ATP. ATP-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i was significantly depressed in cardiomyocytes isolated from the failing heart and this change was partially attenuated by <b>imidapril</b> treatment. However, the binding characteristics of 35 S-labeled adenosine 5 ′-(γ-thio) triphosphate in sarcolemma isolated from the failing heart remained unaltered. ATP-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i was depressed by verapamil and cibacron blue in both control and failing heart cardiomyocytes; however, the ATP response in the failing hearts, unlike the control preparations, was not decreased by ryanodine. This insensitivity to ryanodine was attenuated by <b>imidapril</b> treatment. Treatment of infarcted rats with enalapril and losartan produced effects similar to <b>imidapril.</b> These findings indicate that the positive inotropic response to ATP and ATP-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i in cardiomyocytes are impaired in heart failure.

40|$|Aims Symptoms {{of cancer}} {{cachexia}} (CC) include fatigue, shortness of breath, and impaired exercise capacity, {{which are also}} hallmark symptoms of heart failure (HF). Herein, we evaluate the effects of drugs commonly used to treat HF (bisoprolol, <b>imidapril,</b> spironolactone) on development of cardiac wasting, HF, and death in the rat hepatoma CC model (AH- 130). Methods and results Tumour-bearing rats showed a progressive loss of body weight and left-ventricular (LV) mass that {{was associated with a}} progressive deterioration in cardiac function. Strikingly, bisoprolol and spironolactone significantly reduced wasting of LV mass, attenuated cardiac dysfunction, and improved survival. In contrast, <b>imidapril</b> had no beneficial effect. Several key anabolic and catabolic pathways were dysregulated in the cachectic hearts and, in addition, we found enhanced fibrosis that was corrected by treatment with spironolactone. Finally, we found cardiac wasting and fibrotic remodelling in patients who {{died as a result of}} CC. In living cancer patients, with and without cachexia, serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide and aldosterone were elevated. Conclusion Systemic effects of tumours lead not only to CC but also to cardiac wasting, associated with LV-dysfunction, fibrotic remodelling, and increased mortality. These adverse effects of the tumour on the heart and on survival can be mitigated by treatment with either the β-blocker bisoprolol or the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone.

40|$|Human carboxylesterase (CES) 1 A is {{responsible}} for the biotrans-formation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as <b>imidapril</b> and temocapril. Because antidiabetic or antihyperlipi-demic drugs are often coadministered with ACE inhibitors in clin-ical pharmacotherapy, the inhibitory effect of these drugs on CES 1 A 1 enzyme activity was investigated. In addition, the inhibi-tory effect on CES 2 enzyme activity was evaluated to compare it with that on CES 1 A 1. The inhibitory effects were evaluated with 11 antidiabetic and 12 antihyperlipidemic drugs. The <b>imidapril</b> hydro-lase activity by recombinant CES 1 A 1 was substantially inhibited by lactone ring-containing statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin and thiazolidinediones such as troglitazone and rosiglitazone. The activity in human liver microsomes was also strongly inhibited by simvastatin and troglitazone (Ki 0. 8 0. 1 and 5. 6 0. 2 M, respectively). However, statins containing no lactone ring such as pravastatin and fluvastatin did not show strong inhibition. 7 -Ethyl- 10 -[4 -(1 -piperidono) - 1 -piperidono]carbonyloxycamptothecin hydrolase activity by recombinant human CES 2 was substantially inhibited by fenofibrate (Ki 0. 04 0. 01 M) as well as by simvastatin (0. 67 0. 09 M).

In AH- 130 study the treatment of tumor-bearing rats with cardiovascular drugs was made. The analysis of cardiac data of cachectic cancer patients was presented in this research as well. The following scientific findings were shown: 1) Comparison of a cancer cachexia model (AH- 130 Yoshida Hepatoma) with an cardiac cachexia model (myocardial infarction) : • While tumor animals developed a real cachexia characterized by a loss of fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, infarct animals did not. Tumor animals had also atrophic organs, especially the heart. • Tumor animals showed a myocardial dysfunction visible by echocardiographic parameters like stroke volume, fractional shortening and cardiac output. Blood pressure and repolarization decreased in the heart due to the tumor inoculation. Biomarkers confirmed the damage of the heart and ventricular remodeling. Infarct animals developed heart failure induced edema. In addition, myocardial induction led to a gain of heart weight, dilatation of the ventricle and there was a trend to an increase of the heart rate. In contrast the ventricular diameter and the heart rate decreased in tumor-bearing rats distinguishing this cardiomyopathy from classical heart failure. • Analysis of the heart revealed more apoptosis, autophagy and a higher ubiquitin proteasome activity in the tumor animals. Furthermore, these animals showed a reduced anabolic signaling. In contrast myocardial infarction induced hypertrophic signaling. 2) Treatment of tumor-bearing rats with cardiovascular drugs (AH- 130) : • The specific β 1 -blocker bisoprolol (5 mg/kg/d) or the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone (50 mg/kg/d) showed an increase in the survival of tumor-bearing animals, while the unspecific β-blocker carvedilol (30 mg/kg/d) or the angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitor <b>imidapril</b> (0, 4 mg/kg/d) showed no positive effect. • Bisoprolol or spironolactone could prevent the loss of skeletal muscle mass, fat mass and left ventricular tissue. Treatment with spironolactone increased the left ventricular mass and led to an improved heart function. <b>Imidapril</b> inhibited the loss of body weight, but had no effect on the impaired heart function in tumor-bearing animals. Carvedilol could neither attenuate the cachexia nor the cardiomyopathy. • Bisoprolol or spironolacton reduced the catabolism and increased anabolism in Tumor-bearing animals, but carvedilol or <b>imidapril</b> did not. 3) Analysis of heart data of cachectic cancer patients: • The results revealed atrophy of the heart with a reduced posterior wall and elevated fibrosis.

She had a surgical history of left Blalock–Taussig shunt {{at the age of}} 2  months, bidirectional Glenn operation at the age of 3  years, and Fontan palliation (extracardiac conduit total cavopulmonary connection without fenestration of the atrium) at the age of 5  years for her congenital hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), double outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular septal defect, pulmonary atresia, and absence of inferior vena cava. She had received aspirin, warfarin, propranolol, <b>imidapril,</b> furosemide, and spironolactone preoperatively. Her activities of daily living were maintained. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal systolic and diastolic function of the univentricular chamber with trivial atrioventricular valve regurgitation.|$|E
40|$|Continuous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibitor}} therapy {{does not}} necessarily produce significant decreases in plasma aldosterone levels (aldosterone escape). We examined the role of aldosterone escape in 75 essential hypertensive patients treated with an ACE inhibitor (enalapril maleate [34 patients], <b>imidapril</b> hydrochloride [24 patients] or trandolapril [17 patients]) for 40 weeks. With treatment, blood pressure decreased and plasma renin activity increased, while plasma aldosterone concentrations did not change. Aldosterone escape was observed in 38 of the 75 patients and in 17 of 37 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy before treatment. Left ventricular mass index did not change in patients with aldosterone escape but decreased significantly in patients without aldosterone escape. The present study demonstrated {{a high incidence of}} aldosterone escape in patients with essential hypertension despite the use of ACE inhibitors. The results also suggest that aldosterone escape may reverse the beneficial effects of an ACE inhibitor on left ventricular hypertrophy...|$|E

Since the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in heart failure, this study tested the hypothesis that attenuation of cardiac SL changes in congestive heart failure (CHF) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with prevention of alterations in gene expression for SL Na +-K + ATPase and Na +-Ca 2 + exchanger. CHF in rats due to MI was induced by occluding the coronary artery and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with an ACE inhibitor, <b>imidapril</b> (1 mg/kg/day), for 4 weeks. Heart dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in the infarcted animals were associated with depressed SL Na +-K + ATPase and Na +-Ca 2 + exchange activities. Protein content and mRNA levels for Na +-Ca 2 + exchanger as well as Na +-K + ATPase α 1 -, α 2 - and β 1 -isoforms were depresse...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} review article by Trobec et al., it was stated {{that there are no}} data on the effects of ACE {{inhibition}} in the field of cancer cachexia, even though there is some evidence for a beneficial effect on muscle mass in chronic heart failure, i. e. cardiac cachexia [1]. While it is true that there are no PubMed-listed clinical studies, Ark Therapeutics has completed a phase III clinical trial on the use of <b>imidapril</b> in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer which showed significant reduction in the rate of weight loss in both NSCLC and colorectal cancer but not in pancreatic cancer. However, when analyzed together, the significance on weight loss reduction was lost and hence the trial missed its primary endpoint [2]. These results prompted a second phase III trial in August 2008, which was focused on NSCLC [3]. However, due to a commercial refocusing, Ark Therapeutics is no longer pursuing this study. Furthermore, there is evidence from pre-clinical models that ACE inhibition can indeed reduce wasting of muscle mass in cancer cachexia [4]. Taken together, there are some data—albeit limited—on the usefulness of ACE inhibition in cancer cachexia.

40|$|Regulators of G-protein {{signaling}} protein 2 (RGS 2) play an irreplaceable role in {{the control}} of normal blood pressure (BP). One RGS 2 (- 391, C>G) genetic variation markedly changes its mRNA expression levels. This study explored the relationship between this genetic variation and the responses to antihypertensive drugs in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. Genetic variations of RGS 2 were successfully identified in 367 specimens using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays. All patients were treated with conventional doses of antihypertensives after a 2 -week run-in period and followed-up according to our protocol. A general linear model {{multivariate analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) was used for the data analysis. A significant difference in the mean systolic BP change was observed between RGS 2 (- 391, C>G) CC/CG (n = 82) and GG (n = 38) genotype carriers (- 13. 6 vs. - 19. 9 mmHg, P = 0. 043) who were treated with candesartan, irbesartan or <b>imidapril</b> at the end of 6 weeks. In addition, the patients' BP responses to α,β-adrenergic receptor blockers exhibited an age-specific association with the RGS 2 (- 391, C>G) genetic variation at the end of 4 weeks. The RGS 2 (- 391, C>G) genetic polymorphism may serve as a biomarker to predict a patient's response to antihypertensive drug therapy, but future studies need to confirm this...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimThe {{evaluation}} of mutagenic properties of <b>imidapril</b> hydrochloride (IMD) and its degradation impurity, diketopiperazine derivative (DKP), nitrosation mixtures {{was conducted in}} order to analyze the carcinogenic risk of IMD long-term treatment in patients. In this study an in vitro Ames test with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 strains was used. BackgroundIMD and DKP contain nitrogen atoms, which makes them theoretically vulnerable to in vivo nitrosation with the production of N-nitroso compounds (NOC). NOC, in turn, are known animal mutagens indicating that their endogenous production from nitrosable drugs constitutes a carcinogenic hazard. Materials and methodsPure IMD sample was exposed to forced degradation conditions of increased temperature and dry air {{in order to achieve}} a DKP sample. Both samples were then treated with a nitrosating agent and the obtained nitrosation mixtures were subjected to mutagenicity analysis by the Ames test with S. typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 strains in the presence and absence of metabolic activation system (S 9 mix) using a commercial Ames MPF 98 / 100 microplate format mutagenicity assay kit. ResultsNone of the six concentrations of the investigated nitrosation mixtures exhibited any mutagenic potential in both S. typhimurium strains. The addition of S 9 mix did not alter the non-mutagenic properties of the studied compounds. ConclusionsThe nitrite treatment of both studied compounds has no impact on their mutagenic properties under the conditions of the present studies. Hence, IMD and DKP nitrosation mixtures are classified as non-mutagens in this test...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:Cutaneous drug {{reactions}} may {{be classified}} {{with regard to}} pathogenesis and clinical morphology. They may be mediated by both immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms. Case report:A 56 year old female presented with widespread patches and macules, concentrated on her face, trunk and extremities. The lesions were pruritic, and temporally associated with intake of benzapril hydrochloride, <b>imidapril</b> and metformin. Methods:Biopsies for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination, {{as well as for}} immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) analysis were performed for diagnostic purposes, and also to evaluate the lesional immune response. Results:Hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated a histologically unremarkable epidermis. Within the dermis, a moderately florid, superficial and deep, perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, histiocytes and rare eosinophils was identified, consistent with an allergic drug reaction. DIF demonstrated deposits of IgE, Complement/C 3 and fibrinogen around dermal blood vessels. IHC demonstrated positive staining with HAM- 56 and myeloid/histoid antigen in the cell infiltrate around the upper dermal blood vessels. HLA-ABC was overexpressed around those vessels, as well as around dermal sweat glands. COX- 2 demonstrated positive staining in both the epidermis and upper dermis. Conclusion:Drug reactions are significant causes of skin rashes. In the current case, we were able to identify multiple antigen presenting cells {{in the area of the}} main inflammatory process. The immunologic case findings suggest that allergic drug eruptions may represent complex processes. An allergic drug reaction should be suspected whenever dermal, perivascular deposits of fibrinogen, Complement/C 3 and other markers such as IgE are identified via DIF...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), {{also known}} as kininase II, {{functions}} not only to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but also to cleave bradykinin into inactive fragments. Thus, ACE inhibition causes the tissue accumulation of bradykinin, exerting either of two opposite effects: anti- or proangiogenic. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the role of bradykinin in the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), with or without ACE inhibition. METHODS. Laser photocoagulation was used to induce CNV in wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 -R) -deficient mice. Wild-type mice were pretreated with the ACE inhibitor <b>imidapril,</b> with or without the bradykinin B 2 receptor (B 2 -R) antagonist icatibant daily for 6 days before photocoagulation, and the treatment was continued daily until the end of the study. CNV response was analyzed by volumetric measurements using confocal microscopy 1 week after laser injury. The mRNA and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 1 in the retinal pigment epithelium–choroid complex were examined by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS. ACE inhibition led to significant suppression of CNV development to the level seen in AT 1 -R-deficient mice. B 2 -R blockade together with high-dose but not low-dose ACE inhibition resulted in more potent suppression of CNV than did ACE inhibition alone. B 2 -R blockade alone exhibited little or no effect on CNV. VEGF, ICAM- 1, and MCP- 1 levels, elevated by CNV induction, were significantly suppressed by ACE inhibition...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSimple, accurate, {{sensitive}} and validated UV spectrophotometric and chemometric methods were {{developed for the}} determination of <b>imidapril</b> hydrochloride (IMD) {{in the presence of}} both its alkaline (AKN) and oxidative (OXI) degradation products and in its pharmaceutical formulation. Method A is the fourth derivative spectra (D 4) which allows the determination of IMD in the presence of both AKN and OXD, in pure form and in tablets by measuring the peak amplitude at 243. 0 nm. Methods B, C and D, manipulating ratio spectra, were also developed. Method B is the double divisor–ratio difference spectrophotometric one (DD–RD) by computing the difference between the amplitudes of IMD ratio spectra at 232 and 256. 3 nm. Method C is the double divisor-first derivative of ratio spectra method (DD–DR 1) at 243. 2 nm, while method D is the mean centering of ratio spectra (MCR) at 288. 0 nm. Methods A, B, C and D could successfully determine IMD in a concentration range of 4. 0 – 32. 0 µg/mL. Methods E and F are principal component regression (PCR) and partial least-squares (PLS), respectively, for the simultaneous determination of IMD in the presence of both AKN and OXI, in pure form and in its tablets. The developed methods have the advantage of simultaneous determination of the cited components without any pre-treatment. The accuracy, precision and linearity ranges of the developed methods were determined. The results obtained were statistically compared with those of a reported HPLC method, and {{there was no significant difference}} between the proposed methods and the reported method regarding both accuracy and precision...|$|E
30|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have been}} identified in human carboxylesterases (Kim et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2008; Yamada et al., 2010). Some of the SNPs are localized in the promoter or coding regions that affect protein expression or enzyme activity. Particularly, a coding SNP (GGG to GAG) in CES 1 exon 4 results in Gly 143 Glu substitution. Gly 143 resides in the oxyanion hole-forming domain (HGGG 143) that {{plays an important role in}} CES 1 catalytic activity. Ectopic expression of CES 1 carrying this mutation confirmed significant reduction of its esterase activity in vitro (Zhu et al., 2008). The minor allele frequency of Gly 143 Glu was determined to be 3.7 %, 4.3 %, 2.0 %, and 0 % in Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations, respectively. A deletion in exon 6 at codon 260 results in a frameshift mutation and complete loss of hydrolytic activity. The Asp 260 fs appears to be a very rare mutation (Zhu et al., 2008). A SNP A(− 816)C localized in the promoter region of CES 1 gene increases transcriptional efficiency (Geshi et al., 2005). Patients carrying the A(− 816)C SNP showed enhanced anti-hypertension response to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>imidapril,</b> which is converted to its active metabolite, imidaprilat, by CES 1 (Geshi et al., 2005). CES 1 inactivates the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel through ester hydrolysis. The A(− 816)C variation attenuates responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The A(− 816)C polymorphism was not observed to be significantly associated with stent thrombosis occurrence in this study (Xie et al., 2014).|$|E
40|$|KCNH 2 (hERG) {{potassium}} channels have {{an integral}} role in regulating the excitability of smooth muscle cells. Some pathways driven by angiotensin II, nitric oxide and adrenergic receptors blocker {{are involved in}} modulating the properties of KCNH 2 potassium channels. And these pathways {{are closely related to}} blood pressure regulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that KCNH 2 genetic polymorphisms may affect blood pressure response to the antihypertensive drug therapies. To evaluate the interactions between KCNH 2 genetic polymorphisms and individual blood pressure response to antihypertensive drugs, 370 subjects with essential hypertension (EH) were studied. In evaluating the interactions between KCNH 2 genetic polymorphisms and drug response to blood pressure, multivariable ANOVA analysis followed by Bonferroni correction were carried out. There were statistically significant interactions between KCNH 2 (1956, C>T) polymorphism and DBP change (P =  0. 010), MAP change (P =  0. 014) on azelnidipine or nitrendipine therapy patients at the end of 6 weeks. We found that the KCNH 2 (1956,C>T) polymorphism was associated with the hypotensive effects of α,β-ADR blockers of DBP change at the end of 4 and 6 weeks' treatment in an age- and gender-dependent manner (P =  0. 007 and 0. 019, respectively). Similar results were also observed for changes in MAP at the end of 4 and 6 weeks (P-values were 0. 035 and 0. 078, respectively). While patients who received <b>imidapril,</b> candesartan and irbesartan therapy, no significant difference in drug response among KCNH 2 (1956,C>T) genotype was observed. We have reported {{for the first time that}} KCNH 2 (1956, C>T) polymorphism is associated with efficacy of antihypertensive drugs CCBs and ADR blockers, and may serve as a novel biomarker for individualized therapy for certain antihypertensive drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{angiotensin}} I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) to induce directly protein degradation in skeletal muscle {{has been studied}} in murine myotubes. Angiotensin I stimulated protein degradation with a parabolic dose–response curve and with a maximal effect between 0. 05 and 0. 1 [*]μM. The effect was attenuated by coincubation with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidaprilat, suggesting that angiotensin I stimulated protein degradation through conversion to Ang II. Angiotensin II also stimulated protein breakdown with a similar dose–response curve, and with a maximal effect between 1 and 2. 5 [*]μM. Total protein degradation, induced by both Ang I and Ang II, was attenuated by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin (5 [*]μM) and MG 132 (10 [*]μM), suggesting that the effect was mediated through upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome proteolytic pathway. Both Ang I and Ang II stimulated an increased proteasome ‘chymotrypsin-like' enzyme activity {{as well as an}} increase in protein expression of 20 S proteasome α-subunits, the 19 S subunits MSS 1 and p 42, at the same concentrations as those inducing protein degradation. The effect of Ang I was attenuated by imidaprilat, confirming that it arose from conversion to Ang II. These results suggest that Ang II stimulates protein degradation in myotubes through induction of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Protein degradation induced by Ang II was inhibited by insulin-like growth factor and by the polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid. These results suggest that Ang II has the potential to cause muscle atrophy through an increase in protein degradation. The highly lipophilic ACE inhibitor <b>imidapril</b> (Vitor™) (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) attenuated the development of weight loss in mice bearing the MAC 16 tumour, suggesting that Ang II {{may play a role in}} the development of cachexia in this model...|$|E
