5|$|Informal essay {{and travel}} writing was another highlight. Xu Xiake (1587–1641), a travel {{literature}} author, published <b>his</b> <b>Travel</b> Diaries in 404,000 written characters, {{with information on}} everything from local geography to mineralogy. The first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in Beijing was in 1582; by 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing. The new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late Ming period, for the readership of the merchant class.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, Ueshiba trained a {{large number}} of students, many of whom later became famous {{teachers}} in their own right and developed their own styles of aikido.

50|$|Uten Enten (雨天炎天) is a road {{essay by}} Japanese author Haruki Murakami, about <b>his</b> <b>travels</b> in Greece and Turkey.

A popular edition collecting both volumes was published in 1991. In 2008 a renewal edition was published with some new photographs.|$|R
5|$|Willis {{embedded}} his {{own personality}} into his writing and addressed his readers personally, specifically in <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> writings, {{so that his}} reputation was built {{in part because of}} his character. Critics, including his sister in her novel Ruth Hall, occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mission}} was stalled once they lost a ship in the Strait of Malacca, they {{nonetheless}} landed at the Pearl River estuary on August 15 with eight ships and negotiated with Chinese officials for possible silk and porcelain trade at Canton. The Chinese naval commander of Nantou (under the jurisdiction of Zhongshan, located {{at the mouth of}} the Pearl River) stalled Andrade's small fleet of ships for an entire month while Andrade waited for permission to sail upriver to Canton. After Andrade threatened to sail upriver without permission, the naval commander finally decided to let him pass, granting him pilots to assist <b>his</b> <b>travel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his travels in China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E
50|$|Jain Charin is more {{commonly}} known as Jain Farstrider for <b>his</b> <b>travels</b> to many places. He is a fictional equivalent to Marco Polo, and the book about <b>his</b> <b>travels</b> is very popular.

5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, {{he married}} Amalia Marín in a {{ceremony}} {{that took place in}} Ponce Cathedral. Later that year, he traveled to Spain to learn about its political system. There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, president of the Fusion Party, was the better option to help in this task. While in Spain, Muñoz Rivera received notice that his father had died, which heavily affected him. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he published an article about his father in La Democracia. He subsequently noticed that <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party, which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera, with the two factions becoming known as Muñocistas and Barbosistas.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 he {{was first}} {{appointed}} consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State. Muller held this position all through the Second Boer War and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902 Muller retired {{to a life of}} travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to Czechoslovakia, where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.|$|E

5|$|Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help {{further the}} spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of Emperor Tenji (r. 661–672), whereupon they {{presented}} a gift of a south-pointing chariot that they had crafted. This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-compass vehicle (employing a differential gear) was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki of 720. Japanese monks also visited China; {{such was the case}} with Ennin (794–864), who wrote of <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> experiences including travels along China's Grand Canal. The Japanese monk Enchin (814–891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near Fuzhou, Fujian and setting sail for Japan from Taizhou, Zhejiang during his second trip to China.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese were {{intrigued}} with European technology, but so were visiting Europeans of Chinese technology. In 1584, Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) featured in his atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum the peculiar Chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages, just like Chinese ships. Gonzales de Mendoza also mentioned this {{a year later}} – noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes – while Gerardus Mercator (1512–94) featured them in his atlas, John Milton (1608–74) {{in one of his}} famous poems, and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest (1739–801) in the writings of <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> diary in China.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E

5|$|Headley's {{success for}} Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and {{commentators}} began {{to discuss his}} availability for the 1954 series against England. A public subscription to finance <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> to Jamaica, opened by the Daily Gleaner, raised over £1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley's arm. The latter injury {{kept him out of}} the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of Len Hutton, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting {{at the beginning of the}} next over, so that England could try to get him out before he settled down.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Xu Xiake, who focused on technical aspects in <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> literature, the Chinese poet and official Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610) used travel literature {{to express his}} desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with Confucian court politics. Yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholar-official. This anti-official sentiment in Yuan's travel literature and poetry was actually following {{in the tradition of}} the Song dynasty poet and official Su Shi (1037–1101). Yuan Hongdao and his two brothers, Yuan Zongdao (1560–1600) and Yuan Zhongdao (1570–1623), were the founders of the Gong'an School of letters. This highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the Confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism, which was also apparent in Ming vernacular novels such as the Jin Ping Mei. Yet even gentry and scholar-officials were affected by the new popular romantic literature, seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that he knew where Bickley lived and, intending to ride in that direction, asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> through Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Relying {{on money}} donated by neighbors, Du Bois {{attended}} Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. <b>His</b> <b>travel</b> to and residency in the South was Du Bois's {{first experience with}} Southern racism, {{which at the time}} encompassed Jim Crow laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and lynchings; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Fisk, he attended Harvard College (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by his professor William James, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, cum laude, in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century.

Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during <b>his</b> <b>travel</b> to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
