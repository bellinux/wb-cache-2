25|$|While {{investigators}} {{focused on}} the <b>foam</b> <b>material</b> that had been installed behind the stage, claiming the foam was intended for use in packaging and product display, testimony {{available to the public}} contradicts this. Testimony by Barry Warner, the salesman from American Foam who sold the foam to the Derderians, confirmed that there was a sales order for high-density acoustic soundproofing foam. Chemical analysis of the actual foam that was in the nightclub on the evening of the fire was never released to the public. A roll of foam confiscated from the basement of the nightclub after the fire was removed by the ATF but the testing done on that specific foam was never released to the public. Witnesses to the fire reported that once ignited, flames spread across the foam at approximately one foot per second.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) {{is a kind}} of {{biodegradable}} materials. In {{this paper}} PBS <b>foaming</b> <b>materials</b> is prepared by physical foaming method of one-step compression molding. The influences of blowing agent and nucleating agent, the foaming temperature and foaming time on the cellular morphology of PBS <b>foaming</b> <b>materials</b> have been studied. The results showed that when the foaming temperature was 160 ˚C, the blowing agent content was 5 parts, the foaming pressure was higher than 10 MPa, and the foaming time was 20 minutes with nucleating agent addition, the cellular morphology and mechanical properties of the <b>foaming</b> <b>materials</b> were better. The results showed that the foaming technology influenced greatly on the properties of <b>foam</b> of PBS <b>materials.</b> The expansion ratio had a small drop when the temperature increased. The addition of nucleator talc and foaming aids urea increased first then decreased the expansion ratio of the PBS <b>foaming</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
