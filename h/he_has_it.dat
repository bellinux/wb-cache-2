5|$|On {{his way to}} a meeting, Webber {{goes through}} a red light, and collides with another vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned. Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged. Ferguson finally agrees to the surgery, after constant pleads from Lexie, and makes a start to physical therapy. Lexie returns home to see her sister Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her new husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) having sex in the kitchen. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is at home, begging her husband Karev to spend time with her, but he dismisses her. At Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s apartment, his girlfriend Lexie has moved in, and his bisexual ex-girlfriend Torres walks in on Sloan in the shower. Lexie expresses her concern to Torres about doing this, and she apologizes. Robbins confronts Shepherd, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, and asks him to run an expensive test to see if Andy has Tethered spinal cord syndrome, which reveals that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it,</b> and it is reversed through surgery. Stevens notices the girl Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio), sitting outside the hospital, and tells her to go get a life, because O'Malley did not save her so she could be miserable. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens unites with Karev, and Webber announces that Seattle Grace will be merging with Mercy West.|$|E
500|$|Selänne's primary {{attribute}} is his skating speed. Nicknamed the [...] "Finnish Flash", {{he uses his}} speed to evade opposition defenders. [...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's just a very elegant player. He's got a very nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> <b>it</b> just makes for a heck of a great player." ...|$|E
500|$|The third act {{continues}} in Gloria's bedroom suite. In the play's most controversial scene, {{a group of}} actresses enter the room while Wally hides in another room of the suite. They decide to play [...] "Stripping Cupid", a card-based strip game, and remove pieces of clothing onstage. One of them, Dot Madison, is down to her last two items of clothing when Wally returns to the room. The actresses leave, and Wally says {{he is going to}} get his bag so <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> the next morning. While he is out of the room, Zeffie enters. Gloria asks Zeffie to hide in the bed, so when Wally returns she will see his advances firsthand. In a final plot twist, when Wally returns he has a telegram from his lawyer revealing that the Reno divorce is not valid. Gloria and Wally reconcile, and Zeffie gives her approval to the relationship between Betty and Chicky.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Was you {{in lower}} seven?--so you was!' says George. Well, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> all right--you bet <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it.</b> Now wasn't that queer? The very day you and I began {{to know each}} other!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so. If <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> <b>it's</b> {{more than}} likely that <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> legged <b>it</b> to get away. He--hullo, he's going into that alleyway!" ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> known <b>it.</b> When the {{soldiers}} jostled him so evilly they robbed him. And <b>he</b> knew <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> known <b>it</b> {{as if it}} were fate. Even {{as if it were}} fated beforehand.|$|R
500|$|Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{appears on}} Larry King Live. During his {{appearance}} on the program, a breaking story interrupts his interview with show host Larry King—it is being reported that the Asian stocks are falling. Larry King asks Tracy's opinion on this story, which results in Tracy giving chaos-inducting views, including, [...] "New York {{as we know it}} will no longer exist tomorrow" [...] and he calls for panic, sending the people of New York into madness. At the NBC studios, the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), try looking for money that Tracy has hidden in the building after revealing this on Larry King Live. Pete calls the program asking Tracy where he stores the money. Tracy reveals that the safest place <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> hidden has [...] "a hard top and soft bottom, no matter where it moves, the cash stays in the same place." [...] This clue is of no help to Pete, Frank, Toofer, and Lutz.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Twain {{introduced}} a fictional elaboration {{of the mill}} in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. When Hank Morgan, the American time traveler, introduces decimal currency to Arthurian Britain, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> denominated in cents, mills, and [...] "milrays", or tenths of a mill (the name perhaps suggested by [...] "myriad", meaning ten thousand or by the Portuguese and Brazilian milreis).|$|E
2500|$|Campbell had methods {{all of his}} own, {{rough and}} ready by precise {{standards}} but very effective for all that. ... He has so far avoided text-book dogmas, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> in {{him to become a}} fine slogger. His eye seemingly allows him to hook without moving the right foot across the wicket, to cut the ball very near the off stump, to drive cross-batted and to hit across the line of the ball. A good eye, confidence and exceptional power of strike are natural assets which add up to a large sum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{television}} series is inconsistent {{on the question}} of whether Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations. For example, in The Deadly Assassin an old classmate of the Doctor's, Runcible, is slow to recognise the Doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> <b>it</b> then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed. However, in The Armageddon Factor (1978), Drax, another old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the Academy (the Doctor takes a while to remember Drax, though).|$|E
2500|$|Acting through {{administrative}} method (Fa), {{the ruler}} conceals his intentions, likes and dislikes, skills and opinions. Not acting himself, he can avoid being manipulated. The ruler plays no {{active role in}} governmental functions. He should not use his talent even if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it.</b> Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries. Creel argues that not getting involved in details allowed Shen's ruler to [...] "truly rule", because it leaves him free to supervise the government without interfering, maintaining his perspective. Seeing and hearing independently, the ruler is able to make decisions independently, and is, Shen says, able to rule the world thereby.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hanina deduced from [...] that {{everything}} is in the hand of Heaven except the fear of Heaven, for [...] says: [...] "What does the Lord your God ask of you, but only to fear the Lord your God." [...] The Gemara asked whether the fear of Heaven was such a little thing that [...] says [...] "only." [...] Rabbi Hanina said in the name Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that God has in God's treasury nothing but a store {{of the fear of}} Heaven, as [...] says: [...] "The fear of the Lord is His treasure," [...] and thus the fear of Heaven must be a great thing. The Gemara responded that for Moses, the fear of Heaven was a small thing, for he had it. Rabbi Hanina illustrated with a parable: If a man is asked for a big article and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it,</b> it seems like a small article to him; if he is asked for a small article and he does not have it, it seems like a big article to him.|$|E

2500|$|Bayern did not {{contest the}} Belmont Stakes and was instead {{aimed at the}} seven-furlong Woody Stephens Stakes at the same meeting. He contested the early lead before taking a clear {{advantage}} entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by {{seven and a half}} lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance. He had a bad experience in the gate in the Preakness. Jimmy Barnes [...] and Bob's crew did a great job getting him ready by schooling, schooling, schooling him." [...] Bayern was moved back up in class and distance for the Grade I Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park on July 27. Ridden for the first time by Martin Garcia, he was the second choice in the betting behind the filly Untapable. Garcia took the lead from the start and set a steady pace before drawing away in the straight to win by more than seven lengths from Albano, with Untapable in fifth place. Baffert, who won the race for a record seventh time, watched the running on television. After the race, the trainer, who said that he had considered keeping the horse to sprint distances, stated, [...] "We tried to slow him down in the past, but now we know we just have to utilize his speed. I didn't think he'd do it as devastating as that. It looks like <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> all together now." ...|$|E

60|$|Philip {{put his arm}} {{round her}} waist and kissed her lips. She only laughed a little and {{made no attempt to}} withdraw. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> come quite naturally. Philip was very proud of himself.

60|$|Quite well, I believe. I think he's {{very well}} suited to the post <b>he</b> <b>has.</b> <b>It</b> would be a pity to disturb him when he's just got {{at home with the}} work.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is penniless, hungry, and destitute. He is {{completely}} beaten down, {{and has no}} resource at all. Look after him! Lose no time! I know <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> in his mind to kill himself." ...|$|E
