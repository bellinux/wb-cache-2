The {{aim of this study}} was to report our experience on the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in postoperative critical bleeding after OLT. In 7 patients with persistent severe bleeding after application of a standard transfusion protocol, we administered a 90 microg/kg bolus of rFVIIa and if necessary eventually repeated it after 3 hours. We recorded the blood loss and the need for transfusions before and after the rFVIIa therapy. Blood losses and need for platelets significantly decreased after rFVIIa administration; a nonsignificant decrease in red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions also occurred. In 6 patients treatment with rFVIIa was effective; only 1 patient died because of hemorrhagic shock and no thromboses were detected among the treated patients. Awaiting stronger evidence from randomized controlled trials, we suggest that in some challenging cases of massive bleeding rFVIIa should be considered a useful option to control bleeding...|$|E

Third- and fourth-year dental students were observed during patient-care appointments and behaviors were recorded and analyzed. Behaviors observed before the EVD outbreak and subsequent mandatory in-service training were compared with behaviors observed after completion of the training. ResultsUse of personal protective equipment was nearly universal. Overall compliance with infection control parameters was 88 %. However, only a minority of students demonstrated no breaches of protocol. Most violations involved improper mask use and improper glove use during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> of an appointment and failure to wash hands after removing gloves.

30|$|To manage {{hemorrhage}} tendency {{during the}} perioperative period, anesthesiologists must determine an appropriate method and tailor it to each patient. We used 4  units of FFP {{prior to the}} surgical procedure. The estimated half-life of factor XI is 45  h, {{which is similar to}} standard FFP [9]; therefore, we judged FFP transfusion 1  day prior to surgery which would prevent <b>intraoperative</b> and acute <b>phase</b> massive hemorrhage. As shown in Fig.  1, APTT levels improved from 89.7 to 36.2  s after FFP transfusion. We investigated the transition level of APTT after surgery. The level of APTT was gradually prolonged to 52.6  s by postoperative day 7. After the surgery, the color of the exudate fluid from surgical drain had changed to slightly reddish, which may have been related to the change of APTT. Considering the estimated half-life of factor XI, we anticipated that APTT would rise to the same level as the preoperative value. Fortunately, APTT remained shorter than expected, and we did not need to use additional FFP.|$|R
40|$|Primary graft failure (PGF) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{complications}} that occurs immediately following lung transplantation and greatly contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of PGF is correlated with a marked decline in endogenous nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. Therefore, the administration of NO during lung transplantation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic treatment to prevent or attenuate PGF pathogenesis. Despite the initial positive results of experimental and uncontrolled clinical trials, recent randomized clinical trials do not support the prophylactic administration of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) for the prevention of PGF following lung transplantation under the conditions tested. Nonetheless, there is evidence that iNO administration during PGF can improve oxygenation and reduce pulmonary hypertension without altering systemic vascular resistance. This suggests that iNO may prevent the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the hypoxic phase of PGF. During the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> of transplantation, one-lung ventilation (OLV) and pulmonary artery clamping usually increase PVR, causing decreased right ventricular function and hemodynamic instability. The administration of iNO during these lung transplant procedures could decrease right ventricular dysfunction by reducing PVR and help to avoid the use of cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} how TEE in the setting of OLTX is a highly valuable (but maybe underutilized) tool, as it is important not only for cardiovascular monitoring, but also for evaluating hepatic vein blood flow and inferior vena cava anastomosis and patency. We describe, for the first time, the use of intraoperative TEE for evaluating the patency of a rescue cavo-cavostomy anastomosis in the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase.</b> TAS, on the other hand, is impossible to perform during surgery [16 – 18]. In fact, one of the major advantages of using a TEE probe is its anatomical proximity to the liver, allowing the liver to be studied from the inside without interfering with the surgery. Furthermore, TEE is more sensitive in detecting low blood flow velocity or small changes of blood flow in the hepatic veins [18]. Moreover, the literature reports a case in which intraoperative TEE evaluation of a vena cava tumor resection using the piggy-back technique led to a change in the surgical plain [24]. Thus, our report is not the first to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining good liver anatomy visualization and acceptable quality images of the IVC through the use of TEE [25].|$|E
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I focused on {{perioperative}} nursing care {{for women with}} a caesarean section in regional and general anesthesia. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and research part. In the theoretical part of my thesis history, conditions, indications and contraindications, and also complications during a caesarean section performance are described. Information about anesthesia which is used for a caesarean section is also given. Conditions for general, epidural and spinal anesthesia administration are described. Advantages, disadvantages, indications, contraindications and complications {{of different types of}} anesthesia are also mentioned. A substantial part of the theoretical part is devoted to perioperative nursing care. The preoperative nursing care is described, the preparation for it is divided according to the type of anesthesia. Nursing care during the intraoperative and mainly postoperative phases is mentioned in detail. The aim of my thesis was to identify differences in perioperative nursing care for women with a cesarean section in regional and general anesthesia. My work was also focused on women's level of awareness about possibilities of anesthesia for caesarean section. Another goal of my work was to make up standards of perioperative nursing care for women during a caesarean section delivery in regional and general anesthesia, which is administered in the delivery room. Two hypotheses were stated. The first hypothesis is the supposition that women after a caesarean section need a different nursing care, which depends on the type of anesthesia administered. The second hypothesis is the supposition that women are adequately informed about the possibilities of anesthesia for a caesarean section. Quantitative research conducted through questionnaires was chosen to conduct the survey. Questionnaires were distributed to women after a caesarean section at the confinement department. Research results are shown in graphs. The both hypotheses were confirmed by the research investigation. The research has revealed a new finding that women need different nursing care not only after a caesarean section, but also during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase.</b> I used this finding to develop a standard of perioperative nursing care for women during a caesarean section delivery in regional and general anesthesia. The standard is designed for midwives and is intended to improve nursing care for women {{in the course of a}} caesarean section delivery during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase.</b> The research has proved that women with a cesarean section need a different perioperative nursing care, which depends on the type of anesthesia administered. It is therefore necessary to differentiate between the two groups and provide them with a different nursing care. The research has also shown that women feel sufficiently informed about anesthesia for a caesarean section. Women´s awareness is a prerequisite for a good cooperation with the patient and successful nursing and medical care. The nursing care provision according to the perioperative care standard will ensure a quality professional nursing care for women before, during and after a caesarean section...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular {{surgical}} {{care has}} changed dramatically in recent years with little knowledge {{of the impact of}} system failures on patient safety. The primary aim of this multicentre observational study was to define the landscape of surgical system failures, errors and inefficiency (collectively termed failures) in aortic surgery. Secondary aims were to investigate determinants of these failures and their relationship with patient outcomes. METHODS: Twenty vascular teams at ten English hospitals trained in structured self-reporting of <b>intraoperative</b> failures (<b>phase</b> I). Failures occurring in open and endovascular aortic procedures were reported in phase II. Failure details (category, delay, consequence), demographic information (patient, procedure, team experience) and outcomes were reported. RESULTS: There were strong correlations between the trainer and teams for the number and type of failures recorded during 88 procedures in phase I. In 185 aortic procedures, teams reported a median of 3 (i. q. r. 2 - 6) failures per procedure. Most frequent failures related to equipment (unavailability, failure, configuration, desterilization). Most major failures related to communication. Fourteen failures directly harmed 12 patients. Significant predictors of an increased failure rate were: endovascular compared with open repair (incidence rate ratio (IRR) for open repair 0 · 71, 95 per cent c. i. 0 · 57 to 0 · 88; P[*]=[*] 0 · 002), thoracic aneurysms compared with other aortic pathologies (IRR 2 · 07, 1 · 39 to 3 · 08; P[*]<[*] 0 · 001) and unfamiliarity with equipment (IRR 1 · 52, 1 · 20 to 1 · 91; P[*]<[*] 0 · 001). The major failure total was associated with reoperation (P[*]=[*] 0 · 011), major complications (P[*]=[*] 0 · 029) and death (P[*]=[*] 0 · 027). CONCLUSION: Failure in aortic procedures is frequently caused by issues with team-working and equipment, and is associated with patient harm.

40|$|Introduction: The cooling of {{the human}} body as a {{protective}} measure for the brain and other organs has become increasingly established in medicine, especially in the field of cardiac surgery. While corresponding procedures and surgical techniques have become methodologically sound, there is one factor that is still uncertain and speculative: the acquisition of the actual temperature {{of the human}} body. In particular, when the physiological heat distribution is disturbed by open body cavities and external temperature regulation. In this situation there is still no clear concept about the temperature behavior of the brain, the ideal measurement point or process of measurement. In the present study we compared temperature gradients and temperature behavior of four different measurement sites during cardiac surgery, especially during surgery under deep hypothermia with the aim of comparing different sensor locations. Among the sensors used was the so-called Double Sensor which has not yet been used in a comparable setting in cardiosurgery. The question, accordingly, is to determine to which extent the new sensor based on the heat flux principle will be able to detect body temperature in extreme temperature conditions, especially when compared to established sensors or sensor positions. Methods: Between May and August 2009, 24 patients undergoing surgery of the heart and / or great vessels in the German Heart Institute Berlin (Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin) were included in the study. Nine of the operations took place with the patient in deep hypothermia, three in mild hypothermia and 12 unter normothermic conditions. Intraoperative thermomonitoring was provided by three (in deep hypothermia four) different sensoring systems: a vesical probe in the urinary bladder, the Double Sensor at the forehead, the measurement of the arterialized blood temperature within the heart-lung machine (HLM) and, in deep hypothermia patients, an esophageal probe. Readings were recorded in continuous intervals throughout the operation period. Data analysis and statistical processing was carried out by SPSS 18. 0 statistics, and by SPSS version 19. Bland-Altman-Diagrams and scatter plots were developed and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was calculated along with a correlation analysis (r). Results: The intra-operative temperature drop during the phase of deep hypothermia and subsequent re-warming could be reproduced by all methods of measurement. Generally, the measured values of the Double Sensor correlated most strongly with the vesical temperature (r = 0. 95) and with the esophageal temperature (r = 0. 93). Because the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phases</b> differed greatly from each other, they were analyzed separately. During the cooling phase the esophageal sensor and the vesical sensor showed the closest correlation (r = 0. 94). Considerig the arterial temperature of the HLM as the output temperature, the vesical temperatur correlated most closely with it (r = 0. 80), followed by the Double Sensor (r = 0. 79) and the esophageal measurement (r = 0. 76). During rewarming the values of the esophageal probe correlated best with the arterial temperature (r = 0. 94), followed by the Double Sensor (r = 0. 89) and vesical temperature (r = 0. 85). Intra- and interindividually a very heterogeneous picture with clear path dependencies (hysteretic loops) could be demonstrated. Discussion: The measured behavior of the individual sensors shows a significant path dependence in terms of hysteretic loops. Therefore, the direction of the temperature curve (cooling vs. warming) has an obvious influence on the measured behavior of the sensors. As already expected from the review of current studies, {{we were not able to}} identify one method as being "the most valid". Accordingly, any temperature measurement under extreme conditions should consider both the environmental factors (open body cavities, cooling method, etc.) as well as the individual characteristics of the thermometer, sites of temperature measurement and direction of temperature change (cooling/warming). A purely linear correlation analysis must be questioned. As for the Double Sensor, we could show that it records similar dynamics as vesical and esophageal sensors in hypothermic conditions. Further studies will be important for further increasing the understanding of the Double Sensor...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Intraoperative care {{includes}} a unique {{knowledge of how}} to perform a safe and effective surgery procedure. Surgery performed under regional or local anaesthesia allows the patient to remain conscious during the procedure and is rather common in Swedish healthcare today. Aim: The aim was to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} main concerns of operating theatre nurses (OTN) when caring for conscious patients during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase.</b> Methods: Interviews were conducted with 23 OTNs from five different hospitals in Sweden and analysed according to grounded theory. Findings: The main concern among the OTNs was to take the patient in consideration. The core category “achieve and maintain ethical treatment of patients” in the operating theatre (OT) was a strategy used throughout the intraoperative process. Ethical treatment was described as moral behaviour at different levels and included the team’s behaviour, respectful and individualised patientcare, and the working-morale of the professionals. Being vigilant and being flexible were the categories related to the core category. The OTNs constantly assessed where to pay most attention as they balanced between the needs of the patient, the team, and the surgery procedure. Conclusion: It is important that every patient is taken into consideration and that ethical principles are held to the highest standards in the OT. A familiar team can facilitate that. The complex skills that operating theatre nurses develop can be added to explain important competencies within the profession...|$|E

During the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> of surgery, the attending surgeon can be likened to a team leader with responsibility for task accomplishment by a small team. This study identified and evaluated surgeons ’ leadership behaviors during operations, with particular reference to any changes that occurred following two types of events. Method Videos of live operations (n= 29) from the operating rooms of three teaching hospitals in the UK were analyzed to identify and code surgeons ’ intraoperative leadership behaviors using the Surgeons ’ Leadership Inventory (SLI). The frequency {{and quality of the}} leadership behaviors were compared before and after {{the point of no return}} (PONR) (n= 24) and before and after an unexpected intraoperative event (n= 5).

No significant differences were found for the overall frequency or quality of leadership behaviors pre- and post-PONR. The frequency of leadership behaviors classified as ‘training’ and ‘Supporting others ’ significantly decreased after an unanticipated intraoperative event. Discussion This study provides a detailed description of surgeons ’ intraoperative leadership during different types of operative situations and stages. During the intraoperative period, the attending surgeon seemed to lead the surgical trainee almost exclusively, and not other members of the operative team.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} reported that measuring circulating serum mRNAs using quantitative one-step real-time RT-PCR was clinically useful for detecting malignancies and determining prognosis. The aim {{of our study}} was to find crucial serum mRNA biomarkers in esophageal cancer that would provide prognostic information for post-esophagectomy patients in the critical care setting. Methods We measured serum mRNA levels of 11 inflammatory-related genes in 27 post-esophagectomy patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU). We tracked these levels chronologically, perioperatively and postoperatively, until the two-week mark, investigating their clinical and prognostic significance as compared with clinical parameters. Furthermore, we investigated whether gene expression can accurately predict clinical outcome and prognosis. Results Circulating mRNAs in postoperative esophagectomy patients had gene-specific expression profiles that varied with the clinical phase of their treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that upregulation of IL- 6, VWF and TGF-β 1 mRNA in the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> (p = 0. 016, 0. 0021 and 0. 009) and NAMPT and MUC 1 mRNA on postoperative day 3 (p ®, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) significantly correlated with MUC 1 and NAMPT mRNA expression (p = 0. 048 and 0. 045). IL- 6 mRNA correlated with hypercytokinemia and recovery from hypercytokinemia (sensitivity 80. 9 %) and was a significant biomarker in predicting the onset of severe inflammatory diseases. Conclusion Chronological tracking of postoperative mRNA levels of inflammatory-related genes in esophageal cancer patients may facilitate early institution of pharamacologic therapy, prediction of treatment response, and prognostication during ICU management in the perioperative period. </p...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{perioperative}} fluid {{management is}} an important component of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways. Fluid management within ERAS should be viewed as a continuum through the preoperative, <b>intraoperative,</b> and postoperative <b>phases.</b> Each phase is important for improving patient outcomes, and suboptimal care in one phase can undermine best practice within the rest of the ERAS pathway. The goal of preoperative fluid management is for the patient to arrive in the operating room in a hydrated and euvolemic state. To achieve this, prolonged fasting is not recommended, and routine mechanical bowel preparation should be avoided. Patients should be encouraged to ingest a clear carbohydrate drink two to three hours before surgery. The goals of intraoperative fluid management are to maintain central euvolemia and to avoid excess salt and water. To achieve this, patients undergoing surgery within an enhanced recovery protocol should have an individualized fluid management plan. As part of this plan, excess crystalloid should be avoided in all patients. For low-risk patients undergoing low-risk surgery, a "zero-balance" approach might be sufficient. In addition, for most patients undergoing major surgery, individualized goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is recommended. Ultimately, however, the additional benefit of GDFT should be determined based on surgical and patient risk factors. Postoperatively, once fluid intake is established, intravenous fluid administration can be discontinued and restarted only if clinically indicated. In the absence of other concerns, detrimental postoperative fluid overload is not justified and "permissive oliguria" could be tolerated...|$|R
40|$|Expertise {{and genuine}} {{consideration}} for animal welfare {{are essential to}} enable refinement of experimental procedures, aim- ing to prevent or minimize pain and suffering. Our main goal was to define and apply a system to prevent, recognize, and manage suffering during the 3 main phases of transplantation surgery: preoperative, <b>intraoperative,</b> and postoperative <b>phases.</b> In the perioperative period, the improvement of safety and ef- ficacy of anesthesia and analgesia are critical aspects. Aiming to refine the procedure in our primate models, we implement- ed adjustment and refinement in the anesthetic and analgesic protocol. Indeed, a more effective management, a faster recov- ery, and {{a positive impact on}} animal welfare were obtained by modifying dosages of drugs administered, whilst guaranteeing the maintenance of an optimal depth of anesthesia and anal- gesia. Considering the postoperative phase, to recognize and manage pain and/or suffering eventually occurring, an evalu- ation system has been implemented, relying on the following aspects: 1) continuous clinical monitoring, ensuring the best possible approach for the prompt evaluation of the animal con- ditions, thus minimizing the risk of mistake or underestimation of clinical signs, 2) continuous laboratory monitoring, allowing an early recognition of any altered physiologic parameter, and 3) definition of specific assessment criteria, with regard to the termination of experimental procedures and consequent eu- thanasia (humane endpoint). This assessment system, based on a combined analysis of both quantitative (measurable) and qualitative (observable) elements, had useful, satisfactory, and reproducible results.

40|$|The Operating Room (OR) nurse {{many times}} is the unique working in Surgical Theatre. They {{have so many}} duties and {{solicitation}} that they are stressed {{in the end of}} each shift. Since 19901, the Perioperative Nursing System (SAEP) has been developed and encouraged its implementation. OBJECTIVES: identify the activities realized by OR nurses and compared their work in public and private hospitals. METHOD: An invitation was sent to each hospital with more than 50 beds, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A sample of 14 hospitals accepted and 7 were public and 7 private hospitals. The data was collected using a structured questionnaire composed by open questions about: characteristics of hospital; description of surgical theatre; activities of nursing staff. To collect data about OR nurse activities, they are described as: preparation for anesthesia and surgery (14 items); during intraoperative period (24 items); at the end of surgery (14 items); management (9 items) and education, research and social role (8 items). The OR nurses, leader of nursing staff in surgical theatre, were interviewed at hospital, from September 2004 to May 2005. The anonymity and secret were observed. The statistical analysis was descriptive and used non parametric test x 2. The Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient was 0. 86. RESULTS: All phase of surgery that means, immediate preoperative, <b>intraoperative</b> and postoperative <b>phases</b> the presence of OR nurse is detected. The activities involved on preparation of the environment were most frequent. Data showed relations statistically significant, for OR nurses in private hospitals for activities related to preparation of surgery and intraoperative period due anesthesiologists and surgeons (p= 0. 01). The relations statistically significant for OR in public hospitals were: activities related to materials and equipments in preparation for surgery (p = 0. 014) and intraoperative period due to anesthesiologists and surgeons (p= 0. 004). These results showed the difference between private and public hospitals. The activities in order to obtain materials and equipment were presented more in public hospitals, where the lack of maintenance and high technology were observed. CONCLUSIONS: OR nurses work as facilitator of surgical team work included conditions to performance the anesthesia and surgery. This {{is an important part of}} OR nurses’ role but they would like to have the possibility in developing more activities in order to implement SAEP. &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; REFERENCE&# 13; Castellanos BEP, Jouclas VMG.

The Department of Anesthesia cooperating with each Italian licensed OLT center received a question- naire regarding preoperative evaluation, intraoperative anesthesia management, anesthetic drugs, blood components therapy, perioperative monitoring, supportive therapies, postoperative care, staff and organization. Results. Twenty-two centers were surveyed and 17 returned the questionnaire. Center specific protocols for OLT anesthesia exist in 12 centers. Balanced anesthesia (volatile anesthetic agents and continuous infusion of opioids) is the standard anesthetic method. In 14 cases a thromboelastogram is available; one center reported not to have a rapid infusion device available. Pulmonary artery catheterization with a continuous cardiac output device is the most used hemodynamic monitoring system; in case of hemodynamic instability, the combination of dopamine/noradrenaline resulted the first choice before vascular clamping whereas noradrenaline alone after graft’s reperfusion. No difference about which <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> is mostly characterized by the use of blood components was reported. Postopera- tive care is provided on anesthesiological-guided Intensive Care Units (ICU) in all the surveyed centers and in three centers the ICU is dedicated only to transplant patients. Conclusion.

The operating theatre personnel’s views on Patient Safety Culture showed the highest percentage of positive responses was the dimensions “Teamwork Within Hospital Units” and “Organisational Learning- Continous improvement”. The dimensions with the least positive response was “Nonpunitive Response To Error” and “Staffing”. When comparing compliance to basic hygiene and the results of the patient safety culture survey a medium relation was found, where the staff who gave the most positive response to the survey also complied better to the WHO’s hygiene guidelines. Conclusions: Compliance to basic hygiene during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> in the operating theatre in Mozambique, Maputo was often insufficient. There was a medium strong relation between the staffs views on patient safety and their compliance to basic hygiene. This implies that working with the staff’s attitudes concerning patient safety could improve hygiene compliance resulting in reduced number of surgical site infections...|$|E
40|$|Coronary artery {{bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery is {{indicated}} {{for patients with}} coronary artery disease to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and/or prolong life. Unfortunately coronary vascular disease (CVD) associated mortalities {{was one of the}} highest in the world. In Saudi Arabia, CVD was reported to account for over 22 % of deaths each year, and another estimates showed over 42 % of all deaths, attributed to CVD. The patient undergoing CABG surgery deserves to have confidence that the professional nurse is knowledgeable, caring, efficient, and effective in providing necessary perioperative care. Proper preparation of the patient and significant others, expertise during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase,</b> and a thorough knowledge base combined with skill and compassion of the nursing staff during the postoperative phase increase the likelihood of a positive outcome for the patient. A compassionate, knowledgeable, and skilled nurse caring for the patient after open heart surgery is an asset in the achievement of positive outcomes for the patient and his/her significant others. The care of the CABG patient is intense, complex, and rewarding. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit unconscious, intubated, and completely dependent on advanced technology as well as the expert care of the health team. Typically 24 – 48  h after the surgery, the invasive lines have been discontinued, the patient no longer needs to be mechanically ventilated, organ system function is returning to normal, and the patient is now ready to work toward increasing independence. Cardiac surgery is not the cure for coronary artery disease. It gives the patient the opportunity to make needed lifestyle adjustments and achieve the highest degree of health possible.

40|$|Background Women {{undergoing}} Cesarean Section (CS) {{are vulnerable}} to the adverse effects associated with perioperative core temperature drop, {{in part due to}} the tendency for CS to be performed under neuraxial anesthesia, blood and fluid loss, and vasodilation. Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH) is a common condition that affects patients undergoing surgery of all specialties and is detrimental to all age groups, including neonates. Previous systematic reviews on IPH prevention largely focus on either adult or all ages populations, and have mainly overlooked pregnant or CS patients as a distinct group. Not all recommendations made by systematic reviews targeting all adult patients may be transferable to CS patients. Alternative, effective methods for preventing or managing hypothermia in this group would be valuable. Objectives To synthesize the best available evidence in relation to preventing and/or treating hypothermia in mothers after CS surgery. Types of participants Adult patients over the age of 18 years, of any ethnic background, with or without co-morbidities, undergoing any mode of anesthesia for any type of CS (emergency or planned) at healthcare facilities who have received interventions to limit or manage perioperative core heat loss were included. Types of intervention(s) Active or passive warming methods versus usual care or placebo, that aim to limit or manage core heat loss as applied to women undergoing CS were included. Types of studies Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria, with reduction of perioperative hypothermia a primary or secondary outcome were considered. Types of outcomes Primary outcome: maternal core temperature measured during the preoperative, <b>intraoperative</b> and postoperative <b>phases</b> of care Secondary outcomes: newborn core temperature at birth, umbilical pH obtained immediately after birth, Apgar scores, length of Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) stay, maternal thermal comfort. Search strategy A comprehensive search was undertaken of the following databases from their inception until May 2012 : ProQuest, Web of Science, Scopus, Dissertation and Theses PQDT (via ProQuest), Current Contents, CENTRAL, Mednar, OpenGrey, Clinical Trials. There were no language restrictions. Methodological quality Retrieved papers were assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers prior to inclusion using JBI software. Disagreements were resolved via consultation with the third reviewer. An assessment of quality of the included papers was also made in relation to five key quality factors. Data collection Two independent reviewers extracted data from the included papers using a previously piloted customized data extraction tool. Results 12 studies with a combined total of 719 participants were included. Three broad intervention groups were identified; intravenous (IV) fluid warming, warming devices, leg wrapping. IV fluid warming, whether administered intraoperatively or preoperatively, was found to be effective at maintaining maternal (but not neonatal) temperature and preventing shivering, but does not improve thermal comfort. The effectiveness of IV fluid warming on Apgar scores and umbilical pH remains unclear. Warming devices, including forced air warming and under body carbon polymer mattresses, were effective at preventing hypothermia and reduced shivering, however were most effective if applied preoperatively. The effectiveness of warming devices to improve thermal comfort remains unclear. Preoperative forced air warming appears to aid maintenance of neonatal temperature, while intraoperative forced air warming does not. Forced air warming was not effective at improving Apgar scores and the effects for umbilical pH remain unclear. Conclusions Intravenous fluid warming, by any method, improves maternal temperature and reduces shivering for women undergoing CS. Preoperative body warming devices also improve maternal temperature, in addition to reducing shivering...|$|R
40|$|Inadvertent {{hypothermia}} {{is common}} in patient's undergoing surgical procedures. Hypothermia within the perioperative environment may have many undesired physiological effects {{that are associated with}} significant postoperative morbidity. Patient's temperature drops to below 35 °C during the first hour of anaesthesia because of impaired thermoregulatory mechanism and patient getting cold in the operating theatre. For this reason, health care professionals working in the perioperative environment need to know what are the most effective strategies for treating or preventing hypothermia to improving patient outcomes following surgical procedures. However, to date there has been no systematic review of effectiveness with high quality randomised controlled trials to identify effective strategies for the prevention and/or management of hypothermia in the perioperative environment. The objective of this systematic review was to identify the most effective strategies for the prevention and/or management of hypothermia in the <b>intraoperative</b> and postoperative <b>phases</b> of surgical care. A comprehensive search was undertaken on electronic databases from their inception to October 2008, including Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Current contents connect, DARE, Dissertations Abstract International, EMBASE, Scopus, and TRIP. The search was restricted to English language. Randomised controlled trials or clinical controlled trials were sought, which evaluated the effectiveness of active or passive warming techniques in the prevention and/or treatment of inadvertent hypothermia. Critical appraisal of study quality was undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal instruments. Data extraction was via the Joanna Briggs Institute standard data extraction form for evidence of effectiveness. Eighteen studies with a combined 1451 patients were included. The results were classified into three categories with a further sub classification within the active warming techniques category. Forced air warming was effective in maintaining intraoperative normothermia when compared to passive warming, routine thermal care and no form of warming. Forced air warming in pregnant women scheduled for caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia prevented maternal and foetal hypothermia. In contrast, passive warming with tight elastic bandages wrapped around the legs (passive insulation) in the same patient population had no significant benefits in preventing maternal hypothermia. However, in arthroscopic knee surgery patients, forced air warming did not result in a decrease in the incidence of postoperative shivering indicating that it was not effective or feasible to extend active warming into recovery in this patient population. Forced air warming was effective than circulating water mattress in preventing hypothermia in patients who underwent repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Forced air warming was effective against radiant warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in lengthier surgical procedures. Prewarming in different patient populations prevents redistribution hypothermia, especially after one hour of anaesthesia induction. Intravenous and irrigating fluids warmed (38 - 40 °C) to a temperature higher than that of room temperature by different fluid warming devices (both dry and water heated) proved significantly beneficial to patients in terms of stable haemodynamic variables, and higher core temperature (core T) {{at the end of the}} surgery (transurethral prostatectomy and orthopaedic surgery). However, prewarming irrigation fluids in knee arthroscopy patients did not prove beneficial in maintaining normothermia. Water garment warmer was significantly (P < 0. 05) effective than forced air warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in orthotopic liver transplantation patients. Extra warming with forced air compared to routine thermal care was effective in reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections and postoperative cardiac complications, as well as shorten the length of hospital stay. Passive warming with reflective heating blankets or elastic bandages wrapped around the legs tightly were found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence or magnitude of hypothermia. Low-flow anaesthesia with active forced air warming was effective in stabilising patient's core T during surgical procedures when compared to low-flow anaesthesia alone or low-flow anaesthesia with passive insulation. Phenylephrine i. v. infusion resulted in a significantly less reduction in core T after first hour of anaesthesia and patients were warmer until the end of the surgery (minor oral surgery). Active warming with forced air warming units keeps all patients warmer in the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Forced air warming compared with alternate forms of warming reduces the incidence of shivering and wound infections, increases thermal comfort and reduces morbid cardiac events. Our review indicates that active warming techniques (forced-air warming) are effective in preventing and managing hypothermia in the perioperative environment and based on the results from the review there are several recommendations to guide clinical practice: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research should focus on large, high quality randomised controlled trials looking at long-term clinical outcomes, operating temperature forced-air warming devices (not just maximum set temperature), different body sites and percentage of body coverage area of active warming for efficient management of intraoperative hypothermia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Communication is {{important}} for patient safety {{in the operating room}} (OR). Several studies have assessed OR communications qualitatively or have focused on communication in crisis situations. This study used prospective, quantitative observation based on well-established communication theory to assess similarities and differences in communication patterns between open and laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: Based on communication theory, a standardized proforma was developed for assessment in the OR via real-time observation of communication types, their purpose, their content, and their initiators/recipients. Data were collected prospectively in real time in the OR for 20 open and 20 laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs. Assessors were trained and calibrated, and their reliability was established statistically. RESULTS: During 1, 884 min of operative time, 4, 227 communications were observed and analyzed (2, 043 laparoscopic vs 2, 184 open communications). The mean operative duration (laparoscopic, 48 min vs open, 47 min), mean communication frequency (laparoscopic, 102 communications/procedure vs open, 109 communications/procedure), and mean communication rate (laparoscopic, 2. 13 communications/min vs open, 2. 23 communications/min) did not differ significantly across laparoscopic and open procedures. Communications were most likely to be initiated by surgeons (80 - 81 %), to be received by either other surgeons (46 - 50 %) or OR nurses (38 - 40 %), to be associated with equipment/procedural issues (39 - 47 %), and to provide direction for the OR team (38 - 46 %) in open and laparoscopic cases. Moreover, communications in laparoscopic cases were significantly more equipment related (laparoscopic, 47 % vs open, 39 %) and aimed significantly more at providing direction (laparoscopic, 46 % vs open, 38 %) and at consulting (laparoscopic, 17 % vs open, 12 %) than at sharing information (laparoscopic, 17 % vs open, 31 %) (P < 0. 001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous intraoperative communications were found in both laparoscopic and open cases during a relatively low-risk procedure (average, 2 communications/min). In the observed cases, surgeons actively directed and led OR teams in the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase.</b> The lack of communication between surgeons and anesthesiologists ought to be evaluated further. Simple, inexpensive interventions shown to streamline intraoperative communication and teamworking (preoperative briefing, surgeons' mental practice) should be considered further...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthetic induced {{inhibition}} of normal thermoregulation combined with cool operating room environment, results in peri- and postanaesthetic hypothermia in most surgical patients. Aim {{of this study}} was to determine whether a fluid warmer as a single active perianaesthetic warming method was capable to prevent or reduce perioperative hypothermia in dogs undergoing superficial, mainly orthopedic surgery. In this study sixty-seven dogs of different breeds undergoing seventy elective surgical procedures of longer than 60 Minutes were divided to two groups. One group received warmed intravenous crystalloid fluids (42 °C) via coaxial fluid warmer (Autotherm ®) in flow rate of 10 ml/kg/h, the other was observed as a control (room temperature crystalloid fluids). After a routine sedation with midazolam and l-methadone, induction with propofol for tracheal intubation was performed. All patients received general anaesthesia with isoflurane/oxygen. In both groups standard surgical draping was used and dogs were placed on an isolated operating table. Results of the deep rectal- and oesophageal temperatures were considered as body core temperature. The body temperature was measured during preoperative examination, at the induction, in five minute intervals during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> and during postanaesthetic recovery 5, 10, 30, 60 and 180 minutes after tracheal extubation. Posture, postoperative behaviour and incidence of postanaesthetic shivering were also evaluated. After a short moderate temperature elevation (0, 2 ± 0, 3 °C), probably due to mental excitement, during the anaesthesia induction, perianaesthetic body core temperature fell in both groups. The fall in core temperature was greatest during the first hour of anaesthesia. This likely reflected the redistribution of heat following the vasodilatation after anaesthesia induction. The classic pattern of perianaesthetic core temperature fall was observed in several cases in both groups. Dogs that received warmed intravenous fluids had a significantly higher body core temperature after 40 min until 130 min of anaesthesia. The present study demonstrated that warming intravenous fluids resulted at least 0, 4 °C (0, 4 - 1 °C) greater core temperature and a significantly lower grade of secondary hypothermia. The patients of the warm fluid group could be extubated significantly earlier than the control animals. Shivering was consistent in both groups, however it was observed more often in animals of the control group. We conclude that fluid warming combined with standard passive heat conservation methods, was effective in minimizing perianaesthetic hypothermia during superficial and orthopedic surgery in dogs, however it was not effective enough as a single method to maintain the perioperative normothermia...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE This study {{evaluated}} whether intraoperative imaging with computer-assisted virtual reconstruction {{would be}} advantageous in reconstructions of {{orbital floor fracture}}s. The surgeon's intention to revise a reconstructed primary orbital floor fracture by evaluating a postoperative mirrored computed tomographic (CT) scan was analyzed intraoperatively before wound closure, during inpatient hospitalization, and after hospitalization. The inter-rater agreement and the match of intention to revise and actual revision were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-one anonymized postoperative CT scans of patients with a unilateral orbital floor fracture were mirrored using software. These computer-assisted virtual reconstructions were consecutively examined by 4 examiners. Seven of these patients underwent a revision. In the first part, the inter-rater agreements for all 3 times were analyzed. In the second part, the examiners' intentions to revise were compared with the actual performed revisions. RESULTS The overall inter-rater agreements were 0. 69 for the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase,</b> 0. 55 for the in-hospital phase, and 0. 39 for the post-hospital phase. The intraoperative inter-rater agreement for each examiner was 0. 58 to 0. 80. The Fleiss κ value for the in-hospital and post-hospital phases was lower. The comparison of the examiners' intention to revise and the actual revisions showed that 15 to 24 additional would have been revised. In contrast, 6 of 7 actual revisions would have been revised intraoperatively. The missed actual revision was the same case by all 4 examiners. The accordance of intention to revise with the actual revisions decreased during hospitalization and even more after hospitalization. This study showed strong agreement among examiners for revising anatomically incorrectly reduced orbital floor fractures intraoperatively by evaluating postoperative mirrored CT scans. During the in-hospital and post-hospital phases, the restraints against revision seemed to increase, thus leading to poorer inter-rater agreement. This analysis of postoperative CT scans with computer-assisted virtual reconstructions of the orbit would have led to considerably more revisions intraoperatively, but all actual revisions were detected except for 1 case. This case was {{the same for all}} 4 examiners. Operation time would have been prolonged in the additional revised cases, but a better anatomic reconstruction would have been achieved. Furthermore, the intraoperative result of the reconstruction would have been controlled instantly and corrected immediately, if needed. CONCLUSION This study showed that of 6 of 7 actual revisions, implant placement would have been revised intraoperatively by all 4 examiners, if intraoperative imaging with computer-assisted virtual reconstruction of the orbit would have been applied. Therefore, the authors suggest that intraoperative imaging with computer-assisted virtual reconstruction could be advantageous in the prevention of later revisions of orbital floor fractures. In this study, the threshold to revise implant placement intraoperatively seemed to be lower when using intraoperative imaging with virtual reconstructions, because considerably more cases would have been revised intraoperatively by the examiners. In the in-hospital and post-hospital phases, this threshold increased, suggesting the more important role of clinical findings. It is uncertain whether the actual surgeons would have revised the same cases as the examiners if they had used intraoperative imaging with virtual reconstructions for their deliberation. However, the intraoperative inter-rater agreement was good and cost-intensive postoperative revisions might be prevented...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation (MD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Acute {{renal failure}} still is, with the {{exception}} of cardiac deaths, the most important pathological process associated with perioperative mortality in patients operated for abdominal aortic aneurysms. The intraoperative change in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular function have been investigated in human and animal models, particularly over the past 15 years. Despite large variation in study populations, measurement techniques and study designs in general, a significant body of evidence has developed which suggests infrarenal aortic clamp-induced renal ischemia to be the cause of postoperative acute renal failure when this complication does occur. It is rather surprizing then that, despite some recent studies which have reported on various pharmacological interventions to prevent intraoperative renal ischemia (with variable success), very little has apparently been done to unravel the pathogenesis and exact pathophysiology of this potentially lethal complication. Although a number of investigators suggest the possibility of hormonal involvement (particularly reninangiotensin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and catecholamines) in the process, the exact role of these mediators have not been explored (or reported) in a structured fashion. In an initial human study, renal hemodynamics and function were measured from the preoperative period, during the <b>intraoperative</b> <b>phase</b> and at least until 4 hours after aortic unclamping. To investigate the possibility of a temporal relationship between renal changes and fluctuations in hormonal concentrations, plasma concentrations of relevant hormones were determined at every sampling period where renal parameters were measured. The decrease in RBF and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which we demonstrated to coincide with infrarenal aortic cross clamping, is consistent with results previously published. We demonstrated persistence of the impairment of these parameters as long as 4 hours into the postoperative phase; which has previously only been reported for the period until immediately after aortic unclamping with the abdomen still open. The persistence of a depressed GFR until the time of discharge of patients is cause for concern, particularly in patients with compromised renal function prior to surgery. Of the measured hormones with a potential influence on RBF and nephron function, renin was the only mediator where changes in plasma concentrations coincided with the depression of RBF and GFR after aortic cross clamping. The design of our study did not allow us to conclude whether the concomitant increase in angiotensin II was primarily responsible for the change in renal hemodynamics, or whether the raised renin (and angiotensin) levels were stimulated by the decrease in RBF induced by another mechanism. In another patient group, we demonstrated that the combination of mannitol and dopamine provided no protection against the deleterious effects of aortic cross clamping. In fact, the high urine volumes produced under the influence of these agents (which did not correlate with RBF at the corresponding periods), is likely to prompt a false sense of security. Given the lack of any objective benefit afforded by these agents, their use in these clinical circumstances should be discouraged. The animal studies were aimed at elucidation of the exact role of angiotensin in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the renal changes associated with infrarenal aortic clamping, as well as the interaction of angiotensin with other modulators for which an interactive relationship had been described previously under other experimental and/or clinical circumstances. The first study showed that, although renin (and thus angiotensin) concentrations were high after aortic unclamping, the hormone had no pathogenic or pathophysiological role of significance in the observed renal changes during this period (since blocking angiotensin II activation by the prevention of renin release, or by inhibiting the conversion enzyme, did not prevent a substantial decrease in RBF or GFR during that period). Preventing angiotensin II activation did, however, prevent renal changes during aortic clamping. This beneficial effect did not establish a primary role for angiotensin during that period, since the favourable influence could also (at least partially) be explained by prevention of the permissive influence of angiotensin on other vasoconstrictors and/or other vasodilatory influences of ACE inhibition and [1 - blockade which are unrelated to angiotensin. This study did indicate that (at least partially) different mechanisms are responsible for the renal changes seen during aortic clamping, and after aortic unclamping. The second study explored the role of calcium in the renal pathophysiological changes during aortic clamping and after unclamping. The protective influence effected by the administration of a Ca 2 + -blocker suggest the dependence of the renal vasoconstrictive and glomerular pathophysiological process(es) on the cellular influx of Ca 2 + through voltage-gated channels. It unfortunately provides no definitive insight into the primary instigators of these processes. However, it does offer a clinically useful method of preventing these changes and protecting the kidney against ischemic injury during abdominal aortic surgery. The third component of the animal studies demonstrates the importance of the protective effect of renal prostaglandins during the specific experimental (and probably also the clinical) circumstances. Again, it does not provide definitive information on the mediators responsible for the renal changes, since the deleterious effects of numerous endogenous substances have previously been shown to be counterbalanced by intrarenal synthesis of prostaglandins under various experimental and clinical circumstances. The extent of the pathophysiological and ultrastructural changes which occurred under the influence of a NSAID does, however, suggest that these drugs should not be used under these clinical circumstances. The last component of the study provides evidence that angiotensin only plays a secondary/supplementary role in the renal pathophysiological process even during aortic clamping. This may explain the contradictory evidence regarding the potential beneficial effect of ACE inhibition (on renal hemodynamics and glomerular function) during abdominal aortic surgery (Licker et al. 1996, Colson et al. 1992 a). Based on our studies, ACE inhibition can not be supported for this purpose. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Akute nierversaking is met die uitsondering van kardiale sterftes, steeds die belangrikste patologiese proses wat geassosieer is met perioperatiewe mortaliteit in pasiënte wat opereer word vir abdominale aorta aneurismes. Die intraoperatiewe veranderinge in renale bloedvloei (NBV) en glomerulêre funksie is die afgelope 15 jaar ondersoek en gerapporteer in pasiënte- sowel as diere-modelle. Ten spyte van groot variasies in studie-populasies, meettegnieke en ontwerp van studies in die algemeen, dui 'n wesenlike hoeveelheid getuienis daarop dat infrarenale klemming van die aorta renale isgemie induseer, wat die oorsaak is van postoperatiewe akute nierversaking wanneer hierdie komplikasie voorkom. Dit is verbasend dat, ten spyte van sommige onlangse studies wat rapporteer oor 'n verskeidenheid farmakologiese ingrepe om intraoperatiewe renale isgemie te voorkom (met wisselende sukses), baie min oënskynlik gedoen is om die patogenese en die presiese patofisiologie van hierdie potensieel dodelike komplikasie te ontrafel. Hoewel verskeie outeurs die moontlikheid van hormonale betrokkenheid (veral renienangiotensien, antidiuretiese hormoon en katekolamiene) in hierdie proses suggereer, is die presiese rol van hierdie mediators nog nie op 'n gestruktureerde wyse ondersoek (of rapporteer) nie. In ons aanvanklike pasiënte-studie is renale hemodinamika en -funksie gemeet vanaf die preoperatiewe periode, gedurende die intra-operatiewe fase en tot minstens vier uur na ontklemming van die aorta. Serumkonsentrasies van relevante hormone is bepaal tydens elke metingsperiode waar renale parameters gemeet is, ten einde die moontlikheid van 'n temporale verwantskap tussen renale veranderinge en variasies in hormoonkonsentrasies te ondersoek. Die vermindering in NBV en glomerulêre filtrasiespoed (GFS) wat ons aangetoon het om saam te val met infrarenale aortaklemming, stem ooreen met resultate wat tevore deur ander navorsers publiseer is. Ons het aangetoon dat die inkorting van hierdie parameters voortduur tot minstens vier uur na aorta-ontklemming. Hierdie veranderinge is tevore slegs rapporteer vir periodes tot kort na aorta-ontklemming voor sluiting van die buikwond. Die feit dat die GFS steeds verlaag is met ontslag van hierdie pasiënte, skep rede tot kommer, veral in pasiënte wat alreeds ingekorte nierfunksie het voor die chirurgiese prosedure. Van die gemete hormone wat moontlik 'n invloed sou kon uitoefen op NBV eh nefronfunksie, was renien die enigste waarvan verandering in plasmakonsentrasies saamgeval het met die onderdrukking van NBV en GFS na aortaklemming. Die ontwerp van ons studie het ons nie toegelaat om 'n besliste uitspraak te maak of die geassosieerde verhoging in angiotensien II primêr verantwoordelik was vir die verandering in renale hemodinamika, of dat die verhoogde renien (en angiotensien) bloedvlakke moontlik sekondêr stimuleer is deur die verandering in NBV wat deur 'n ander meganisme induseer is. In 'n ander pasiëntegroep het ons aangetoon dat die kombinasie van mannitol en dopamien geen beskerming verleen het teen die nadelige effekte van aorta-klemming nie. Die groot volumes uriene wat uitgeskei is onder die invloed van hierdie middels (wat nie korreleer het met NBV tydens ooreenstemmende periodes nie), het inderwaarheid 'n ontoepaslike gerustheid uitgelok. Weens die ooglopende gebrek aan objektiewe voordeel wat verleen word deur hierdie middels, behoort hulle gebruik tydens hierdie kliniese omstandighede ontmoedig te word. Die doel van die diere studies was die identifisering van die presiese rol van angiotensien in die patogenese en patofisiologie van die renale veranderinge geassosieer met infrarenale aortaklemming, sowel as die interaksie van angiotensien met ander modulators waarvoor 'n interaktiewe verwantskap voorheen beskryf is onder eksperimentele en/of kliniese omstandighede. Die eerste studie het getoon dat alhoewel renien (en dus angiotensien) konsentrasies hoog was na aorta-ontklemming, die hormone geen betekenisvolle patogenetiese of patofisiologiese rol in die waargenome renale veranderinge gedurende hierdie periode het nie (aangesien blokkade van angiotensien aktivering deur voorkoming van renien vrystelling, of deur inhibisie van angiotensien omsettingsensiem (AOE), nie 'n daling in NBV of GFS kon voorkom nie). Voorkoming van angiotensien II aktivering het egter wel renale verandering voorkom gedurende aortaklemming. Dié voordelige effek het nie 'n primêre rol vir angiotensien gedurende die periode bevestig nie, aangesien die gunstige invloed ook (ten minste gedeeltelik) verduidelik kon word deur die voorkoming van die fassiliterende invloed van angiotensien op ander vasokonstriktore en/of ander vasodilator-invloede van die onderdrukking van AOE en ïs-blokkers (wat geen verband het met angiotensien of die blokkade daarvan nie). Die studie het aangetoon dat (ten minste gedeeltelik) verskillende meganismes verantwoordelik is vir renale veranderinge wat gesien is gedurende aortaklemming en na -ontklemming. Die tweede studie het die rol van kalsium in die renale patofisiologiese veranderinge gedurende aortaklemming en na ontklemming ondersoek. Die beskermende invloed wat deur die toediening van Ca 2 + -blokkers bewerkstellig is, het bevestig dat die renale vasokonstriktoriese en glomerulêre patofisiologiese prosesse afhanklik is van sellulêre influks van kalsium deur spannings-afhanklike kannale. Dit het ongelukkig geen definitiewe insig verleen ten opsigte van die primêre inisieerders van die proses nie. Dit verskaf nogtans 'n bruikbare kliniese metode om daardie veranderinge te voorkom en die niere teen isgemiese besering gedurende abdominale aorta-chirurgie te beskerm. Die derde komponent van die diere-studies demonstreer die belangrikheid van die beskermende effek van renale prostaglandiene tydens die spesifieke eksperimentele (en waarskynlik ook die kliniese) omstandighede. Weereens gee dit nie definitiewe inligting oor die bemiddelaars wat verantwoordelik is vir die renale veranderinge nie, aangesien die skadelike effekte van verskeie endogene stowwe voorheen aangetoon is om beperk of voorkom te word deur die intrarenale vrystelling van prostaglandiene. Die omvang van die patofisiologiese en ultrastrukturele veranderinge wat ontstaan het onder die invloed van nie-steroïed anti-inflammatoriese middels (wat gebruik is om prostaglandien sintese te inhibeer), dui aan dat hierdie middels vermy moet word onder soortelyke kliniese omstandighede. Die laaste komponent van die studie verskaf 'n sterk aanduiding dat angiotensien slegs 'n sekondêre/aanvullende rol speel in die renale patofisiologiese proses, selfs gedurende aortaklemming. Dit mag die weersprekende getuienis oor die potensiële voordeel van AOE onderdrukking (op renale hemodinamika en glomerulêre funksie) gedurende abdominale aortachirurgie (Licker et al. 1996, Colson et al. 1992 a) verklaar. Gebaseer op ons studies, kan AOE onderdrukking nie ondersteun word vir hierdie doel nie...|$|E
