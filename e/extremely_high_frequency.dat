25|$|Radio {{waves from}} ≈10kHz (very low frequency) to ≈300GHz (<b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency)</b> {{propagate}} differently in interstellar space {{than on the}} Earth's surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on Earth. A great deal of radio astronomy depends on compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the desired signal.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the frequency, waveguides can be {{constructed}} from either conductive or dielectric materials. Generally, the lower the frequency to be passed the larger the waveguide is. For example, the natural waveguide the earth forms given by the dimensions between the conductive ionosphere and the ground {{as well as the}} circumference at the median altitude of the Earth is resonant at 7.83Hz. This is known as Schumann resonance. On the other hand, waveguides used in <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (EHF) communications can be less than a millimeter in width.|$|E

40|$|Replication of {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) {{is largely}} {{controlled by the}} cellular arm of the immune response. In this study the CMV-specific CD 4 T-cell response was characterized in a cohort of apparently healthy individ-uals. In 11 % of all individuals, <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequencies,</b> between 10 and 40 %, were found. High-level frequencies of CMV-specific CD 4 T cells persisted over several months and were {{not the result of}} an acute infection. Specific T cells were oligoclonal and were phenotypically and functionally characterized as mature effector cells, with both cytokine-secreting and proliferative potential. These high-level frequencies do not seem to compromise the immune response towards heterologous infections, and no signs of immunopathology were observed. Whereas a large temporary expansion of virus-specific T cells is well known to occur during acute infection, we now show that <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> of virus-specific T cells may continuously exist in chronic CMV infection without overtly compromising the remaining protective immunity.
