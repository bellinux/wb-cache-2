Using {{the notion}} of {{planarity}} and drawing for hypergraphs introduced respectively by Johnson and Pollak [9] and Mäkinen [14], we show in this paper that any hypergraph having less than nine hyperedges is vertex-planar and can be <b>drawn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge standard and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subset standard without edge crossing. Key words: hypergraphs, planarity, vertex-planarity, <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge standard, <b>drawing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subset standard, Euler diagram...|$|R

O'Neill scored 113 in the first innings to help a depleted team take a 137-run first innings lead and prevent India from squaring the series.

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata {{finished}} in fourth place, taking the final {{position in the}} finals, and were drawn against first-place Mumbai in the semi-finals. They hosted a 3–2 win in the first leg, with all goals in the first half, including two by Hume, and advanced with a goalless <b>draw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second leg. In the final, away to Kerala on 18 December, Kolkata fell behind to a goal by their former player Mohammed Rafi, and equalised before half-time with a header by defender Henrique Sereno. The game went to penalties, with Hume having Atlético's first attempt saved by Graham Stack, but Elhadji Ndoye missed for Kerala and Debjit Majumder saved from Cédric Hengbart to win Kolkata the title.|$|E
