5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E
40|$|L. <b>A.</b> Paul <b>has</b> {{recently}} argued that, on {{the standard}} model of rationality, individuals cannot make rational decisions about whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> or not. In this paper, I show that Paul’s arguments do not plausibly demonstrate that the standard model of rationality precludes rational decisions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> I argue that there are phenomenal and non-phenomenal values {{that can be used}} to determine the value that <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> will <b>have</b> for us and, in turn, {{that can be used to}} make rational decisions about whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> or not.

Data from Norway (N = 1307) show that subjective norms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} timing of intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is supported by their families and friends, {{the more likely they are}} to want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now compared to within the next three years. Attitudes also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on differences in the timing of intentions, for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able to cope with having child are more likely to intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now rather than within the next three years. This effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> varies considerably with personal circumstances...|$|R
30|$|Dommermuth et al. (2011) {{investigated}} {{the role of}} attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on the time frame in which individuals intended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (‘now’ and ‘within the next three years’). They found that subjective norms <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} timing of the intentions of childless people and one-child parents to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> The more childless individuals and first-parity parents felt that their intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> were supported by their families and friends, the more likely they were to want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> in the short term (‘now’) compared to later (‘within the next three years’). Perceived behavioural control was a significant determinant for both groups: people who considered themselves better able to cope with <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> were more likely to intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> in the short term (‘now’) rather than later (‘within the next three years’). However, this effect disappeared when the authors controlled for demographic background variables. It seems that for the Norwegian case, the effect of perceived control on the timing of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> varies considerably with personal circumstances.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, Victor and {{his wife}} Julia move to Genoa City to help Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) run her company, Chancellor Industries. Julia felt {{neglected}} by Victor and sleeps with her photographer, a man named Michael. Victor created his own company, Newman Enterprises, and ended up cheating on Julia as well, with Eve Howard (Margaret Mason) and later Lorie Brooks (Jaime Lyn Bauer). Julia became pregnant and {{it is assumed that}} it was Michael’s child; Victor attacks him and Julia loses the child, revealed to actually have been Victor’s. Eve later <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), believed to be Victor’s son. Julia and Victor divorce and she leaves town with Michael, just as Victor begins a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Having been from the lower walks of life, Victor teaches Nikki about society. He later takes over the Prentiss family company, Prentiss Industries, and they scheme to get it back by using Lorie to seduce Victor into a marriage. On their wedding day, Victor signs the company back over to them and Lorie stands him up. Victor then tries returns to Nikki, who recently married Kevin Bancroft. Nikki ended up pregnant with Victor's child, but she ended up being manipulated into a marriage Tony DiSalvo to save her relationship with Kevin. Nikki later gives birth to a daughter named Victoria Newman (Ashley Nicole Millan). Nikki also later got involved with a man named Rick Daros, who nearly killed her before being saved by Victor. Eve Howard returns with her boyfriend, demanding that money be allocated to Cole in Victor’s will, and later takes a job as his assistant, which prompts Julia to return to protect Victor. He planned to marry Eve but faked his death on the day of their wedding, and ends up marrying Nikki in April 1984. The following year, while Victor and Nikki are vacationing, Eve reappears with Rick, and they end up stealing money from them and escaping. Nikki facilitates Victor's reunion with his mother, Cora Miller, before her death.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the time frame of {{intentions}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> For both parents and childless people we compare those who want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now with those who intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> within the next three years. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and using data from Norway (N = 1307), we investigate the role of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on these two different time frames in fertility intention. The results show that subjective norms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} timing of intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is supported by their families and friends, {{the more likely they are}} to want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now compared to within the next three years. It also shows that positive attitudes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on intending to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now rather than later for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able to cope with having child are more likely to intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now rather than within the next three years.

If you choose to remain childless, and your choice is based upon projections about what you think it would be like for you to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational.

25|$|Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean {{has assumed}} a new {{identity}} as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labors in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes {{it out on the}} other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers uses the incident as a pretense to fire Fantine ("At the End of the Day"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both ("I Dreamed a Dream"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken.
