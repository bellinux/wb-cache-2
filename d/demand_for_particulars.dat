40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{conserve}} fisheries stocks have included such demand-side measures as consumer boycotts to reduce <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> specific species, {{and the promotion}} of aquaculture to reduce pressure on natural stocks. This article argues that these sorts of measures can be counter-productive. The economics of the commercial fishing industry are such that decreasing <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> species can often have the perverse effect of increasing industry effort to catch them. This means that consumer boycotts or efforts to promote aquaculture can have the effect of accelerating, rather than ameliorating, the depletion of overfished stocks. This proposition is tested on a panel data set, covering several species over a period of almost two decades, drawn from the New England fishery. We conclude that effective conservation of depleted fisheries requires supply-side regulation such as quotas. Copyright (c) 2001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

The income effects were, however, statistically insignificant, as they may have been captured by choices of appliances rather than utilisation. The estimated model results were then employed to examine the effect of a proposed change in the tariff structure for electricity in Barbados.

We begin by identifying the determinants of farmer <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{planting material}} of cooking banana cultivars that are candidate hosts for insertion of pest and disease resistance by NARO. At {{the level of the}} individual farm household, <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> planting material is defined by the decision to “adopt ” (use) and the scale of use (number of mats). We then use the fitted equation to generate three pieces of information. First, we develop client prototypes by describing the characteristics of farm households with high and low predicted <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> cultivars. This exercise illustrates how the choice of host planting material for genetic transformation can have social consequences. Second, we use the example of Nakitembe to estimate the total size of industry <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> planting material of a genetically transformed host cultivar. Third, we simulate changes in <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> planting material when resistance traits are inserted, with varying degrees of effectiveness...|$|R
