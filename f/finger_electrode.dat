Electrospun TiO 2 anatase submicron-diameter wire suspensions in a viscous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix were prepared directly from electrospun submicron-diameter fibre mats by using high-shear mixing, achieving the complete break-up of all electrospun mats and suspending TiO 2 submicron-diameter wires uniformly in the PDMS matrix. Suspension was used as an active layer in an electro-optical device where a reversible change in light scattering is achieved by preparing a device consisting of an active layer and combined planar and <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> system. Using the constructed device, it was possible to change the alignment or spatial distribution of TiO 2 submicron-diameter wires by applying a DC electric field across the planar or finger, electrodes thus changing the transmittance (DT = 25 %) of the suspension and demonstrating the potential to use combined planar and <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> devices in smart window applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} effect of {{electrostatic}} boundary conditions and defects on the electrical properties of epitaxial nano ferroelectric thin film capacitors with various electrode configurations. The capacitor geometries studied are parallel plate, or so called sandwich type electrodes and the interdigitated finger electrodes grown on the ferroelectric film. The defects, when present, are frozen-in dipoles of the p-type. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy coupled with the elastic and electrostatic boundary conditions is used to compute the electrical properties. A switchable ferroelectric polarization lying in {{the plane of the}} film for the case of interdigitated electrodes is weakly impacted by the presence of dead layers and asymmetrically distributed defects compared to a classical sandwich type nano film. An out of plane remanent polarization in a sandwich type capacitor, stabilized via compressive in-plane misfit, always forms in a multidomain configuration in ultrathin films with thin dead layers. An in-plane polarization stabilized by a tensile misfit, on the other hand, could be much more effectively used in memory device applications where interdigitated electrodes are possible to utilize. The latter also does not suffer as much from the possible presence of dead layers even in ultrathin structures (Film thickness < 10 nm). Switching fields is a strong function of defects in ultrathin <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> type systems. We also show how polarization vector configures itself in favor of the highly inhomogeneous field formed under applied bias in the <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> case for a film under tensile stress. Thus, switching and the related sensing technique has to be considered accordingly in applications. Presence of a bottom electrode for the case of the <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> capacitor also has a substantial impact on electrical properties. The hysteresis and domain characteristics of the two capacitor geometries as a function of interface conditions and defects are discussed for BaTiO 3 strained on compressive and tensile single crystal substrates...|$|E

40|$|Electrowetting {{of water}} drops on {{structured}} superhydrophobic surfaces {{are known to}} cause an irreversible change from a slippy (Cassie-Baxter) to a sticky (Wenzel) regime. An alternative approach to using a water drop on a superhydrophobic surface to obtain a non-wetting system {{is to use a}} liquid marble on a smooth solid substrate. A liquid marble is a droplet coated in hydrophobic grains, which therefore carries its own solid surface structure as a conformal coating. Such droplets can be considered as perfect non-wetting systems having contact angles to smooth solid substrates of close to 180 degrees. In this work we report the electrowetting of liquid marbles made of water coated with hydrophobic lycopodium grains and show that the electrowetting is completely reversible. Marbles are shown to return to their initial contact angle for both ac and dc electrowetting and without requiring a threshold voltage to be exceeded.

40|$|Rationale: Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is associated with}} exaggerated autonomic responses to sudden, loud acoustic stimuli, particularly under conditions characterized by ambiguous threat. However, {{it is not clear}} if such exaggerated responses are a stable vulnerability factor for developing PTSD or a feature of current PTSD that resolves with symptom resolution. We investigated this issue by comparing autonomic startle responses to acoustic stimuli under low, medium, and high threat conditions in Gulf War Veterans with and without current and past PTSD. Methods: Our sample included three groups: no PTSD (n= 151), PTSD in remission (n= 51), and current PTSD (n= 54) (M age&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 44. 3, SD&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 9. 6; 11. 6 % female). Current and past PTSD symptoms were assessed with the clinician-administered PTSD scale. All participants were exposed to an acoustic stimulus in three conditions: 1) low threat, in which participants experienced no threat of shock; 2) medium threat, in which participants wore a <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> but were told that they would not get shocked; and 3) high threat, in which participants wore a <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> and were told that they would get shocked. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare group differences in startle responding. Results: Individuals with current PTSD had significantly higher heart rate responses compared with the no PTSD group in the low, t(196) &#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 2. 52, p= 0. 011, and medium threat conditions, t(66. 7) &#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 2. 40, p= 0. 022, and compared with the PTSD in remission group in the low, t(87) = 1. 957, p= 0. 05), and medium threat conditions, t(77. 81) &#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 2. 50, p= 0. 02. In analyses, including only patients with current or past PTSD who had current clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) across the entire range from 0 to 108 (M&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 41. 0, SD&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 25. 4), we found that higher severity of current PTSD symptoms was not only associated with higher startle responses, particularly in the medium threat condition (r&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 22, p= 0. 04), but also with trend level in the low (r= 0. 18, p=. 09) and high (r= 0. 18, p= 0. 09) threat conditions. Conclusion: These results suggest that exaggerated autonomic startle responses under conditions of low and medium threat vary as a function of current PTSD severity and are not a marker of PTSD vulnerability. Moreover, the data suggest that this startle paradigm with varying threat levels may be a useful index of hyperarousal of fear-related neurocircuitry in PTSD...|$|E

In our design, an Ag/SiO 2 electrode is embedded into a Si substrate while being positioned between Si nanowire (SiNW) arrays underneath poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), facilitating suppressed recombination at the Si/Ag interface and notable improvements in the fabrication reproducibility. With an optimized microgrid electrode, our 1 -cm 2 hybrid solar cells exhibit a power conversion efficiency of up to 16. 1 % with an open-circuit voltage of 607 mV and a short circuit current density of 34. 0 mA/cm 2. This power conversion efficiency is more than twice as high as that of solar cells using a conventional electrode (8. 0 %). The microgrid electrode significantly minimizes the optical and electrical losses. This reproducibly yields a superior quantum efficiency of 99 % at the main solar spectrum wavelength of 600 nm. In particular, our solar cells exhibit {{a significant increase in the}} fill factor of 78. 3 % compared to that of a conventional electrode (61. 4 %); this is because of the drastic reduction in the metal/contact resistance of the 1 -μm-thick Ag electrode.

This involved generation of soot particles using a quenched co-flow diffusion flame; depositing the particles onto a sensor substrate using thermophoresis and particle detection using a <b>finger</b> <b>electrode</b> structure, patterned on thermally oxidized silicon substrate. The generated soot particles were characterized using techniques including Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer for mobility size distributions, Differential Mobility Analyzer-Aerosol Particle Mass analyzer for the mass-mobility relationship, and Transmission Electron Microscopy for morphology. The generated particles were similar to particles from diesel engines in concentration, mobility size distribution, and mass fractal dimension. The primary particle size, effective density and organic mass fraction were slightly lower than values reported for diesel engines. The response measured with the sensors was largely dependent on particle mass concentration, but increased with increasing soot aggregate mobility size. Detection down to cumulative mass as small as 20 - 30 mu g has been demonstrated.

The depletion width of the p-n junction under the ITO-electrode was induced and extended while the absorbed volume and built-in electric field were also increased when the biasing voltage was increased. The photocurrent and conversion efficiency were increased because more photo-carriers are generated in a larger absorbed volume and because the carriers transported and collected more effectively due to higher biasing voltage effects. Compared to a reference solar cell (which was biased at 0  V), a conversion efficiency enhancement of 26.57 % (from 12.42 % to 15.72 %) and short-circuit current density enhancement of 42.43 % (from 29.51 to 42.03  mA/cm 2) were obtained as the proposed MOS-structure solar cell biased at 2.5  V.

By performing chemical treatment on polymeric insulation via fluorination process, the charge transport characteristics of the material can be modified. In doing so, excellent surface properties of fluoropolymers can be attained without compromising the bulk properties of the original polymeric insulation. The change in chemical components at the surface of polymeric insulation should lead to a corresponding change in electrical properties at the surface and so suppress charge accumulation. In this paper, epoxy resin samples were formulated and treated with various surface fluorinating conditions. The samples then were characterised by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and DC surface conductivity measurements. The surface potential decay measurement was performed and the result shows that there is a significant change in surface potential decay measurement with the introduction of surface fluorinated layer.

The corresponding sensor systems are commonly large and cumbersome. Here, a 7. 5 [*]×[*] 3. 5 [*]mm chip, containing microstructured CTD sensor elements, has been developed. On this, 1. 5 [*]mm 2 gold <b>finger</b> <b>electrodes</b> are used to measure the impedance, and thereby the conductivity of water, in the MHz frequency range. Operation at these frequencies resulted in higher sensitivities than those at sub-MHz frequencies. Up to 14 [*]kΩ per parts per thousand salt concentration was obtained repeatedly for freshwater concentrations. This was three orders of magnitude higher than that obtained for concentrations in and above the brackish range. A platinum electrode is used to determine a set ambient temperature with an accuracy of 0. 005 °C. Membranes with Nichrome strain gauges responded to a pressure change of 1 bar with a change in resistance of up to 0. 21 [*]Ω. A linear fit to data over 7 bars gave a sensitivity of 0. 1185 [*]Ω/bar with an R 2 of 0. 9964. This indicates that the described device can be used in size-limited applications, like miniaturized submersibles, or as a bio-logger on marine animals...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{demands of}} high-throughput, {{accurate}} and fast response biological or chemical sensors are driving {{the development of}} new detection technologies. This paper presents a micromechanical biosensor with capacitive read-out method. The proposed biosensor design consists of a fixed-fixed beam attached to an interdigitated capacitor. Implementation of the interdigitated capacitor design improves the sensitivity of the biosensor. The effects of the electrode thickness, length and the number of <b>electrode</b> <b>fingers</b> on the change of capacitance are investigated. The results show that the percentage change of capacitance is proportional to the number of the <b>electrode</b> <b>fingers.</b> Similarly, the increase in the length of the electrodes results in an increase in the percentage change of the capacitance. However, as the thickness of the electrode increases, the percentage change of the capacitance decreases. <br /...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the design, simulation, {{fabrication}} and test results of ZnO-based contour-mode micro-resonators integrating piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) layers. The inter-digitated (IDTs) type micro-resonators are fabricated on ZnO films and suspended top of 2 µm thick silicon membranes using silicon-on insulator (SOI) technology. We analyze several possibilities of increasing the quality factor (Q) and the electromechanical coupling coefficient (k t 2) of the devices by varying the numbers and lengths of the IDTs electrodes and using different thicknesses of the ZnO layer. We designed and fabricated IDTs of different finger numbers (n= 25, 40, 50 and 80) and lengths (L= 100 / 130 / 170 / 200 µm) for three different thicknesses of ZnO films (200, 600 and 800 nm). The measured Q factor confirms that reducing the length {{and the number of}} IDTs fingers enables to reach better electrical performances at resonant frequencies around 700 MHz. The extracted results for an optimized micro-resonator device having a IDTs length of 100 μm and 40 <b>finger</b> <b>electrodes,</b> show a Q of 1180 and a k t 2 of 7. 4 %. We demonstrate also that the reduction of the ZnO thickness from 800 nm to 200 nm increases the quality factor from 430 to 1600 respectively, around 700 MHz. Experimental data are in very good agreement with theoretical simulations of the fabricated device...|$|R
