After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof of his methods. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to {{the hospital}}, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.|$|E

25|$|Amber Reeves {{attended}} Kensington High School until 1904, {{and then}} travelled to Europe to become fluent in French.

Reeves then began studying Moral Sciences at Newnham College in 1905. It is unlikely her father raised further opposition as he always spoke highly of her academic achievements.|$|E
25|$|Although The Wonderful Wizard of Oz {{was very}} profitable, the family {{remained}} low on cash in 1900 near Christmas. The book's initial royalty was {{slated to be}} given to Frank in January. However, Maud told Frank to ask for it in advance to purchase Christmas gifts. Begrudgingly, Frank requested and received the money, pocketing it. Not glancing at the money, Frank returned home, finding Maud ironing his shirt. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> money after she asked for it, whereupon she became shocked. Anticipating it to be no more than $100, Maud was delighted to learn that the check was for $3,432.64. Maud misremembered the iron during the ensuing flurry and burned Frank's shirt.|$|E
25|$|Lange {{began the}} new decade {{in the light}} romp How to Beat the High Co$t of Living (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it {{received}} mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which {{he was working with}} Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for Goin' South (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). Upon offering her the part, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.|$|E

500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham and Perry. It was a late {{addition to the}} episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, [...] "All the modern musicals like Jekyll & Hyde have these really overwrought love songs, so {{we really wanted to}} have one between J.D. and Turk." [...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys." [...] The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, [...] "and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [...] ", [...] including Turk performing an appendectomy on J.D. in [...] "My Day Off".

500|$|Castellaneta and Kavner {{were asked}} to voice the lead roles of Homer and Marge Simpson as they were regular cast members of The Tracey Ullman Show on which The Simpsons shorts appeared. Cartwright auditioned for the part of Lisa, but found that Lisa was simply {{described}} as the [...] "middle child" [...] {{and at the time}} did not have much personality. She then became more interested in the role of Bart, so Simpsons creator Matt Groening let her try out for that part instead, and upon hearing her read, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> job on the spot. Smith had initially been asked by casting director Bonita Pietila to audition for the role of Bart, but Pietila then realised that Smith's voice was too high, Smith was given the role of Lisa instead, although she almost turned it down. When the show was commissioned for a full half-hour series, Shearer joined the cast and performed multiple roles. Groening and Sam Simon asked Shearer to join the cast as they were fans of his radio show. Azaria was only a guest actor in the first season, but became permanent in season 2. He first appeared in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", re-recording Christopher Collins's lines as Moe Szyslak. As he joined later {{than the rest of the}} cast, Groening still considers Azaria the [...] "new guy." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he was {{transferred}} to the 524th Regiment, Xie was not familiar with any of the men under his command. He commanded the defense of the warehouse from 27 October til 1 November. Its proximity to the Shanghai International Settlement made it world-famous and brought the war between the Chinese and Japanese to the world's attention, if only briefly. During the defense Girl Guide Yang Huimin secretly delivered a Republic of China flag to the defenders; when she asked what Xie's plans were he replied [...] "Defend to the death!". Moved, she asked for a list of the names of the defenders to announce to the entire country. Xie realized that doing so would reveal to the Japanese (who had been fooled into thinking an entire regiment was stationed at the warehouse) their real strength. However, not wanting to disappoint Yang, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> original roster of the 524th Regiment - 800 men, nearly double their actual strength. Thus the defenders of Sihang Warehouse became known as the Eight Hundred Heroes.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Sophia Magdalena {{was never}} {{involved}} in politics, {{except for one}} on one occasion. In August 1788, during the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), the King gave her the task to enter in negotiations with Denmark to prevent {{a declaration of war}} from Denmark during the ongoing war against Russia. He asked her to call upon the Danish ambassador Reventlow and give him a letter to be read in the Danish royal council before her brother, the Danish King. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> freedom to write as she wished, but to use the argument that she spoke as a sister and mother to a son with the right to the Danish throne and upon her own initiative. Sophia Magdalena called upon the Danish ambassador, held a speech to him followed by a long conversation and then handed him a letter written as a [...] "warm appeal" [...] to her brother. A copy was sent to Gustav III, and her letter was read in the royal Danish council, were it reportedly made a good impression. However, her mission was still unsuccessful, as the Russo-Danish alliance made it unavoidable for Denmark to declare war shortly afterward. At the time, there were a note that she met two Russian prisoners of war in the park of the Haga Palace, and gave them 100 kronor each.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother {{moved into}} {{the other half of}} Dilke's Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as Dante's Inferno, and they would read together. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> love sonnet [...] "Bright Star" [...] (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in {{progress}} which he continued at until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. [...] "All his desires were concentrated on Fanny". From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones. Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture. Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his 'star' began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as [...] "The Eve of St. Agnes" [...] and [...] "La Belle Dame sans Merci" [...] where love and death both stalk. [...] "I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;" [...] he wrote to her, [...] "...your loveliness, and the hour of my death".|$|E
