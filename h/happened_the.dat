It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this never <b>happened.</b> <b>The</b> success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what <b>happened.</b> <b>The</b> reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{peaceful}} protests {{continued in}} front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka on the sidewalk of Spadina Avenue and at Queen's Park simultaneously.

Toronto Mayor David Miller urged that such tactics as blockading the Gardiner Expressway not be used again. Police officials decried the use of children during such dangerous tactics.|$|E

5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had <b>happened.</b> <b>The</b> {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E

Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy.

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never <b>happened.</b> <b>The</b> unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874.

However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him {{to try to get the}} three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget everything that has <b>happened.</b> <b>The</b> nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
5|$|Freed, Desha left Kentucky, {{traveling}} {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi rivers. According to legend, {{he attempted to}} rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Desha confessed that he had been living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event <b>happened.</b> <b>The</b> deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E

If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has <b>happened,</b> <b>the</b> birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E

Although no riders tested positive, Roberto Visentini, Flavio Giuppioni and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second, third and fourth, respectively, in the eighteenth stage – showed up too late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their team leaders, the jury later reverted their decision, and no penalty was given.|$|E

They are unaware that Faronea is conspiring with Baptiste Bouclier, the chauffeur of party host Vic Huling, to kidnap Vic. The next morning the Milburns awake hung over to find Vic dead from a gunshot through the heart and his wife Bette missing. Tony calls his friend, district attorney Danny Harrison to investigate. Bette arrives with Billy Arliss at whose home she had slept. Because of their excessive drinking, no one can remember anything about what had <b>happened</b> <b>the</b> night before.

5|$|As it <b>happened,</b> <b>the</b> Japanese commander, Major General Masutaro Nakai of the 20th Division, {{had ordered}} a {{sizeable}} force {{to move to}} Kaiapit {{under the command of}} Major Yonekura Tsuneo. Yonekura's force included the 9th and 10th Companies of the 78th Infantry Regiment, the 5th Company of the 80th Infantry Regiment, a heavy machine-gun section, a signals section and an engineer company—a total of about 500 troops. From Kaiapit it was to threaten the Allied position at Nadzab, creating a diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape. The main body left Yokopi in the Finisterre Range on 6 September but was delayed by heavy rains that forced the troops to move, soaking wet, through muddy water for much of the way. Only the advance party of this force had reached Kaiapit by 18 September, by which time Lae had already fallen. Yonekura's main body, moving by night to avoid being sighted by Allied aircraft, was by this time no further from Kaiapit than King, but had two rivers to cross. Since both were heading for the same objective, a clash was inevitable.|$|E
