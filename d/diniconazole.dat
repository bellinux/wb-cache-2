40|$|The {{enantioselective}} bioaccumulation of <b>diniconazole</b> in Tenebrio molitor Linne larva {{was investigated}} with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry {{based on the}} ChiralcelOD- 3 R[cellulose tri-(3, 5 -dimethylphenyl carbamate) ] column. In this study we documented the effects of dietary supplementation with wheat bran contaminated by racemic <b>diniconazole</b> at two dose levels of 20 mg kg(- 1) and 2 mg kg(- 1) (dry weight) in Tenebrio molitor. The results showed that both doses of <b>diniconazole</b> were taken up by Tenebrio molitor rapidly {{in the first few}} days, the concentrations of R-enantiomer and S-enantiomer at high doses reached the highest level of 0. 55 mg kg(- 1) and 0. 48 mg kg(- 1), respectively, on the 1 (st) d, and the concentrations of them obtained a maxima of 0. 129 mg kg(- 1) and 0. 128 mg kg(- 1) at low dose, respectively, on the 3 (rd) d, which means that the concentration of <b>diniconazole</b> was proportional to the time of achieving the highest accumulated level. It afterwards attained equilibrium after a sharp decline at both 20 mg kg(- 1) and 2 mg kg(- 1) of <b>diniconazole.</b> The determination results from the feces of Tenebrio molitor demonstrated that the extraction recovery (ER) values of the high dose group were higher than that of the low dose group and the values were all above 1; therefore, it could be inferred that enantiomerization existed in Tenebrio molitor. Additionally, the biota accumulation factor was used to evaluate the bioaccumulation of <b>diniconazole</b> enantiomers, showing that the bioaccumulation of <b>diniconazole</b> in Tenebrio molitor was enantioselective with preferential accumulation of S-enantiomer.

40|$|The {{effects of}} azole-type P 450 inhibitors and two metabolism-resistant abscisic acid (ABA) analogues on in vitro ABA- 8 '-hydroxylase activity, in planta ABA metabolism, {{endogenous}} ABA content, and tuber meristem dormancy duration {{were examined in}} potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Russet Burbank). When functionally expressed in yeast, three potato CYP 707 A genes were demonstrated to encode enzymatically active ABA- 8 '-hydroxylases with micromolar affinities for (+) -ABA. The in vitro activity of the three enzymes was inhibited by the P 450 azole-type inhibitors ancymidol, paclobutrazol, <b>diniconazole,</b> and tetcyclasis, and by the 8 '-acetylene- and 8 '-methylene-ABA analogues, with <b>diniconazole</b> and tetcyclasis being the most potent inhibitors. The in planta metabolism of [3 H](1) -ABA to phaseic acid and dihydrophaseic acid in tuber meristems was inhibited by <b>diniconazole,</b> tetcyclasis, {{and to a lesser}} extent by 8 '-acetylene- and 8 '-methylene-ABA. Continuous exposure of in vitro generated microtubers to <b>diniconazole</b> resulted in a 2 -fold increase in endogenous ABA content and a decline in dihydrophaseic acid content after 9 weeks of development. Similar treatment with 8 '-acetylene-ABA had no effects on the endogenous contents of ABA or phaseic acid but reduced the content of dihydrophaseic acid. Tuber meristem dormancy progression was determined ex vitro in control, diniconazole-, and 8 '-acetylene-ABA-treated microtubers following harvest. Continuous exposure to <b>diniconazole</b> during microtuber development had no effects on subsequent sprouting at any time point. Continuous exposure to 8 '-acetylene-ABA significantly increased the rate of microtuber sprouting. The results indicate that, although a decrease in ABA content is a hallmark of tuber dormancy progression, the decline in ABA levels is not a prerequisite for dormancy exit and the onset of tuber sprouting.

Three exposure concentrations (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg) of <b>diniconazole</b> in soil (dry weight) to earthworms were used. The uptake kinetics fitted the first-order kinetics well. The bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of R, S isomers were 6. 6046 and 8. 5115 in 25 mg/kg dose exposure, 2. 6409 and 2. 9835 in 10 mg/kg dose exposure, 1. 7784 and 2. 0437 in 1 mg/kg dose exposure, respectively. Bioaccumulation of <b>diniconazole</b> in earthworm tissues was enantioselective with a preferential accumulation of S-diniconazole and the enantiomer fractions were about 0. 45 - 0. 50 {{in all three}} level dose exposures.

40|$|The enantiomeric {{separation}} of chiral agrochemicals was investigated using dual systems with mixtures of cyclodextrin derivatives. The dual cyclodextrin systems consist of two neutral cyclodextrin, namely hydroxypropyl- Î³-cyclodextrin (HP-Î³-CD) and hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (HP-Î²-CD). The agrochemicals used were three triazole fungicides viz. cyproconazole, bromuconazole and <b>diniconazole,</b> each with 2, 2 and 1 stereogenic centre respectively.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A selective and simple analytical method for the trace level determination of <b>diniconazole</b> in soil, fruit, vegetables and water samples was developed based on immunoaffinity extraction followed by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The ELISA was based on monoclonal antibodies highly specific to <b>diniconazole</b> and was a fast, cost-effective, and selective screening method {{for the detection of}} <b>diniconazole.</b> The results of the ELISA correlated well with gas chromatography (GC) results, with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9879 (n = 19).

Complete separation of 10 stereoisomer of triazole fungicides were obtained in a single run with good resolution (Rs 1. 74 “ 26. 31) and high peak efficiency (N > 400 000). In {{the second part of the}} study, enantioseparation of hexaconazole, penconazole, myclobutanil, and triadimefon was investigated. Simultaneous enantioseparation of penconazole, myclobutanil, and triadimefon was achieved under acidic condition (pH 3. 0) using 25 mM phosphate buffer, 50 mM SDS, and 30 mM HP-Î³-CD, with Rs greater than 0. 9 whereas, simultaneous enantioseparation of hexaconazole, penconazole, and myclobutanil was successfully achieved under neutral condition (pH 7. 0) using 25 mM phosphate buffer, 40 mM SDS, and 40 mM HP-Î³-CD, with Rs greater than 1. 6. In order to improve detection sensitivity, on-line preconcentration technique was investigated.

All of the phenylpropanoids exhibited dose- and time-dependent insecticidal activity. Among all the tested phenylpropanoids, coumarin exhibited the highest toxicity by revealing the least LD 50 value (0. 672 g/L). In addition, the most toxic compound (coumarin) observed in the current study, deteriorated the growth resulting tremendous reduction (78. 39 %) in efficacy of conversion of digested food (ECD), and (ECI) efficacy of conversion of ingested food (70. 04 %) of tenth-instar red palm weevil larvae.

The detoxification response of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus larvae determined by the quantitative expression of cytochrome P 450, esterases, and glutathione S-transferase revealed enhanced expression among moderately toxic and ineffective compounds.

40|$|A new {{analytical}} procedure {{was developed and}} validated, using liquid chromatography, for simultaneous determination of seven new pesticides belonging to different chemical classes (azoles, strobilurines, benzoylureas, and a new oxazolidinedione) in apple, grape and wine food samples. Solvent extraction of pesticides was performed using a cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9 + 1 v/v) mixture and the extract was cleaned-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using silica cartridges and elution with tetrahydrofurane. Separation of pesticides flusilazole, fenbuconazole, <b>diniconazole,</b> tebufenozide, famoxadone, trifloxystrobin and flufenoxuron was performed by gradient elution High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a microbore Hypersil HS C 18 column in 35 min total time, using mixtures of acetonitrile-water as the mobile phase. Pesticides were detected and quantified at 210 nm with a variable-wavelength UV detector. Recoveries of pesticides from spiked samples, at 0. 05 - 2. 0 mg kg- 1 for apple and grape and at 0. 025 - 0. 250 mg L- 1 for wine, ranged from 82 to 107 % for apple and grape and from 87 % to 106 % for wine with RSD 12 %. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of the method, as a {{signal to noise ratio}} equalled 10, ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 10 mg kg- 1 for apple and grape and from 0. 005 to 0. 02 mg L- 1 for wine samples. The uncertainty associated with the analytical methodology, estimated using the 'bottom-up' approach, was lower than 12. 8 % for all pesticides and matrices tested. The proposed methodology was applied for the evaluation of trifloxystrobin residue levels in grapes exposed to field treatments and in the must and wine produced from them...|$|E
