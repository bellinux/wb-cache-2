To address these issues, the effects of <b>efonidipine</b> and its R(−) - and S(+) -isomers on these Ca 2 + channel subtypes were examined electrophysiologically in the expression systems using Xenopus oocytes and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK tk-ts 13). <b>Efonidipine,</b> a mixture of R(−) - and S(+) -isomers, exerted blocking actions on L- and T-types, but no effects on N-, P/Q- and R-type Ca 2 + channels.

We examined effects of <b>efonidipine,</b> a dual T-type and L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB), on TGF-β 1 –induced fibrotic changes in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast. T-type and L-type calcium channel mRNAs were highly expressed in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. TGF-β 1 (5 ng/mL) significantly increased Smad 2 phosphorylation and [3 H]-leucine incorporation, which were attenuated by pretreatment with <b>efonidipine</b> (10 μM). Neither R(−) <b>efonidipine</b> (10 μM), selective T-type CCB, nor nifedipine (10 μM), selective L-type CCB, efficaciously inhibited both TGF-β 1 –induced Smad 2 phosphorylation and [3 H]-leucine incorporation.

Its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA) is of great use for the understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms of the drug. The binding of <b>efonidipine</b> to BSA was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. BSA fluorescence was quenched by <b>efonidipine,</b> {{due to the fact that}} <b>efonidipine</b> quenched the fluorescence of tryptophan residues mainly by the collision mode. The thermodynamic parameters &# 916;H 0 and &# 916;S 0 were 68. 04 kJ/mol and 319. 42 J·mol- 1 ·K- 1, respectively, indicating that the hydrophobic interactions played a major role. The results of circular dichroism and synchronous fluorescence measurements showed that the binding of <b>efonidipine</b> to BSA led to a conformational change of BSA. The fraction of occupied sites (&# 952;) for the 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalein-sulfonic acid (ANS) -BSA system is 85 %, whereas for the NZ- 105 -BSA system, it is 53 %, which suggests that the interaction of ANS with BSA is stronger than that of NZ- 105 with BSA. Binding studies in the presence of ANS indicated that <b>efonidipine</b> competed with ANS for hydrophobic sites of BSA. The effects of metal ions on the binding constant of the efonidipine-BSA complex were also investigated.

Currently CCBs have been classified by delivery system, half-life and channel types. We tested anti-albuminuric effect among 4 types of CCBs. Methods: Subjects were 50 hypertensives (SBP/DBP 164. 7 ± 17. 1 / 92. 3 ± 12. 2 mm Hg, s-Cr 0. 81 ± 0. 37 mg/dl, urinary albumin excretion (UAE) 69. 4 (33. 5 - 142. 6) mg/gCr). Four CCBs were administered in a crossover setting: nifedipine CR, a long biological half-life L type by controlled release; cilnidipine, an N/L type; <b>efonidipine,</b> a T/L type; and amlodipine, a long biological half-life L type. Results: Comparable BP reductions were obtained. UAE at endpoints ware as follows (mg/gCr,*P < 0. 01) : nifedipine CR 30. 8 (17. 3 - 81. 1),* cilnidipine 33. 9 (18. 0 - 67. 7),* <b>efonidipine</b> 51. 0 (21. 2 - 129. 8), amlodipine 40. 6 (18. 7 - 94. 7). By all agents, significant augmentations were observed in PRA, angiotensin I and angiotensin II (AngII). AngII at cilnidipine was significantly lower than that at amlodipine. PAC at cilnidipine and <b>efonidipine</b> was significantly lower than that at amlodipine. Nifedipine CR significantly reduced ANP concentration. Conclusions: It is revealed that only nifedipine CR and cilnidipine could reduce albuminuria statistically.

In contrast, there has been limited progress on the pharmacology T-type Ca 2 + channels. T-type channels play a role in cardiac pacemaking, aldosterone secretion, and renal hemodynamics, leading to the hypothesis that mixed T- and L-type blockers may have therapeutic advantages over selective L-type blockers. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify compounds that block the Cav 3. 2 T-type channel with high affinity, focusing on two classes of compounds: phenylalkylamines (e. g., mibefradil) and dihydropyridines (e. g., <b>efonidipine).</b> Compounds were tested using a validated Ca 2 + influx assay into a cell line expressing recombinant Cav 3. 2 channels. This study identified four clinically approved antihypertensive drugs (<b>efonidipine,</b> felodipine, isradipine, and nitrendipine) as potent T-channel blockers (IC 50 < 3 μM). In contrast, other widely prescribed dihydropyridines, such as amlodipine and nifedipine, were 10 -fold less potent, making them a more appropriate choice in research studies on the role of L-type currents.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of an L- and T-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) on 24 hour systolic blood pressure (24 -hour SBP) and heart rate (24 -hour HR) profiles in essential hypertensive patients. Subjects and Methods: Thirty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. The 24 -hour SBP and HR were recorded before and after treatment with <b>efonidipine</b> (L- and T-type CCB, 40 mg), after waking. Changes in 24 -hour SBP and HR and the diurnal to nocturnal SBP ratio were measured. The best-fit curves of changes in SBP and HR were depicted using a periodic function. Results: The mean 24 -hour SBP and HR decreased significantly after treatment. The diurnal to nocturnal SBP ratio in dipper-type hypertension cases decreased from 16. 7 ± 6. 1 % to 8. 3 ± 9. 8 % (p< 0. 05), whereas in non-dipper hypertension cases, it increased from 2. 3 ± 2. 9 % to 7. 7 ± 5. 1 % (p< 0. 01). The antihypertensive effect was minimal at 5. 0 hours after drug administration and it slowly recovered at a constant rate (2. 1 mm Hg/h) over 12 hours in dipper cases. The median 24 -hour changes in HR in the dipper and non-dipper cases were- 2. 3 / min and- 5. 4 /min, respectively.

40|$|Although dihydropyridines {{are widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of vasospasm, their effectiveness is questionable, suggesting that other voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) contribute to control of cerebrovascular tone. This study therefore investigated the role of dihydropyridine-insensitive VDCCs in cerebrovascular function. Using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, we found mRNA and protein for L-type (CaV 1. 2) and T-type (Ca V 3. 1 and CaV 3. 2) channels in adult rat basilar and middle cerebral arteries and their branches. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed both L-and T-type channels in smooth muscle cell (SMC) membranes. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that a high-voltage-activated calcium current, showing T-type channel kinetics and insensitivity to nifedipine and nimodipine, comprised 20 % of current in SMCs of the main arteries and 45 % of current in SMCs from branches. Both components were abolished by the T-type antagonists mibefradil, NNC 55 - 0396, and <b>efonidipine.</b> Although nifedipine completely blocked vasoconstriction in pressurized basilar arteries, a nifedipine-insensitive constriction was found in branches and this increased in magnitude as vessel size decreased. We conclude that a heterogeneous population of VDCCs contributes to cerebrovascular function, with dihydropyridine-insensitive channels having a larger role in smaller vessels.

However, the causal relationship between subthalamic bursts and PD symptoms and the ionic mechanisms underlying the bursts remain to be established. Here, we have shown that T-type Ca 2 + channels are necessary for subthalamic burst firing and that pharmacological blockade of T-type Ca 2 + channels reduces motor deficits in a rat model of PD. Ni 2 +, mibefradil, NNC 55 - 0396, and <b>efonidipine,</b> which inhibited T-type Ca 2 + currents in acutely dissociated STN neurons, but not Cd 2 + and nifedipine, which preferentially inhibited L-type or the other non–T-type Ca 2 + currents, effectively diminished burst activity in STN slices.

In the present study, we investigated {{the role of}} T-type calcium channels in mediating the Ang II–induced efferent arteriolar tone using the selective T-type calcium channel blocker mibefradil. Isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat kidneys were used for direct visualization of renal microcirculation. Administration of Ang II (0. 3 nmol/L) caused marked constriction of afferent (from 13. 560. 6 to 9. 260. 6 mm, P, 0. 01, n 56) and efferent (from 11. 561. 0 to 7. 460. 7 mm, P, 0. 01, n 55) arterioles. Mibefradil (1 mmol/L) dilated both vessels, with 82611 % and 7267 % reversal of afferent and efferent arterioles, respectively.

Inhibition of endogenous NRSF by an adenovirus-expressing dominant-negative NRSF (AD/dnNRSF) increased human CYP 11 B 2 and CYP 11 B 1 mRNA expression, leading to aldosterone and cortisol secretion in human adrenocortical (H 295 R) cells. In reporter gene experiments, NRSE suppressed luciferase reporters driven by CYP 11 B 2 and CYP 11 B 1 promoters and dnNRSF enhanced them. Moreover, cotransfection of dnNRSF increased luciferase activity of reporter genes after deletion or mutation of NRSE, suggesting that NRSF/NRSE regulates transcription of CYP 11 B 2 and CYP 11 B 1 genes indirectly. AD/dnNRSF augmented mRNA expression of rat CYP 11 B 2 and CYP 11 B 1 genes, neither of which contains a NRSE-like sequence in rat adrenal cells.

Section A summarised fundamental principles of the vasculature including an outline of the vascular system, vascular physiology, vascular cell biology, regulation of cytosolic Ca⁺⁺ and vascular pathophysiology. Section B utilised isolated vessels and wire myography to determine the effect of pre-treatment with L-type CCBs (verapamil and nifedipine) and combined L- and T-type CCBs (mibefradil and <b>efonidipine)</b> on endothelin- 1 (Et- 1) and K⁺-mediated contractile responses in large (rat aorta) and small (rat mesenteric and human subcutaneous) vessels. All four CCBs inhibited both Et- 1 and K⁺-mediated contractile responses to a similar extent in large rat vessels, however in rat microvessels the combined L- and T-channel blockers produced significantly greater inhibition of contraction than L-channel blockers alone. The significance of this differential T-channel effect in microvessels was further supported by: (1) demonstration of divergent CCB responses in human microvessels, (2) incremental inhibition of constrictor responses with a combined L- and T-CCB despite maximal L-channel blockade, (3) utilisation of structurally diverse CCBs with varied affinity for L- and T-channels, (6) use of pharmacodynamically and therapeutically appropriate CCB concentrations, (7) confirmation of contractile agonist independent responses, (8) consistent results even in the presence of an altered microvascular physiology in the form of chronic Et- 1 activation and (9) exclusion of an endothelium-dependent mechanism. Section C utilised the molecular techniques of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ratiometric western blotting to examine the distribution of the pore-forming subunits Caᵥ 1. 2, Caᵥ 3. 1 and 3. 2 in both large (rat aorta) and small (rat mesenteric) vessels. The PCR data was equivocal with no difference noted in the distribution of the L- and T-channels between large and small vessels. In contrast to this, quantitative western blot analysis revealed that while there is a similar distribution of the three subunits in the large vessel, there is a significantly increased expression of both T-channel pore-forming subunits in microvessels (Caᵥ 3. 1 : 112 ± 38 %*, Caᵥ 3. 2 : 168 ± 48 %* relative to L-channel expression, *p< 0. 05). Considered together these ‘functional’ and ‘structural’ studies indicate the important role of the Ca⁺⁺ T-channel in regulating contractile responses in the microvasculature and their therapeutic potential.
