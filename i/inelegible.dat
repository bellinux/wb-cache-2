5000|$|A poor {{start to}} the 2006-07 {{campaign}} saw the Dumfries side bottom of the league after 21 games. Inspired by the goals of January transfer window signing Stephen Dobbie, a twelve match unbeaten run led to the side avoiding relegation in the penultimate game of the season. A Scottish Cup run that included a replay penalty shoot-out victory over Dundee saw Queens make the quarter-finals before Hibernian won 2-1 at Palmerston.

50|$|When Reccesuinth died in 672 at his villa in Gerticos, his {{successor}} Wamba was elected on the spot, {{then went to}} Toledo to be anointed king by the bishop of Toledo, according to the procedures laid out in prior church councils. In 673, Wamba defeated a rebel duke named Paul, and held his victory parade in Toledo. The parade included ritual humiliation and scalping of the defeated Paul. Wamba carried out renovation works in Toledo in 674-675, marking these with inscriptions above the city gates that are no longer extant but were recorded in the eighth century. The Eleventh Council of Toledo was held in 675 under king Wamba. Wamba weakened {{the power of the}} bishop of Toledo by creating a new bishopric outside Toledo at the church of Saints Peter and Paul. This {{was one of the main}} churches of Toledo and was the church where Wamba was anointed king, and the church from which Visigothic kings departed for war after special ceremonies in which they were presented with a relic of the True Cross. By creating a new bishopric there, Wamba removed power over royal succession from the bishop of Toledo and granted it to the new bishop. The Twelfth Council of Toledo was held in 681 after Wamba's removal from office. Convinced that he was dying, Wamba had accepted a state of penitence that according to the decision of a previous church council, made him <b>inelegible</b> to remain king. The Twelfth Council, led by newly installed bishop Julian confirmed the validity of Wamba's removal from office and his succession by Ervig. The Twelfth Council eliminated the new bishopric that Wamba had created and returned the powers over succession to the bishop of Toledo.|$|E
30|$|At {{the third}} relapse, {{due to the}} lack of other {{treatment}} options and to the positive experience of (Vacirca et al. 2014), the patient underwent BR achieving a CR. At this time, BR had demonstrated to be an active regimen for indolent relapsed/refractory NHL (Rummel et al. 2005) and for patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (Vacirca et al. 2014), leading to a ORR of nearly 46 % with a median duration of response of 17.3  months with a favorable toxicity profile. Therefore it could represent an interesting treatment option for patients who are <b>inelegible</b> for a platinum based chemotherapy and consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation.|$|E
