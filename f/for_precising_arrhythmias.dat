40|$|Arrhythmia {{recurrence}} after catheter ablation {{of persistent}} atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is not uncommon}} and frequently requires repeat ablation procedures. 1 – 3 However, the <b>precise</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> that recurs depends on the strategy that was used at the original session. Patients who undergo sole pulmonary vein (PV) isolation usually manifest recurrent AF. Patients who undergo substrate modification, {{in the form of}} electrogram based 4 or linear ablation, 5 frequently develop atrial tachycardia (AT) either during or after the procedure. Whether these orga-nized arrhythmias represent underlying driver tachycardias that were responsible for maintaining AF or occur {{as a result of our}} intervention (that is, proarrhythmia) remains unresolved. Article see p 1059 If we are truly unmasking underlying drivers, then our abla-tion strategy may be validated because it allows us to map and potentially eliminate sources of AF, which otherwise coul...|$|R
