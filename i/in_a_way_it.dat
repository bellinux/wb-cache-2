5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

Sivanath Sastri was amongst the committee members. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> was forerunner of the Indian National Congress.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{initiatives}} northeastern Florida prospered economically <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> never did under Spanish administration. Furthermore, the British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This would be the first introduction of much of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today including trial by jury, habeas corpus and county-based government. Neither East Florida nor West Florida would send any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence. Florida would remain a Loyalist stronghold {{for the duration of the}} American Revolution.|$|E

Problems involving the usage of real boar caused the producers to use computer-generated replacements and shots that suggested the animals' presence.

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> never gleamed before. I {{think a lot of}} people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|Historian Daniel Silliman {{has argued}} that, {{whatever}} the thieves' intention, the act puts {{the culture of}} Christmas in a different light. [...] "Baby Jesus thieves literally take the Christ out of Christmas," [...] Silliman writes. [...] "When they do, it becomes apparent that the sacred object is also a piece of property, protected by the law that protects property and this whole apparatus that defends Christmas: fences and lights, tracking devices and private security companies, patrolling police and the courts. The commercialization of Christmas is visible here <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> might not be, otherwise. That’s {{the power of the}} joke." ...|$|E
500|$|Flaming Pie is {{the tenth}} solo studio album by Paul McCartney {{under his own}} name, first {{released}} in 1997. His first studio album in over four years, it was mostly recorded following McCartney's involvement in the highly successful Beatles Anthology project. The album was recorded in several locations over two years, 1995 and 1997, featuring two songs dating from 1992. The album featured several of McCartney's family members and friends, most notably McCartney's son, James McCartney. In Flaming Pies liner notes, McCartney said: [...] " [...] reminded me of The Beatles' standards and the standards that we reached with the songs. So <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was a refresher course that set the framework for this album." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he resumed, [...] "if {{you agree}} to my proposition, we'll get a lawyer to fix <b>it</b> up. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it's</b> some relief to know Helen has enough, and now I'm {{going to talk to}} her." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Book of the Stranger" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. He joined the series as a director in the sixth season. He also directed the previous episode, [...] "Oathbreaker". In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's in front of you, and not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking forward to it — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect." [...] The operative word was fear. Fear of the unknown. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The sewer {{processing}} plant scenes were shot at Iona Island Sewage Treatment plant in Canada. The sewer scenes were {{shot in a}} pit on the show's stage, with Carter using his father, {{who worked as a}} construction worker, as a consultant on how to build it. As no ship was available for filming the opening scenes in the Russian freighter, a hydro sub station in Surrey, British Columbia was adapted into an engine room. Carter had to fight with Fox's broadcast standards department over the scene where a victim vomits up a flukeworm while in the shower. James Wong described it as the grossest piece of television ever put on the air. As Gillian Anderson's pregnancy was getting more apparent, the producers started to shoot Scully's scenes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> would be disguised, with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing".|$|E
500|$|The Civil War, and {{the period}} {{following}} it, saw a general flowering of American art, literature and music. Amateur musical ensembles of this era {{can be seen}} as the birth of American popular music. Music author David Ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining [...] "the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique, eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression. If it was vocal music, the words would be in English, despite the snobs who declared English an unsingable language. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> was part of the entire awakening of America that happened after the Civil War, a time in which American painters, writers, and 'serious' composers addressed specifically American themes." [...] During this period the roots of blues, gospel, jazz, and country music took shape; in the 20th century, these became the core of American popular music, which further evolved into the styles like rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and hip hop music.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was common}} {{knowledge}} that the Old Vic triumvirate had been dismissed, they refused to be drawn on the matter in public, and Olivier even arranged to play a final London season with the company in 1949, as RichardIII, Sir Peter Teazle, and Chorus in his own production of Anouilh's Antigone with Leigh in the title role. After that, {{he was free to}} embark on a new career as an actor-manager. In partnership with Binkie Beaumont he staged the English premiere of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, with Leigh in the central role of Blanche DuBois. The play was condemned by most critics, but the production was a considerable commercial success, and led to Leigh's casting as Blanche in the 1951 film version. Gielgud, who was a devoted friend of Leigh's, doubted whether Olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine: [...] " [...] was so very like her, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> must have been a most dreadful strain to do it night after night. She would be shaking and white and quite distraught at the end of it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Today" [...] was {{the first}} song Corgan wrote for Siamese Dream. Corgan said, [...] "The day after I wrote 'Today,' my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit,' and I guess <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> was." [...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E

500|$|Vaughn said he {{shot the}} film <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> resembled the {{productions}} of the 1960s, with [...] "very traditional framing, and camera movement when {{it needs to}} move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang", and using the anamorphic format [...] "to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the James Bond films". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did [...] "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" [...] of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, [...] "keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing." [...] The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who {{were responsible for the}} end credits and tried to do something that [...] "could be done with traditional optical". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the Bond films.|$|E
500|$|After the reveal of the film's full cast, many {{outlets and}} fans began {{referring}} to the film as [...] "Avengers 2.5", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, {{and the fact that}} the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier. In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> could play out".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Alexander of Television Without Pity {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–". Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode the [...] "highlight" [...] of the season. In particular, {{he was pleased}} with the way Pam and Jim's strife was portrayed; he wrote that [...] "tonight the ... drama felt earned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> hadn't previous" [...] and that [...] "Jim and Pam were used well". Houx was also {{extremely}} pleased with Odenkirk's performance, writing that, [...] "Even if Odenkirk is doing an impression of Steve Carell's character, not only is it great for the non-comedy comedy, but you can totally see a parallel universe where Odenkirk played Michael Scott and nailed it as well as Carell did." [...] He concluded that, with Odenkirk's presences, [...] "In about twenty seconds this became the best episode of the season." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend gave a moderately positive review, noting that the entry [...] "dealt with some of the ongoing issues among the staff of Dunder Mifflin. With the exception of a pretty great guest appearance by Breaking Bads Bob Odenkirk (Better call Saul!) and some interesting developments in the relationship department for some of the characters, the episode was fairly standard. And then came the very end, which offered an interesting reveal and a teaser of something big." ...|$|E
