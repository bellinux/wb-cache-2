Jack and Ridikolous have a meeting, resulting in the wine becoming the corporate sponsor of the Source Awards, which is being produced by Ridikolous. To further mend things with Tracy, Jack proposes to let Tracy host the award show. This backfires when Tracy refuses to host it in fear that he will <b>get</b> <b>shot,</b> but Jack still sees it as the only way to work things out with Ridikolous.|$|E
25|$|Prior to an International Labour Day celebration, {{government}} officials concoct a false flag assassination plot to foment {{public support for}} legislation of the National Security Law. They hire two petty gangsters to execute the plot: Hairy (Zerisawa Courtney Wu), a middle-aged low-level triad member, and Peter (Peter Chan), an immigrant from India. While the two argue over who should fire the gun, {{the director of the}} Liaison Office decides that the leaders of both the TMD and the Fortune Parties are to <b>get</b> <b>shot</b> with real bullets, so as to instigate greater panic in the territory. Misbelieving they will get paid and flee to India afterwards, both Hairy and Peter attempt the assassination but are killed instantly on scene by the police. Later, the government identifies the perpetrators as terrorists and restates the significance of the upcoming legislation.|$|E
25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer in order {{to make sure that the}} digital raindrops hit all the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to <b>get</b> <b>shot</b> and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E

25|$|Fair City enjoys {{consistently}} high official viewing statistics. The viewing {{figures for}} each episode are around 500,000 – 600,000 and rise to 700,000 {{or more for}} specials. The soap is hugely popular with viewers outside of Dublin. It attracts the highest audiences for any drama on Irish television, beating stalwart British imports such as Coronation Street, Emmerdale and EastEnders in the ratings.

The show was not an instant ratings success in {{the first couple of}} seasons, but became more favourable in subsequent seasons, when there were strong story lines centring on the Doyle and Molloy families. The serial was not initially a critical success, but it has received acclaim recently for its more credible, sophisticated and psychological stories under executive producer Brigie de Courcy.|$|E
25|$|Chad is devastated when Lexie reveals she has {{cancer and}} Stefano is murdered. Chad is furious {{to learn that}} Will is a suspect and after Melanie tries to defend Will, they have a huge fight, and she presumably skips town. Chad mourns Lexie's passing all alone.

When told of Taylor's death by Ron Fenton, Clough apparently did not speak, put the phone down on him and cried heavily. He also, while very upset, made a phone call to the Taylor family. Clough attended the funeral eleven days later and dedicated his 1994 autobiography to Taylor saying [...] "To Peter. Still miss you badly.

500|$|... "It's Too Late" [...] was a {{commentary}} on nostalgic fashions and made reference to actress Diana Dors in a lyric rebuking drug use. According to Antonia, the song criticized indifferent, decadent people who cannot, as Johansen sang, [...] " [...] New York français". On [...] "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", he scolded those who abuse love, wanting to [...] "kick it on the floor" [...] and [...] "beat it like a scatter rug". [...] "Puss 'n' Boots" [...] was titled after an illustrated, podoerotic magazine sold in adult book stores. Johansen said the song was about shoe fetishism, [...] "or as Arthur [...] observed, it's about 'the woofers in relationship with the woofee'." [...] Its lyrics depicted adversities faced by the protagonist, [...] "Little Rhinestone Target", {{as he tried to}} change his name in pursuit of his shoe fetish before the music ended with a gunshot, a sound effect inspired by the Olympics' 1958 song [...] "Western Movies". Willis interpreted a feminist subtext in the song, citing the lyrics [...] "sometimes you gotta get away someway / and now you're walkin' just like you're ten feet tall...

(He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men." [...] Madame Nhu added, [...] "ou open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it." ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Patton {{entered the}} {{receiving}} tent of the hospital, {{speaking to the}} injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may <b>get</b> <b>shot</b> and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E

500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son <b>get</b> <b>shot</b> in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there {{you have to play}} with your teeth or else you <b>get</b> <b>shot.</b> There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and {{for the next two years}} Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E
500|$|At the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May 1941, [...] was sunk, {{probably}} by Bismarck. The hydrophones on Prinz Eugen detected a foreign ship to port at 05:00. The Germans sighted the smokestacks of two ships at 05:45, {{which the first}} gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider initially reported as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them to be battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port was their precise identity revealed. The British ships started firing at the German task force at 05:53. Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first, but due to the reversed German battle order, Hood opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead. The German task force was {{still waiting for the}} order to commence firing, which Admiral Lütjens did not give immediately. Two minutes later, after multiple inquiries by Schneider, [...] ""?

It is likely that one [...] shell struck somewhere between Hood's mainmast and 'X' turret aft of the mast. A huge jet of flame burst out from Hood from the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of Hood, and she sank in only three minutes, her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water.|$|E

500|$|Oberleutnant Johannes Steinhoff {{flying with}} Bf 109Ds of 10.(Nacht)./JG 26 took off escorted by a Rotte from II./JG 77. At 13:30, they {{attacked}} one group after the anti-aircraft fire lifted. The Bf 109s claimed seven bombers, with Steinhoff claiming two. The first kill was credited to Unteroffizier Heolmayr. At 13:40, a Rotte of Bf 110s from ZG 26, led by Hauptmann Wolfgang Falck, claimed four bombers. Falck's aircraft was severely damaged, {{forcing him to}} disengage. Falck managed to glide back to base and make a [...] "dead-stick" [...] landing without power. Unteroffizier Fresia also made two claims. Fresia's second victim was Flying Officer Allison. No. 149 Squadron Leader Harris came under attack from a Bf 109 piloted by Oberleutnant Johann Fuhrmann. Fuhrmann failed to hit the bomber in beam attacks. He then tried a stern attack, against earlier advice, only to <b>get</b> <b>shot</b> down. Fuhrmann managed to land in the sea {{a few hundred yards}} from the island of Spiekeroog.

During the battle a Bf 110 piloted by Oberleutnant Gordon Gollob shot down and killed Squadron Leader Archibald Guthrie, of No. 9 Squadron. Hue-Williams, Squadron Leader of No. 37 Squadron was also shot down, possibly by Hauptmann Reinecke. Soon afterward, the Germans suffered a casualty when Leutnant Roman Stiegler crashed into the sea in pursuit of Flying Officer Lemon. Stiegler was killed. At the same time, Jagdgruppe 101 claimed two more bombers. Bf 110s from ZG 76 had also attacked the bombers claiming five more.|$|E
