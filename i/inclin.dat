(1999) have provided predictions regarding optimal bidder behavior in rst price auctions when the ranking of valuations is common knowledge. Compared {{with the standard}} rst price auction model, bidders should bid more aggressively. Therefore, the seller's expected revenue should increase. Low value bidders should bid more aggressively than high value bidders. This should reduce eciency. The experiment evaluates these comparative statics predictions. This evaluation is conducted using the dual market bidding procedure where the same two bidders have to bid for the same item in two markets under dierent information conditions. Experimental results indicate that while low value bidders are inclined to bid more aggressively after information about the ranking of valuations is revealed, high value bidders are <b>inclin</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} density waves in {{granular}} material, investigated both experimentally and numerically. When granular material falls {{through a long}} narrow pipe one observes recurrent clogging. The kinetic energy of the falling particles increases up to a characteristic threshold corresponding to the onset of recurrent clogging and density waves of no definite wavelength. The distances between regions of high density depend strongly on the initial conditions. They vary irregularly without any characteristic time and length scale. The particle [...] flow was investigated using 2 D Molecular Dynamics simulations. Experimental investigations lead to equivalent results. PACS. numbers: 05. 60, 47. 25, 46. 10, 02. 60 The astonishing effects observed in moving granular material have been subjects of interest for at least 200 years. Examples of such effects are the angle of repose [1] [2] size segregation [3] [...] [5], heap formation on vibrating media [6] [...] [9], density waves [10] and granular flow down <b>inclin</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Most Fresnel lenses for {{projection}} {{systems are}} made from Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Such lenses, e. g. for LCD- projectors, are flat discs whereas one surface is plane and the other microstructured. Special coatings are necessary to reduce stray light and 'hot spots' in the projected image, finally. Plasma-ion Assisted Deposition {{has been applied to}} realize dielectric multilayers on PMMA. Additionally, a low pressure plasma pre-treatment has been carried out as the first step of the coating process which inducing an irreversible modification of surface composition that leads to excellent adhesion conditions for coating. The special problem for coating the microstructured surface is the <b>inclin</b> ation angle of the small Fresnel facets which increases from the center to the outer area of microstructured lens. Consequently, the vapor incidence angle changes in the same way. Another problem is to keep the temperature at the polymer surface low during coating process. Thin microst ructured polymer lenses show lower dimensional stability compared to flat or compact samples. Several coating designs have been invested to get a uniform moderate antireflective effect and in result an optimized light impression for the observer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the wind energy potential for electricity generation in the northwestern coast of Senegal. The wind characteristics and wind energy potential in eight sites (Kayar, Potou, Gandon, Sakhor, Sine Moussa Abdou, Botla, Dara Andal and Nguebeul) are analyzed using the wind speed data collected during a period of one year for each site. The annual mean wind speed and the power density were computed. Results obtained show that the annual mean wind speed varies between 5. 28 m/s in Potou (at 30 m) and 3. 10 m/s in Dara Andal (at 7 m). The corresponding power density varies between 120. 01 W/m 2 and 30. 05 W/m 2 respectively. A technical assessment of electricity generation from three big wind turbines and from three small wind turbines was carried out. Results show that the highest capacity factor was 39 % observed in Sokhar for the wind turbine Yellow- Sand, whereas the lowest capacity factor was 5 % in Gandon for the wind turbine Ecotecnia 80. The highest output energy was 4, 517, 900 k Wh/year in Sokhar for the wind turbine Repower, while the lowest output energy was 312 kWh/year observed in Gandon for the wind turbine <b>Inclin</b> 600...|$|E

Nowadays, managerial techniques, which <b>inclin</b> to force manipulative ways to get profit {{as much as possible}} without paying attention on the genuiness of human interactions, are assume less appropriate anymore. Counselling techniques, which focus on the genuiness and sincerity, are assumed to be more humane. Therefore, counselling approaches need to be implemented in industria world. Although it Is needed as a necessity in Industrialworld, the fact st shows {{that there is not a}} lot of companies plan to give counsellingservic with professional counsellors. On the other sides, the managers, trainer supervisors, and experts in human resources development do not hav enough knowledge and art in counselling yet. Themastery of counselling skill have realized as a difficult and complex thing because basic principal of it is not mastered. Counselling is not a complex thing because basic principal of it is not mastered. Counselling is not a plain knowledge wit mechanical proceduresbut it is about theart of helping. Because of that it is important to bring awareness to the industrialist to employ the professional counsellor to give counselling form now on. While the counsellors have to raise their professional competency so that the public trust toward their profession will grow rapidly. This challenge must be aware by the counsellors, moreover in the globalisation era, which the flow of the goods and merit from a country to the other countries cannot be prevented by the protective policies...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} tilt table incline and knee flexion angle {{on the degree of}} weight bearing and forces exerted across the supporting straps. DESIGN: A quantitative and exploratory study to {{investigate the}} effects of a mechanical procedure. SETTING: Physiotherapy gymnasium. SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy subjects (9 female, 3 male) aged 22 - 45 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects stood on a tilt table, on two occasions, with simulated contractures of 10 degrees and 40 degrees knee flexion. Nine tilt angles, between 10 degrees and 90 degrees, were maintained for 1 minute each in random order. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Force was recorded from single-point load cells placed under the feet, and at knee and chest straps. RESULTS: The degree of simulated knee contracture (10 degrees or 40 degrees) influenced the distribution of forces at different recording sites. Weight bearing increased with table incline and was significantly less with the 40 degrees than the 10 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 001). Conversely, forces across the knee straps were systemically higher with the 40 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 0001). The effects were accentuated by greater body weight. Forces across the chest strap also increased with tilt and were significantly larger with the 40 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between table incline, angle of knee flexion and distribution of forces generated during tilt table standing have been quantified and described. Standing with flexed knees involved less weight bearing under the feet and greater force exerted across the supporting straps. These effects were more pronounced at the higher knee angle and with greater body weight, and could be modified by reducing table <b>inclin...</b>|$|E

A Taleby Robert Burns When chapman billies {{leave the}} street, And drouthy neebors neebors meet, As market-days are wearing late, And folk begin to tak the gate; While we sit bousin, at the nappy, And gettin fou and unco happy, We think na on the lang Scots miles, The mosses, waters, slaps, and stiles, That lie {{between us and}} our hame, Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame, Gathering her brows like {{gathering}} storm, Nursing her wrath to keep it warm. This truth fand honest Tam o 2 ̆ 7 Shanter, As he frae Ayr ae night did canter: (Auld Ayr, wham ne 2 ̆ 7 er a town surpasses, For honest men and bonie lasses.) O Tam! had 2 ̆ 7 st thou but been sae wise As taen thy ain wife Kate 2 ̆ 7 s advice! She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, A bletherin, blusterin, drunken blellum; That frae November till October, Ae market-day thou was na sober; That ilka melder wi 2 ̆ 7 the miller, Thou sat as lang as thou had siller; That ev 2 ̆ 7 ry naig was ca 2 ̆ 7 d a shoe on, The smith and thee gat roarin fou on; That at the Lord 2 ̆ 7 s house, ev 2 ̆ 7 n on Sunday, Thou drank wi 2 ̆ 7 Kirkton Jean till Monday. She prophesied, that, late or soon, Thou would be found deep drown 2 ̆ 7 d in Doon; Ot catch 2 ̆ 7 d wi 2 ̆ 7 warlocks in the mirk, By Alloway 2 ̆ 7 s auld haunted kirk. Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet, To think how mony counsels sweet, How mony lengthen 2 ̆ 7 d sage advices, The husband frae the wife despises! But to our tale:—Ae market night, Tam had got planted unco right, Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely, Wi 2 ̆ 7 reaming swats that drank divinely; And at his elbow, Souter Johnie, His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony: Tam lo 2 ̆ 7 ed him like a vera brither; They had been fou for weeks thegither. The night drave on wi 2 ̆ 7 sangs and clatter; And ay the ale was growing better: The landlady and Tam grew gracious Wi 2 ̆ 7 secret favours, sweet, and precious: The souter tauld his queerest stories; The landlord 2 ̆ 7 s laugh was ready chorus: The storm without might rair and rustle, Tam did na mind the storm a whistle. Care, mad {{to see a man}} sae happy, E 2 ̆ 7 en drown 2 ̆ 7 d himsel amang the nappy: As bees flee hame wi 2 ̆ 7 lades o 2 ̆ 7 treasure, The minutes wing 2 ̆ 7 d their way wi 2 ̆ 7 pleasure; Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious, O 2 ̆ 7 er a 2 ̆ 7 the ills o 2 ̆ 7 life victorious! But pleasures are like poppies spread, You seize the flow 2 ̆ 7 r, its bloom is shed; Or like the snow falls in the river, A moment white—then melts forever; Or like the borealis race, That flit ere you can point their place; Or like the rainbow 2 ̆ 7 s lovely form Evanishing amid the storm. Nae man can tether time or tide: The hour approaches Tam maun ride,— That hour, o 2 ̆ 7 night 2 ̆ 7 s black arch the key-stane That dreary hour he mounts his beast in; And sic a night he taks the road in, As ne 2 ̆ 7 er poor sinner was abroad in. The wind blew as 2 ̆ 7 twad blawn its last; The rattling show 2 ̆ 7 rs rose on the blast; The speedy gleams the darkness swallow 2 ̆ 7 d; Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellow 2 ̆ 7 d: That night, a child might understand, The Deil had business on his hand. Weel mounted on his grey mare, Meg,— A better never lifted leg,— Tam skelpit on thro 2 ̆ 7 dub and mire, Despising wind and rain and fire; Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet, Whiles crooning o 2 ̆ 7 er some auld Scots sonnet, Whiles glowrin round wi 2 ̆ 7 prudent cares, Lest bogles catch him unawares. Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry. By this time he was cross the ford, Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor 2 ̆ 7 d; And past the birks and meikle stane, Whare drucken Charlie brak 2 ̆ 7 s neckbane: And thro 2 ̆ 7 the whins, and by the cairn, Whare hunters fand the murder 2 ̆ 7 d bairn; And near the thorn, aboon the well, Whare Mungo 2 ̆ 7 s mither hang 2 ̆ 7 d hersel. Before him Doon pours all his floods; The doubling storm roars thro 2 ̆ 7 the woods; The lightnings flash from pole to pole, Near and more near the thunders roll; When, glimmering thro 2 ̆ 7 the groaning trees, Kirk-Alloway seem 2 ̆ 7 d in a bleeze: Thro 2 ̆ 7 ilka bore the beams were glancing, And loud resounded mirth and dancing. Inspiring bold John Barleycorn! What dangers thou can 2 ̆ 7 st make us scorn! Wi 2 ̆ 7 tippenny we fear nae evil; Wi 2 ̆ 7 usquebae we 2 ̆ 7 ll face the devil!

Warlocks and witches in a dance; Nae cotillion brent-new frae France, But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels Put life and mettle in their heels. A winnock bunker in the east, There sat Auld Nick in shape o 2 ̆ 7 beast: A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large, To gie them music was his charge; He screw 2 ̆ 7 d the pipes and gart them skirl, Till roof and rafters a 2 ̆ 7 did dirl. — Coffins stood round like open presses, That shaw 2 ̆ 7 d the dead in their last dresses; And by some devilish cantraip sleight Each in its cauld hand held a light, By which heroic Tam was able To note upon the haly table A murderer 2 ̆ 7 s banes in gibbet airns; Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen 2 ̆ 7 d bairns; A thief, new-cutted frae the rape— Wi 2 ̆ 7 his last gasp his gab did gape; Five tomahawks, wi 2 ̆ 7 blude red-rusted; Five scimitars, wi 2 ̆ 7 murder crusted; A garter, which a babe had strangled; A knife, a father 2 ̆ 7 s throat had mangled, Whom his ain son o 2 ̆ 7 life bereft— The grey hairs yet stack to the heft; Wi 2 ̆ 7 mair o 2 ̆ 7 horrible and awfu 2 ̆ 7, Which ev 2 ̆ 7 n to name wad be unlawfu 2 ̆ 7. As Tammie glowr 2 ̆ 7 d, amaz 2 ̆ 7 d and curious, The mirth and fun grew fast and furious: The piper loud and louder blew, The dancers quick and quicker flew; They reel 2 ̆ 7 d, they set, they cross 2 ̆ 7 d, they cleekit Till ilka carlin swat and reekit And coost her duddies to the wark And linket at it in her sark! Now Tam, O Tam! had thae been queans, A 2 ̆ 7 plump and strapping in their teens! Their sarks, instead o 2 ̆ 7 creeshie flannen, Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!— Thir breeks o 2 ̆ 7 mine, my only pair, That ance were plush, o 2 ̆ 7 gude blue hair, I wad hae gien them aff y hurdies, For ae blink o 2 ̆ 7 the bonie burdies! But wither 2 ̆ 7 d beldams, auld and droll, Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal, Lowping and flinging on a crummock. I wonder didna turn thy stomach. But Tam ken 2 ̆ 7 d what was what fu 2 ̆ 7 brawlie; There was ae winsom wench and walie, That night enlisted in the core (Lang after ken 2 ̆ 7 d on Carrick shore. For mony a beast to dead she shot, And perish 2 ̆ 7 d mony a bonie boat, And shook baith meikle corn and bear, And kept the country-side in fear); Her cutty sark o 2 ̆ 7 Paisley harn, That while a lassie she had worn, In longitude tho 2 ̆ 7 sorely scanty, It was her best, and she was vauntie. Ah! little ken 2 ̆ 7 d thy reverend grannie, That sark she coft for her wee Nannie, Wi 2 ̆ 7 twa pund Scots (2 ̆ 7 twas a 2 ̆ 7 her riches), Wad ever grac 2 ̆ 7 d a dance of witches! But here my Muse her wing maun cow 2 ̆ 7 r, Sic flights are far beyond her pow 2 ̆ 7 r; To sing how Nannie lap and flang, (A souple jad she was and strang), And how Tam stood like ane bewitch 2 ̆ 7 d, And thought his very een enrich 2 ̆ 7 d; Even Satan glowr 2 ̆ 7 d and fidg 2 ̆ 7 d fu 2 ̆ 7 fain, And hotch 2 ̆ 7 d and blew wi 2 ̆ 7 might and main: Till first ae caper, syne anither, Tam tint his reason a 2 ̆ 7 thegither, And roars out, 2 ̆ 2 Weel done, Cutty-sark! 2 ̆ 2 And in an instant all was dark: And scarcely had he Maggie rallied, When out the hellish legion sallied. As bees bizz out wi 2 ̆ 7 angry fyke, When plundering herds assail their byke; As open pussie 2 ̆ 7 s mortal foes, When, pop! she starts before their nose; As eager runs the market-crowd, When 2 ̆ 2 Catch the thief! 2 ̆ 2 resounds aloud; So Maggie runs, the witches follow, Wi 2 ̆ 7 mony an eldritch skriech and hollo. Ah, Tam! ah, Tam! thou 2 ̆ 7 ll get thy fairin! In hell they 2 ̆ 7 ll roast thee like a herrin! In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin! Kate soon will be a woefu 2 ̆ 7 woman! Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg, And win the key-stane of the brig: There at them thou thy tail may toss, A running stream they dare na cross. But ere the key-stane she could make, The fient a tail she had to shake! For Nannie far before the rest, Hard upon noble Maggie prest, And flew at Tam wi 2 ̆ 7 furious ettle; But little wist she Maggie 2 ̆ 7 s mettle— Ae spring brought aff her master hale But left behind her ain grey tail: The carlin claught her by the rump, And left poor Maggie scarce a stump.
