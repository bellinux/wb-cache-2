In 1991, she moved to Oslo {{with her husband and}} a daughter until she was tracked down by Norwegian police in 1994 and handed over to Germany in 1995. The arrest was followed by a strong debate over how to deal with <b>foreign</b> <b>criminals.</b> She was <b>sentenced</b> to 12 years for her various crimes and was released after three years due to ill health. She was the first woman to be sentenced twice for such a crime. Andrawes has since resided in Oslo with her husband, Palestinian academic and human rights activist Dr. Ahmad Abu Matar, and their daughter.|$|R
40|$|Deportation, and {{immigration}} control generally, are held not {{to enjoy the}} protections of article 6 ECHR (right {{to a fair trial}} in a civil or criminal matter) or article 7, which outlaws retrospective criminal penalties. However, the Immigration Act 2014 declaration that ‘deportation of a <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> “is” in the public interest’ has opened the way to retrospective measures against <b>foreign</b> <b>criminals,</b> even long residents with leave to remain. The Act’s formal limits on access to article 8 ECHR and curtailed appeal rights for <b>foreign</b> <b>criminals</b> mean that the ‘effective remedy’ available to ‘aliens’ under article 13 barely applies. This paper argues the need to consider how the current position measures up to the standards of certainty and finality formally protected by the ancient concepts of double jeopardy and res judicata, and consider whether a blanket exclusion of immigration issues from articles 6 and 7 can still be justified. I examine how autrefois convict and autrefois acquit may be applicable where the <b>criminal</b> <b>sentence</b> discussed but did not include a recommendation for deportation, and how res judicata may be applicable where a <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> has already won an appeal on art 8 grounds, or, by analogy, where leave to remain has been granted subsequent to the criminal conviction. I look at whether deportation appeals for unconvicted suspects facing unsupported police evidence amount to a ‘determination of a criminal charge’ despite being neither a criminal or civil trial, and whether deportation as a result of such must amount to a ‘penalty’, so as to engage articles 6 and 7 ECHR...|$|R

40|$|The {{advancement}} of the justification of <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences.</b> Research into {{the effectiveness of the}} PROMIS model In response to both laymen and professionals criticizing the obscurity of <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences,</b> the Dutch judiciary, in 2004, started a large-scale project called Promis. The aim of the project was to improve the justification of judicial decisions and thus advance communication between the criminal judge, the people concerned and, finally, the general public. To achieve this goal, the initiators of Promis developed a model. The positive evaluations of the project did, however, provide no clear indications whether the justifications of <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> that were presented after the introduction of the model, provided more insight in the argumentation for the type of punishment and the length of the punishment that were imposed than the ones preceding Promis. This uncertainty induced us to try and ascertain, by means of a comparison of corpora, whether the argumentation in <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> has indeed been improved. The results of the research are presented in this contribution...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{official}} reports, {{the academic}} {{literature and the}} media have dedicated increased attention to <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> groups in Italy. The actual nature of <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> organisations, and particularly their comparability to Italian mafias, is still under researched. This study explores {{the application of the}} offence of mafia-type association (Article 416 -bis of the <b>Criminal</b> Code) to <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> organisations. It analyses the theoretical applicability of the offence as well as statistics and jurisprudence of relevant cases. Results show that the offence of mafia-type association is theoretically applicable to <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> groups. However, the number of cases is very low. This is due to two concurring factors: <b>foreign</b> <b>criminal</b> groups do not always have the same characteristics of domestic mafias (stability, continuity, use of the mafia method); the evidentiary difficulties have brought the prosecution and the courts to apply other offences, carrying high penalties but without the need to prove the mafia method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a research}} based on analyzing <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> on <b>criminal</b> trials on organized crime activity in Sicily pronounced from 2000 through 2006. Large <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> related dataset collection activity in Italy is severely constrained {{for various reasons}} such as difficulty of data collection at the courthouses, unavailability of data in digital format, and classification criteria used in the public archives. Thus, in general, judicial statistics suffer from lack of reliability and informativeness. The objective {{of this research is}} to analyze the text of <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> in a revisable and verifiable way, so that information is extracted on the trial leading to the sentence, the socioeconomic environment in which the relevant events occurred, and the differences between the various districts conducting the trials. The purpose is to elaborate a tool of automated analysis of the text of the sentences that is generalizable to other areas of jurisprudence, and, outside of jurisprudence, to other temporal and geographical contexts. The 726 <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> that have been converted into text files have been pronounced at all judicial levels in the four Sicilian districts for mafia-related crimes. This research is relevant because, {{for the first time in}} Italy, we aim to empirically describe the juridical response to the phenomenon of organized crime, by using a large and extendable database of <b>criminal</b> <b>sentences</b> that can be analyzed with data mining techniques, rather than deriving general conclusions from a focused small set of sentences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Legal {{representation}} {{plays an}} important role in <b>criminal</b> <b>sentencing</b> decisions. China has recently stipulated a mandatory legal representation clause for all offenders facing capital charges in its Criminal Procedural Law (1996). This study uses data generated from criminal court case documents involving three serious violent crimes: murder, intentional assault, and robbery. All these crimes carry a maximum of sentence of death. The study examines whether and under what conditions legal representation has an effect on <b>criminal</b> <b>sentencing</b> decisions in China. While the overall multi-regression model did not find that having a legal representation significantly reduces the <b>criminal</b> <b>sentence,</b> a further analysis of the types of criminal defense reveals that sentencing decisions are significantly correlated with the type of defense, and in particular, the court’s appraisal of the defense. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R
