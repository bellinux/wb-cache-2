In 2003, a CAS ruling against Mühlegg allowed the International Olympic Committee to strip him of his other medals. Norwegians Frode Estil and Thomas Alsgaard, who had originally tied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> heat for silver, were promoted to gold, while fourth-placed Per Elofsson was promoted to bronze.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs. In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays eggs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E

5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} War of Knives, the United States and France {{were engaged in}} a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the Quasi-War. In late December 1799 the American armed {{schooner}} Experiment was escorting under convoy the brig Daniel and Mary and the schooners Sea Flower, Mary, and Washington to prevent their capture by French privateers. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> calm off {{the north side of the}} present-day Haitian island of Gonâve, in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy becalmed, Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack and seize the American vessels.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E
5|$|A five team group stage then followed, {{in which}} each team played the others once. Manchester City were drawn with Twente, Schalke 04, Racing de Santander and Paris Saint-Germain. City topped the group, after wins against Twente and Schalke, a draw with Paris Saint-Germain and a defeat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> rubber in Santander. The {{knockout}} stages then resumed, with a visit to F.C. Copenhagen in freezing conditions. City took the lead twice but could only draw 2–2. The home leg was more comfortable, and ended in a 2–1 victory. Another Danish club, Aalborg, awaited in the next round. Both matches finished 2–0 to the home side, and the tie was decided by a penalty shootout, which Manchester City won. City then faced Hamburger SV, in their first European quarter-final since 1979. The away leg was played first, and started exceptionally well for Manchester City, as Stephen Ireland scored after just 35 seconds. However, Hamburg soon equalised, and won the match 3–1. A difficult task in the home leg soon became even harder, when Hamburg scored an away goal early in the match. City scored twice, the first by Elano, who also hit the woodwork on two occasions with free-kicks. However, City could not produce the third goal that would have taken the tie into extra time.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{made his}} Davis Cup for Switzerland {{debut in the}} World Group 1st Round against Italy in 1999 at 17 years of age. In his first match he {{defeated}} Davide Sanguinetti in four sets and recorded a second singles victory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> rubber two days later as Switzerland advanced to the World Group Quarterfinals. In the Quarterfinals Federer, who was still 17 years old, suffered his first Davis Cup loss when he was defeated by Belgian Christophe Van Garsse in five sets. The Swiss team {{would go on to}} lose the rubber 3–2. A year later, Federer competed in his first Davis Cup doubles rubber where he teamed with countryman Lorenzo Manta to defeat Australians Wayne Arthurs and Sandon Stolle in four sets. Despite the doubles victory, Federer lost both singles rubbers to Mark Philippoussis and Lleyton Hewitt which saw Switzerland sent to the World Group Playoffs {{for the first time in}} Federer's career. He would return for the playoffs in July 2000 and led Switzerland to a 5–0 win over Belarus by recording wins in singles and doubles.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, England {{participated in}} both the Women's Cricket World Cup, and the inaugural Women's World Twenty20. Taylor was {{identified}} as one of England's key players in {{a preview of the}} tournament, and she set up victory for England in their opening match against Sri Lanka with her eighth ODI century, her third in successive World Cup matches against Sri Lanka. She asserted her dominance once more in the second match, against India, scoring quicker than a run a ball for her 69 not out, to help England chase down a modest total in under 40 overs. Not required to bat against Pakistan, and dismissed for 19 against New Zealand, Taylor helped secure England's place in the final with a rapid 65 runs, including 2 sixes and 6 fours, against the West Indies. In England's final match of the group stages, Taylor top-scored with 49 runs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> rubber loss against Australia: Australia could not qualify for the final, and England were already through. In the final, having restricted New Zealand to 166, England were ahead of the required rate early. An early loss of wicket brought Taylor to the crease, and she played an attacking innings of 21, including 4 fours, before being bowled. England won the match by four wickets, to become ODI world champions. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, having made 324 runs, and her batting average was the highest amongst batsmen with over 100 runs. She was one of five England players to be named in the team of the tournament.|$|E
