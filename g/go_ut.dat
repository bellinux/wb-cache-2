6000|$|This {{day is a}} grand day for Winchester. They elect the mayor. It {{was indeed}} high time the place should {{have some sort of}} excitement. There was nothing going on--all asleep. Not an old maid's sedan {{returning}} from a card party; and if any old women have got tipsy at christenings, they have not exposed themselves in the street. The first night, though, of our arrival here there was a slight uproar took place at about ten of the clock. We heard distinctly a noise patting down the street, as of a walking-cane of the good old dowager breed; and a little minute after we heard a less voice observe, [...] "What a noise the ferril made--it must be loose." [...] Brown wanted to call the constables, but I observed it was only a little breeze, and would soon pass over. The side streets here are excessively maiden-lady-like; the door-steps always fresh from the flannel. The knockers have a very staid, serious, nay almost awful quietness about them. I never saw so quiet a collection of lions' and rams' heads. The doors most part black, with a little brass handle just above the keyhole, so that you may easily shut yourself out of your own house. He! He! There is none of your Lady Bellaston ringing and rapping here; no thundering Jupiter-footmen, no opera-treble tattoos, but a modest lifting up of the knocker by a set of little wee old fingers that peep through the gray mittens, and a dying fall thereof. The great beauty of poetry is that it makes everything in every place interesting. The palatine Venice and the abbotine Winchester are equally interesting. Some time since I began a poem called [...] "The Eve of St. Mark," [...] quite in the spirit of town quietude. I think I will give you the sensation of walking about an old country town in a coolish evening. I know not whether I shall ever finish it; I will give it as far as I have <b>gone.</b> <b>Ut</b> tibi placeat-- ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1928, State Attorney General Claude Pollard {{issued a}} legal {{opinion that the}} UT Board of Regents could issue bonds against the AUF, the account that holds the annual {{distributions}} of the PUF. [...] In 1931, the legislature authorized UT Regent-requested bonds to improve UT Austin's buildings and campus in general. As the provision was repealed in 1932, it granted the only time ever that PUF principal was spent. [...] The AUF's distributions were directed, in 1931, by the legislature such that 2/3 of the money would <b>go</b> to <b>UT</b> Austin and 1/3 to Texas A&M, and also extended to be available for purchase of equipment and building construction. [...] In 1947, after World War II and during the education boom from the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, a constitutional amendment was passed that authorized the issuance of $15 million in AUF bonds, $10 million to the UT System and $5 million to the Texas A&M System.|$|R

This {{was a major}} achievement for a club that had only been in existence for six years. Laragh <b>Utd.</b> <b>went</b> {{on to win the}} Senior championship in 1982, 1983 and 1984. The 1984 final was played in Ballyconnell, as this was the Centenary year of the G.A.A. In the same year, Laragh Utd won the Ulster 7-a-side competition. This {{competition was}} played to celebrate the Centenary year. In recent years, Laragh Utd. has not had much success at Senior Level, but great progress has been made and under-age level. The club won the U-12 league in 2002 and was narrowly beaten by Belturbet in the U-13 championship. The club has consistently provided players to the Cavan County teams, the most notable being Jimmy Carroll, Matt Rudden, Ray Cullivan, Donal Donohoe, Fionan McDonagh, John Brady, Patrick Sheils and Paul Brady. In 1997, Patrick and Paul both won Ulster Senior championship medals with Cavan.

40|$|Black {{and white}} {{photograph}} of Rice University Owls baseball player Allan Ramirez, headlining his achievement into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Caption reads: Let’s take a brief glance {{at some of}} the honors won by another deserving new member of the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame, Allan Ramirez. [...] He set the all-time Southwest Conference record for strikeouts in SWC games while starring for the Owls during a four-year career from 1976 - 79. [...] He won four games for the Baltimore Orioles during their World Championship year of 1983. [...] And perhaps most significantly, he was the winning pitcher in one of the all-time greatest games in SWC history, a March 27, 1977 4 – 3 Rice win over the Texas Longhorns in 14 innings. The win ended UT’s 34 -game win streak, the longest in NCAA history. Allan Ramirez was a superior competitor who loved to go out “against the odds” and win while playing for Rice under veteran coach Doug Osburn. He is now doing well as a medical sales representative for Roerig Pharmaceuticals in his old home town of Victoria. Arm trouble in 1983 forced Allan to undergo arthoscopic surgery later during the 1984 season. He tried to come back in 1985, but is just didn’t work out for Ramirez as he prematurely retired from baseball that year. What a shame the arm trouble emerged as, at a young 32, Ramirez could still be pitching major league baseball today. But Ramirez has no regrets. He has a good job, a fine family he’s very proud of (wife Hilda Marie who he married on September 2, 1978, and children Renee Michelle (8) and Felice Danielle (5), and is now happily situated in Victory as he enters the Rice Hall of Fame. Allan had some dramatic moments in his exciting career at Rice, but {{there is no question that}} his victory at Austin against the Longhorns is the highlight. Ramirez was a mere sophomore challenging the Horns at relatively new Disch-Falk Field. UT was riding a 34 -game win streak, then and now the longest in Division I history. In fact, eliminating the post-season NCAA play-offs, <b>UT</b> <b>went</b> into that game without a loss in 48 straight regular-season games! It was an early-season March encounter in SWC action. Saturday’s game was rained out so the Owls and Longhorns were playing on a Sunday. A gutsy Ramirez had thrown more than 200 pitches to keep his Owls tied with UT at 3 – 3 through 13 innings. Finally, an exhausted Ramirez had to be pinch hit for in the 14 th, but the Owls came through to score a run and take a 4 – 3 lead. Jeff Hays came in the bottom of the 14 th to retire UT and earn the save for Ramirez as the Owls ended the all-time longest winning streak in college baseball history. Ramirez had many more career highlights for Rice. His 134 strikeouts in 1976 broke an impressive SWC mark set by fabulous Bobby Layne of Texas. He set career Rice standards in complete games (39), shutouts (7), strikeouts (418), inning pitched (342), games started (48) and games completed (39) and wins (27). He also has the season record for shutouts with five in 1976 and ERA for a season with a sparking 1. 90 during that marvelous 1976 freshman season. His career ERA of 2. 53 ranks third on the all-time Rice list behind current Cincinnati Reds pitcher Norm Charlton and David Pavlas. Perhaps the most telling story about Allan occurred when he faced UH at Cougar Field. The game was in the last of the seventh inning, the bases were loaded with two out and a 3 – 2 count on the batter. EVERYTHING depended on Allan’s final pitch with Rice up a single run. With all the runners in motion, Allan calmed reared back and struck out the Cougar batter to give Rice the win. It was sheer drama, as was usually the case when Ramirez pitched.
