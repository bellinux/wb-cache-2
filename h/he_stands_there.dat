2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.

"I wonder," [...] cries Will, in a choking voice, [...] "that I don't cut {{him into}} twenty {{thousand}} pieces as <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> before {{me with his}} confounded yellow face.

I hate the ugly faces of both of you, and, hic!--if you are for the King, show you are for the King, and drink his health!" [...] and he sank down into his box with a hiccup and a wild laugh, which he repeated a dozen times, with a hundred more oaths and vociferous outcries that I should drink the King's health.|$|E

60|$|For a long {{two minutes}} <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> motionless, {{watching}} the new creature {{that he has}} never seen before; and it will be well for you to keep perfectly quiet and let him surrender the path when he is so disposed. Motion on your part may bring him nearer to investigate; and you can never know at what slight provocation the red danger light will blaze into his eyes. At last he moves away, quietly at first, turning often to look and to make trumpets of his ears at you. Then he lays his great antlers back on his shoulders, sticks his nose far up ahead of him, and with long, smooth strides lunges away over the windfalls and is gone.|$|E

CHARLES is a goodish-looking, moustached [...] young man of about twenty-eight, with a white rim to the collar [...] of his waistcoat, and spats. He has his hand behind CHLOE'S [...] back, as if to prevent her turning tail. She is rather a [...] handsome young woman, with dark eyes, full red lips, and a [...] suspicion of powder, a little under-dressed for the country.

6000|$|Light breaks {{suddenly}} {{in on him}} in floods; but still a false transitory light, and no real sunshine. He is invited to Edinburgh; hastens thither with anticipating heart; is welcomed as in triumph, and with universal blandishment and acclamation; whatever is wisest, whatever is greatest, or loveliest there, gathers round him, to gaze on his face, to show him honor, sympathy, affection. Burns's appearance among the sages and nobles of Edinburgh, must be {{regarded as one of}} the most singular phenomena in modern Literature; almost like the appearance of some Napoleon among the crowned sovereigns of modern Politics. For it is nowise as a [...] "mockery king," [...] set there by favor, transiently, and for a purpose, that he will let himself be treated; still less is he a mad Rienzi, whose sudden elevation turns his too weak head; but <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> on his own basis; cool, unastonished, holding his equal rank from Nature herself; putting forth no claim which there is not strength in him, as well as about him, to vindicate. Mr. Lockhart has some forcible observations on this point: ...|$|E
6000|$|Look on that man--the centre {{and cause}} of all this outburst! <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> alone. The cross is ready. It lies beneath his feet. The rough hand of a brutal soldier has seized his robe to tear it from him. Another with stalwart arm is boring the holes, gazing upward the while with a face of stupid unconcern. There on the ground lie the hammer and the nails: the hour, the moment of doom is come! Look on this man, as upward, with deep, sorrowing eyes, he gazes towards heaven. Hears he {{the roar of the}} mob? Feels he the rough hand on his garment? Nay, he sees not, feels not: from all the rage and tumult of the hour he is rapt away. A sorrow deeper, more absorbing, more unearthly seems to possess him, as upward with long gaze he looks to that heaven never before closed to his prayer, to that God never before to him invisible. That mournful, heaven-searching glance, in its lonely anguish, says but one thing: [...] "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [As he {{goes out}} the LITTLE MAN looks very wistfully after him. [...] Screwing up his mouth and nose, he holds the BABY away from him [...] and wavers; then rising, he {{puts it on the}} seat {{opposite}} and [...] goes through the motions of letting down the window. Having [...] done so he looks at the BABY, who has begun to wail. Suddenly [...] he raises his hands and clasps them, like a child praying. [...] Since, however, the BABY does not stop wailing, he hovers over [...] it in indecision; then, picking it up, sits down again to dandle [...] it, with his face turned toward the open window. Finding that [...] it still wails, he begins to sing to it in a cracked little [...] voice. It is charmed at once. While he is singing, the [...] AMERICAN appears in the corridor. Letting down the passage [...] window, <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> in the doorway with the draught blowing [...] his hair and the smoke of his cigar all about him. The LITTLE [...] MAN stops singing and shifts the shawl higher to protect the [...] BABY'S head from the draught.] ...|$|E
60|$|They {{brought him}} a letter while <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{listening}} to that even-song, gazing at the old desert road.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{as though}} fascinated. I {{began to feel}} impatient, but I dared not show any signs of it.|$|R
60|$|He {{paid her}} no heed: <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> with his glass in his hand, looking from Mrs. Mavis to Miss Grace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{yield to}} no one," [...] he began, [...] "in the pity I {{feel for the}} wife. But I say, the martyr in this case, from first to last, is the husband. Whatever the poor woman may have endured, that unhappy man at the Bar has suffered, and is now suffering, more. If {{he had not been}} the kindest of men, the most docile and most devoted of husbands, he would never have {{occupied}} his present dreadful situation. A man of a meaner and harder nature would have felt suspicions of his wife's motives when she asked him to buy poison--would have seen through the wretchedly commonplace excuses she made for wanting it--and would have wisely and cruelly said, 'No.' The prisoner is not that sort of man. He is too good to his wife, too innocent of any evil thought toward her, or toward any one, to foresee the inconveniences and the dangers to which his fatal compliance may expose him. And what is the result? <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> branded as a murderer, because he was too high-minded and too honorable to suspect his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Embroil" [...] {{is perhaps}} too strong an expression. I can't imagine among either my enemies or my friends a being so hard up for {{something}} to do as to quarrel with me. [...] "To disappoint one's friends" [...] would be nearer the mark. Most, almost all, friend ships of the writing period of my life have come to me through my books; and I know that a novelist lives in his work. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> the only reality in an invented world, among imaginary things, happenings, and people. Writing about them, he is only writing about himself. But the disclosure is not complete. He remains, to a certain extent, a figure behind the veil; a suspected rather than a seen presence--a movement and a voice behind the draperies of fiction. In these personal notes there is no such veil. And I cannot help thinking of a passage in the [...] "Imitation of Christ" [...] where the ascetic author, who knew life so profoundly, says that [...] "there are persons esteemed on their reputation who by showing themselves destroy the opinion one had of them." [...] This is the danger incurred by an author of fiction who sets out to talk about himself without disguise.|$|E
60|$|Here {{then you}} have before the throne, that is, the throne or mercy-seat, the high priest; for there it was that God {{appointed}} that the altar of incense, or that to burn incense on, should be placed (Exo 30:1-7). This incense-altar in the type was to be overlaid with gold; but here the Holy Ghost implies, that it is all of gold. This throne then is the mercy-seat, or throne of grace, to which we are bid to come; and, as you see, here is the angel, the high priest with his golden censer, and his incense, ready to wait upon us. For so the text implies, for he is there to offer his incense with the prayers of all saints that are waiting without at his time of offering incense within (Luke 1:10). So, then, at the throne of grace, or before it, stands the high priest of our propitiation, Christ Jesus, with his golden censer in his hand, full of incense, therewith to perfume the prayers of saints, that come thither for grace and mercy to help in time of need.[8] And <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> as you see, {{under the name of}} an angel, for he is the angel of God's presence, and messenger of his covenant.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in the raiment of a king, and {{the gates}} of the jewelled shrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed {{monstrance}} shone a marvellous and mystical light. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in a king's raiment, and the Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move. In the fair raiment of a king <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> before them, and the organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets, and the singing boys sang.|$|R
