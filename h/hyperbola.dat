5|$|Besides the ellipse {{with the}} centre at the focus, Newton also applied Proposition 6 to the <b>hyperbola</b> (Proposition 12), and the {{parabola}} (Proposition 13). Also, to the ellipse with {{the centre of}} force at {{the centre of the}} ellipse (Proposition 10), to the equiangular spiral (Proposition 9), and to the circle, with the centre of force not coinciding with the centre, and even on the circumference (Proposition 7).|$|E
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} <b>hyperbola,</b> and as such they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around the Sun, to a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any <b>hyperbola,</b> the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a <b>hyperbola,</b> as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{properties of}} a <b>hyperbola</b> are easily proven using {{the representation of}} a <b>hyperbola</b> introduced in this section.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} tangent line distingushes the <b>hyperbola</b> {{from the}} other conic sections. Let f be {{the distance from the}} vertex V (on both the <b>hyperbola</b> and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the <b>hyperbola</b> is greater than 2f. The tangent to the <b>hyperbola</b> at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle ∠PQV of greater than 45°.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the <b>hyperbola's</b> center and that {{passes through the}} <b>hyperbola's</b> vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.|$|R
50|$|Fig. 2&#8209;7b {{shows that}} when viewed in an extra {{dimension}} of space, the timelike invariant <b>hyperbolae</b> generate hyperboloids of one sheet, while the spacelike invariant <b>hyperbolae</b> generate hyperboloids of two sheets.|$|R

25|$|This {{equation}} {{is called the}} canonical form of a <b>hyperbola,</b> because any <b>hyperbola,</b> regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a <b>hyperbola</b> that is congruent to the original (see below).|$|E
25|$|Several other curves can {{be derived}} from the <b>hyperbola</b> by inversion, the {{so-called}} inverse curves of the <b>hyperbola.</b> If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular <b>hyperbola</b> and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the <b>hyperbola,</b> the resulting inverse curves are a limaçon or a strophoid, respectively.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{implies that}} the <b>hyperbola</b> is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle B, {{as well as the}} envelope of the polar lines of the points on B. Conversely, the circle B is the envelope of polars of points on the <b>hyperbola,</b> and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the <b>hyperbola.</b> Two tangent lines to B have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle C; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on B are the asymptotes of the <b>hyperbola.</b> The two branches of the <b>hyperbola</b> correspond to the two parts of the circle B that are separated by these tangent points.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} are concurrent: (1) a circle {{passing through the}} hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the <b>hyperbola</b> at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the <b>hyperbola.</b>|$|E

The analogous ratios for ellipses and <b>hyperbolas</b> depend on their eccentricities.

25|$|Students of {{integral}} calculus know that f(x) = x'p has an algebraic antiderivative {{except in the}} case p = –1 corresponding to the quadrature of the <b>hyperbola.</b> The other cases are given by Cavalieri's quadrature formula. Whereas quadrature of the parabola had been accomplished by Archimedes in the third century BC (in The Quadrature of the Parabola), the hyperbolic quadrature required the invention in 1647 of a new function: Gregoire de Saint-Vincent addressed the problem of computing the areas bounded by a <b>hyperbola.</b> His findings led to the natural logarithm function, once called the hyperbolic logarithm since it is obtained by integrating, or finding the area, under the <b>hyperbola.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Two conic {{sections}} are congruent {{if their}} eccentricities {{and one other}} distinct parameter characterizing them are equal. Their eccentricities establish their shapes, equality of which is sufficient to establish similarity, and the second parameter then establishes size. Since two circles, parabolas, or rectangular <b>hyperbolas</b> always have the same eccentricity (specifically 0 {{in the case of}} circles, 1 in the case of parabolas, and [...] in the case of rectangular <b>hyperbolas),</b> two circles, parabolas, or rectangular <b>hyperbolas</b> need to have only one other common parameter value, establishing their size, for them to be congruent.|$|R
