40|$|The anti-viral drug interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is widely-known {{to induce}} {{psychiatric}} and cognitive effects in patients. Previous work {{has shown that}} physical exercise can {{have a positive effect}} against brain insult. We investigated the effects of a clinically-comparable treatment regime of IFN-alpha on cognitive function in male Wistar rats and assessed the impact of chronic treadmill running on the deficits generated by IFN-alpha. We found that IFN-alpha induced significant impairments in performance on both spatial novelty and object novelty recognition. Chronic forced exercise did not protect against IFN-alpha-induced learning <b>deficits</b> in <b>reactivity</b> to spatial change, but did restore the capacity for novel object recognition in IFN-alpha-treated animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} two {{dimensions}} of psychopathy-dispositional fearlessness (theorized to reflect variations in reactivity of the brain's defensive system) and externalizing proneness (presumed to reflect variations in function of anterior regulatory systems) -in fear learning was examined {{in a sample of}} undergraduates assessed using the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R) who participated in a differential aversive conditioning task. Only scores on self-reported "fearless dominance," irrespective of scores on "impulsive antisociality," were related to diminished acquisition of physiological fear. Consistent with dual-process accounts of psychopathy proposing divergent etiological pathways for the interpersonal/affective and the social deviance features of the disorder, our results lend support to the existence of a <b>deficit</b> in <b>reactivity</b> of the brain's defensive system underlying the fearlessness dimension of psychopathy...|$|R
40|$|Diminished {{emotional}} and empathic capacity is a core characteristic of psychopathic personality. The current study examines {{the effect of}} the condition on neural reactivity to emotional content with the use of high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Seventeen high-trait and 15 low-trait healthy individuals identified with a self-report measure of psychopathy participated in an emotional Stroop task in which they responded to negative and positive valence blocks of emotionally charged and emotionally neutral images. The high-trait group showed less reactivity to emotional stimuli than neutral stimuli with faster Stroop reaction times, reduced amplitude of two emotional processing event-related potentials (ERPs), the Early Anterior Positivity, and the Late Positive Potential, and less affective amplification of the P 1 attentional ERP. Diminished processing of emotional content may reflect a top-down, learned inhibition of emotional processing, whereas reduced early emotional reorienting of attention also suggests an additional bottom-up, biologically based <b>deficit</b> in affective <b>reactivity...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{tentative}} {{model of}} schizophrenic psychotic episodes is presented, {{based on the}} evidence that certain characteristics of individuals may serve as vulnerability factors and that environmental stressors may precipitate psychotic periods in vulnerable individuals. Certain information-processing <b>deficits,</b> autonomic <b>reactivity</b> anomalies, and social competence and coping limitations are viewed as potential vulnerability factors. Stressors in the form of discrete life events as well as the prevailing level of social environmental stress are seen as factors that interact with preexisting vulnerability characteristics to produce vicious circles, which lead, in turn, to psychotic episodes. A distinction among stable vulnerability indicators, mediating vulnerability factors, and episode indicators is suggested to differentiate types of abnormalities that characterize individuals prone to or manifesting schizophrenic disorder. Some major areas of unresolved questions in relation to this view of schizophrenic psychotic episodes are discussed. The primary purpose of this concluding article in the present series is to integrate the major conclusions of the preceding five articles into a tentative vulnerability/stress model of schizophrenic psychotic episodes that might suggest possible interacting contributions of the individual factors. Due to the relatively broad nature of the constructs that presently need to be used to bridge the diverse possible vulnerability and stress factors, the model is a framework or schema for further developments rather than a formal hypothetico-deductive model. Equally as important as the tentative model is an attempt to identify unresolved issues that now preclude a clearer theoretical integration...|$|R
40|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) is {{a disorder}} defined by mood disturbance, but the <b>deficits</b> in emotional <b>reactivity</b> that accompany MDD {{are not yet}} fully characterized. Researchers have utilized the emotion-modulated startle paradigm to investigate emotional responding among depressed individuals with mixed results. Inconsistent results may be {{due in part to}} the heterogeneity of mood disorders, including variation in mood severity. The current study utilized an emotion-modulated startle procedure with 33 individuals currently experiencing a major depressive episode, 25 individuals currently experiencing a minor depressive episode (mD), and 31 healthy controls. Severity of depression, anxiety, and positive and negative mood states were ascertained on the sample. Emotion-modulated startle failed to differentiate between mood disordered individuals and healthy controls. However, results found a significant association between abnormal patterns of emotion responding and positive affect (PA), such that individuals with low PA showed exaggerated responding to unpleasant stimuli. The results suggest that PA may be an important dimension in mood disorders that underlies abnormal emotional responses...|$|R
40|$|Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia- 1 (DISC 1) is {{a genetic}} {{susceptibility}} locus for major mental illness, including schizophrenia and depression. The Disc 1 protein was recently shown {{to interact with}} the Wnt signaling protein, DIX domain containing 1 (Dixdc 1). Both proteins participate in neural progenitor proliferation dependent on Wnt signaling, and in neural migration independently of Wnt signaling. Interestingly, their effect on neural progenitor proliferation is additive. By analogy to Disc 1, mutations in Dixdc 1 may lead to abnormal behavior in mice, and to schizophrenia or depression in humans. To explore this hypothesis further, we generated mice mutant at the Dixdc 1 locus and analyzed their behavior. Dixdc 1 −/− mice had normal prepulse inhibition, but displayed decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, abnormal behavior in the elevated plus maze and <b>deficits</b> in startle <b>reactivity.</b> Our results suggest that Dixdc 1 −/− mice will be a useful tool to elucidate molecular pathophysiology involving Disc 1 in major mental illnesses...|$|R
40|$|<b>Deficits</b> in {{emotional}} <b>reactivity</b> are frequently reported in Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs). A deficit in prosocial emotions, namely the callous unemotional traits (CU), {{may be a}} mediator of emotional reactivity. Our aim is to investigate subjective emotional reactivity towards visual stimuli with different affective valence in youths with DBDs and healthy controls. The clinical sample included 62 youths with DBDs (51 males, 8 to 16 years, mean 11. 372. 1 years), the control group 53 subjects (36 males, 8 to 16 years, mean 10. 871. 5 years). The groups were compared using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU),and the International Affective Picture System (IAPS),which explores the affective(pleasant/unpleasant emotional reaction) and arousal (low/high intensity of emotion) dimen- sions. The DBD group presented higher scores in externalizing and internalizing CBCL scores, and in ICU callous and indifferent subscales. At the IAPS,DBD patients differed from controls in the affective valence of the images, rating less unpleasant neutral and negative images. The CU traits were the only predictor of emotional reactivity in the DBD sample. A less aversive way to interpret neutral and negatives timuli may explain why DBD patients are less responsive to negative reinforcements...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the contribution of the}} phenotypic domains of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition of the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009) to deficient aversive-potentiated startle in a mixed-gender sample of 180 undergraduates. Eyeblink responses to noise probes were recorded during a passive picture-viewing task (erotica, neutral, threat, and mutilation). Deficient threat vs. neutral potentiation was uniquely related to increased boldness scores, thus suggesting that the diminished defensive reaction to aversive stimulation is specifically linked to the charm, social potency and venturesomeness features of psychopathy (boldness), but not to features such as callousness, coldheartedness and cruelty traits (meanness), even though both phenotypes theoretically share the same underlying low-fear disposition. Our findings provide further evidence of the differential association between distinct psychopathy components and <b>deficits</b> in defensive <b>reactivity</b> and strongly support the validity of the triarchic model of psychopathy in disentangling the etiology of this personality disorder. This study received the support of Grant PSI 2011 - 22559 from the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (Spain), Grant P 1 · 1 B 2013 - 12 from Universitat Jaume I (Spain) and a predoctoral fellowship from the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación to the first author (BES- 2008 - 004554) ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe present studies {{characterize}} {{working memory}} capabilities in the El mouse model of epilepsy using a species-typical social recognition memory task. As the El mouse exhibits a stress hyper-reactivity phenotype, {{the impact of}} hypertonic saline consumption, a memory modulatory treatment, upon social recognition performance was also examined. The hypotheses under test were: (1) that seizure susceptible El mice would perform poorly in the short-term working memory task relative to seizure resistant ddY controls, and (2) that the behavioral and neural responses to stressor exposure would be atypical in El mice. Results revealed a short-term working memory <b>deficit</b> and altered <b>reactivity</b> to social, environmental, and physiological stressors in El mice. In Experiment 1, El mice exhibited poor sociability and decreased olfactory investigation times, both anxiogenic-like traits, compared to ddY controls. In Experiment 2, El mice exhibited poor working memory performance compared to capable performance in ddY controls. Social recognition memory in ddY mice was abolished, however, by salt-loading whereas El mice were unaffected by exposure to this physiological stressor. In Experiment 3, all salt-loaded mice exhibited enhanced brain stress neuropeptide (corticotropin releasing factor–CRF) content, and salt-loaded El mice exhibited a 70 % reduction in handling-induced seizures. These findings suggest that El mice exhibit high emotionality as well as atypical reactions to stressor exposure, and that these characteristics impact social working memory performance and seizure susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia {{patients}} exhibit {{impairment in}} prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR), which is commonly {{interpreted as a}} sensorimotor gating deficit. To date, it is unclear when these gating deficits arise. Results of animal studies and some human data suggest that PPI deficits are in part genetically determined, such that gating deficits could be present {{before the onset of}} a full-blown psychosis. To test this assumption, we investigated PPI of ASR in individuals with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia and patients with first-episode schizophrenia. METHODS: Startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI of ASR, as well as a neuropsychological test battery, were assessed in 54 subjects with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia (35 early and 19 late prodromal subjects), 31 first-episode schizophrenia patients (14 unmedicated, 17 medicated), and 28 healthy control subjects. Patients were also examined with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. RESULTS: Prodromal subjects and unmedicated patients with first-episode schizophrenia showed significant PPI deficits, whereas schizophrenia patients treated with risperidone had almost normal PPI. Startle reactivity decreased with greater severity of symptoms (control subjects, early prodromal group > late prodromal group > unmedicated first-episode patients) but was almost normal in the medicated patients. With respect to habituation, prodromal subjects and schizophrenia patients did not differ from healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: PPI disruption is already present in a prodromal state of schizophrenia, but startle <b>reactivity</b> <b>deficits</b> seem to emerge with the onset of acute psychosis...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that both the {{amygdala}} and frontal cortex contribute to emotional and motivational processes in rodents and humans. These regions show extensive amyloid pathology in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in mouse models of AD. However, the impact of amyloid production on emotional and motivational processes in mouse models of AD has not been systematically examined. The presence of pathology within key regions linked to emotional processes led to the hypothesis that Tg 2576 mice, which express a human genetic mutation associated with early onset AD, would show age-related <b>deficits</b> in emotional <b>reactivity</b> and incentive and aversive learning and memory processes. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of extensive amyloid pathology in cortical, amygdala and medial temporal lobe structures in Tg 2576 mice. Behavioural studies established impairments in anxiety, behavioural disinhibition and fear conditioning in Tg 2576 mice. In contrast, other experiments showed that appetitive instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning remained goal-directed in aged Tg 2576 mice. However, context-outcome associations were insensitive to post-conditioning changes {{in the value of the}} outcome in aged but not in young Tg 2576 mice. In order to gain insight into how Ap pathology influenced hippocampal-amygdala system activity during emotional learning, the final set of experiments assessed changes in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos following acquisition and retrieval of fear memories. The findings from this thesis indicate that Tg 2576 mice display relatively circumscribed changes in emotional reactivity and emotional memory processes that may reflect age-related alterations in amygdalo-hippocampal network interactions...|$|R
40|$|Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) {{is thought}} to be {{characterized}} by emotion regulation deficits, including decreased use of adaptive strategies such as reappraisal, but {{little is known about the}} exact nature of these deficits and whether or not they are specific to the depressed mood state. The late positive potential (LPP) is a sustained positive deflection of the event-related potential (ERP) associated with responding to emotionally-valenced stimuli, and reappraisal strategies have been found to reduce LPP magnitude in response to emotional stimuli in healthy individuals, but this effect has not been examined in MDD. This study utilized ERPs to examine emotional reactivity to positive and negative pictures during passive viewing and a reappraisal condition in a sample 25 of individuals with current MDD, 26 with remitted depression (RMD), and 26 healthy controls. The LPP was greater for passive viewing of positive and negative relative to neutral pictures in all groups, with no significant group findings emerging. For positive pictures, all groups showed reduced LPP 2 ̆ 7 s for positive reappraisal relative to passive viewing with no group by condition interactions. For negative pictures, both the MDD and RMD groups exhibited abnormalities, with the MDD group failing to show a reduction in LPP for reappraised pictures relative to passive viewing and the RMD group demonstrating an unexpected increase in LPP magnitude for reappraised negative pictures. The LPP for emotional pictures and reappraisal instructions may reveal <b>deficits</b> in emotional <b>reactivity</b> and regulation among mood-disordered individuals, particularly for negative stimuli, and may suggest targets for clinical intervention...|$|R
40|$|A single {{intravenous}} injection {{of a relatively}} small number of T cells contained in the population of rat thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) is sufficient to restore to normal the peripheral T cell pool of athymic PVG. rnu/rnu nude rats. The donor T cells expand greater than 10 - 15 - fold, self-renew, and restore immunocompetency to nude recipients permanently (greater than 2 yr). We asked whether the T cell repertoire was affected by the expansion and self-renewal process. Nude recipients were injected with syngeneic PVG TDL that had been allospecifically depleted (negatively selected) by consecutive passage from blood to thoracic duct lymph through two irradiated (DAxPVG) F 1 intermediate rats. Negatively selected TDL were tested before transfer by the P [...] F 1 popliteal LN GVH assay and showed a greater than 90 % depletion of specific reactivity to DA alloantigens. Surviving cells or their progeny were recovered from LN or TDL of nude recipients 8 and 12 mo after transfer. The <b>deficit</b> in GVH <b>reactivity</b> to the DA haplotype persisted, but normal GVH activity was demonstrated against a third party (AOxPVG) F 1 alloantigen. The "hole" in the repertoire could not be attributed to tolerance induced by the co-transfer of contaminating irradiated F 1 TDL. PVG TDL passaged consecutively through (AOxPVG) F 1 and (DAxPVG) F 1 intermediates and devoid of (AOxPVG) F 1 cells remained specifically depleted to both AO and DA haplotypes when recovered from nude recipients 4 and 13 mo later, but displayed GVH activity to a third-party (BNxPVG) F 1 alloantigen. Thus the exact specificity of the T cell repertoire of the original inoculum was faithfully maintained in nude recipients throughout the initial phase of rapid expansion and the continued self-renewal of the mature peripheral T cell pool...|$|R
40|$|Nicotine {{dependence}} {{is difficult}} to treat, and the biological mechanisms that are involved are not entirely clear. There is an urgent need to develop better drugs and more effective treatments for clinical practice. A critical step towards accelerating progress in medication development is to understand the neurobehavioral effects of pharmacotherapies on clinical characteristics associated with nicotine dependence. This review sought to summarize the {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) literature on smoking cessation with the aim to better understand the neural processes underlying the effects of nicotinic and non-nicotinic pharmacological smoking cessation treatments on specific symptoms of nicotine dependence and withdrawal. We conducted a search in Pubmed, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases with the keywords 'fMRI' or 'functional magnetic resonance imaging' and 'tobacco' or 'nicotine' or 'smok*'. The date of the most recent search was May 2012. The original studies that were included were those of smokers or nicotine-dependent individuals, published in the English language, with pharmacological treatment for nicotine dependence and use of fMRI with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging or continuous arterial spin labelling (CASL). No date limit was applied. Two of the authors read the abstracts of all studies found in the search (n = 1, 260). The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and 1, 224 articles were excluded. In a second step, the same authors read the remaining 36 studies. Nineteen of the 36 articles were excluded. The results were tabulated by the number of individuals and their mean age, the main sample characteristics, smoking status, study type and methodology, and the main fMRI findings. Seventeen original fMRI studies involving pharmacological treatment of smokers were selected. The anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala, thalamus and insula are heavily involved in the maintenance of smoking and nicotine withdrawal. The effects of varenicline and bupropion in alleviating withdrawal symptoms and decreasing smoking correlated with modulation of the activities of these areas. Nicotine replacement therapy seems to improve cognitive symptoms related to withdrawal especially by modulating activities of the default-network regions; however, nicotine replacement does not necessarily alter the activities of neural circuits, such as the cingulate cortices, that are associated with nicotine addiction. The risk of bias in individual studies, and across studies, was not assessed, and no method of handling data and combining results of studies was carried out. Most importantly, positron emission tomography (PET) studies were not included in this review. fMRI studies delineate brain systems that contribute to cognitive <b>deficits</b> and <b>reactivity</b> to stimuli that generate the desire to smoke. Nicotinic and non-nicotinic pharmacotherapy may reduce smoking via distinct neural mechanisms of action. These findings should {{contribute to the development of}} new medications and discovery of early markers of the therapeutic response of cigarette smoker...|$|R
40|$|Anosognosia, {{or lack of}} {{awareness}} of one's deficits, is a core feature of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). We hypothesized that this deficit has its origins in failed emotional processing of errors. We studied autonomic and facial emotional reactivity to errors in patients with bvFTD (n = 17), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 20), and healthy controls (HC, n = 35) during performance of a timed two-alternative-choice button press task. Performance-related behavioral responses to errors were quantified using rates of error correction and post-error slowing of reaction times. Facial emotional responses were measured by monitoring facial reactivity via video and subsequently coding the type, duration and intensity of all emotional reactions. Skin conductance response (SCR) was measured via noninvasive sensors. SCR and total score for each facial emotion expression were quantified for each trial. Facial emotions were grouped into self-conscious (amusement, embarrassment) and negative (fear, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt) emotions. HCs corrected 99. 4 % of their errors. BvFTD patients corrected 94 % (not statistically different compared with HC) and AD corrected 74. 8 % of their errors (p < 0. 05 compared with HC and bvFTD). All groups showed similar post-error slowing. Errors in HCs were associated with greater facial reactivity and SCRs compared with non-error trials, including both negative and self-conscious emotions. BvFTD patients failed to produce self-conscious emotions or an increase in SCR for errors, although they did produce negative emotional responses to a similar degree as HCs. AD showed no <b>deficit</b> in facial <b>reactivity</b> to errors. Although, SCR was generally reduced in AD during error trials, they showed a preserved increase in SCR for errors relative to correct trials. These results demonstrate a specific deficit in emotional responses to errors in bvFTD, encompassing both physiological response and a specific deficit in self-conscious emotions, despite intact awareness and correction of errors. The findings provide a potential mechanism for anosognosia and possibly other behavioral abnormalities in bvFTD and highlight the importance of studying multiple channels of reactivity to errors, including performance related responses and emotional responses, {{in order to understand}} how impaired error processing could influence behavior...|$|R
