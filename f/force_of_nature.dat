5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E

Thus it was the religious philosophy of life that led me to the concept of the imperishability <b>of</b> <b>forces.</b> By this line of reasoning I became convinced that just as it is true that the human soul is immortal, so it must also surely be a general law <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> that the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are imperishable.|$|R

The 'game of chance' that Fortune puts into play {{can be related to}} that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor.

25|$|Operationally, {{the storm}} was {{referred}} to as Mahasen; however, this stirred some controversy from nationalists and officials in Sri Lanka. They claimed that the name comes from King Mahasena of Anuradhapura who brought prosperity to the island, thus naming a destructive <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> after him would be improper. As such, Sri Lankan agencies referred to the system as a nameless cyclone and requested that international agencies do the same.

The India Meteorological Department later renamed the system as Viyaru in their final reports and removed Mahasen from all previous archived advisories.|$|E
25|$|Schelling {{held that}} the {{divisions}} imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as {{the outcome of the}} single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of organicism. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> leads to the conception of the duality through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.|$|E

Most serious scientific research in this area depends on the theorized anti-gravitational properties of antimatter (currently being tested at the alpha experiment at CERN) and/or the effects of non-Newtonian forces such as the gravitomagnetic field under specific quantum conditions. According to the general theory of relativity, rotating matter can generate a new <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> known as the gravitomagnetic interaction, whose intensity is proportional to the rate of spin. In certain conditions the gravitomagnetic field can be repulsive. In neutrons stars for example it can produce a gravitational analogue of the Meissner effect, but the force produced in such an example is theorized to be exceedingly weak.|$|E

500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member of}} our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E
500|$|Thelema draws its {{principal}} gods and goddesses from Ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit. She {{is the night}} sky arched over the Earth symbolized {{in the form of}} a naked woman. She is conceived as the Great Mother, the ultimate source of all things. [...] The second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit. [...] Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in Liber AL vel Legis as [...] "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star". [...] The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick. [...] Other deities within the cosmology of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, a <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Compatibilists {{contend that}} even if {{determinism}} were true, {{it would still be}} possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text The Bhagavad Gita offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: [...] "... But the Man who knows the relation between the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> and actions, witnesses how some <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> work upon other <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> and becomes not their slave..." [...] When we are ignorant of the relationship between <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself. Paramahansa Yogananda also said, [...] "Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation." ...|$|R

500|$|According to Latin American {{literature}} scholar Richard Callan, {{the dichotomy}} between destruction and fertility is {{embodied in the}} opposition between the President and Miguel Angel Face. While the President represents sterility and destruction, his favorite, Miguel Angel Face, embodies fertility, a positive and generative <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Callan notes that Miguel Angel Face's transformation from the President's favorite to a positive generative force is not deliberate. Instead, Callan argues that [...] "it results from the birth of true love in his formerly barren heart. However, he is too engrossed in his love to notice the shift in {{his relationship with the}} President." [...] The President, not surprisingly, identifies himself candidly with death. Examples from the novel include the death sentences he gives to Abel Carvajal (for a crime the President is fully aware the man did not commit) and to Lucio Vasquez, a man in his service that carried out his wish for the Zany to be killed and yet is still executed. In contrast to the President, Callan highlights Miguel Angel Face's association with love. The love that Miguel Angel Face develops for Camila identifies him with love and life, and leads to procreationthe birth of his son. Rosello argues that even before his transformation, Miguel Angel Face was aware of the President's destructive nature. As such, Rosello argues that Miguel Angel Face [...] "knew from the beginning that the only 'safety' in the President's world is a form of self destruction: only by losing his identity and letting the President's mind invade his own could he hope to remain alive". So, when he failed to comply, he did indeed lose his life.|$|E
