50|$|Like Catan, Zarahemla uses a {{somewhat}} modular board structure, {{but instead of}} individual hexes (as {{is the case of}} Catan), Zarahemla uses five strips of hexes - one five-hex strip, two four-hex strips, and three-hex strips, which could be oriented and rearranged as in the standard game. Unlike Catan, however, Zarahemlas hexes are placed on a fixed board, which itself contains the game's harbors, or trading posts.

2500|$|This {{activity}} {{peaked in}} May 1924, a watershed moment for Romanian modernist history: Contimporanul issued its [...] "activist" [...] manifesto, with principles ranging from primitivist anti-art and Futurism to constructive patriotism and the taking up of modern city-planning. It demanded that Romanians topple art, [...] "for it has prostituted itself", and also [...] "dispatch [...] dead". Vinea, Janco, M. H. Maxy, and Georges Linze were curators of the Contimporanul art show, {{which opened in}} November 1924, bringing the group to national attention, and sampling the major tendencies of European Constructivism. That year, Contimporanul was joined by Ion Barbu, who soon became its poet laureate, alongside the more senior Arghezi and Vinea himself. Vinea shared with Barbu a favorite pastime, the consumption of recreational drugs, most probably cocaine and sulfuric ether, but was less keen on frequenting literary hospots such as Casa Capșa. For decades, they would compete not just as poets, but also as womanizers, <b>keeping</b> <b>score</b> of their sexual conquests. Răsturnica ("Miss Tumble-over"), Barbu's ribald ode to a dead prostitute, was published by, and is sometimes attributed to, Vinea.|$|E
