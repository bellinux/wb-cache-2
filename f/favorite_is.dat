5|$|Donizetti {{managed to}} {{retrieve}} the score of L'ange de Nisida from Joly's company and reworked it as La favorite (now more commonly known by its Italian title, La favorita) in September 1840 for a December premiere in Italy. To circumvent the Italian censors Donizetti agreed to plot modifications; La <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> about a medieval King of Castile.|$|E
5|$|Ashbrook has {{compared}} the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine precisely how much material L'ange {{provided for the}} latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E
5|$|Unnerved, Angel tells Cyphre that he {{no longer}} wants the job, but agrees to {{continue}} after Cyphre offers him $5,000. He soon discovers that Favorite had a wealthy fiancée named Margaret Krusemark but had also begun a secret love affair with a woman named Evangeline Proudfoot. Angel travels to New Orleans and meets with Margaret, who divulges little information, telling him that <b>Favorite</b> <b>is</b> dead. Angel then discovers that Evangeline is also dead, but is survived by her 17-year-old daughter, Epiphany Proudfoot, who was conceived during her mother's love affair with Favorite. When Epiphany is reluctant to speak, Angel tracks down Toots Sweet, a blues guitarist and former Favorite bandmate. After Angel uses force to try to extract details of Favorite's last-known whereabouts, Toots refers him back to Margaret. The following morning, police detectives inform Angel that Toots has been murdered. Angel returns to Margaret's home, where he finds her murdered, her heart removed with a ceremonial knife. He is later attacked by enforcers of Ethan Krusemark—a powerful Louisiana patriarch and Margaret's father—who tell him to leave town.|$|E

Likely one reason it was a <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> that it was inspired by Barks' own experiences in the poultry business.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{official}} results were published shortly after midnight 28 December {{and it was}} clear the two candidates to face in a runoff would be Josipović and Bandić all the major candidates gave their speeches. Josipović called for voters to vote for the light, not for the dark, while Bandić insulted Josipović saying he was a pawn of Zoran Milanović and nothing more than his remote-control. The following morning the official campaign for the second round began. Josipović denied being an SDP project calling himself independent and accusing Bandić of being a remote-control of Ivo Sanader, referring among other things to claims by Dragan Primorac that Bandić was the favorite of the former prime minister. Bandić denied the rumors, however the following day the media published a story claiming that Bandić and Sanader had a secret lunch that very day in a Zagreb restaurant. Bandić denied the rumors calling the journalists who published the story liars, saying the media's <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> Josipović and that they would do anything to discredit him.|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "a half hour of heartwarming comedy". She was particularly pleased with how Michael was able to overcome Oscar with pathos, and she enjoyed the episode's subplots. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic praised the episode and awarded it five stars out of five. He wrote that [...] "If my favorite thing for Jim to do is prank Dwight, my second <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> when he backs Michael." [...] Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "While this A story was filled with plenty of laughs, [...] Dwight's B story was absolutely murderous [...] all gold". He also felt that the C plot was enjoyable, because [...] "Andy is great in small doses".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the game}} Hamauzu was known for working on orchestral pieces, Mizuta for {{instrumental}} pieces, and Suzuki for electronic pieces, {{and as a result}} all three composers attempted to write music that did not fit their general style to avoid only writing music similar to what they had produced before. They also worked with each other to blend their styles together, so that shifts between composers in the soundtrack would not be jarring. While the music is not intended to be reminiscent of Final Fantasy XIIIs music, pieces set in scenes involving places or characters from the prequel use motifs and pieces of music used in that game for those places or characters. Mizuta's favorite song from the soundtrack that he wrote is [...] "Caius's Theme", which he rewrote four times {{over the course of a}} month. Suzuki's <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Historia Crux", which he wrote as several tunes mixing into one as a metaphor for time travel in the game, and Hamauzu's is [...] "Knight of the Goddess", the battle theme for the game, which he attempted to make the equal of [...] "Blinded by Light", the battle theme of the prequel, which he felt was very well received.|$|E

500|$|Sakimoto did {{not meet}} with Uematsu for {{direction}} on creating the soundtrack and tried to avoid copying Uematsu's style from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks. However, he did attempt to ensure that his style would mesh with Uematsu's [...] "Kiss Me Good-Bye" [...] and the overall vision of the series. The soundtrack also includes songs composed by Uematsu for previous Final Fantasy games, with new arrangements by Sakimoto. These tracks include [...] "Final Fantasy ~FFXII Version~", [...] "Victory Fanfare ~FFXII Version~", [...] "Chocobo FFXII Arrange Ver. 1", [...] "Chocobo ~FFXII Version~", and [...] "Clash on the Big Bridge ~FFXII Version~". Of these, all but [...] "Clash on the Big Bridge" [...] are recurring pieces used in almost every Final Fantasy game. [...] "Clash on the Big Bridge" [...] plays during the battle with Gilgamesh, {{as it did in}} Final Fantasy V. Sakimoto created the music for the game based on the atmosphere of the game and the emotional changes of the characters, rather than the story, so that the music would not be affected by changes {{in the development of the}} game. Sakimoto stated in an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game that his favorite pieces from the soundtrack are the [...] "world" [...] themes in the outdoor areas, and that his overall <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> [...] "The Cerobi Steppe".|$|E

2500|$|The opening falsetto harmonies {{captured}} the drip-drop {{of rain and}} tears by using a late 1950s doo-wop singing style. That it became a regional <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> summed up by one journalist who noted that [...] "Maybe it's because although it speaks to a universal sentimental human experience - romantic heartbreak - it does so with dignity, rather than pour on the sap." [...] Nevetheless, [...] "It's Raining" [...] did not reach any national chart.|$|E

We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My <b>favorite</b> <b>is</b> the Japanese translations".|$|E
