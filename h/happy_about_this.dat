In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria.

One thing that I’ve learned is to not steer too far from my fan base because they really appreciate what you do. You can never change the way you came out.

Di Bona responded by accusing [...] "Shapiro of misrepresentation, saying he never revealed his political agenda." [...] Suffice it to say, Di Bona agrees with the idea that Hollywood tends to be populated by left-wing individuals and that this therefore reveals that scripted shows push a leftist political agenda and that Hollywood discriminates against conservatives.|$|R
