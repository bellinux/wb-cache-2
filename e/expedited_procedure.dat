40|$|This report {{discusses}} certain {{provisions of}} law that commonly are known as “fast-track” or <b>expedited</b> <b>procedures.</b> They are so labeled because these statutory provisions contain special legislative procedures that apply to one or both houses of Congress and that expedite, or put on a fast track, congressional consideration of a certain measure or a narrowly defined class of measures. This report first presents the nature, purpose, and elements of fast-track procedures. Then the report discusses {{some of the most}} important ways in which these procedures differ from the normal procedures of the House and Senate and, therefore, how the use of <b>expedited</b> <b>procedures</b> can affect the legislative process in Congress...|$|R
50|$|During colonial rule, the {{hierarchy}} of courts began with magistrates' courts in the towns, rising to a High Court and finally a Supreme Court of Appeal. In addition, mainly in rural areas, there were several levels of local courts with varying powers to hear disputes such as divorces and other matrimonial issues, inheritance and access to land based on traditional customary law. These courts also heard minor criminal cases specified in the Malawi Penal Code, using an <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure.</b> These were subordinate to the High Court, and subject to legislation giving the guarantee of a fair trial, {{including the right to}} legal representation and the right to appeal to the High Court.|$|E

H.R. 2080 was passed by the United States House of Representatives under an <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure</b> on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators (Ben Cardin of Maryland, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Carl Levin of Michigan) initially placed [...] "holds" [...] on the bill to prevent its consideration in the United States Senate, the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.

50|$|The arrested {{workers were}} taken to a nearby fairground, the National Cattle Congress in Waterloo, Iowa, where they were charged with aggravated {{identity}} theft, a criminal offense that carries a mandatory two years sentence, and briefed on their rights and options. The immigrant workers, most of them without prior criminal records, were offered a plea agreement {{in exchange for a}} guilty plea to lesser charges. 297 accepted the agreement and pleaded guilty to document fraud. In an <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure</b> known as “fast track”, hearings were scheduled {{over the course of the}} following three days, in which the judges took guilty pleas from the defendants, who were bound by handcuffs at the wrists as well as chains from their upper torso to their ankles, in groups of ten, and sentenced them immediately, five at a time. Most of the workers were sentenced to five months in prison and were deported afterwards. Before this raid, undocumented people who had no prior records were usually not criminally charged in the aftermath of a raid, and were instantly deported on civil immigration violations. Forty-one of those arrested were allowed to remain in the USA, being granted a special visa, known as U-visa, for those who suffered violent abuse.|$|E

40|$|For years, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{has been}} {{overloaded}} with requests for preliminary rulings, given that these proceedings make {{up more than}} three-quarters of the Court caseload. Such circumstances constitute a significant constraint to the operation of the Court, which is unable to quickly and effectively respond to the preliminary questions which are referred to this Court by the national courts of Member States. In addition, the duration of the regular preliminary ruling proceedings jeopardizes the European standards {{not only in terms of}} the lengthy procedure but also in terms of observing the right of each individual to effective judicial protection within a reasonable time. In order to make the proceedings faster and more effective, the procedural rules have been repeatedly amended and supplemented. The applicable Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate some exceptions from the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The first one is the so-called simplified procedure, where the Court renders a final decision in the form of a reasoned order, without scheduling an oral hearing and obtaining the written opinion of the Advocate-General. The Court may also decide to institute the <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure,</b> by means of which the case at issue is given absolute priority over other cases. The last exception is the urgent procedure, which is applicable only in the area of freedom, security and justice; it implies the omission of certain stages of the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The analyses presented in this paper show that the results achieved in terms of reducing the length of the regular preliminary ruling procedure are generally positive. Thus, the average time required for rendering a decision in the <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure</b> is approximately four and a half months, which is certainly a significant improvement as compared to the length of the regular procedure which takes sixteen to seventeen months. The initial results accomplished by instituting the urgent procedure are even more encouraging, as the average duration of this procedure is approximately two months. The time required for deliberation in an urgent procedure has never exceeded three months, which makes this procedure faster and more efficient than the <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E

Recently, Justice Minister Donner has used an <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure</b> to submit a legislative proposal concerning shielded witnesses. This Bill raises many questions, that concern, amongst others, the discretion of intelligence services to determine which information will be provided for use in criminal proceedings and the relationship between this discretionary power and the connected legal duty of secrecy on the one hand and the rights of the defence to test and question that information on the other. Furthermore, questions raise regarding the evidentiary quality of this information. The proposed rules also influence the legitimacy of criminal law and the position of the criminal courts. What effect does the paradigm of security-orientated thinking have on the historical connection between criminal law and the rule of law? This issue is also addressed in this article...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade is}} {{imperative}} {{for economic growth}} in New Zealand. However, there is lack of engagement from Small to Medium Sized Enterprises given the extensive barriers they face to international markets. The Bilateral Arbitration Treaty (BAT) is one method that aims to increase both trade and access to effective justice. It would replace the default mechanism of cross border litigation with international commercial arbitration for the resolution of international business-to-business disputes. This paper assesses the worth of the BAT in the New Zealand environment considering new issues highlighted by empirical research. These potential impediments include the expense, length and confidentiality of arbitral proceedings. The time length and cost issues raise concerns with access to justice, as protected by s 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (BORA). The confidentiality of BAT proceedings prima facie conflict with open justice and s 14 of BORA. This paper recommends an <b>expedited</b> <b>procedure</b> option and fee structure {{be included in the}} terms of the BAT, in addition to the publication of BAT awards, to allay these concerns. Ultimately, the BAT would be a worthwhile pursuit of the New Zealand government to support increasing trade...|$|E
