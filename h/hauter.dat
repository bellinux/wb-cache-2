50|$|The <b>Haut</b> {{ladies are}} {{completely}} {{distinct from the}} <b>Haut</b> Lords. A select group of them run the <b>haut</b> genome and ensure genetic progress is made {{for the good of}} the <b>haut.</b> Less fortunate <b>haut</b> ladies are given as wives to honor successful ghem, usually decorated admirals or generals. This is a great honor for the ghem, as <b>Haut</b> women are genetically augmented to be extremely attractive, and having a <b>haut</b> wife is a great trophy for a ghem lord. But being given in marriage to a ghem lord is seen as a step down for <b>haut</b> women, who lose the privilege of traveling in force bubbles, and are no longer admitted to haut-only areas. From the perspective of the Star Crèche, such genetically planned mixings are a means to control the introduction of successful <b>haut</b> genetic refinements into the general population. They travel around in a force bubble that prevents others from seeing them unless they wish it, which increases their air of mystery.|$|R

5000|$|The Star Crèche {{contains}} all <b>haut</b> genetic material. The Empress of Cetaganda {{is responsible for}} it, causing her, and the other <b>haut</b> women who run it, to wield enormous power among the <b>haut.</b> <b>Haut,</b> who all have 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome being used to include the new genes introduced by the Star Crèche, do not reproduce on their own but are given genetically engineered <b>haut</b> fetuses in uterine replicators who will become their children, solely {{at the discretion of}} the Star Crèche. Contracts are reached to determine which bloodlines (called [...] "constellations" [...] by the <b>haut)</b> cross and in what ways. The <b>haut</b> ladies who are the genetic engineers of the Star Crèche decide upon new traits they would like to include in each wave of fetuses, so that each generation may be an improvement, or at least a distinct change, from the last. New traits are first tested on the [...] "ba", an asexual, genderless servant caste made up of people genetically very similar to the <b>haut,</b> except for their asexuality, lack of gender, possible visual markers (such as lack of hair), and genes to ensure obedience and discretion. Control of reproduction is another way that the <b>Haut</b> leaders on Cetaganda control the Satraps, the other <b>haut</b> and, by extension, the entire empire.|$|R

50|$|Ghem-caste Cetagandans are a {{military}} caste that carries some engineered genes, but is largely {{free of the}} intensive control over reproduction that so thoroughly pervades the <b>Haut.</b> The Ghem are driven to impress their Haut-caste masters, largely through military conquest, often with disastrous results (at least as revealed in the series to date). The Ghem population functions as an intermediary between the <b>Haut</b> and the lower class by occasionally contributing genetic material to the <b>Haut,</b> and sometimes being awarded <b>Haut</b> women as wives when the Star Creche decides that a new gene {{is ready to be}} released into the Cetagandan population. While a <b>Haut</b> wife is one of the highest honors a Ghem can receive, it means disgrace to the <b>Haut</b> woman, whose high status is lost.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Rockall Trough is a large, lightly explored, {{deep water}} basin {{offshore}} West of Britain. Only the 1 3 2 / 1 5 - 1 well has pene t ra ted Mesozoic section within the Rockall Trough encounter ing a syn-rift section, in terpreted on seismic reflection data, of early Cretaceous age (<b>Hauter</b> ivian-Cenomanian) lying directly on crystalline basement. Older rift events {{have been proposed}} in the Rockall Trough to explain the extensive crustal thinning (Beta = 3 to 5) {{and because of the}} p resence of older rifts on adjacent basins. Although the evidence is not conclusive, analysis of seismic reflection data within the Rockall Trough and of rift system trends on an early Cretaceous plate reconstruct ion do not require or suggest older than Cretaceous rifts in the Rockall Trough but also do not preclude them. Structurally, the Cretaceous rifting is highly assymetric being dominated by faults downthrowing to the southeast. A model of a reactivated Caledonian foreland thrust belt is proposed similar to that repor ted on the adjacent Hebridean shelf...|$|E
