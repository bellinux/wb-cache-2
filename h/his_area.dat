5|$|Chotiner was in {{many ways}} the most {{interesting}} personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging <b>his</b> <b>area</b> of operation. Painted in sinister colors by the press, he was both a public relations problem for Nixon and an invaluable campaign strategist.|$|E
5|$|After pacifying central Vietnam, Duyệt was reappointed {{to be the}} viceroy of {{southern}} Vietnam and Cambodia in 1820 by Emperor Minh Mạng, Gia Long's successor. The emperor further enhanced Duyệt's powers by allowing him the power to oversee all foreign trade coming into <b>his</b> <b>area,</b> and collect taxes in Cambodia and on imports and exports at his discretion. This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development. The southern area had only been populated by ethnic Vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration, clearing and development of land was rapid.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} quicker {{of the two}} teams. Inside a minute, a miskick by Manchester United left back John Aston troubled his defence, and {{presented}} Reg Lewis and Rooke with shooting opportunities. After three minutes, Arsenal took the lead; combination play from Jimmy Logie and Bryn Jones forced goalkeeper Jack Crompton out of <b>his</b> <b>area,</b> and ended with Jones hitting the ball high into an empty net. Lewis headed in Archie Macaulay's cross from the right to double Arsenal's lead, and the team scored their third almost immediately, when Rooke maneuvered past the United defence to shoot past Crompton.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the tournament Paris Saint-Germain beat Valencia by three goals. The French club had made five changes to the side that lost against Arsenal, which worked to their favour as Amara Diané and David N'Gog each scored inside 30 minutes. Valencia {{struggled}} to match their opponents' intensity, though remained a threat with Fernando Morientes' arrival in the second half. The match was settled with five minutes remaining of normal time; Luyindula, on as a substitute, received a pass from Loris Arnaud which drew goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand out of <b>his</b> <b>area</b> and allowed the French striker to tap the ball into an empty net.|$|E

5|$|The Boers {{enclosed}} Ladysmith on 2 November, {{beginning a}} 118-day siege. The King's, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Llewelyn Mellor, became {{assigned to the}} north-eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox, a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in <b>his</b> <b>area.</b> Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night, although rain, oppressive heat, and cold limited the opportunity to rest. On 6 January, the King's mounted infantry helped repulse a Boer attempt to penetrate the southern perimeter. By late January, the scarcity of supplies had become particularly acute. Disease pervaded while the town resorted to consuming the garrison's horses and mules.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of his own, and exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph—for most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid—and to forward some tax revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival to the real power behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended <b>his</b> <b>area</b> of control over Syria up to the border zone with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of <b>his</b> <b>area</b> of expertise.|$|E

5|$|Headquartered in the Sydney {{suburb of}} Edgecliff, Eastern Area Command was formed on 15May 1942 under the {{leadership}} of Air Vice Marshal Bill Anderson. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers. Training units in New South Wales remained part of No.2 (Training) Group. No.5 (Maintenance) Group was formed in Sydney on 1June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by Eastern Area Command. In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the South West Pacific Area, Major General George Kenney, formed the majority of his US flying units into the Fifth Air Force, and most of their Australian counterparts into RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock. Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and <b>his</b> <b>area</b> commanders were ultimately dependent on the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, for supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 16 of the competition, Luton faced Ipswich Town of the Second Division. Without several senior players because of ineligibility and injury, Luton scored early through Brian Stein's strike, and then {{produced}} a solid defensive performance, reliant on goalkeeper Les Sealey {{to earn a}} place in the quarter-finals. The result marked Ipswich's first defeat of the season, having earlier recorded 10 wins and two draws at Portman Road. Luton hosted Bradford City in the fifth round of the competition on 19 January 1988. A mistake by Bradford goalkeeper Paul Tomlinson handed Luton the lead four minutes before the hour, when he gave away a free kick for handling the ball in <b>his</b> <b>area.</b> A shot from Danny Wilson in the 65th minute resulted in Luton's second goal; though his effort was saved by Tomlinson, the goalkeeper could not fend off the advancing Harford's header.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in <b>his</b> <b>area</b> and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{system of}} county courts in England and Wales {{dates from the}} County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with {{the exception of the}} City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 courts. Four of these circuits were wholly in Wales, as were 46 of these courts. A further seven courts were located in Monmouthshire (which had at the time an ambiguous status and was sometimes treated as being part of England) and these seven courts were part of a circuit for Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in <b>his</b> <b>area</b> as necessary, sitting in each court at least once a month. Few permanent courts were needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.|$|E
5|$|The uprisings were {{supposed}} to be simultaneous, but Học sent a last-minute order to Nhu to postpone action until February 15. The messenger was arrested by the French and Nhu was unaware of the change in schedule. Yen Bay was a military post comprising more than 600 troops in four companies of infantry. These were commanded by twenty French officers and non-commissioned officers. VNQDĐ members had been espousing revolutionary sentiment in the area for several months and there was considerable tension in the town leading up to the planned mutiny. The nearby village of Sơn Dương in Phú Thọ was a hotbed of preparations, as many of the bombs used by the VNQDĐ were manufactured there. More than 100 bombs were made at the home of Nguyen Bac Dang, who also led the recruitment of villagers in <b>his</b> <b>area.</b> It was there that Nhu prepared a command post to coordinate what would be the centrepiece of the attack, the assaults against Yên Bái and Phú Thọ.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini, {{a staunch}} anti-Communist {{who opposed the}} fight for land of Sicilian peasants, {{organised}} his own peasant cooperatives in <b>his</b> <b>area</b> during both post-war periods, through which he deflected {{the appeal of the}} left-wing parties, maintained his hold over the peasants, and guaranteed his own continued access to the land. He was in a fierce dispute over the lease of the large estate Miccichè of the Trabia family in Palermo, with a peasant cooperative headed by Michele Pantaleone who had founded the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano – PSI) in Villalba. Vizzini had tried hard to persuade Pantaleone to marry his niece but failed. Pantaleone used his leverage with the left wing press. In return Don Calò arranged for the crops on Pantaleone family’s land to be vandalized. There was even a failed attempt on Pantaleone’s life.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of <b>his</b> <b>area</b> to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
