5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

25|$|Mourinho {{is highly}} renowned for his {{tactical}} prowess, game management and adaptability to different situations. A usual feature of his teams <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> {{three or more}} central midfielders, as Mourinho has stressed midfield superiority as crucial in winning games. As a Porto manager, Mourinho employed a diamond 4–4–2 formation, with his midfield – consisting of Costinha or Pedro Mendes as defensive midfielder; Maniche and Dmitri Alenichev as wide central midfielders; and Deco on the tip – acting as a cohesive unit rather than a collection of individuals, providing Porto with midfield superiority while allowing the full-backs to move forward.|$|E

25|$|A flick shot is a straight-batted shot {{played on}} the leg side by {{flicking}} a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs.

It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, the flick can also be played by lofting the ball over the infield.|$|E
25|$|Military bands or {{corps of}} drums were {{historically}} the first marching bands. Instrumentation in these bands varies but generally consists of brass, woodwinds, and percussion. Due {{to their original}} purpose, military marching bands typically march in a forward direction with consistent straight lines. Music is performed at a constant tempo (120–140 BPM) to facilitate the steady marching of the entire military group the band <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with.</b> The marching step size, or interval, is consistent, and usually at a 6 to 5 (six steps per five yards) or 8 to 5 (eight steps to five yards). This style includes field music units such as drum and bugle corps or bugle bands, pipe bands, and fife and drum corps.|$|E

Kay <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> ice crystals when the Snow Queen asks {{him if he}} knows what love is.

While the coach travels through a dark woods, they are stopped by a gang of robbers, who take Gerda and strip the coach of its gold plate, sparing the attendants. An old hag takes Gerda, but when she is bitten on the ear by her daughter Angel, who is riding on her back, she listens to her request to keep Gerda with her other captive pets. These pets include a fox, little rabbits, the birds that were spared the Snow Queen's frost earlier, and a large reindeer, named Bucky Boy. The birds tell Gerda that they saw the Snow Queen take Kay with her to Lapland. The reindeer offers to take Gerda there. It remains for the robber girl to let Gerda and Bucky Boy go, which she does. She also releases the birds, the fox, and the rabbits, but they decide to stay with her.|$|E

500|$|Enforcers {{typically}} only fight each other, {{with only}} the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight. There is {{a high degree of}} respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory. This is also known as granting a [...] "free pass". Enforcer Darren McCarty described fighters as being divided into [...] "heavyweights" [...] and [...] "light heavyweights", and said that players in the former category [...] "end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch." ...|$|E
500|$|Engels {{felt that}} the three largest {{influences}} on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West, Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive—the inclusion of a one-armed character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has {{also noted that the}} series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a [...] "familiar" [...] framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers {{nothing out of the ordinary}} other than the single domino which Jennings <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> at all times, drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which seems out of place.|$|E

500|$|With his {{contract}} expiring in the off-season, Teemu Selänne, who had since {{returned to the}} Ducks, was reportedly in talks with team management to sign Kariya. On August 27, 2010, however, {{on the advice of}} doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010–11 season with post-concussion syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA. He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players; {{in an interview with the}} Globe and Mail, he commented, [...] "The thing I worry about is that you'll get a guy who <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a concussion, and he gets hit, and he dies at centre ice." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about a}} heartbreak, where the protagonist can't {{relinquish}} his grip on a dysfunctional relationship, even if the girl <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> his heart, he's being used and his feelings are being thrown to the side. The song opens with Zayn singing, [...] "She got, she got, she got/Her own reason for talking to me/She don't, she don't, she don't/Give a f**k/About what I need," [...] before continuing: [...] "Tell me your lies/Because I just can't face it." [...] In the chorus, he repeats: [...] "It's you, it's you, it's you," [...] showing that he [...] "can't seem to fight his feelings about th girl being 'the one,' but [...] "also referring {{to the loss of}} that love he is dealing with based off of her and her decisions within their relationship." [...] Several critics believed that the song was written about Zayn's break-up with former fiancée Perrie Edwards.|$|E
500|$|When Stan Lee {{approaches}} Database, who <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a toy Batmobile, he {{asks him}} if he would rather prefer a more exciting action figure. Lee then begins shoving a The Thing action figure into the Batmobile, effectively destroying it. This scene pokes fun at the DC vs. Marvel rivalry (Batman's Batmobile of DC Comics and The Thing a property of Marvel Comics). Another scene in the episode references Danish physicist Niels Bohr. In his book What's Science Ever Done For Us: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe, Paul Halpern wrote [...] "In the episode , one of Homer's favorite TV shows is preempted by the program The Boring World of Niels Bohr. Homer is so upset that he clutches an ice-cream sandwich, aims it at the screen like it's a remote control, squeezes out its contents, and splatters Bohr's image. In contrast to Homer's reaction, most physicists heap nothing but accolades upon Bohr, whose revolutionary ideas shaped the modern concept of the atom." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally from Nigeria, Mr. Eko {{was born}} on January 31, 1968. He grew up always looking after his younger brother, Yemi (Adetokumboh M'Cormack), with whom {{he lived in a}} small village.

Impressed by his actions, the guerrillas take Eko away with them and draw him away from his religious lifestyle and into the criminal life, where Eko adopted the title [...] "Mr." [...] He grows up to be a fearless drug lord and a vicious leader of a guerrilla group, while his brother becomes an honoured priest. Years after his abduction, Eko returns to his home village to ask Yemi to help him smuggle heroin, which Eko has hidden in a large number of Virgin Mary statues and intends to fly out of the country.

500|$|Kohli {{and other}} senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh {{ahead of the}} England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series {{averaging}} just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39. He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging {{the ball to the}} wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times, while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers. Geoffrey Boycott said, [...] "Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique and get back to basics". India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.|$|E
500|$|Other {{examples}} of the work as a parody can be taken from {{the names of the}} Scriptores themselves. It has been suggested that [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] and [...] "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius" [...] were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC. With respect to [...] "Trebellius Pollio", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of Mark Antony who was mentioned in the Philippics (Phil, 11.14), and another reference to him in Epistulae ad Familiares along with the term [...] "Pollentiam" [...] reminded the History's author of Asinius Pollio, who was a fellow Plebeian Tribune alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well. This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] by [...] "Flavius Vopiscus" [...] {{at the start of the}} Life of Aurelian, with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's published Commentaries. Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the Cognomen Fides for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it is no coincidence that, in selecting the name [...] "Trebellius Pollio", the author <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> the concepts of fides and fidelitas historica at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] and [...] "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius".|$|E
