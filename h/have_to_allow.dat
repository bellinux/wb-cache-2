That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp. In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> services like Yelp the ability {{to opt out of}} having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.|$|E

On September 1, Nanjing was taken. When the rebellion was suppressed, Sun and other instigators fled to Japan. In October 1913 an intimidated parliament formally elected Yuan Shikai President of the Republic of China, and the major powers extended recognition to his government. Duan Qirui and other trusted Beiyang generals were given prominent positions in the cabinet. To achieve international recognition, Yuan Shikai had to agree to autonomy for Outer Mongolia and Tibet. China was still to be suzerain, but it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Russia a free hand in Outer Mongolia and Tanna Tuva and Britain continuation of its influence in Tibet.|$|E

Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time. IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied {{that this was the}} purpose of his celebration by saying, [...] "I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy". Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory.

2500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} basic interest rate {{as determined by the}} Federal Reserve. The interest above the basic rate applied by the lender is a financial intermediation service and is subject to the FairTax (on a typical home mortgage only about one-half of one percent of interest would be subject to tax). Several economic studies have estimated that switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system such as the FairTax would result in an interest rate drop of approximately 25%. These changes would result in a decreased cost for home buyers. [...] As a comparison to the FairTax for encouraging home ownership, the current tax system would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> all taxpayers to fully deduct the purchase of used property against income and payroll taxes, expand the mortgage interest deduction so that it permits a deduction against payroll taxes, fully untax interest income to lenders and institutions, and fully untax returns on savings. [...] However, since several areas would be tax free under the FairTax plan, it could decrease the social incentive to spend more on homes in favor of savings, education, or other investments.|$|E

2500|$|Bryson's {{start to}} the season was {{hampered}} by an injury which he {{picked up in the}} opening game of the season away to Bolton Wanderers on 8 August. He was taken off in the 21st minute suffering from what was later revealed to be a stretched ligament on the inside of his knee and was ruled out for 2 to 4 weeks. However, he was ruled out for longer than first thought; six weeks later, new Derby manager Paul Clement reported that Bryson was still feeling some discomfort in his knee, which meant he was [...] "finding some things difficult to do relating to shooting and long passing". A week later, on 1 October, Clement revealed that Bryson had had injections in his knee to speed up the healing process and would thus miss training for a fortnight to allow his knee to settle. Clement said that [...] "I think we all underestimated the severity of the injury he picked up on the opening day just because of his character. He wanted to push and push to get back as soon as possible but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> the healing process to take place." [...] Bryson returned to training on 16 October, played 90 minutes in an under-21 match against Newcastle United on 26 October and finally made his return to first team action on 31 October, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute for new signing Jacob Butterfield in a 3–0 win against Rotherham.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremiah Gurney (1812–1895) {{was born}} in Coeymans, New York. Gurney, then a jeweler in Saratoga, N.Y. {{became one of the}} first, if not the first student in America to learn the [...] "new art" [...] of daguerreian photography. Gurney was taught the process by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1839, who {{explained}} to Gurney that [...] "What you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> for is the initial outlay [...] [...] And there is of course my fee." [...] The fee was thought to have been fifty dollars. Gurney was not listed in the New York city directories until 1843, when he appears as a daguerreian at 189 Broadway. In the 1850s [...] "Gurney's Daguerreian Gallery" [...] offered mammoth daguerreotype prints from double full size plates. In 1852, he took time off to recover from a common illness of the daguerreian trade, mercury vapor poisoning. In 1857 Gurney was listed in the New York City Directory at 359 Broadway, in partnership with C.D Fredericks. In 1860, he was listed as a [...] "photographist" [...] at 707 Broadway, in business as [...] "J. Gurney and Son." [...] Gurney and son Benjamin advanced paper photography {{with the use of the}} [...] "Chrystalotype" [...] process. Jeremiah Gurney is probably best known for his having taken a photograph of Abraham Lincoln in an open coffin April 24, 1865, as the President's body lay in state in City Hall, New York City. The episode caused much distress to Mary Lincoln, who had forbid the taking of any photographs of her husband's corpse. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was furious and succeeded in confiscating all of the existing prints and negatives but one. In 1874 Gurney's partnership with his son was dissolved. In April 1895, Jeremiah Gurney began a journal that was later gifted to the New York Historical Society by the photographer's great-great grandniece, Miss Elizabeth May Possons.|$|E
2500|$|The Parade {{column and}} its {{response}} received considerable {{attention in the}} press, including a front page story in the New York Times in which Monty Hall himself was interviewed. [...] Hall understood the problem, giving the reporter a demonstration with car keys and explaining how actual game play on Let's Make a Deal differed from {{the rules of the}} puzzle. In the article, Hall pointed out that because he had control over the way the game progressed, playing on the psychology of the contestant, the theoretical solution did not apply to the show's actual gameplay. He said he was not surprised at the experts' insistence that the probability was 1 out of 2. [...] "That's the same assumption contestants would make on the show after I showed them there was nothing behind one door," [...] he said. [...] "They'd think the odds on their door had now gone up to 1 in 2, so they hated to give up the door no matter how much money I offered. By opening that door we were applying pressure. We called it the Henry James treatment. It was 'The Turn of the Screw.'“ Hall clarified that as a game show host {{he did not have to}} follow the rules of the puzzle in the vos Savant column and did not always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> a person the opportunity to switch (e.g., he might open their door immediately if it was a losing door, might offer them money to not switch from a losing door to a winning door, or might only allow them the opportunity to switch if they had a winning door).
