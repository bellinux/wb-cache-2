40|$|ABSTRACT: The hnRNP C 1 and C 2 {{proteins}} {{are abundant}} nuclear proteins that bind avidly to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>RNAs</b> (hnRNAs) {{and appear to}} be involved with pre-mRNA processing. The RNA-binding activity of the hnRNP C proteins is contained in the amino-terminal 94 amino acid RNA-binding domain (RBD) that is identical for these two proteins. We have obtained the 'H, 13 C, and 15 N N M R assignments for the RBD of the human hnRNP C proteins. The assignment process was facilitated by extensive utilization of three- and four-dimensional heteronuclear-edited spectra. Sequential assignments of the backbone resonances were made using a combination of I 5 N-edited 3 D NOESY-HMQC, 3 D TOCSY-HMQC, and 3 D TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC as well as 3 D HNCA, HNCO, and HCACO spectra. Side-chain resonances were assigned using 3 D HCCH-COSY and 3 D HCH-TOCSY spectra. Four-dimensional I 3 C/I 3 C-edited NOESY and I 3 C/l 5 N-edited NOESY experiments were used to unambigously resolve NOEs. The overall global folding pattern was established by calculating a set of preliminary structures using constraints derived from the sequential NOES and a small number of long-range NOEs.

The RNA {{recognition}} motif (RRM), {{also known}} as the RNA-binding domain (RBD) or ribonucleopro-tein domain (RNP), was first identified in the late 1980 s when it was demonstrated that mRNA precur-sors (pre-mRNA) and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>RNAs</b> (hnRNAs) are always found in complex with proteins (reviewed in [1]). Biochemical characterizations of the mRNA polyadenylate binding protein (PABP) and the hnRNP protein C shed light on a consensus RNA-binding domain of approximately 90 amino acids containing a central sequence of eight con-served residues that are mainly aromatic and posi-tively charged [2, 3].

Based on sequence and structural motifs, 113 of these RNAs can be assigned to the C/D box or H/ACA box subclass of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), known as guide RNAs for rRNA. While 30 RNAs represent mouse homologues of previously identified human C/D or H/ACA snoRNAs, 83 correspond to entirely novel snoRNAs.

Although a variety of factors contribute to the development of this deficiency, effects of chronic alcohol use on renal thiamin transport have not been thoroughly examined. We addressed this issue by examining the effect of chronic alcohol feeding of rats with liquid diet on physiological and molecular parameters of renal thiamin transport. Chronic alcohol feeding caused a significant inhibition in carrier-mediated thiamin transport across the renal brush-border membrane and was evident as early as 2 wk after initiation of alcohol feeding. Similarly, thiamin transport across the renal basolateral membrane was significantly inhibited by chronic alcohol feeding. The inhibition in renal thiamin transport was associated with a marked decrease in the level of expression of THTR 1 and - 2 proteins, mRNAs, and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Chronic alcohol feeding also caused a significant reduction in the level of expression of thiamin pyrophosphokinase but not that of the mitochondrial thiamin pyrophosphate transporter.

S 1 proteins A-D are those selectively extracted at pH 4. 9 from isolated nuclei pretreated with either RNase A or DNase I. In the present study we identified S 1 ('first supernatant') proteins B 2, C 1 and D 1 with p 45, p 40 and p 37 AUF 1 s respectively, by microsequencing and product analysis of transfected cDNAs. We found, further, that more than 96 % of the S 1 proteins occurred in the nucleus, and localized largely in RNase-sensitive structures. B 2 was confined in the nucleus and C 1 directly bound to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>RNAs</b> (hnRNAs). These B 2 and C 1 proteins formed hnRNP structures responsible for the 33 S, and, to lesser extent, the 40 S particles, which were liberated upon mild nucleolytic cleavage. On the other hand, D 1 and the remainder of C 1 were associated with nuclease-hypersensitive sites of hnRNAs, and comprised the major cytoplasmic AUF 1 s that {{may be involved in}} mRNA decay. Two-dimensional immunoblotting resolved each S 1 isoform into up to six spots or more, and suggested that the previous uncertain relationship of hnRNP D 0 and hnRNP D is resolved in terms of charge differences and differential splicing arising from one gene. The present results thus indicate that S 1 proteins B 2, C 1 and D 1 are identical with AUF 1 proteins, but largely occur as hnRNP proteins in the nucleus. That hnRNP D 0 is indeed an hnRNP protein was verified...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{polymerase}} {{activities in}} intact HeLa cell nuclei {{have been examined}} and compared to activities investigated in previous studies of the purified enzymes. The RNA synthesized by the mammalian polymerases while still in nuclei is identified. The polymerases are tentatively identified by location, sensitivity to α-amanitin, and response to manganese and altered ionic strength. Polymerase I {{is located in the}} nucleolus and labels partially complete precursor molecules of ribosomal RNA. Polymerases II and III are in the nucleoplasm and both label giant <b>nuclear</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>RNA...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{isolated and}} characterized a human myeloma cell line overproducing ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) due to gene amplification [Leinonen, Alhonen-Hongisto, Laine, Jänne & Jänne (1987) Biochem. J. 242, 199 - 203]. We have now employed the PCR combined with reverse transcription to determine semiquantitatively ODC gene dosage and {{the amounts of}} <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> (hn) <b>RNA</b> and of mature mRNA of the enzyme in parental and alpha-difluoromethylornithine-resistant human myeloma cells. Experiments with dilution series revealed that the ODC gene copy number {{and the amount of}} both hnRNA and mRNA were increased to the same extent (about 100 -fold) in the resistant cells. Similar dot-blot analyses of ODC-specific genomic DNA and total RNA indicated that the ODC gene copy number was increased by a factor of 380 and the amount of ODC mRNA by a factor of 700. Our results indicate that the PCR combined with reverse transcription is at least as useful as blot analyses to give semiquantitative assessment of the amounts of specific DNA or RNA sequences. In addition, the use of the PCR enables the analysis of minute sample amounts in extremely short time...|$|R
