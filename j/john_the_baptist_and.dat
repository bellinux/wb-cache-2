5|$|Jesus was a Galilean Jew, born {{around the}} {{beginning}} of the 1st century, who died in 30 or 33 AD in Judea. The general scholarly consensus is that Jesus was a contemporary of <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> <b>and</b> was crucified by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who held office from 26 to 36 AD.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist,</b> <b>and</b> carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E

5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> <b>and</b> in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

25|$|The Sermon on the Mount (anglicized {{from the}} Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: Sermo in monte) is a {{collection}} of sayings and teachings of Jesus, which emphasizes his moral teaching found in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5, 6, and 7).

25|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} a fringe theory not {{supported}} by any tenured specialists in biblical criticism or cognate disciplines; it contradicts the mainstream historical view, which {{is that while the}} gospels include many mythical or legendary elements, these are religious elaborations added to the biography of a historical Jesus who did live in 1st-century Roman Palestine, was baptized by <b>John</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> <b>and</b> was crucified by the order of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate.|$|E
