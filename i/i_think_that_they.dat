500|$|On how Wilkes {{connects to}} Carter, Austin said Wilkes is [...] "one {{of the top}} {{scientists}} in his field , but he’s {{had to work hard}} to get there. It’s sort of a similar struggle of an African-American and a woman in the 1940s to try to succeed, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both see that in one another and that’s part of where the chemistry and connection comes from." [...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional. I think that Sousa likes Wilkes enough and it’s the same the other way".|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{fluency in}} several languages, Sarria was {{assigned}} to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> figured that I was a little bit gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{criminal}} {{case against the}} men charged has been met with strong criticism as well as conflict between members of the prosecution, complicating the investigation.

2500|$|West Germany, in {{conjunction}} with other European countries, conducted a secret study from 1951 to 1954, also concluding that UFOs were extraterrestrial. This study was revealed by German rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth, who headed the study and who also made many public statements supporting the ETH in succeeding years. [...] At the study's conclusion in 1954, Oberth declared, [...] "These objects (UFOs) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy." [...] Soon afterwards, in an article in The American Weekly, October 24, 1954, Oberth wrote [...] "It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> possibly are manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries..." ...|$|E

Many orders might have been given, but few obeyed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were panic stricken; it was a rout, as I said before.|$|E
2500|$|Tony and Mandy begin a relationship. Dunn {{said that}} when she was first {{informed}} of the storyline she was surprised. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, [...] "it did actually work". The pair marry and later have a child who they name Grace. Grace dies from suspected SIDS and the pair split. Pickard said [...] "If they hadn't lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened". Dunn said that the storyline worked well, saying [...] "as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick and I both knew how we would play things and it worked". Tony leaves Hollyoaks with Mandy and her daughter. Tony returns three months later without Mandy. Dunn explained the reason for Tony leaving Mandy saying: [...] "Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos". Dunn revealed Mandy wanted revenge for this. In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes [...] "Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: [...] "they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again. So there's the possibility that their relationship might be re-kindled".|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E

Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E
