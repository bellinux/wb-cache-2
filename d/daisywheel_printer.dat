50|$|Compared {{to earlier}} consumer-oriented color {{printers}}, inkjet printers {{have a number}} of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot matrix or <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printers.</b> They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic-quality printing are widely available.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{best known for the}} HyType I, HyType II, and Diablo 630 <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printers,</b> but also {{produced}} the hard disk drives that were resold by DEC as the RK02 and RK03. Lead engineers Jonny Skolnick and Eli Fenyes headed operations at the division.|$|R
50|$|IBM 5219 - A <b>daisywheel</b> impact <b>printer</b> not {{far removed}} from the IBM typewriters. It was good for about 40 {{characters}} per second (CPS).|$|R
50|$|Many impact printers, {{such as the}} <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printer</b> and {{dot matrix}} printer, used a print head that printed a {{character}} then moved on until an entire line was printed. Line printers were much faster, as each impact printed an entire line.|$|E
50|$|Several other I/O {{devices were}} {{developed}} for the Alto, including a TV camera, the Hy-Type <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printer</b> and a parallel port, although these were quite rare. The Alto could also control external disk drives {{to act as a}} file server. This was a common application for the machine.|$|E
5000|$|Kaypro 2X - The Kaypro 2X {{was similar}} to the Kaypro 4, but it lacked the {{built-in}} 300 baud modem that was available in the Kaypro 4. Kaypro 2X's were often sold in a bundle with the Wordstar word processing software suite, spreadsheet and database software. The impact printer that was also included in the bundle was labeled as the [...] "Kaypro Printer," [...] but was actually a re-branded Juki 6100 <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived <b>printers,</b> teletypewriter-derived <b>printers,</b> <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printers,</b> dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.|$|R
5000|$|An {{updated version}} of this {{computer}} called the model 16/8 ran dual CPUs, an 8-bit Z80 and 16-bit Intel 8086, which could be booted jointly or separately. The operating system was 8-bit CP/M 80 and 16-bit CP/M 86, and it was supplied with the Word Perfect word processor and dBase II database management system. It had double 8" [...] floppy disk drives, a 12" [...] monochrome monitor and a <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printer.</b> Later in 1984 double 5.25 floppy disk drives, a portrait-size blue monitor, and a laser printer were offered. The Model 16/8 is also called a Xerox 823.|$|E
50|$|From {{the start}} Robert Temple Catalogues were {{set on a}} computer: {{originally}} on magnetic tape, but then, as this was difficult to edit when re-cataloguing unsold stock, they very soon went over instead to setting catalogues on the handier magnetic cards that were enjoying a brief vogue in about 1980-81. In 1982 they acquired their first P.C. from Premier Business Systems, a firm but recently founded by Charles Ross. This used a rudimentary program written in machine-code and designed for booksellers. The program incorporated a 'user-level' language, which was fairly basic, and in this Allen wrote a program capable of outputting catalogues in a style and format similar to those they had previously published. Up to this point all the catalogues had been produced as hard copy on a <b>daisywheel</b> <b>printer,</b> but Premier Business Systems morphed, first into Owl Microsystems, then, in December 1983, into 'The Clue Computing Company' (later to be bought by Bristol Office Machines), and they produced a system written in a higher-level language called CLUE, which {{was the brainchild of}} another bookseller, Mark Westwood. Allen produced his own system in this language (which is still in use by the firm to-day), and went over to producing hard-copy on a laser-printer. The original floppy discs were replaced in 1984 by Tandon Datapacs, and then, in 1990, after the advent of the cheap Winchester, by the conventional hard-discs we know to-day.|$|E
