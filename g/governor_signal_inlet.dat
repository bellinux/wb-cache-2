The Malayan Union was placed {{under the jurisdiction of}} a British <b>Governor,</b> <b>signalling</b> the formal inauguration of British colonial rule in the Malay peninsula. Moreover, while the State Councils were still kept functioning in the former Federated Malay States, they lost the limited autonomy that they enjoyed, left to administer only some less important local aspects of government, and became an extended hand of the Federal government in Kuala Lumpur. Also, British Residents replacing the Sultans {{as the head of the}} State Councils meant that the political status of the Sultans were greatly reduced.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{an engine}} {{transient}} condition, effects of different exhaust mass flows, <b>inlet</b> <b>signal</b> amplitudes and periods on dynamic {{responses of the}} three-way catalytic converter were investigated experimentally. Experimental results show that exhaust mass flows, <b>inlet</b> <b>signal</b> amplitudes and periods have important influence on engine emissions and oxygen storage capacity of Ceria for the three-way catalytic converter with CeO 2 catalyst in the washcoat. With the increase of the exhaust mass flow, the lambda outlet signal increases nonlinearly; emissions are better {{at the beginning and}} then turns deteriorated {{in the case of a}} high mass flow after the lean-rich transition. Outlet lambda increases almost linearly with the increase of exhaust mass flows and lambda outlet signal amplitudes after the richlean transition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} on model predictive {{control of the}} combustion phasing in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. The controllers were based on linearizations of a previously presented physical model of HCCI including cylinder wall temperature dynamics. The control <b>signals</b> were the <b>inlet</b> air temperature and the inlet valve closing. A system for fast thermal management was installed and controlled using mid-ranging control. The resulting control performance was experimentally evaluated in terms of response time and steady-state output variance. For a given operating point, a comparable decrease in steady-state output variance was obtained either by introducing a disturban ce model or by changing linearization point. The robustness towards disturbances was investigated {{as well as the}} effects of varying the prediction and control horizons...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. In recent years, agricultural farms in Peru have started to implement equipment for anaerobic digestion of the organic residues of their production. At first, the main objective of the implementation was to obtain bio-fertilizers, but in this process, biogas was also obtained. Farms in Peru did not use this biofuel in any process, {{which is why they}} freed it or burnt it in torches, polluting the environment in both ways, due to the biogas content of methane. This last fuel has a high global warming potential (GWP) and carbon dioxide, result of the biogas burning is also a pollutant. In this context, an experimental device was designed and built to evaluate the performance of a Diesel cycle engine generator set of 40 kW using diesel and biogas as fuels. The generator set had a fixed speed of 1800 RPM. The tests were initially carried out using only diesel as fuel to obtain comparable parameters. The tests were made simulating an electric load of 62. 5 %. After this, a conversion kit was installed to allow the use of biogas in the engine. This equipment controls the Duty Cycle, which is a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the percentage of time the injectors are opened. The kit used as input signals the generated power, the electronic <b>governor</b> <b>signal</b> and the exhaust gases temperature. Then, tests were carried out partially substituting diesel for biogas. The biogas used for the test contained approximately 40 % of methane. The results indicated that for higher Duty Cycles (higher quantities of biogas), the exhaust temperatures increased, due to the superior temperature of biogas combustion. With the percentage of methane available in the biogas, the substitution rates reached 17, 9 % and 36, 7 %, maintaining the generated power and reducing significantly the consumption of diesel. This technology makes possible the modular production of electric energy in agricultural farms, usually isolated, allowing the use of biogas commonly produced in the same place with the organic residues they manage, diminishing pollution, reducing costs and using the energy for useful purposes. dc 201...|$|R

50|$|I-93 {{continues}} through the northern suburbs of Boston, coming in Woburn {{to a second}} intersection with Interstate 95 and Route 128, which run in a concurrency. Travelers going north can either change over to I-95 north to eventually reach Maine, or remain on I-93 toward New Hampshire. Farther north, in Andover, I-93 meets I-495, providing access to Worcester to the southwest and New Hampshire's seacoast region to the northeast. Just south of the state line, I-93 crosses the Merrimack River into Methuen, where it interchanges with Routes 110 and 113 at exit 46 {{just north of the}} river crossing. Prior to August 2016, the Route 110 and 113 junction beneath I-93 was a rotary, but current construction routes the highways straight under I-93. While two new ramps are being built at the interchange to complete the new partial cloverleaf format, there are temporary <b>signals</b> and <b>inlets</b> at the end of two existing ramps to serve traffic that will soon be using the new loop ramps. Work began in July 2014 on the project, and with the rotary now closed, demolition of the rotary will be underway in late 2016. The full project is scheduled for completion in June 2018. I-93 then interchanges with the western end of Route 213, a connector between I-93 and I-495. I-93 then crosses into New Hampshire after about 1 mi.|$|R
40|$|The inlet attack {{angle of}} rotor blade {{reasonably}} {{can be adjusted}} with the change of the stagger angle of inlet guide vane (IGV), so the compressor efficiency of each operating condition will be affected. For the purpose to improve the efficiency, the DSP (Digital Signal Processor) controller is designed to adjust the stagger angle of IGV in order to optimize the efficiency at any operating condition automatically. The A/D <b>signal</b> collection includes <b>inlet</b> static pressure, outlet static pressure, outlet total pressure, rotor speed and torque signal, then the efficiency can be calculated in the DSP, and the angle signal for the stepping motor which control the IGV will be sent out from the D/A. Experimental investigations are performed on a three-stage, low-speed axial compressor with variable inlet guide vanes. It is demonstrated that the DSP designed can well adjust the stagger angle of IGV online, and the efficiency under different operating conditions can be optimized. The establishment of this DSP online adjustment scheme may provide a practical solution for improving performance of multi-stage axial flow compressor when its operating condition is varied...|$|R
40|$|The {{active control}} of {{rotating}} stall {{in a low}} speed centrifugal compressor is investigated. In particular, {{a study of the}} applicability of a controlled inlet distortion as a means of adjusting system damping and suppressing a rotating stall condition is performed. ^ As motivation for such a study, results on the stall initiation behavior of the Purdue Low Speed Centrifugal Research Compressor (PLCRC) are presented. These results indicate that the progression into rotating stall is gradual, being characterized by one or more weak spatial pressure waves which grow, {{over a period of several}} impeller revolutions, into a large scale rotating stall condition. ^ Based on this evidence, a mathematical model is developed to predict the effectiveness of a controlled inlet distortion as a means of suppressing rotating stall. The results from this model predict that a correcting inlet waveform, when introduced at an optimum phase angle, will be able to extend the range over which the compressor operates stably. ^ Based on the predictions from this mathematical model, an experimental verification of the stalling behavior of the PLCRC under the influence of a controlled inlet distortion is presented. Employing an array of air injection jets as the distortion generator, the control system introduces a phased inlet distortion based on a measured static pressure <b>signal</b> in the <b>inlet.</b> Suppression of one-cell rotating stall is achieved, and the recovery of the compressor from such a condition is also accomplished. ...|$|R
40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{principle}} holds {{promise to}} increase efficiency and to reduce emissions from internal combustion engines. As HCCI combustion lacks direct ignition timing control and auto-ignition depends on the operating condition, control of auto-ignition is necessary. Since auto-ignition of a homogeneous mixture is very sensitive to operating conditions, a fast combustion phasing control is necessary for reliable operation. To this purpose, HCCI modeling and model-based control with experimental validation were studied. A six-cylinder heavy-duty HCCI engine was controlled on a cycle-to-cycle basis in real time {{using a variety of}} sensors, actuators and control structures for control of the HCCI combustion in comparison. The controllers were based on linearizations of a previously presented physical, nonlinear, model of HCCI including cylinder wall temperature dynamics. The control <b>signals</b> were the <b>inlet</b> air temperature and the inlet valve closing. A system for fast thermal management was installed and controlled using mid-ranging control. The resulting control performance was experimentally evaluated in terms of response time and steady-state output variance. For a given operating point, a comparable decrease in steady-state output variance was obtained either by introducing a disturbance model or by changing linearization point. The robustness towards disturbances was investigated as well as the effects of varying the prediction and control horizons. Increasing the horizons had a very limited effect on the closed-loop performance while increasing the computational demands substantially. As shown in the paper, modeling constitutes a necessary element for embedded networked control design applied to HCCI combustion engine design...|$|R
40|$|Although {{angiotensin}} II (Ang II) {{was reported}} to facilitate sperm motility and intratesticular sperm transport, recent findings {{shed light on the}} efficacy of Ang II in stimulating inflammatory events in testicular peritubular cells, effect of which {{may play a role in}} male infertility. It is still unknown whether Ang II can induce testicular apoptotic cell death, which may be a more direct action of Ang II in male infertility. Therefore, the present study aims to determine whether Ang II can induce testicular apoptotic cell death and whether this action can be prevented by sulforaphane (SFN) via activating nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (NRF 2), the <b>governor</b> of antioxidant-redox <b>signalling.</b> Eight-week-old male C 57 BL/ 6 J wild type (WT) and Nrf 2 gene knockout mice were treated with Ang II, in the presence or absence of SFN. In WT mice, SFN activated testicular NRF 2 expression and function, along with a marked attenuation in Ang II-induced testicular oxidative stress, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptotic cell death. Deletion of the Nrf 2 gene led to a complete abolishment of these efficacies of SFN. The present study indicated that Ang II may result in testicular apoptotic cell death, which can be prevented by SFN via the activation of NRF 2...|$|R
40|$|Many studies about heat {{transfer}} characterization of single phase fixed bed matrix regenerators {{are devoted to}} the finding of experimental correlations. Despite several deep investigations, the emerged correlations are not well established, indeed the high complexity of the processes involved, {{the shape of the}} solid-fluid interface, the complexity of the geometry of the solid matrix, make accurate experimental data difficult to obtain. The aim of the present work pursuit a double objective: (i) to develop and propose an inverse method to identify h, the fluid-matrix {{heat transfer}} coefficient, by means of transient simulated experiments, and (ii) to investigate the sensitivity of the h reconstruction process to the variation of the control input parameters and material properties, in order to find the optimal value of the experimental control variables that allows the identification of this unknown coefficient to be performed with "minimum variance". The reconstruction technique is applied to numerical experiments and {{it is based on the}} simulated measurements of oscillating temperatures of the fluid at the inlet and outlet of the regenerator. The identification of h is performed by means of an inverse search technique, driven by the difference between simulated measurements and calculated temperature time histories at the regenerator outlet. At first, experiments in different operating conditions are simulated in order to investigate the ability of the algorithm to identify the correct value of h and its uncertainty. Then a parametric study is performed and the optimal control frequency of the known (imposed) oscillating temperature <b>signal</b> at the <b>inlet</b> is found as a function of the mass flow rate, the geometry and other operating and thermophysical characteristics of the system...|$|R

The light was to be lit each night immediately following the gunfire from <b>Governor’s</b> Island which <b>signaled</b> sunset. Until dawn, the light would shine every six seconds and, on a clear night, it could be seen twelve miles away. If the night was foggy, Kate would descend into her basement where she would start an engine that would send out loud siren blasts at three second intervals. Kate and her assistant keeper, her son Jacob, would not attempt sleep on foggy nights as {{there was no point in}} trying. If the siren were to malfunction, Kate would have to ascend to the top of the tower and manually hammer on a bell. This hammering was a signal to the mainland that the siren was in need of repair, and officials would make the trip as soon as the weather permitted. She also had to keep detailed notes regarding her keeper duties to submit to the government each month. To the New York Times, Kate described the light as “more difficult to care for than a family of children.” Although the lamp only needed to be wound every five hours to maintain the light, Kate took careful measures to wind it every three hours. Her meticulous efforts ensured that the “light never disappointed sailors who have depended on it.” ...|$|R
