Nevertheless, it is observed that if the method is applied without using <b>drafting</b> <b>instruments</b> the results are still highly accurate, since the perimeter of the surface on which the lines are drawn reduces the possibility of error.

40|$|Objectives: When {{higher level}} of {{evidence}} is absent, findings of case series studies {{can be used to}} generate hypotheses for further research. However, to date, there has been no established instrument for determining their quality. This study was to develop and validate an instrument to assess the quality of case series studies on herbal medicines. Design: A <b>draft</b> <b>instrument</b> was developed based on items generated by judges. Raters (including judges), consisting of herbal medicine researchers, herbal medicine practitioners, and other professionals, used the <b>draft</b> <b>instrument</b> to assess the quality of sample case series reports. The number of quality assessment items was then reduced as much as possible in the instrument while maintaining its reliability and validity. Content and construct validity, and inter-rater agreement of the instrument were used as the main outcome measures. Results: Seven (7) judges from different backgrounds independently generated 68 nonredundant items for inclusion in the initial <b>draft</b> <b>instrument.</b> The content validity of these items was assessed by all judges for consensus using a seven-point scale, and a 24 -item second-draft instrument was derived. The wording and sequence of these items were further revised and then used by 20 raters (including seven judges) to assess the quality of 35 case series reports. A 13 -item instrument was finally developed. All raters, including the judges, demonstrated a high level of consistency on quality of the reports by using this instrument, despite their different backgrounds. Conclusions: High-level consistency can be achieved by using this instrument to assess the quality of case series studies. This instrument may facilitate the improvement of reporting quality of case series studies...|$|R

40|$|Homework (mutually agreed {{tasks for}} the patient to {{complete}} outside the therapy session) is animportant component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT homework disconfirmsnegative thoughts and beliefs; focuses subjective accounts to more objective detailed accounts;allows therapist and patient to review the past week's activities; and helps the therapist to relatethe session to specific tasks (Beck et al., 1979). Compliance with homework has been shown toimprove the clinical results of CBT (Persons et al., 1988). At the present time there is noconsensus as to the average rate of adherence in completing homework assignments (Detweiler& Whisman, 1999). The identification and reliable measurement of barriers affecting completion ofhomework assignments may improve the potency of CBT, thereby producing further reductionsin depressive symptoms and improvement in ultimate clinical outcome. It may also assistresearchers to identify factors related to variance in treatment outcome, thereby strengthening thegeneralizability of investigational findings for the clinical community. A two-phase {{study was conducted to}} develop an instrument that may assist CBT patients,therapists, and researchers to ascertain the barriers that may be preventing completion ofhomework assignments. Phase I involved the interview of 20 depressed patients and 20 therapists to elicit perceived barriers to homework completion in order to develop an item poolfor the <b>draft</b> <b>instrument.</b> In Phase II, the <b>draft</b> <b>instrument</b> was administered to 56 subjects on 2 separate occasions. Factor Analysis revealed a 2 -factor solution of "Patient Factors" and "Therapist/TaskFactors.

The goal {{of this study was to}} develop the Pediatric Quality Appraisal Questionnaire (PQAQ). MethodsA <b>draft</b> <b>instrument</b> was constructed from published checklists and questionnaires. New questions pertaining to the pediatric population were incorporated. An expert panel reviewed the <b>draft</b> <b>instrument</b> and the proposed scoring scheme for face and content validity. A revised version was pilot tested by three independent appraisers. After addressing discrepancies in scores, a final version was created and subjected to interrater and test–retest reliability assessment. ResultsThe 57 items in the final PQAQ were mapped onto 14 domains: economic evaluation, comparators, target population, time horizon, perspective, costs and resource use, outcomes, quality of life, analysis, discounting, incremental analysis, sensitivity analysis, conflict of interest, and conclusions. Among the 57 items, 46 have response options that are scored from 0 to 1. Interrater reliability was 0. 75 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 66 – 0. 81) and test–retest reliability was 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 71 – 0. 98).

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a comprehensive patient-reported outcomes instrument {{focusing on the}} impact of dry eye on everyday life (IDEEL). Methods Development and validation of the IDEEL occurred in four phases: 1) focus groups with 45 dry eye patients to develop a <b>draft</b> <b>instrument,</b> 2) item generation, 3) pilot study to assess content validity in 16 patients and 4) psychometric validation in 210 subjects: 130 with non-Sjögren's keratoconjunctivitis sicca, 32 with Sjögren's syndrome and 48 controls, and subsequent item reduction. Results Focus groups identified symptoms and the associated bother, the impact of dry eye on daily life and the patients' satisfaction with their treatment as the central concepts in patients' experience of dry eye. Qualitative analysis indicated that saturation was achieved for these concepts and yielded an initial 112 -item <b>draft</b> <b>instrument.</b> Patients understood the questionnaire and found the items to be relevant indicating content validity. Patient input, item descriptive statistics and factor analysis identified 55 items that could be deleted. The final 57 -item IDEEL assesses dry eye impact constituting 3 modules: dry eye symptom-bother, dry eye impact on daily life comprising impact on daily activities, emotional impact, impact on work, and dry eye treatment satisfaction comprising satisfaction with treatment effectiveness and treatment-related bother/inconvenience. The psychometric analysis results indicated that the IDEEL met the criteria for item discriminant validity, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability and floor/ceiling effects. As expected, the correlations between IDEEL and the Dry Eye Questionnaire (a habitual symptom questionnaire) were higher than between IDEEL and Short-Form- 36 and EuroQoL- 5 D, indicating concurrent validity. Conclusion The IDEEL is a reliable, valid and comprehensive questionnaire relevant to issues that are specific to dry eye patients, and meets current FDA patient-reported outcomes guidelines. The use of this questionnaire will provide assessment of the impact of dry eye on patient dry eye-related quality of life, impact of treatment on patient outcomes in clinical trials, and may aid in treatment effectiveness evaluation. </p...|$|R
