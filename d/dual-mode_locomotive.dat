50|$|In the 2010s {{a typical}} Ethan Allen Express had three-four Amfleet {{passenger}} cars, an Amfleet business class car, and an Amfleet cafe car, with the train being pulled by a GE P32AC-DM <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LIRR {{also uses}} 134 C3 Bilevel coaches powered by 23 DE30AC {{diesel-electric}} locomotives and 21 DM30AC <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives.</b> They are used mostly on non-electrified territories, including the Port Jefferson, Oyster Bay, Montauk, and Greenport Branches.|$|R
50|$|The Long Island Rail Road owns an {{electric}} fleet of 836 M7 and 170 M3 electric multiple unit cars, and 134 C3 bilevel rail cars powered by 24 DE30AC diesel-electric locomotives and 21 DM30AC <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{with the}} Harlem and Hudson Lines, {{diesel-powered}} trains {{are driven by}} BL20-GH and <b>dual-mode</b> Genesis P32AC-DM <b>locomotives,</b> paired with Shoreliner coaches. While some peak-period trains operate directly to and from Grand Central Terminal with Genesis P32AC-DM <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> only, most New Haven Line diesel-only territory is operated as shuttle service between Danbury and South Norwalk, or between Waterbury and Bridgeport.|$|R
50|$|Between Albany and New York, {{the train}} is always pulled by a P32AC-DM <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotive,</b> since diesel {{operation}} is prohibited in New York Penn Station. Typically, P42DC locomotives are used between Albany and Toronto, which results in a locomotive change in Albany. Occasionally, the P32AC-DM locomotive will stay on the train {{all the way to}} Toronto.|$|E
50|$|The East River Tunnels are {{currently}} owned by Amtrak and are electrified by both third rail and overhead catenary. Diesel-powered locomotives {{are not allowed}} in the tunnels except in emergency because of ventilation concerns, so the LIRR uses DM30AC <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> to power a few trains from non-electrified lines {{into and out of}} Penn Station during rush hours.|$|R

50|$|A short {{portion of}} the Empire Connection was {{electrified}} when {{it was built in}} 1991, allowing trains from Albany direct access to Penn Station New York by use of <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Track near the terminal was electrified with 750 V DC third rail, compatible with the third rail system used within Penn Station by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR).|$|R
25|$|All {{station tracks}} are powered by 12 kV {{overhead}} wire. Tracks 5–21 also have 750 V DC third rail. Due {{to the lack}} of proper ventilation in the tunnels and station, only electric <b>locomotives</b> and <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> are scheduled to enter Penn Station. Diesel-only NJT trains terminate at Hoboken Terminal or Newark Penn Station, and diesel-only LIRR trains terminate at or prior to Long Island City.|$|R
5000|$|The Empire Service {{utilizes}} <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{due to a}} ban on {{diesel locomotive}} operations in the Penn Station tunnel. An [...] "on the fly" [...] power change from diesel to third rail (or vice versa) takes place once the train enters the tunnel near Penn Station. There is {{a short amount of}} track between Albany and Schenectady that allows for 110 MPH (177/KMH) operations.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of electrification, the LIRR {{ultimately}} pursued <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{that could}} switch between diesel power and electric power to serve Penn Station (where diesel emissions are banned). Senator Norman Levy said that [...] "The people who ride the line {{would have just}} about all {{the positive aspects of}} electrification with this proposal." [...] The LIRR's dual mode locomotives debuted in the late 1990s, providing two round trips during weekday rush hours between Penn Station and Port Jefferson, the first time a one-seat ride was available.|$|R
5000|$|Trains {{initially}} {{could not}} go beyond Newark Penn Station to New York Penn Station because the locomotives were diesel-powered, and diesel locomotives cannot operate in the North River Tunnels. The introduction of ALP-45DP <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> allows for direct service to New York Penn Station. Limited, service to New York Penn Station started as a pilot program on March 3, 2014. Select trains scheduled to arrive at New York Penn Station provide one-seat rides to New York. This original [...] "pilot project" [...] schedule has been subsequently expanded to include additional trains.|$|R
25|$|Agence métropolitaine de {{transport}} (AMT) {{operates the}} ALP-45DP <b>dual-mode</b> electro-diesel <b>locomotives</b> for the Repentigny-Mascouche Line (AMT). They run as electric {{while in the}} poorly ventilated Mount Royal Tunnel, otherwise they run as diesel locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The portion from Jamaica to Babylon {{has been}} {{electrified}} since 1925. It is grade-separated on embankments or elevated structures. From Babylon east to Montauk, diesel-electric or <b>dual-mode</b> electric/diesel-electric <b>locomotives</b> haul trains of passenger coaches.|$|R
50|$|These special {{locomotives}} {{can operate}} as an electric locomotive or as a diesel locomotive. The Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit Rail Operations operate dual-mode diesel-electric/third-rail (catenary on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and New York City because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in Manhattan tunnels. For the same reason, Amtrak operates a fleet of <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the New York area. British Rail operated dual diesel-electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power. This allowed railway yards to remain un-electrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.|$|R
25|$|In North America, the {{flexibility}} of diesel locomotives and the relative low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. An example of the latter {{is the use of}} electric locomotives by Amtrak and commuter railroads in the Northeast. New Jersey Transit New York corridor uses ALP-46 electric locomotives, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in Penn Station and the Hudson and East River Tunnels leading to it. Some other trains to Penn Stations use <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives</b> that can also operate off third-rail power in the tunnels and the station. Electric locomotives are planned for the California High Speed Rail system.|$|R

50|$|In 1983, Conrail {{passed its}} {{commuter}} operations to state agencies. In New York State, the MTA formed Metro-North Railroad as a subsidiary company to operate these, and operations in Connecticut under contract with that state. The locomotives were repainted in Metro-North colors (more commonly {{in a silver}}, blue, and red scheme; some in a silver and blue scheme), {{and a large number}} of them, now in some cases over 25 years old, were rebuilt and modernized. 10 rebuilt for the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT) were painted in the original New Haven (New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad) paint scheme, which has since been applied to remanufactured locomotives in the CDOT's Shoreline East service pool, and on four new GE Genesis II P32AC-DM <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the plan}} was {{rejected}} by FTA, the Montgomery County Planning Commission initiated the R6 Extension Study (later called the Norristown Extension) as an alternative approach. Unlike the SVM, the R6 Extension Study would only see electrification extended as far as King of Prussia (with SEPTA extending the Norristown High Speed Service) and no major reconstruction of any platforms. Any service west of King of Prussia would require new construction and the purchasing of extra push-pull consists hauled by <b>dual-mode</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Funding for the R6 Extension Study was to be provided by revenue earned via a proposed plan to toll U.S. Route 422 between Pottstown and King of Prussia. The tolling idea, suggested by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), was lambasted by several regional politicians, most notably Pennsylvania House of Representatives member Mike Vereb. Vereb and the influential passenger rail advocacy group Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition jointly appeared at a DVRPC open forum on September 13, 2011 where DVRPC Executive Director Barry Seymour was presenting. On October 5, 2011, under increasing pressure and opposition, DVRPC cancelled the tolling proposal and plans for the Norristown Extension. As of October 2011, {{there are no plans}} to restore passenger rail service beyond Norristown.|$|R
50|$|An electro-diesel {{locomotive}} (also {{referred to as}} a <b>dual-mode</b> or bi-mode <b>locomotive)</b> is powered either from an electricity supply (like an electric locomotive) or by using the onboard diesel engine (like a diesel-electric locomotive). For the most part, these locomotives are built to serve regional, niche markets with a very specific purpose.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{initiation}} of select, direct, service to New York Penn Station on the Raritan Valley Line in March 2014, <b>dual-mode</b> Bombardier ALP-45DP <b>locomotives</b> (combination diesel and electric power) {{were added to the}} RVL rolling stock to incorporate the [...] "one seat ride" [...] to and from Raritan or High Bridge and Penn Station in New York.|$|R

These are diesel-only versions of the Class 88s which would arrive later. In October 2014, a further ten were ordered followed by another seven in July 2015. From December 2014, six commenced operating services for Chiltern Railways. In April 2015, two Class 68s commenced operating Fife Circle Line services for Abellio ScotRail. A further batch of six Class 68s (68020-25) were delivered by on 5 April 2016.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the Long Island Rail Road {{operated}} {{two types}} of trains: electric multiple units, which operated over the railroad's electrified lines, and diesel locomotive-hauled trains on the non-electrified portions. Service into New York City was electric-only. The coaching stock which comprised the Long Island's diesel service was aging, and there was political interest in offering a one-seat ride for commuters on the busy, but only partially electrified, Port Jefferson Branch. The Long Island decided to solve both problems simultaneously: it would acquire several <b>dual-mode</b> EMD FL9 <b>locomotives</b> from the Metro-North Railroad, and buying a small fleet of new passenger cars to go with them. If the experiment was successful, it could proceed with a larger order and replace the diesel fleet.|$|R
