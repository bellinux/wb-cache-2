40|$|The {{detection}} and identification of Streptococcus suis type 2 in 8. 1 % of 347 pig herds of southwestern Ontario {{revealed that the}} infection is widespread in this area. A herd suspected to be infected showed a carrier rate of 9. 7 % among the 62 animals sampled. These subclinical carriers represent a potential source of infection for slaughterhouse workers. From studies of contamination of hands and knives, {{it was concluded that}} <b>eviscerators</b> involved in removing the larynx and lungs from the carcasses have a significantly higher (p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) risk of exposure to Streptococcus suis than other abattoir workers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed at {{identifying}} the critical points {{for control of the}} pig-carcass contamination with Salmonella spp. in two Greek slaughterhouses. During 22 visits, from January 1997 to June 1998, we collected environmental samples from floor surfaces, workers 2 ̆ 7 hands and their knives before and after the onset of slaughter. In each visit we also collected I 0 samples of carcasses for every 50 pigs slaughtered (a sampling round). All samples were analyzed with standard microbiological techniques. In multivariable logistic regression models with random-effects the proportion of Salmonella positive carcasses in a sampling round was associated with the slaughterhouse, the period of the year the sampling was done, the sampling round, the sampling day and the results from testing the various environmental samples. The risk of carcass contamination was found to increase by 17 (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) or by 6. 5 (P= 0. 0007) times when the <b>eviscerators</b> 2 ̆ 7 or the leaf fat removers 2 ̆ 7 hands and/or knives were found contaminated, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial usage in food animals {{increases}} {{the prevalence of}} antimicrobial drug resistance among their enteric bacteria. It {{has been suggested that}} this resistance can in turn be transferred to people working with such animals, e. g. abattoir workers. Antimicrobial drug resistance was investigated for Escherichia coli from broilers raised on feed supplemented with antimicrobials, and the people who carry out evisceration, washing and packing of intestines in a high-throughput poultry abattoir in Gauteng, South Africa. Broiler carcasses were sampled from 6 farms, on each of which broilers are produced in a separate ‘grow-out cycle’. Per farm, 100 caeca were randomly collected 5 minutes after slaughter and the contents of each were selectively cultured for E. coli. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each isolate was determined for the following antimicrobials: doxycycline, trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, enrofloxacin, fosfomycin, ceftriaxone and nalidixic acid. The same was determined for the faeces of 29 abattoir workers and 28 persons used as controls. The majority of isolates from broilers were resistant, especially to antimicrobials that were used on the farmsin the study. Overall median MICs and the number of resistant isolates from abattoir workers (packers plus <b>eviscerators)</b> tended to be higher than for the control group. However, no statistically significant differences were observed when the median MICs of antimicrobials used regularly in poultry and percentage resistance were compared, nor could an association between resistance among the enteric E. coli from packers and those from broilers be demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Scrat, the saber-toothed {{squirrel}} climbs a glacier to bury his acorn, but accidentally opens {{a hole in}} it, causing water to spurt out. The world of ice is slowly melting. The creatures of the Ice Age are all shown enjoying themselves on slides and pools made by the melting ice; among them the three protagonists of the first film: Manny, Sid, and Diego. Sid opens a small day camp, where none of the younger creatures take him seriously, nor do Manny and Diego, which leaves Sid seeking a daring deed. Fast Tony, a local con artist is claiming that the earth will flood and that the bark and reeds which he sells are needed to stay alive. Manny dismisses the idea, but is distracted when he sees that Sid will try to high dive from a giant waterfall known as [...] "the Eviscerator"; as Manny goes with Diego {{to the top of}} the <b>Eviscerator</b> to save Sid from his act of daredevilry, suddenly the ice under Diego's feet begins breaking, causing him to bolt in fear, this also made Sid figure out that Diego is afraid of the water. The herd figure that the pleasant weather has caused the ice shelves to melt, and it is kept from destroying the valley only by the glaciers, which have formed a dam.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{in response to}} a rising trend in the incidence of notified human leptospirosis cases, particularly in meat workers, between 2000 and 2005 in New Zealand. Meat workers constituted the highest proportion (65 % during 2004) of notified leptospirosis cases. Sheep either alone or in combination with other animals constituted the second most important animal contact source of human infection (after cattle). Further justification of this {{research was}} {{due to the fact that}} a number of cases were reported from meat workers employed in sheep-only abattoirs and concerns were raised that sheep may be a significant source of human infection. A longitudinal study was undertaken to determine the serological and cultural prevalence of two of the most commonly diagnosed serovars, Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjobovis and Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. Lines of sheep and individual sheep were systematically randomly sampled at a sheep-only abattoir in Feilding from May 2004 to June 2005. In addition, an assessment of the risk of occupational exposure of meat workers to carcasses shedding live leptospires was carried out using a stochastic model. The association between white-spotted kidney lesions and the serological and cultural prevalence of leptospirosis in sheep was determined along with the diagnostic value of these lesions to predict serological and culture status at the line and individual carcass levels. The study showed that the prevalence of lines with sheep seropositive to one or both serovars was 44 % (95 % CI 35 – 54), corresponding to 45 % (95 % CI 35 – 55) of farms. This indicates that nearly half the sampled farms had been exposed to infection previously. The overall individual serological prevalence in the sample of 15, 855 sheep processed was 6 % (95 % CI 5 – 7). Lambs born in the 2003 – 2004 season had a significantly higher serological prevalence to one or both serovars at the line and individual animal levels compared with lambs born in the 2004 – 2005 season, suggesting a strong seasonal effect. The serological prevalence of Hardjobovis was significantly higher than Pomona at the line and individual animal levels. The overall isolation rates of live leptospires from seropositive kidneys of Hardjobovis and Pomona were 22 % and 17 % respectively, and 1 % from seronegative carcasses. From a purposively selected line (suspected of being from a farm with active leptospirosis) all 13 kidneys of seropositive carcasses were culture positive indicating a high risk of exposure of meat workers to leptospires in such a situation. Kidneys from seropositive carcasses were significantly more likely to return culture positive compared with kidneys from seronegative carcasses. The assessment of daily risk of exposure of meat workers indicated moderate risk for <b>eviscerators</b> and meat inspectors ranging from 3 – 11 (95 % CI 0 – 22) and 6 – 18 (95 % CI 1 – 34) carcasses potentially shedding live leptospires respectively, and a high risk for offal-handlers that ranged from 18 – 54 (95 % CI 7 – 91) shedding carcasses. The results from the third study showed that the prevalence of white spotted kidneys was 16 % and 91 % at the individual sheep and line levels, respectively. Carcasses with white spotted kidneys were 5. 2 times (95 % CI 3. 9 – 7. 1) more likely to test seropositive to one or both serovars, but lesions were poor predictors of serological status as judged by test sensitivity and positive predictive values. Furthermore, a positive linear association between white-spot kidney lesion scores and seropositivity to either or both serovars was evident. Consideration of lesion status of lines rather than for individual animals resulted in higher test sensitivity but still suffered from a low positive predictive value. Leptospires were isolated from 5 % (95 % CI 4 – 8) kidneys that were cultured. There was no statistically significant association between white spotted kidney lesion scores and culture test results in the survey data; however, a significant linear positive association was evident when culture data from a purposively sampled farm was merged with the survey data. We conclude that the processing of sheep in sheep-only abattoirs constitutes a definite exposure risk of meat workers to leptospirosis and that exposure risks ranged from moderate to high degrees depending on type of duties performed on the slaughter room floor. Furthermore, since grossly visible white-spotted kidney lesions were positively associated with serological and cultural prevalence of disease it would be advisable for meat workers to take extra care when processing lines with a high prevalence of carcasses with these lesions to reduce the risk of infection. This recommendation is made despite the poor predictability of serological and cultural status of these lesions...|$|R
