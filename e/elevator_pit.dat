40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{shift to}} quality-based {{marketing}} has challenged the grain-handling industry to meet desired purity levels {{as part of}} identity-preservation programs. Very few resources are available {{for the development of}} management strategies. This study measured commingling during grain transfer as influenced by the receiving configuration of an elevator. The facility, located at Manhattan, Kansas, has three receiving pits and one bucket elevator with a handling capacity of 190 t/h (metric ton per hour). The experiments involved moving soybeans through one of the receiving pits, followed by corn through the same flow path, without special cleaning between the two operations. Corn samples, collected at specific time intervals, were used to calculate commingling, the percentage by mass of soybean kernels mixed in corn. Commingling was greater than 1 % only during the first 135 s (first 2 t, 2 metric ton, received), except for the gravity-type pit configuration where commingling remained in excess of 1 % {{for the duration of the}} test (840 s or 7. 3 t of grain). Measured mean cumulative commingling at the end of operation was 1. 25 %, 0. 30 %, and 0. 23 % for the combined effect of gravity-type <b>pit</b> and <b>elevator</b> leg, combined effect of <b>elevator</b> leg and <b>pit</b> with a drag conveyor, and effect of elevator leg, respectively. ARENA simulation was used to predict commingling using different levels of initial impurities of incoming grain.

50|$|Inspection {{service is}} {{designed}} to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB'. When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be canceled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or canceled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the <b>elevator</b> <b>pit)</b> landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.|$|E

40|$|The 105 -KE Basin {{contains}} 1, 150 Metric Tonnes of Uranium (MTU) of N Reactor fuel, {{along with}} {{less than half a}} MTU of single pass reactor (SPR) fuel. In addition to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the 105 -KE Basin, extensive quantities of debris and a substantial amount of sludge have accumulated in the basin. The 105 -KE Basin fuel and sludge are not encapsulated and, as a result, corroding fuel has produced contamination products that are deposited on the basin walls, floor, and equipment. contamination products produce radiation dose exposures to the workers. To decrease worker exposures, this Notice of Construction (NOC) describes dose reduction modifications under consideration to mitigate worker radiation exposure from the basin walls and exposed piping. The major equipment egress paths from the basin (the dummy <b>elevator</b> <b>pit</b> and the south loadout pit) are blocked completely with debris and/or empty canisters. Therefore in addition to dose reduction, this NOC also describes debris removal activities and equipment. Recently, the primary water treatment system has been without mechanical filtration capabilities. This NOC describes planned modifications to the primary water treatment system to restore mechanical filtration by restarting the cartridge filters. The proposed modifications described in this NOC are expected to commence in the Fall of 1995.

This {{information will be}} beneficial in the assessing the acceptability of K Basin sludge in the Tank Waste Remediation System and in the design and/or operational practices related to retrieval and handling of this K Basin sludge. Calculations were made based on results from recent laboratory chemical and radionuclides analyses of sludge sampled from thirteen locations in K East main basin. This concentration data was mathematically processed to determine the various constituents concentration distribution throughout the basin floor. This data was further processed, along with data previously generated from the analysis of measured sludge depths, to give both basin total masses and associated spatial distribution of the various sludge constituents. Results of these calculations, showed that the major gravimetric constituents of the sludge are iron (1505 kg), uranium (1387 kg), aluminum, sodium and c 2 @ 15 cium. Significant amounts of fissionable materials were also calculated: u (9. 92 kg) and 239 pU (3. 42 kg). The calculated distribution of sludge constituent masses showed distinct patterns.

40|$|Floor-by-floor {{survey of}} {{installed}} elements of an elevator shaft using coordinate method and tacheometer is also inhibited by {{the necessity to}} determine device installation points for floors of every mounting horizon that leads to additional measurements due to conditions of the completed building framework and presence of {{a great number of}} situational disturbances and then it entails significant time expenditure and diminution of accuracy in the obtained results. Technical capabilities of the modern electronic tacheometer substantially simplify an accomplishment of the mission because the device can be applied not only in function of vertical projection but it can be used for preand post-construction survey of the elevator shaft with the help of advanced radiation method. While using the given method the electronic tacheometer equipped with diagonal ocular is installed over a bearing sign in the <b>elevator</b> <b>pit</b> and control points of the elevator shaft are determined with the help of specially developed portable beam deflector in the form of disc with radius   r, which is fixed to a handle rod and orientated perpendicularly to a laser beam.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of particle size analyses and calorimetry testing performed on selected single-pull sludge samples collected from the Hanford K East Basin between December 1998 and June 1999. The samples were collected as isolated cores predominantly from areas that had not been previously sampled (e. g., North Loadout Pit, Dummy <b>Elevator</b> <b>Pit,</b> Tech View Pit), or from areas in which the sludge composition had been altered since the last sampling (e. g., Weasel Pit). Particle size analyses were performed by washing wet sludge samples through a series of four sieves with openings of 250, 500, 1410, and 4000 {micro}m. The loaded sieves were weighed before and after drying to obtain wet and dry particle size distributions. Knowledge of the particle size distribution is needed to design and predict the performance of the systems that will be used to retrieve, transport, and recover sludge. Also, sieving provides an opportunity to observe the components in the sludge. For example, during sieving of the sludge sample from the North Loadout Pit, significant quantities of organic ion exchange beads were observed. The uranium metal content and the particle size of the uranium metal in the K Basin sludge will largely determine the chemical reactivity of the sludge. In turn, the designs for the sludge handling and storage systems must be compatible with the reactivity of the sludge. Therefore, acid calorimetry was performed to estimate the uranium metal content of the sludge. For this testing, sludge samples were dissolved in nitric acid within a calibrated adiabatic calorimeter. The resulting dissolution enthalpy data were then used to discriminate between metallic uranium ({minus} 3750 J/g in nitric acid) and uranium oxide ({minus} 394 J/g in nitric acid). Results from this testing showed that the single-pull sludge samples contained little or no uranium metal...|$|E
