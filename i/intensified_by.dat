5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. <b>Intensified</b> <b>by</b> religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E

Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting.

After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage.

5|$|Despite {{positive}} initial reviews, which {{praised the}} film as a well-made cinematic transfer of the Thunderbirds television series, Thunderbirds Are Go soon {{proved to be a}} box office failure for the Andersons.

To add to the lukewarm public response, negative critical reception of Thunderbirds Are Go has targeted, besides other aspects, the characterisation of the puppet cast, which has been seen as too minimal to sustain a feature-length production, the running time dedicated to model and effects shots, and the fantasy dream sequence starring Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which {{has been described as a}} poor scriptwriting idea on the part of the Andersons.|$|E
5|$|Located {{within an}} area of weak {{vertical}} wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression <b>intensified.</b> <b>By</b> 06:00UTC the next morning, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Beta by the NHC. Beta was slowly moving towards the north-northwest {{in response to a}} mid-tropospheric shortwave trough over the Gulf of Mexico and mid-tropospheric ridge to the northeast of the storm. Deep convection developed near the center of circulation, signifying a developing system. With favorable conditions for development, Beta was forecast to intensify into a hurricane before making landfall in central Nicaragua. An eyewall rapidly developed around the center of circulation, fuelling further intensification. With the formation of an eyewall and the compact size of the storm, rapid intensification was anticipated. By the end of October27, maximum sustained winds around the center of Beta were estimated at 60mph (95km/h). An increase in wind shear caused a minor disruption of the storm's structure, briefly preventing strengthening.|$|E

5|$|On July4, 2005, the National Hurricane Center {{classified}} {{a tropical}} depression near the Windward Islands. This system moved briskly to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Dennis the following day. Taking advantage of highly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, Dennis rapidly <b>intensified.</b> <b>By</b> July6, the system reached hurricane strength {{as it began}} traversing the Jamaica Channel. Around 18:00UTC on July7, the hurricane passed 30mi (45km) northeast of Port Antonio—60mi (95km) northeast of Kingston—with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h)—a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The system subsequently struck Cuba as a Category4 twice before moving over the Gulf of Mexico. It ultimately moved inland over Florida as a Category3 on July10 and dissipated over the Great Lakes eight days later.|$|E

However, {{the hurricane}} weakened back down to Category 1 strength before making landfall just after midnight on August 30 near Matagorda and Palacios, Texas. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), with hurricane-force winds extending out 150mi (240km) from the storm's center of circulation. The hurricane's minimum central pressure at landfall was estimated at 950mbar (hPa; 28.06inHg), though a pressure reading of 952mbar (hPa; 28.16inHg) in Seadrift, Texas marked the lowest recorded pressure. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened, and degenerated to tropical storm strength at 1200UTC on August30 while located near Hallettsville, Texas. Weakening to a tropical depression the following day, it dissipated at 1200UTC on August30 near Sweetwater, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{storm of}} the season formed on September 3 in the western Atlantic. It drifted west-{{northwest}}ward, slowly gaining intensity, and turned northwest on September 8.

It attained its peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 14. As it maintained its intensity on September 15, the hurricane began to turn westward while it continued to approach the coast of South Carolina on September 17. The hurricane made landfall near Myrtle Beach later on September 17, and quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it moved inland.

Hours later, the system weakened to a tropical depression. Late on September 12, the depression re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and soon re-strengthened into a tropical storm. Thereafter, the storm headed southeastward and then eastward while slowly <b>intensifying.</b> <b>By</b> September 14, the system turned southward and became a Category 1 hurricane.

50|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on October 19. Moving westward, it developed a weak circulation on October 23.

This was based on a rating of 1.5 on the Dvorak technique, which is a method of estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones via satellite. At the time of development, the depression had a small area of convection near and east of the center, and due to the wind shear it was never expected to <b>intensify.</b> <b>By</b> October 25, the circulation had become dissociated from the convection.

A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, <b>intensified</b> <b>by</b> panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise.

Three naval flood relief teams, comprising 86 trained swimmers and divers and three officers, were rushed to Tamil Nadu, along with several hundred food packets. The INS Rajali naval air station at Arakkonam functioned as a makeshift airport for transporting relief materials and evacuating stranded people.

General Dalbir Singh Suhag, the Chief of the Army Staff, flew to Chennai on 4 December to supervise the Army's rescue efforts; he and the General Officer Commanding, Dakshin Bharat Area, conducted an aerial reconnaissance. An additional 15 NDRF teams were planned to arrive in a day or two. With rainfall gradually becoming less intense, the pace of relief efforts <b>intensified</b> <b>by</b> 5 December.
