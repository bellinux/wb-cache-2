Drawing from ethnographic observations of a traditional urban family court, this study finds that some judges are able to transform nontherapeutic courtrooms into therapeutic ones despite obstacles.

In order to solve it, different <b>problem-solving</b> <b>techniques,</b> including descriptive modelling, quantitative modelling, computerised implementation and the presentation of results, should be considered. To achieve that, the goal model-driven supply chain design approach is proposed in this paper. This approach uses the principles of model- driven development to combine various <b>problem-solving</b> <b>techniques.</b> The paper describes the use of goal modelling to formally represent the supply chain design problem, defines transformations to obtain the multi-objective optimisation model on the basis of the goal model and uses business intelligence methods to represent modelling results.

This special issue reviews recent research in Bayesian <b>problem-solving</b> <b>techniques.</b> The articles cover the topics of inference in Bayesian networks, decision-theoretic planning, and qualitative decision theory.

40|$|One way of {{thinking}} about research and development is to recognise that firms are trying to solve particular design problems. We often build these design problems into our models, but are forced to oversimplify them {{in order to make the}} models solvable. The approach taken in this paper is to acknowledge that design problems are often insoluble using standard techniques and to model instead the process by which firms solve them. Two such processes are simulated in detail. The first, individual experimental search, is based on a <b>problem-solving</b> <b>technique</b> known as simulated annealing. The second, partial imitation, involves learning at a social level and is based on a <b>problem-solving</b> <b>technique</b> known as the genetic algorithm. Some economic implications of these processes are explored, including their application to stochastic learning curves, patent design and the importance of `technodiversity' in the introduction of new technology to developing countries.
