The method we propose {{is based on a}} nondiagonal decomposition into <b>directed</b> <b>components</b> (DEDICOM), which we use to learn the coefficients of a matrix polynomial of the network’s adjacency matrix. We show that our method can be used to compute better low-rank approximations to a polynomial of a network’s adjacency matrix than using the singular value decomposition, and that a higher precision can be achieved at the task of predicting directed links than by undirected or bipartite methods.

40|$|Let k be an algebraically closed {{field and}} A be a finite-dimensional k-algebra. We may assume that A = kQ/I, where Q is a finite {{connected}} quiver and I is an admissible {{ideal of the}} path algebra kQ; see [5]. For our considerations we may assume that Q has no oriented cycles. Consider the category modA of finite-dimensional left A-modules. For each indecomposable non-projective A-module X, the Auslander–Reiten translate τAX is an indecomposable non-injective module; see [1, 5]. The Auslander–Reiten quiver ΓA has as vertices representatives of the isoclasses of finite-dimensional indecomposable A-modules and as many arrows fromX to Y in ΓA as the dimension of radA(X,Y) /rad 2 A(X,Y). An indecomposable A-module X is directing {{if there is no}} cycle of non-zero non-isomorphisms X = X 0 → X 1 → [...] . → Xs → Xs+ 1 = X between indecomposable mod-ules. A component C of ΓA is directing if all its modules are directing. There are several important examples of <b>directing</b> <b>components</b> which have been extensively studied. Postprojective <b>components</b> are <b>directing</b> <b>components</b> P such that each module in P has only finitely many predeces-sors in the path order of P. Algebras with such type of components are: algebras with the separation condition (in particular, tree algebras), and hereditary algebras (and more generally, tilted and quasi-tilted algebras [20, 3]). Recently, a criterion was given in [4] for the existence of postprojective components. For every tilted algebra A, the connecting component C of ΓA is a directing component; see [14]. Some general properties of <b>directing</b> <b>components</b> were studied in [9], [18] and [19]. The purpose of the present work is to describe properties of <b>directing</b> convex <b>components</b> of ΓA. Such components are standard; they are sincere if and only if the number of τA-orbits is the number of vertices in the quiver Q. In Section 3 we describe an inductive procedure to construct all algebras A accepting a sincere convex <b>directing</b> <b>component</b> in ΓA. Some of our results are related to [19]...|$|R

50|$|The {{will to live}} is a {{psychological}} force to fight for survival seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious reasoning. This occurs particularly when one’s own life is threatened by a serious injury or disease. The idea in which someone {{who is on the}} threshold of death may consciously or unconsciously try to stay alive through the belief that they have a reason or something to live for, along with giving up on the will to live. There are significant correlations between the will to live and existential, psychological, social, and physical sources of distress. The concept of the will to live can be seen as directly impacted by hope. Many, who overcome near-death experiences with no explanation, have described concepts such as the will to live as a <b>direct</b> <b>component</b> of their survival. The difference between the wish to die versus the wish to live is also a unique risk factor for suicide.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} retinal adaptive responses {{in concert with}} the modulation of forward and backward adaptation induced by periodic global flashes using the global flash multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). Methods: Six normal subjects were recruited for global flash mfERG measurements, which consisted of 103 scaled hexagonal elements followed by a global flash frame. In experiments I and II, with constant luminance maintained in both local and global flash frames, the number of dark frames was independently varied and these frames were either inserted prior to or following the global flash frame to investigate the forward or backward adaptive effect of the global flash on the mfERG. In experiment III, the number of dark frames was fixed but the luminance of the global flash frame was varied with constant luminance of the focal flash. This was used to demonstrate that the adaptive effect related not to time but to variation of luminance. Results: All the central, para-central and peripheral <b>direct</b> <b>component</b> amplitudes were found to be significantly influenced by variation of the number of dark frames (p < 0. 01). Reducing the forward adaptive effect of the global flash enhanced the <b>direct</b> <b>component</b> response and it became steady after five dark frames were inserted following the global flash. Reducing the backward adaptive effect of the global flash also enhanced the <b>direct</b> <b>component</b> response but it started reducing after four dark frames were inserted prior to the global flash frame. These changes were different with luminance modulation of the global flash intensity with fixed dark frames, while the <b>direct</b> <b>component</b> amplitude grew approximately linearly with decreasing mean luminance of the global flash stimulation. Conclusion: The retina {{plays a major role in}} visual adaptation. Both forward and backward adaptive effects of the global flash on the <b>direct</b> <b>component</b> have been illustrated in this study. The results show that the forward and backward adaptive phenomena in the global flash mfERG are different and demonstrate that backward adaptation is found at the retinal level.
