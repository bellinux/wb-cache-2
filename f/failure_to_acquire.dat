While there is currently little evidence for in-use treatment <b>failures</b> attributable <b>to</b> <b>acquired</b> reductions in microbicide susceptibility, the susceptibility of some bacteria can be reduced by sublethal laboratory exposure to certain agents. In this investigation, a range of environmental bacterial isolates (11 genera, 18 species) were repeatedly exposed to four microbicides (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, polyhexamethylene biguanide [PHMB], and triclosan) and a cationic apolipoprotein E-derived antimicrobial peptide (apoEdpL-W) using a previously validated exposure system. Susceptibilities (MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations [MBCs]) were determined before and after 10 passages (P 10) in the presence of an antimicrobial and then after a further 10 passages without an antimicrobial to determine the stability of any adaptations. Bacteria exhibiting > 4 -fold increases in MBCs were further examined for alterations in biofilm-forming ability. Following microbicide exposure, ≥ 4 -fold decreases in susceptibility (MIC or MBC) occurred for cetrimide (5 / 18 bacteria), apoEdpL-W (7 / 18), chlorhexidine (8 / 18), PHMB (8 / 18), and triclosan (11 / 18). Of the 34 ≥ 4 -fold increases in the MICs, 15 were fully reversible, 13 were partially reversible, and 6 were nonreversible. Of the 26 ≥ 4 -fold increases in the MBCs, 7 were fully reversible, 14 were partially reversible, and 5 were nonreversible. Significant decreases in biofilm formation in P 10 strains occurred for apoEdpL-W (1 / 18 bacteria), chlorhexidine (1 / 18), and triclosan (2 / 18), while significant increases occurred for apoEdpL-W (1 / 18), triclosan (1 / 18), and chlorhexidine (2 / 18).

We asked what effect the test context has, given identical latent inhibition treatments in Phase 1 and identical conditioned inhibition trainings in Phase 2. In Experiment 1, an AAA versus AAB context-shift design determined that the latent inhibition treatment in Phase 1 attenuated behavior indicative of the conditioned inhibition training administered in Phase 2, regardless of the test context, which could reflect a <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> either <b>acquire</b> or express conditioned inhibition. In Experiment 2, an ABA versus ABB design showed that test performance in Contexts A and B reflected the treatments that had been administered in those contexts (i. e., conditioned inhibition was observed in Context B but not A), which could reflect either the context specificity of either latent inhibition or conditioned inhibition. In either case, latent inhibition of conditioned inhibition training in at least some situations was seen to reflect an expression deficit rather than an acquisition deficit. These data, in conjunction with prior reports, suggest that latent inhibition is relatively specific to the context in which it was administered, whereas conditioned inhibition is specific to its training context only when it is the second-learned relationship concerning the target cue. These experiments are part of a larger effort to delineate control by the test context of two-phase associative interference, {{as a function of}} the nature of target training and the nature of interference training.

40|$|Within {{generative}} L 2 acquisition research {{there is}} a longstanding debate as to what underlies observable differences in L 1 /L 2 knowledge/ performance. On the one hand, Full Accessibility approaches maintain that target L 2 syntactic representations (new functional categories and features) are acquirable (e. g., Schwartz & Sprouse, 1996). Conversely, Partial Accessibility approaches claim that L 2 variability and/or optionality, even at advanced levels, obtains {{as a result of}} inevitable deficits in L 2 narrow syntax and is conditioned upon a maturational <b>failure</b> in adulthood <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> (some) new functional features (e. g., Beck, 1998; Hawkins & Chan, 1997; Hawkins & Hattori, 2006; Tsimpli & Dimitrakopoulou, 2007).

These advanced L 2 learners reliably differentiate syntactically between finite verbs, uninflected and inflected infinitives, which, as argued, only supports Full Accessibility approaches. Moreover, we will discuss how testing the domain of inflected infinitives is especially interesting in light of recent proposals that Brazilian Portuguese colloquial dialects no longer actively instantiate them (Lightfoot, 1991; Pires, 2002, 2006; Pires & Rothman, 2009; Rothman, 2007) ...|$|R

Developmental {{disorders}} are <b>failure</b> or inability <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> various age-specific skills at expected maturational age, which affects about 5 – 10 % of preschool children. One {{of the most}} important methods for evaluation of developmentally delayed children is neuroimaging, especially, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that provides useful information regarding brain tissue structures and anomalies. Method and Material. In this study, hospital records of 580 developmentally delayed children (aged 2 months to 15 years) who admitted in pediatric ward of Golestan Hospital from 1997 to 2009 were selected. Information such as age, MRI findings were collected in the questionnaire and statistically analyzed. Results.

Although several regulatory circuits that control differentiation of SMCs have been identified, the decisive mechanisms that govern phenotypic modulation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse miR- 143 / 145 cluster, expression of which is confined to SMCs during development, is required for VSMC acquisition of the contractile phenotype. VSMCs from miR- 143 / 145 –deficient mice were locked in the synthetic state, which incapacitated their contractile abilities and favored neointimal lesion development. Unbiased high-throughput, quantitative, mass spectrometry–based proteomics using reference mice labeled with stable isotopes allowed identification of miR- 143 / 145 targets; these included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which might affect both the synthetic phenotype and contractile functions of VSMCs. Pharmacological inhibition of either ACE or the AT 1 receptor partially reversed vascular dysfunction and normalized gene expression in miR- 143 / 145 –deficient mice. We conclude that manipulation of miR- 143 / 145 expression may offer a new approach for influencing vascular repair and attenuating arteriosclerotic pathogenesis...|$|R
