In particular, if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing the state of each cell independently at random, with <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> states being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent configuration can be described by exactly the same probability distribution.|$|E

The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between two {{cartridges}} via a Game Link Cable.

The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red or Blue on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of the games are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
