5|$|Sestero further postulates that Wiseau based Lisa's <b>explicit</b> conniving on the {{character}} Tom Ripley, after Wiseau had a profound emotional reaction to the film The Talented Mr. Ripley, and matches elements of its three main characters to those in The Room; Sestero has likewise indicated that {{the character}} Mark was named for the Ripley actor Matt Damon, whose first name Wiseau had misheard. Wiseau also drew on the chamber plays of Tennessee Williams, whose highly emotional scenes he enjoyed acting out in drama school – many advertising materials for The Room make <b>explicit</b> parallels to Williams's work.|$|E

5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} <b>explicit</b> logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an <b>explicit</b> contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E

50|$|The codex {{contains}} the Vulgate {{version of the}} four Gospels, the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea, the letter of St. Jerome to Pope Damasus (Novum opus), the prologue of St. Jerome to the Gospels (Plures fuisse), and prologues and chapter lists {{for each of the}} Gospels. The text is written on vellum in two columns in Uncial script with no division between words. The running titles are in small uncials while the incipits and <b>explicits</b> are in capitals. The incipits and <b>explicits</b> are written in alternating lines of red and black ink. The subscription of Lupus is written in uncials, and also has alternating lines of red and black ink. The text contains additional punctuation and annotations in a 10th-century Beneventuan hand.|$|R

25|$|<b>Explicit,</b> unlike {{implicit}} memory for odors, is thought {{by some to}} be a phenomenon that is exclusive to humans. <b>Explicit</b> memory refers to memories that are remembered with conscious awareness of doing so. In olfaction, <b>explicit</b> memory refers to attributing associative meaning to odors. Through the assignment of associations to odors as well as non-odor stimuli, olfactory stimuli can gain meaning. <b>Explicit</b> memories of odors include information which can be used to process and compare other encountered odors. Attention focused on odors aids in the functioning of everyday life as well as the engagement of proper responses to experienced events. Evidence of <b>explicit</b> olfaction memory is seen through behaviours in tasks involving a working memory component. The two most commonly used tests for <b>explicit</b> odor memory are odor identification and odor recognition, which are discussed in greater detail below.|$|E

2500|$|Both bulk {{viscosity}} [...] and dynamic viscosity [...] {{need not be}} constant – in general, they depend on density, on each other (the viscosity is expressed in pressure), and in compressible flows also on temperature.
