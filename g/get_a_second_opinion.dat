METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with 24 primary care patients, asking them to describe their experiences with self-perceived preventable problems. We analyzed these interviews using the editing method and classifi ed emotional and behavioral responses to experiencing preventable problems. RESULTS Anger was the most common emotional response, followed by mistrust and resignation. We classifi ed participants ’ behavioral responses into 4 categories: avoidance (eg, stop going to the doctor), accommodation (eg, learn to deal with delays), anticipation (eg, attend to details, attend to own emotions, acquire knowledge, actively communicate), and advocacy (eg, <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion).</b> CONCLUSIONS Understanding how patients react to their experiences with preventable problems can assist health care at both the physician-patient and system levels.

40|$|Participation {{in cancer}} {{clinical}} trials (CCTs) {{is an effective}} means of reducing cancer disparities among Black cancer patients because they provide an opportunity to receive high quality health care from leading healthcare providers and researchers. Yet, Black cancer patients remain underrepresented in CCTs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the patient, family member, physician, and protocol factors that influence Black cancer patients to participate and to remain in CCTs and the day-to-day experiences of Black cancer patients as they navigate their way through the clinical trial process. Albrecht’s model of treatment decision making was used as a theoretical guide. A multimethod approach was used and included a qualitative descriptive design with semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 21 Black cancer patients involved in CCTs and a descriptive statistical analysis of the sample’s sociodemographics and a quantitative measure of symptom burden (the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form). Participants reported mild levels of symptom burden based on the mean values of the assessment scale. Elements of real-time data capture were also used to facilitate collection of four semi-structured cell phone participant interviews over a two month period, in order to understand patient-participants’ everyday experiences in CCTs. The majority of participants self-identified as Black-African American (80 %) and attended college or had a college degree (55 %). A majority had comorbid conditions (70 %) and 40 % were diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. The findings suggest that patient, family member, physician, and protocol factors in Albrecht’s model are important in decision making related to cancer clinical trial participation and retention, but in varying degrees. Patient-participants identified <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion,</b> helping themselves, and helping others as important factors to their decisions to seek treatment at the Cancer Center and to enroll in CCTs. The support of family members was identified primarily in CCT retention, and the qualities of the cancer physician motivated participant enrollment and retention. These qualities included trust, attentiveness, timely referrals, and willingness to provide detailed explanations of treatment options. Protocol features, such as provision of targeted therapy, randomization, and additional diagnostic surveillance, attracted participants to enroll in such trials. Finally, elements of real-time data capture highlighted patient-participants’ everyday qualitative experiences, that included interactions with their clinical care team, events surrounding their outpatient cancer clinical trial appointments, and information shared at their appointments; and, the symptom burden issues that arose as patient-participants progressed in their trials. Patient-participants provided vivid descriptions of their CCT treatment, expectations and events surrounding CCT participation, their symptom experience, personal thoughts and feelings of the effect of CCT participation on their daily lives, and their relationships with family members, the CCT Team, and others during CCT participation. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionA {{positive}} {{finding of}} metastatic melanoma in a sentinel lymph node is an ominous sign {{and a strong}} predictor of overall survival. In contrast, current data trends have shown that patients with benign nevus cells in the sentinel nodes do not require additional therapy since their prognosis {{has been shown to}} be similar to that of patients with negative lymph nodes. Distinguishing between benign capsular nevi and metastatic melanoma often proves to be diagnostically problematic. Case presentationIn this case report we present two cases of melanoma in which sentinel lymph node biopsies proved to be difficult in distinguishing metastatic melanocytes from capsular nevus cells. In both cases, further workup was necessary for accurate diagnoses. DiscussionA lack of standardized distinctions of benign nevus cell from melanoma pose a diagnostic pitfall. Assigning a diagnosis of malignant melanoma might seem like the safer approach to avoid a false negative, but the resultant treatment, including the possibility of additional surgical complications, may cause anxiety, discomfort, and financial instability for the patient. Current methods of distinguishing the two based solely on histology may be insufficient due to similar pathologic patterns. ConclusionTo avoid misdiagnosing a patient and performing unnecessary therapy, it would be beneficial to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> by additional histopathologists at a high volume center. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining should be carefully employed due to some overlap in commonly used markers.

40|$|Germ cell tumors, at a {{prevalence}} of 1 - 2 %, {{make up a}} relatively small proportion of all solid tumors found among males, but they have the highest incidence of all tumors among men {{between the ages of}} 20 and 40 years. The incidence of these tumors is steadily rising and is currently at a rate of 11. 2 per 100, 000 population/year in Germany. Mortality rates due to these diseases has dropped considerably with the advent of new technological advances in diagnosis, the increase of many inter- and multi-disciplinary cooperative efforts, an increase in evidence based therapeutic strategies, and the introduction of Cisplatin based chemotherapies. However, in Germany and elsewhere, the mortality remains higher than would be expected with an adequate implementation of standard therapy guidelines. Reasons for this discrepancy are suspected to be suboptimal quality of care. Foremost is the problem that evidence based guidelines are not being adhered to in the course of therapy. One can only speculate why this is the case. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> might be able to improve adherence to these guidelines here. In this study, retrospective analysis of 133 patients who were treated at the Charité Universitätsmedizin-Benjamin Franklin Hospital between January of 1997 and December of 2006 was carried out. The clinical findings were entered into an online database and then summarized. These summaries were forwarded to urologists based in private practice along with the request to submit their recommendations for therapy. The same data were also presented to a second-opinion center with a request to recommend standard therapy guidelines. Documentation of treatment administered to patients at the Benjamin Franklin Hospital was also entered into the same online database. The treatment administered at this hospital and the treatment suggested by the urologists in private practice was compared with the suggestions from the secondopinion center. The goal was to identify what deviations, if any, were to be found between the treatment-suggestions of private urologists as providers of primary care (first opinion), the therapy conducted at the Charité Hospital, and the treatment suggestions submitted by the second-opinion center. In 25 of 133 cases (18. 8 %) and 33 of 133 cases (24. 8 %), the first opinion and treatment delivered, respectively, deviated from the suggestions submitted by the second-opinion center. A statistically significant deviation from these suggestions was demonstrated for different tumor types, with a greater discrepancy for seminomas. A statistically significant deviation dependent on tumor stage was not found. A tendency for guidelinedeviation in early tumor stages was, however, demonstrated. First opinion recommendations by private urologists and therapies delivered by the Charité Hospital to either under or over treat their patients clearly demonstrates that the publication of guidelines alone is not sufficient to guarantee adherence to them. 8. 3 % (11 of 133 cases) of first opinions and 9. 8 % (13 of 133) of treatments conducted at the Charité Hospital were more extensive when compared to suggestions submitted by the second-opinion center. Adherence to guidelines or the advice of a second-opinion center would have meant less chemotherapy or radiation therapy for patients and thus higher quality of life through reduced side-effects. On the other hand, insufficient therapy was suggested in 10. 5 % (14 of 133) of first opinion cases and conducted in 15. 0 % (20 of 133) of therapies delivered by the Charité Hospital. A higher rate of relapse would be expected in these cases. A single, consistent error in therapy or suggested therapy could not be elicited from the data gathered in this study. That tumors in an earlier stage tend to raise uncertainty in physicians, is a clear indication that the obtaining of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> is warranted. While greater adherence to therapy guidelines in advanced tumor stages is observed, any deviation from the guidelines in these stages can have significantly greater consequences for the patient. It {{is for this reason that}} <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> also has great meaning for these patients. Further studies on testicular cancer and other tumor types support the assumption that the obtaining of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> leads to the implementation of standard therapy guidelines, and with it, an increase in quality of care and thereby a reduction in excess mortality...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} <b>second</b> <b>opinions</b> in {{orthopaedic}} surgery is increading rapidly, yet the grounds on which {{patients and their}} doctors decide to seek <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> have been little studied. The goal {{of the study was}} to identify patient and consultant factors that appeared to contribute to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> being sought. Methods: Two thousand and seventy-nine consecutive new patients visiting and orthopaedic surgical outpatient clinic in 1996 - 1997 participated in the study. Patients were self-defined as seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> if they had visited at least one other consultant for the same condition within the previous two years. Each of these patients completed a questionnaire before seeing the orthopaedic surgeon; this included details about the physician-patient relationship, reasons for seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> and perceived health status. The first-opinion consultants were contacted by mail; their practice characteristics and the motives for seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> were also obtained. Results: Thirty per cent of the study population (n= 625) had sought <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion.</b> Patients sought <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> because of disappointment concerning their original treatment, or because they wanted more information about their condition and/or its treatment. First-opinion consultant were usually unaware of these communication issues. Patients' inclination to initiate <b>a</b> <b>second</b> opinionwas best predicted by their evaluation of their relationship with their first-opinion consultant. The propensity to initiate referrals for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> varied wildely among the first-opinion consultants (10 - 70 %) and was inversely proportional to the size of the group they worked in and their distance from the referral centre. Conclusion: Patients did not seek <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> because they had doubts about the competence of their treating consultant, but because they were dissatisfied about the level of communication or about the results of their treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{knowledge}} {{about the relationship between}} health-related activities on the Internet (i. e. informed citizens) and individuals' control over their own experiences of health or illness (i. e. empowered citizens) is valuable but scarce. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between four ways of using the Internet for information on health or illness and citizens attitudes and behaviours toward health professionals and health systems and establish the profile of empowered eHealth citizens in Europe. Methods Data was collected during April and May 2007 (N = 7022), through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). Respondents from Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Portugal participated in the survey. The profiles were generated using logistic regressions and are based on: a) socio-demographic and health information, b) the level of use of health-related online services, c) the level of use of the Internet to get health information to decide whether to consult a health professional, prepare for a medical appointment and assess its outcome, and d) the impact of online health information on citizens' attitudes and behavior towards health professionals and health systems. Results Citizens using the Internet to decide whether to consult a health professional or to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> are likely to be frequent visitors of health sites, active participants of online health forums and recurrent buyers of medicines and other health related products online, while only infrequent epatients, visiting doctors they have never met face-to-face. Participation in online health communities seems to be related with more inquisitive and autonomous patients. Conclusions The profiles of empowered eHealth citizens in Europe are situational and country dependent. The number of Europeans using the Internet to get health information to help them deal with a consultation is raising and having access to online health information seems to be associated with growing number of inquisitive and self-reliant patients. Doctors are increasingly likely to experience consultations with knowledgeable and empowered patients, who will challenge them in various ways. </p...|$|E
40|$|Goal: In a {{study of}} 10 autopsy cases with {{congenital}} cardiac malformations we investigated whether obtaining a second opinion by means of telepathology could satisfy quality standards for the diagnosis of cardiac malformations and what {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of such a procedure might be. Material: The investigatory samples were 10 formalin‐fixed hearts with complex malformations from 9 fetuses and one newborn on which autopsies had been performed at the Pathological Institute of the Charité Hospital. The requests for a second opinion, which included text and image data, were sent in the form of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations to 5 experts in 4 countries. Per case the number of images that were sent was between 3 and 7. The size of the files was between 439 and 942 kb. The time required for preparation of the cases for sending them to the specialists was between 1 and 2 hours: this encompassed the time for putting the notation on the images, compressing them, creating a file that included both the images and the clinical data and then sending the case file. Results: All 10 cardiac malformations were correctly identified. In 8 of the 10 cases at least one expert had questions. After these questions had been answered and further images had been sent final correct diagnoses were made in all cases. All experts said that the quality of the images was very good. Use of a standardized findings questionnaire, which also included the marking of anatomic structures and of pathological findings in the images, proved useful. Standardized findings forms facilitate orientation during interpretation of the cases and should be used generally to avoid misunderstandings in telepathological communication. Conclusions: In general it is possible to obtain an effective and reliable diagnosis of congenital heart malformations by means of telepathology.

In this paper, we investigate the correlation between four ways of using the Internet for information on health or illness and citizens attitudes and behaviours toward health professionals and health systems and establish the profile of empowered eHealth citizens in Europe. Methods. Data was collected during April and May 2007 (N = 7022), through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). Respondents from Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Portugal participated in the survey. The profiles were generated using logistic regressions and are based on: a) socio-demographic and health information, b) the level of use of health-related online services, c) the level of use of the Internet to get health information to decide whether to consult a health professional, prepare for a medical appointment and assess its outcome, and d) the impact of online health information on citizens' attitudes and behavior towards health professionals and health systems. Results: Citizens using the Internet to decide whether to consult a health professional or to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> are likely to be frequent visitors of health sites, active participants of online health forums and recurrent buyers of medicines and other health related products online, while only infrequent epatients, visiting doctors they have never met face-to-face. Participation in online health communities seems to be related with more inquisitive and autonomous patients. Conclusions: The profiles of empowered eHealth citizens in Europe are situational and country dependent. The number of Europeans using the Internet to get health information to help them deal with a consultation is raising and having access to online health information seems to be associated with growing number of inquisitive and self-reliant patients. Doctors are increasingly likely to experience consultations with knowledgeable and empowered patients, who will challenge them in various ways. © 2011 Santana et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Goals of work: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the predictors for seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> and the utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among gynecologic cancer patients. Patients and methods: Patients attending a gynecologic cancer clinic of a tertiary referral center were recruited over a period of 1 year. A survey was conducted for all the participants in a one-on-one basis. Main results: One hundred ninety-one patients were recruited. Eighty patients (41. 9 %) had consulted other health-care professionals (HCP) for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> after they were diagnosed to have cancer and 89 (46. 6 %) had utilized CAM. In multivariate analysis, late-stage disease (OR= 2. 65, 95 % CI 1. 26 - 5. 58), treatment with radiotherapy (OR= 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 19 - 4. 33) and tertiary education (OR= 11. 28, 95 % CI 3. 06 - 41. 54) were independent predictors for seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> from other HCP and utilization of CAM. Patients who sought <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> from other HCP were more likely to utilize CAM (OR= 6. 12, 95 % CI 3. 24 - 11. 54). Eighty percent of the patients did not inform their usual caregiver their utilization of CAM. Conclusions: Seeking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> from other HCP is common in gynecologic cancer patients. Patients who seek <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> are more likely to utilize CAM. © Springer-Verlag 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
