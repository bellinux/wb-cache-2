5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a {{lightning}} bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a fire on the ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in <b>half</b> <b>from</b> the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the clock and the first <b>half</b> <b>from</b> ending before {{they had a chance}} to score.

5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over <b>half,</b> <b>from</b> 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many {{and the impact of}} the Referendum Party was not a major factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{line will}} operate as M3 and M4. The former will run a full circle, while M4 will only {{operate on the}} eastern <b>half</b> <b>from</b> Copenhagen Central Station (København H) via Østerport to Nørrebro. This {{solution}} is temporary, once the metro network has been extended to Nordhavn, the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch. Later, when the Sydhavn extension has been completed, the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus. Trains will operate both ways through the circle. The line will have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv. The line is estimated to carry 240,000daily passengers, bringing the metro's total daily ridership to 460,000.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{competition from}} trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, passenger volume {{began to decline}} along with less-than-carload freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self-propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 19271928. Carload freight volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and earnings were strong enough {{for the company to}} declare dividends in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross revenues by <b>half</b> <b>from</b> 1932 to 1935.|$|E

5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against Vitesse, Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda got on the board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind Vitesse. The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two scores from Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick. Feyenoord played their last February match on the 23rd away against FC Twente. They created a two-goal lead halfway in the second <b>half</b> <b>from</b> goals by Pellè and Boëtius before Twente scored twice to lead to a 2–2 draw. The last goal came after 5 minutes of stoppage time and was controversial as it was even considered to be offside by Twente player Castaignos. The club ended February fourth in the league table.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Tennessee {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. After a short return, Tennessee's offense started the <b>half</b> <b>from</b> its 30-yard line. Crompton completed passes of 11 and 8 yards, then Virginia Tech's defense halted the Tennessee advance and forced a punt. Virginia Tech's offense began its first drive {{of the second half}} at its 26-yard line, with 13:02 remaining in the quarter. From the 26, Tech began an eight-play drive that saw Ryan Williams carry the ball on seven consecutive plays. Only the final play of the drive, a one-yard touchdown run by Tyrod Taylor, didn't feature the Tech running back. Williams opened the drive with a 21-yard sprint and had a 32-yard run during the possession that ended with Taylor's touchdown at the 8:42 mark in the quarter. The touchdown and extra point extended Tech's lead to 24-14.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru FC flagged February {{off with}} a home game against Sporting Clube de Goa. After missing an early chance, Bengaluru lost the lead when Odafa Onyeka Okolie scored in the 9th minute.

However, the home team's joy was short lived as Odafa {{completed}} his brace in 74th minute and Bengaluru faced first loss at home in the season. In the next home game Bengaluru FC faced I-League debutant DSK Shivajians F.C.. Bengaluru were leading 2–0 with a goal each from Sunil Chhetri and Kim Song-Yong, but due to a defensive error from Bengaluru FC, DSK Shivajians pulled one back by a goal from ex-Bengaluru player Sampath Kuttymani, just before the half time. Bengaluru FC finished the game 4–1 with two more goals in the second <b>half</b> <b>from</b> substitutes Shankar Sampingiraj and Seminlen Doungel, and reclaimed the top spot. In the next game against the defending champion, Mohun Bagan, after the goalless first half, Lalchhuanmawia was sent off by the referee. Jeje Lalpekhlua finally broke the deadlock in 73rd minute from Cornell Glenn's pass. Mohun Bagan doubled the lead by Sony Norde's goal and Bengaluru FC faced second defeat at home and third defeat of the season. After facing a string of defeats, Bengaluru FC got back to winning ways against Aizawl F.C., when C.K. Vineeth's second half goal was enough to secure 3 points.|$|E
