Among the celebrated nonfiction books {{in the field are}} Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball.

5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the <b>Field</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E

40|$|Dreaming is a {{universal}} human experience. Despite this universality, dreams are easily forgotten and home dream recall frequency varies considerably among individuals and within one individual from night to night. Investigation into the dream recall process remains a core issue in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> research. Studies suggest that dream recall can be affected by presleep conditions and that presleep suggestions can influence dream content. This single-subject A/B experiment was conducted {{to test the hypothesis}} that dream recall would be enhanced using presleep self-suggestion. The results showed no increase in dream recall during the self-suggestion period. More research needs to be done before this question can be answered with any degree of confidence...|$|R

500|$|The film's {{exploration}} of {{fathers and sons}} coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, [...] and <b>Field</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dreams.</b> Writing for The New York Times, Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected New Age concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana or his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the evil Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their boys' own adventure. James contrasted the temple's biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet conversation between the Joneses at the film's end. James noted that Indiana's mother {{does not appear in}} the prologue, being portrayed as already having died before the film's events began.|$|E
500|$|Baseball has {{inspired}} many {{works of art}} and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem [...] "Casey at the Bat", appeared in 1888. A wry description {{of the failure of}} a star player in what would now be called a [...] "clutch situation", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and <b>Field</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> (1989). The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. Gaskin's [...] "Slide, Kelly, Slide", Simon and Garfunkel's [...] "Mrs. Robinson", and John Fogerty's [...] "Centerfield". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch [...] "Who's on First", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century. Baseball is also featured in various video games including , Wii Sports, [...] and Mario Baseball.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the correlation <b>of</b> <b>dreamed</b> and actual actions. This issue {{is related to}} the theory of neural simulation of action.

By reviewing studies conducted in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> and lucid dream research on REM sleep it will be shown that correlations between dreamed and actual actions can be found for central nervous activity, autonomic responses and time aspects.

500|$|According to ESPN {{columnist}} Rob Neyer, [...] "with {{that single}} decision, Landis {{might have done}} more for the sport than anyone else, ever. Certainly, Landis never did anything more important." [...] According to Carney, [...] "The public amputation of the eight Sox {{was seen as the}} only acceptable cure." [...] Over the years of Landis's commissionership, a number of the players applied for reinstatement to the game, notably Jackson and Weaver. Jackson, raised in rural South Carolina and with limited education, was said to have been drawn unwillingly into the conspiracy, while Weaver, though admitting his presence at the meetings, stated that he took no money. Both men stated that their play on the field, and their batting percentages during the series (.375 for Jackson, [...]324 for Weaver) indicated that they did not help to throw the series. None was ever reinstated, with Landis telling a group of Weaver supporters that his presence at the meetings with the gamblers was sufficient to bar him. Even today, long after the deaths of all three men, efforts are periodically made to reinstate Jackson (which would make him eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame) and Weaver (deemed by some the least culpable of the eight). In the 1990s, a petition drive to reinstate Jackson drew 60,000signatures. [...] He has been treated sympathetically in movies such as Eight Men Out and <b>Field</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dreams,</b> and Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Feller expressed their support for Jackson's induction into the Hall. Landis's expulsion of the eight men remains in force.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen LaBerge (born 1947) is a psychophysiologist and {{a leader}} in the {{scientific}} study <b>of</b> lucid <b>dreaming.</b> In 1967 he received his Bachelor's Degree in mathematics. He began researching lucid dreaming for his Ph.D. in Psychophysiology at Stanford University, which he received in 1980. He developed techniques to enable himself and other researchers to enter a lucid dream state at will, most notably the MILD technique (mnemonic induction <b>of</b> lucid <b>dreams),</b> which was necessary for many forms <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> experimentation. [...] In 1987, he founded The Lucidity Institute, an organization that promotes research into lucid dreaming, as well as running courses for the general public on how to achieve a lucid <b>dream.</b> His technique <b>of</b> signalling to a collaborator monitoring his EEG with agreed-upon eye movements during REM became the first published, scientifically-verified signal from a dreamer's mind to the outside world. The first confirmed signal came from Alan Worsley under study in England; however his group did not publish their results until later. Though the technique is simple, it opens broad new avenues <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> research and pushed the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> research, or oneirology, beyond its protoscientific and largely discredited psychoanalytic roots, establishing it as a fruitful and respectable discipline.|$|R
40|$|The neural {{mechanisms}} underlying lucid dreaming {{have recently}} been investigated using brain imaging techniques such as electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, which produce insightful but merely correlative results. We propose that research on the neurophysiology <b>of</b> lucid <b>dreaming,</b> for instance concerning the exact relationship between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and metacognitive insight into {{the fact that one}} is dreaming, should be complemented by methods allowing direct causal interference with neural functioning during sleep. To achieve this aim, several stimulation methods are proposed, i. e. transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and galvanic vestibular stimulation. Given the broad range of cognitive and metacognitive processing in dreams, which support a continuous view of lucid and nonlucid dreaming, we further propose that certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> lucidity and its neural mechanisms can be investigated in so-called ordinary, nonlucid dreams. This would allow for phenomenologically more comprehensive and practically more efficient experiments in this <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>dream</b> research.
