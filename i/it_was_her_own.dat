George explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> decision to leave the show, in response to the assertions that her departure was done to [...] "de-gay" [...] Grey's Anatomy. The character has received mixed feedback from critics, and has been characterized as [...] "naughty", [...] "mischievous", and [...] "nutty".|$|E
500|$|On 9 November 1858, the Bury and Norwich Post {{recorded}} {{that earlier}} that month, a waistcoat, silk handkerchief, and £3 in gold {{were stolen from}} a labourer, Richard Butcher, who lived in Stanford-le-Hope. Butcher had gone to Murrell, asking him to use his skills to locate and retrieve his stolen property; when Murrell failed to do so, Butcher turned to the police to apprehend the culprit. Other accounts were passed down in local folk accounts; Maple interviewed an eighty-six-year-old Mrs Petchey, who stated that [...] "My mother lost a brooch, and Murrell told her who had stolen it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> sister-in-law. He wouldn't tell her, though, unless she promised not to tell anyone. The brooch was back in its old place a few days later." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you I never had a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E

500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2007, several BNP officials, {{including}} councillor Sadie Graham {{and head}} of administration Kenny Smith, had pressed for the expulsion of three senior officials—treasurer John Walker, his deputy Dave Hannam and director of publicity Mark Collett—who they accused of bringing the BNP into disrepute. The BNP later accused Graham and Smith of being [...] "far left" [...] infiltrators. In December Graham and Smith launched a blog detailing their complaints against the trio. They were dismissed from their positions by Nick Griffin. During the ensuing dispute, members of BNP security seized a computer from Graham's home. Griffin claimed that they were recovering party property, while Graham claimed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own.</b> A number of BNP councillors later resigned the whip after Councillor Nina Brown claimed that BNP Security had misled her into giving them the key to Sadie Graham's home.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson {{suggests}} that Raquel epitomised {{the representation of}} Northern working-class women during the 1990s: [...] "Raquel articulated the hopes of many young women in her position. The character was complex; one that the whole audience loved, she was naive, gentle, and although {{she looked as if}} she would break men's hearts, for the most part <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> heart that was broken." [...] Hobson deemed Raquel's breakdown at the registry office prior to her marriage to Curly [...] "one of the most poignant and heartbreaking of any scene in a soap opera, or indeed in any other dramas." [...] She felt that in sobbing with awareness that she was marrying not for love but security, Raquel [...] "spoke of the young working-class women, bright, intelligent, who had been failed by the education system, thus united the shared cultural knowledge of the audience as she wept for herself and millions of other women like her." ...|$|E

50|$|Kim {{started to}} receive {{critical}} acclaim {{in the late}} 1990s and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> belief that <b>her</b> work <b>was</b> partly recognized because at that {{time there was a}} generally strong wave of women’s poets and poetry.|$|R
