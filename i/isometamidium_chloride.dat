To determine the effect of a single treatment with <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> at 10 microg/ml on the fly's susceptibility to infection with isometamidium chloride-resistant trypanosome strains, treated flies were infected with one of two resistant isogenic T. congolense IL 1180 strains 3 d after the first feed. Results showed that a single <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> treatment at 10 microg/ml blood sufficed to reduce significantly the fly's subsequent susceptibility to infection. Only 6. 8 % of the flies that were treated with <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> developed a mature infection with T. congolense in the mouthparts compared with 34. 3 % of the control group.

40|$|Bovine {{trypanosomosis}} is {{a serious}} constraint to livestock development in large parts of Mozambique. In most areas where tsetse flies are present, the disease in livestock is controlled using curative and prophylactic trypanocidal drugs. Those drugs {{have been used for}} many years and new drugs are unlikely to become available in the near future. As a result, trypanosomes have developed resistance against the currently available trypanocidal compounds. Drug resistance has been detected in various African countries and {{is a serious}} impediment to the control of livestock trypanosomosis. A study was initiated to determine whether drug resistant trypanosome strains are present in Zambézia Province of Mozambique. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the sensitivity of Trypanosoma congolense isolates from Chinde, Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa Districts to diminazene aceturate, <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> and homidium chloride. To assess the effect of the farming system and the intensity of drug regimens on the development of drug resistance, trypanosome isolates were collected from cattle from subsistence, semisubsistence and commercial livestock production systems. Drug-use practices in each of the production systems were determined using a questionnaire. The methodology used to assess the level of drugs resistance in the trypanosome isolates was the standardized method described by Eisler et al. (2001). Seven isolates were selected for resistance testing. For each of the seven isolates, five different doses varying between 0. 01 - 20 mg/kg body weight for <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride,</b> 0. 01 - 10 mg/kg body weight for homidium chloride and 1 - 30 mg/kg body weight for diminazene aceturate were used. For each dose rate six mice were treated intraperitoneally with the appropriate quantity of the drug dissolved in 0. 2 ml of sterile distilled water 24 hours after the inoculation of the blood containing the trypanosomes. The control mice (six mice per trypanocidal drug) received the same amount of water without the drug. In four of the seven isolates high levels of multiple drug resistance (diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride)</b> were detected. One isolate had a low level of multiple (diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride)</b> drug resistance. Two isolates were susceptible to both diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride.</b> One of those was highly susceptible to <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> even at the lowest dose rate. The observed levels of drug resistance could in most cases be correlated to the drug-use practices in the particular livestock production system. The results obtained from homidium chloride treatment are not conclusive, because most the mice cured after receiving 10 mg/kg body weight of the drug. Hence more research is required to establish the homidium threshold in mice. The results of this study should be useful to define the strategy of disease control in places where resistance of trypanocide were been reported.

40|$|<b>Isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> has {{remained}} a very important prophylactic and therapeutic drug against trypanosomosis in cattle since its introduction into {{the market in the}} 1950 s with, unfortunately, a concomitant development of resistance in trypanosomosis endemic areas. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) was used to compare two isogenic clones of Trypanosoma congolense. The parent clone, sensitive to isometamidium, has a CD 50 (the curative dose that gives complete cure in 50 % of the animals) in the mouse of 0. 018 mg/kg and its derivative exposed to increasing doses of isometamidium, has a CD 50 that is 94 -fold higher. Sixty-four combinations of eight Eco RI and eight Mse I primers were used in comparative AFLP analysis to detect subtle genetic differences between the two clones. Thirty-five polymorphic fragments of DNA that were observed only in the resistant clone were purified and then sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were used in searching the GeneDB T. congolense database to find surrounding sequences upstream of an open reading frame and downstream to a stop codon. The sequences of the open reading frames were subsequently compared to the sequences in the genomic databases. A predicted gene coding for an 854 amino acids protein was thus identified. The protein contains a putative ATP binding site, Walker B and LSGG motifs and eight predicted trans-membrane domains. The gene in the resistant strain of T. congolense has a triplet insertion coding for an extra lysine.

In mice the 50 % curative doses (CD 50) for Samorin range from 0. 007 to 20 mg/kg body weight. Uptake of <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> demonstrated Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics in all the populations, with Km values in the range 0. 35 - 0. 87 microM, and Vmax varied from 17 to 216 pmol/min per 10 (8) cells. The magnitude of Vmax was correlated with sensitivity to the drug. In contrast, no correlation was observed between Km values and drug sensitivity. Pulse-chase experiments indicated two compartments for accumulation of drug. The first consists of freely diffusible drug that is invariant between populations; the other consists of retained isometamidium, which is of variable magnitude between the populations and is correlated with drug sensitivity. Autoradiography and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated initial, rapid accumulation of the drug within the mitochondrion, specifically the kinetoplast. In a drug-sensitive population of T. congolense, agents affecting mitochondrial function were shown to produce dose-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsimito), as measured by the accumulation of the lipophilic cations [3 H]methyltriphenylphosphonium iodide or rhodamine 123. The agents also produced parallel inhibition of isometamidium uptake, suggesting an involvement of DeltaPsimito in the accumulation of the drug. When characterized {{in each of the four}} populations, the spontaneous DeltaPsimito was shown to be characteristic of each population and was correlated with Vmax for drug uptake and sensitivity to the drug in vitro and in vivo. We therefore conclude that in T. congolense DeltaPsimito is an important determinant of the rate and accumulation of the trypanocide <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Populations of this trypanosome species vary with respect to DeltaPsimito, which is correlated with sensitivity to isometamidium.

The sensitivity to each drug was expressed as the minimum effective drug concentration which killed 100 percent of the trypanosomes in a given population within the 5 days. Using this assay, population IL 1180, characterised as being highly sensitive to all three drugs in vivo, required 10 ng/ml <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride,</b> 50 ng/ml homidium bromide or chloride and 5000 ng/ml diminazene aceturate to kill the entire population in vitro.

Trypanosoma congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate populations produced after 5 and 7 months drug selection, respectively. In order to determine whether Development of resistance to isometamidium resulted in cross-resistance to other anti-trypanosomal compounds, T. congolense IL 3343 was characterised in mice for its sensitivity to diminazene aceturate, homidium chloride and quinapyramine sulphate and had CD 50 values of 7. 8 mg/kg b. w., 12. 1 mg/kg b. w., respectively. Thus, a 94 -fold increase in resistance to <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> was associated with a 3 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene, a 33 -fold increase in resistance to homidium, and a 4 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine. Values for T. congolense IL 3341 and T. congolense IL 3342 were intermediate between those of T. congolense IL 1180 and T. congolense IL 3343. In a second study, resistance to quinapyramine sulphate was induced in T. congolense IL 1180 over a 7 -month period of drug selection, resulting in a population designated T. congolense IL 1180 /Stabilate 12. This population had a quinapyramine sulphate CD 50 of > 9. 6 mg/kg b. w., and diminazene aceturate, homidium chloride and <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> CD 50 values of 12. 7 mg/kg b. w., 10. g mg/kg b. w. and 0. 10 mg/kg b. w., respectively (Table 2). Thus, an approximately 40 -fold increase in resistance to quinapyramine was associated with a 6 -fold increase in resistance to isometamidium, 1 28 -fold increase in resistance to homidium and a 6 -fold increase in resistance to diminazene. In summary, these data indicate that Development of resistance to isometamidium in T. congolense IL 1180 was associated with a high level of cross-resistance to homidium, but low levels of cross-resistance to diminazene and quinapyramine. In contrast, the present data and those from goats indicate that Development of resistance to quinapyramine in the same trypanosome clone was associated with relatively high levels of cross-resistance to isometamidium, homidium and diminazene. These data therefore confirm the rationale for using isometamidium and diminazene as a "sanative" combination, and indicate that the use of quinapyramine in cattle, sheep and goats is contra-indicated since Development of resistance to the compound results in relatively high levels of cross-resistance to all three anti-trypanosomal compounds recommended for use in these livestock species. Finally, since resistance to diminazene is difficult to induce experimentally with diminazene, and such resistance usually occurs in the field as part of a multiple-resistance phenotype (Peregrine, 1994) ...|$|E

Methods: Thirty-six Yankasa sheep of {{both sexes}} {{were used for the}} study. The sheep were screened for ecto and endoparasites, and acclimatized for 2 weeks before the commencement of the experiment. The animals were randomly divided into six groups of six sheep each. Two groups (A and B) were infected intravenously with phosphate buffer solution dilute infected blood of approximately 2. 0 × 106 of T. vivax and two other groups (E and F) were also infected intravenously with blood containing the same number of T. congolense. The remaining two groups served as uninfected controls. Of the two T. vivax infected groups, one was further divided into three subgroups of two animals each and each of the sub-groups was treated with different trypanocides 9 days after the establishment of parasitaemia. The same treatment was carried out on the T. congolense infected groups. The other infected groups were left untreated. All the animals were monitored for 8 weeks post infection. Prepatent period of 6 d was recorded for both parasite species. Results: T. vivax was found to be resistant to homidium chloride but sensitive to diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> at the recommended doses. Conversely, T. congolense was found to be resistant to all the three trypanocides used at the recommended doses. Conclusions: Although, resistance to trypanocides exists, it was observed to be more prominent with T. congolense than T. vivax infected sheep...|$|E

Twelve of the stabilates were inoculated into individual Boran (Bos indicus) calves and characterised for their sensitivity, in turn, to diminazene aceturate (Berenil), <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> (Samorin) and homidium chloride (Novidium). All 12 stabilates produced infections which were shown to be Trypanosoma congolense and resistant to treatment with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7. 0 mg kg - 1 body weight (b. w.). Eleven of the infections were also resistant to <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> at a dose of 0. 50 mg kg - 1 b. w. The drug - sensitivity phenotypes {{of three of the}} same isolates were also determined in goats which were each treated with only one of the three trypanocides: all expressed the same phenotypes as the populations expressed in the aforementioned Boran calves. Five clones were derived from one of the isolates which expressed a high level of resistance to all three trypanocides: each alone expressed high levels of resistance to all three trypanocides when characterised in mice. Thus, the multi-resistance phenotype of the parental isolate was associated with expression of multi-resistance by individual trypanosomes. Finally, molecular karyotypes and electrophoretic variants of six enzymes were determined for seven and eight of the isolates, respectively. Six different karotypes were observed and all light of the latter isolates belonged to different zymodemes, indicating that the multi-resistance phenotype at Ghibe was associated with many genetically distinct populations...|$|E

40|$|Trypanosomosis is an {{important}} disease affecting humans as well as animals. It remains a big constraint to livestock productions in tropical areas. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the importance of trypanosomosis among cattle diseases in Burkina Faso, mainly in tsetse-challenged areas, and to capture information on how farmers apply available methods for controlling the disease. A survey has been carried out in 29 villages of Burkina Faso in three regions (north, southwest, and west regions). One hundred and thirty-four cattle breeders were interviewed individually with a questionnaire. The results indicate that among the 16 diseases mentioned by cattle breeders, trypanosomosis is the most important one in tsetse-challenged areas. Overall, 76. 12 % of the breeders mentioned it as the most important disease, while 54. 55 % of the farmers in the southwest region and 70. 91 % of the farmers in the west region ranked it as a priority disease. Chemoprophylaxis/chemotherapy is widely used as a control method. <b>Isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> and diminazene aceturate were used by 53. 49 and 46. 52 % of the responders, respectively. Among farmers, 85. 55 % ranked diminazene aceturate as the less efficient while 14. 45 % ranked <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> as the most efficient trypanocid. Trypanocidal drug quality and drug resistance were raised as a major concern by 30. 77 and 50 % of the respondents, respectively.

40|$|Eleven {{groups of}} male cattle (39 on average per group) were {{monitored}} for presence of trypanosomes at 3 -weekly intervals for periods {{of up to}} 27 weeks at a feedlot of Ferkessedougou, northern Cote d'Ivoire, in an area supposedly free of tsetse. All animals originated from or grazed during transhumance in south west Mali. The groups were assigned to different treatment regimes {{as they enter the}} feed lot. All animals of six groups were treated with diminazene aceturate {{on the first day of}} sampling, three groups at a dose of 3. 5 mg/kg and three groups at 7 mg/kg body weight. Similarly three groups were treated with <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> at a dose of 0. 5 mg/kg. As the feed lot ceased its operations, only one group was treated with the same drug at a dose of 1 mg/kg and an 11 th group was treated with homidium bromide at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Every animal was thus treated with either diminazene aceturate, isometamidum chloride or homidium bromide at the time of first sampling and with a "sanative pair" if detected parasitaemic again. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the one group initially treated with homidium. Five animals were detected parasitaemic at week 0 in two groups treated with <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> at 1 mg/kg bodyweight. Two of these animals were detected parasitaemic again, one at 3 weeks and one at 12 weeks following treatment. Infections were then treated with dimianzene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight and apparently cured. No animals were detected parasitaemic at any time in the other two groups treated with <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg, and in 2 of the 22 animals detected parasitaemic 3 and receiving diminazene aceturate at 7 mg/kg body weight. There was 15 subsequent cases of parasitaemia in animals first treated with diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight that were sampled on at least three occasions following further treatment with isometamidum chloride. Parasitaemia was detected again in 8 animals (53 percent) within 9 weeks of treatment. These results provide evidence of a problem of drug resistance to isometamidum having developed among trypanosomes in two of the eleven groups of animals. Diminazene aceturate at 3. 5 mg/kg body weight had apparently failed to cure infections in 14 animals in these two groups. there was however less evidence of drug failure when the higher dose of 7 mg/kg body weight was used in two other groups...|$|E
40|$|<b>Isometamidium</b> <b>Chloride</b> (ISM) {{is one of}} the {{principal}} drugs used to counteract Trypanosoma congolense infection in livestock, both as a prophylactic as well as a curative treatment. However, numerous cases of ISM resistance have been reported in different African regions, representing a significant constraint in the battle against Animal African Trypanosomiasis. In order to identify genetic signatures associated with ISM resistance in T. congolense, the sensitive strain MSOROM 7 was selected for induction of ISM resistance in a murine host. Administered ISM concentrations in immune-suppressed mice were gradually increased from 0. 001  mg/kg to 1  mg/kg, the maximal dose used in livestock. As a result, three independent MSOROM 7 lines acquired full resistance to this concentration after five months of induction, and retained this full resistant phenotype following a six months period without drug pressure. In contrast, parasites did not acquire ISM resistance in immune-competent animals, even after more than two years under ISM pressure, suggesting that the development of full ISM resistance is strongly enhanced when the host immune response is compromised. Genomic analyses comparing the ISM resistant lines with the parental sensitive line identified shifts in read depth at heterozygous loci in genes coding for different transporters and transmembrane products, and several of these shifts were also found within natural ISM resistant isolates. These findings suggested that the transport and accumulation of ISM inside the resistant parasites may be modified, which was confirmed by flow cytometry and ex vivo ISM uptake assays that showed a decrease in the accumulation of ISM in the resistant parasites.

This knowledge can be exploited for the rational design of drugs to which the parasites may not easily develop resistance. In order to investigate genetic mechanisms underlying the <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> resistance in African trypanosomes, a clone of Trypanosoma congolense was made 200 -fold more resistant to the drug by continued subcurative treatment.

40|$|The efficacies {{of three}} {{trypanocidal}} drugs, diminazene aceturate, <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> and homidium bromide, were evaluated in four representative areas of Cote d'Ivoire with different production systems, degree of integration of different trypanosomosis control approaches {{and delivery of}} veterinary inputs. Herds were selected as follows: (i) twelve traditional, sedentary herds around Boundiali {{with a mixture of}} cattle genotypes, dominantly crosses between trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle: (ii) eleven groups of Zebu cattle at the Ferkessedougou feedlot, originating dominantly from Mali {{at the time of the}} experiments; (iii) fifteen private N'Dama cattle herds in the Bouake area: (iv) sixteen herds of N'Dama cattle at the Marahouse State Ranch. Groups of animals or herds in the four locations were systematically treated with one of the three drugs at given doses (3. 5 mg/kg or 7 mg/kg for diminazene aceturate, 0. 5 or 1 mg/kg for <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> and 1 mg/kg for homidium bromide. Screening for relapse of infection post treatment was done either at 3 week intervals in three sites, or at monthly intervals in the Boundiali area by the buffy coat parasite detection technique. Failures of at least one of the three drugs to control trypanosome infection were observed to a vary ing degree in all but one location. Table 1 indicates the frequency of recurrent infections in the four regions. There was evidence of drug resistance for all three drugs in Boundiali (Coulibaly et al., this volume), for diminazene aceturate and <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride,</b> the two drugs tested in Ferkessedougou (Atse et al., this volume), and for homidium bromide in Bouake. Most parasitaemias detected in cattle in Boundiali were associated with T. vivax (86 percent). The prevalence of T. congolense had previously been reduced through the introduction of tsetse control in the location. Trypanosoma vivax was also more prevalent than T. congolense in cattle sampled at Ferkessedougou. Further south T. congolense was the dominant species and in one herd in Bouake with a high prevalence of trypanosomes a large number of relapses occurred to homidium bromide. At Marahoue Ranch the prevalence of recurrent infection was less than 5 percent. In conclusion: there was evidence for resistance to all three trypanocidal drugs at Boundiali and to isometamidium at Ferkessedougou in cattle imported from southern Mali; at Ferkessedougou, a dose of 7 mg/kg body weight seemed necessary for successful application of diminazene; both T. congolense and T. vivax species appeared to express resistance to the three trypanocidal drugs in the tsetse controlled area of Boundiali, it might be difficult to control the residual T. vivax population; further south, there was less evidence of resistance to the three trypanocidal drugs, except possible for homidium at Bouake. The self-cure ability of the N'Dama may have helped to prevent evidence for drug resistance being revealed in this area...|$|E

A total of 81 cattle owners was randomly selected and interviewed, of which 92. 5 % were aware of tsetse flies and trypanosomosis and 87. 6 %recognised animal trypanosomosis as a problem in the area. Most cattle owners were aware of tsetse fly trapping (76. 5 %), <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> use (55. 5 %), diminazene aceturate use (48 %) and pour-on applications (18. 5 %). However, knowledge did not coincide with the application of control measures.

Differences between awareness and application were highly significant for tsetse fly trapping (c 2 = 67. 8, d. f. = 1, P&lt; 0. 001) and pour-on applications (c 2 = 10. 8, d. f. = 1, P&lt; 0. 05), but not for <b>isometamidium</b> <b>chloride</b> use (c 2 = 0. 08, d. f. = 1, P = 0. 77) and diminazene aceturate use (c 2 = 0. 00, d. f. = 1, P = 1. 00). Most cattle owners (97. 5 %) were willing to participate in future control programmes, but preferred participating on a group basis (85. 2 %) rather than individually (14. 8 %). The 4 most favoured control options in order of importance were: fly traps supplied by the government and maintained by cattle owners; contribution of labour by cattle owners for trap deployment; self-financing of trypanocidal drugs and self-financing of pour-on insecticide.
