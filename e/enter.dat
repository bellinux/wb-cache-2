5|$|Adult males <b>enter</b> a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first <b>enter</b> musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25â€“35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to <b>enter</b> musth during the dry season (Januaryâ€“May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (Juneâ€“December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
