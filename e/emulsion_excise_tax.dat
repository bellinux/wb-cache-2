40|$|Increasing {{the price}} of {{cigarettes}} reduces the demand for cigarettes, thereby reducing youth smoking initiation and cigarette consumption and decreasing the prevalence of cigarette use in the United States overall, particularly among youths and young adults (1, 2). The most common way governments have increased {{the price of}} cigarettes is by increasing cigarette <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> (1, 2), which currently are imposed by all states and the District of Columbia (1). To update data on state cigarette <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> in 2009 (3), CDC conducted a survey of changes in state cigarette <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> during 2010 – 2011. During that period, eight states increased their cigarette <b>excise</b> <b>taxes,</b> and one state decreased its tax; as a result, the mean state tax increased from $ 1. 34 in 2009 to $ 1. 46 in 2011. Previous evidence indicates that further increases in cigarette <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> {{would be expected to}} result in further reductions in demand for cigarettes, decreasing smoking and associated morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Cigarettes and other tobacco products are taxed by federal, state, and local governments in various ways, including through <b>excise</b> <b>taxes,</b> which typically are levied per pack of 20 cigarettes (1). Cigarette <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> rates are set by legislation; <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> usually are collected before the point of sale from manufacturers, distributors, or wholesalers and often are denoted by a tax stamp.

40|$|Background Although higher {{taxation}} {{of tobacco}} products {{is considered the}} most cost-effective tobacco control policy, its negative impact on low-income groups {{is one of the}} arguments used against it. Objective To investigate the impact of current <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> and the increases of <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> on tobacco and household expenditures by expenditure tertiles, and examine who pays <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> in general. Method Impacts of <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> on cigarettes are examined with a budgetary approach. We first estimate the price elasticity of cigarettes by expenditure tertiles using data from the 2003 Turkish Household Expenditure Survey, the most recent data set covering detailed tobacco product information relevant to our analysis. We then conduct a number of simulation analyses by increasing the <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> per pack of cigarettes and examine the impacts of these increases on household expenditures. Finally, as <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> increases, we predict the total <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> paid by households in different expenditure tertiles and compare the concentration curve of <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> spending with the Lorenz curve showing the cumulative share of total household expenditures by expenditure tertiles. We estimate the progressivity coefficient that measures the area between the Lorenz and concentration curves. Results The low-income group is found to be the most sensitive to tax and price increases. It spends a relatively higher share of the household expenditure on cigarettes compared with higher income groups. However, the results suggest a different outcome as <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> increases; the share of household expenditures spent on cigarettes declines for all household tertiles but a significant reduction occurs on the lowest expenditure tertile, suggesting that increases in <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> are progressive. Furthermore, the highest expenditure tertile pays the highest <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> among expenditure tertiles, and their share in total excise revenue increases as the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> per pack of cigarettes increases. Conclusions The poor smoking households benefit the most from increases in excise taxes; from a budgetary perspective, as they reduce their smoking consumption significantly, the share of their excise payment in total household expenditures declines. From a health perspective, they are likely to have more health benefits as their consumption reduces. Government revenues are also predicted to increase with increased <b>excise</b> <b>taxes,</b> and the government can allocate a part of these revenue increases on implementing and enforcing other tobacco control measures including cessation support and smokefree environments. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

40|$|Excerpt] The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P. L. 111 - 148, as amended) {{includes}} a 40 % <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, {{often referred to}} as the Cadillac tax. The 40 % <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> is assessed on the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored health coverage that exceeds a dollar limit. If a tax is owed, it is levied on the entity providing the coverage (e. g., the health insurance issuer or the employer). Under the ACA, the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> was to go into effect in 2018; however, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (CAA of 2016; P. L. 114 - 113) delays implementation until 2020. The <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> is included in the ACA to raise revenue to offset the cost of other ACA provisions (e. g., the financial subsidies available through the health insurance exchanges). The most current publicly available cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> was expected to increase federal revenues by $ 87 billion between 2016 and 2025, based on 2018 implementation. The <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> also is expected to limit the tax advantages for employer-sponsored health coverage. Many economists contend that the tax advantages lead to an overconsumption of coverage and health care services. This report provides an overview of the <b>excise</b> <b>tax.</b> The report includes cost estimates for the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> and explores the <b>excise</b> <b>tax’s</b> relationship with the tax advantages for employer-sponsored health coverage.
