Her name Mami Watanabe is a play on Mami Wata. Despite being Japanese <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> darkened in Japanese ganguro style. She also has a tattoo of a snake on her body and receives a watch and a mirror as gifts in the series, two items generally associated with Mami Wata.|$|E
25|$|Jadis {{makes her}} way to the garden on a {{mountain}} west of Narnia, where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.|$|E
500|$|Precise {{detail is}} not spared in {{descriptions}} of decay and disease, two vivid {{elements in the}} novel. Marneffe, for example, represents [...] His decrepit body {{is a symbol of}} society's weakness at the time, worn away from years of indulgence. The poison which kills Valérie and Crevel is also described in ghastly detail. The doctor Bianchon explains: [...] "Ses dents et ses cheveux tombent, elle a l'aspect des lépreux, elle se fait horreur à elle-même; ses mains, épouvantables à voir, sont enflées et couvertes de pustules verdâtres; les ongles déchaussés restent dans les plaies qu'elle gratte; enfin, toutes les extrémités se détruisent dans la sanie qui les ronge." [...] ("She is losing her hair and teeth, <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> like a leper's, she is a horror to herself; her hands are horrible, covered with greenish pustules, her nails are loose, and the flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors.") ...|$|E

500|$|Elaine {{is usually}} {{depicted}} as a beautiful woman with long red hair and with green eyes. She wears a variety of pirate clothing consistent with the game's Golden Age of Piracy setting; her outfit usually consists of pantaloons, a blouse worn under a lightweight tunic, a sash, boots and a headscarf. Elaine usually wears gold earrings, though by Tales of Monkey Island, she wears her diamond engagement ring as an earring until Chapter 2. Her appearances in The Secret of Monkey Island and [...] are {{in the form of}} pixel art, with appearances slightly differing between the EGA, Amiga and VGA versions of the games. By The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine is rendered in a cartoon art style by LucasArts artists Larry Ahern and Bill Tiller, although the character's choice of clothing remains consistent. Escape from Monkey Island translated Ahern and Tiller's depiction into 3D graphics, while the later special editions and Tales of Monkey Island produced a more stylized art form for the character. While under LeChuck's influence as his demon bride in Tales of Monkey Island, Elaine is dressed in a Gothic wedding dress and a tiara, her eyes are pupiless and <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> given a green hue.|$|E
2500|$|Portraits {{produced}} during the Renaissance provide an invaluable resource for visualizing {{and understanding the}} beauty ideals of the period. [...] Sandro Botticelli’s Venus and Mars, painted between 1480-1490 depicts Venus as the ultimate amalgamation of female physical beauty. [...] Her face is perfectly symmetrical, <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> unblemished and pure white, her hair is light in color and slightly waved, her forehead is high, her eyebrows are severely arched, her lips are red and full and her abdomen and hips protrude slightly under her thin garment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Boulanger {{returned}} to the US for a longer tour. She had arranged to give a series of lectures at Radcliffe, Harvard, Wellesley and the Longy School of Music, and to broadcast for NBC. During this tour, {{she became the first}} woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In her three months there, she gave over a hundred lecture-recitals, recitals and concerts These included the world premiere of Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks Concerto. [...] At that time she was seen by American sculptor Katharine Lane Weems who recorded in her diary, “Her voice is surprisingly deep. She is quite slim with an excellent figure and fine features, <b>Her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> delicate, her hair graying slightly, she wears pince-nez and gesticulates as she becomes excited talking about music.” ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{body was}} so thin {{that one could}} almost see her skeleton. Her chest was as flat as a boy's. Her mouth, with its narrow pale lips, <b>was</b> ugly, and <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> faintly green.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{conflict}} between Wolverine and Cyclops {{that led to the}} former abandoning Utopia, Husk became a teacher at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. At a faculty meeting, Paige tries to express her insecurity about not being cut out for teaching because the students aren't listening to her. Ironically, Beast cuts her off before she can finish. Later, Cannonball expresses his frustration about there only being a memorial for dead X-Men, including their brother Jay, in the faculty lounge and that he doesn't understand how Paige agrees with this decision when she can't even look at Jay's picture. Casting off Sam's feelings, Paige announces she has class and needs to change. In reply to this, Sam states that she sheds her skin every time she's unhappy and her power isn't an antidepressant. At that moment, the school is attacked, and Paige is instructed to go teach as normal. During her class, Rogue interrupts and informs Paige {{that there is a problem}} with the [...] "heating system." [...] Upon leaving the class, Paige instantly husks into her fire form and destroys the invading N'Garai in the mansion. During Paige's time at the school, it becomes apparent that her mysterious molting condition is only worsening because <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> in a state of constant cracking and flaking.|$|E

50|$|The French were {{impressed}} by her appearance despite saying <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> too tanned. They also {{said she was a}} quiet girl. Upon hearing of this meeting at Lyon, Philip IV is said to have said the marriage would not happen..|$|R
50|$|In before-and-after {{photographs}} widely {{circulated in}} the media, her appearance was indeed radically altered, in particular her eyes, which were given double eyelids {{to give her}} a more occidental appearance (see Asian blepharoplasty).

All the king's horses {{and all the}} king's men shall not bend the bow that can despatch a clothyard shaft through thy pearly hide. The male and female women who nightly howl their social and political grievances into the wide ear of the universe are as insensible to the prickings of ridicule as they are unconscious of logic. An intellectual Goliah of Gath might spear them with an epigram like unto a weaver's beam, and the sting thereof would be as but the nipping of a red ant. Apollo might speed among them his silver arrows, which erst heaped the Phrygian shores with hecatombs of Argive slain, and they would but complain of the mosquito's beak.
