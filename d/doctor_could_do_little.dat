25|$|Most was in Cincinnati, Ohio to give {{a speech}} when he fell ill. He was {{diagnosed}} with erysipelas. The <b>doctors</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> for him, and he died a few days later.|$|R
50|$|In New York, McNeely's health {{deteriorated}} {{when another}} tumor was found. Because {{she was pregnant}} and abortion was then illegal, the <b>doctors</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to treat her. This adversity and lack of control over her own body fueled McNeely's feminism. She {{was one of the}} first to address the issue of abortion in her painting, Is it Real? Yes it is (1969).|$|R
25|$|There {{were two}} major {{outbreaks}} of yellow fever, in 1854 and 1867. <b>Doctors</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> since neither its cause nor transmission were understood. Sources say measures against its spread consisted of burning victims' bedclothes and placing burning tar buckets about town. In the first outbreak {{about a third}} of the town's then 700 inhabitants perished and in the second 300 of a population of 1000.|$|R
500|$|Transported {{aboard the}} cramped Mexican Eagle—the lack of space necessitated three trips—the emigrants were in miserable shape {{when they reached}} Belize, {{and in most cases}} had to be carried from the ship. The weather in British Honduras was even worse than that at the Black River, and the colony's {{authorities}} and <b>doctors</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to help the new arrivals. Disease spread rapidly among the settlers and most of them died. The colony's superintendent, Major-General Edward Codd, opened an official investigation to [...] "lay open the true situation of the imaginary State of Poyais and... the unfortunate emigrants", and sent word to Britain of the Poyais settlers' fate. By the time the warning reached London, MacGregor had five more emigrant ships on the way; Royal Navy vessels intercepted them. The surviving colonists variously settled in the United States, remained in British Honduras, or sailed for home aboard the Ocean, a British vessel that left Belize on 1 August 1823. Some died during the journey back across the Atlantic. Of the roughly 250 who had sailed on the Honduras Packet and the Kennersley Castle, at least 180 had perished. Fewer than 50 ever returned to Britain.|$|R
50|$|After advocating violent action, {{including}} the use of explosive bombs, as a mechanism to bring about revolutionary change, Most was forced into exile by the government. He went to France but was forced to leave at the end of 1878, settling in London. There he founded his own newspaper, Freiheit (Freedom), with the first issue coming off the press dated 4 January 1879. Convinced by his own experience of the futility of parliamentary action, Most began to espouse the doctrine of anarchism, which led to his expulsion from the German Social Democratic Party in 1880. Encouraged by news of labor struggles and industrial disputes in the United States, Most emigrated to the USA upon his release from prison in 1882. He promptly began agitating in his adopted land among other German émigrés. Most resumed the publication of the Freiheit in New York. He was imprisoned in 1886, again in 1887, and in 1902, the last time for two months for publishing after the assassination of President McKinley an editorial in which he argued that it was no crime to kill a ruler. A gifted orator, Most propagated these ideas throughout Marxist and anarchist circles in the United States and attracted many adherents, most notably Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Most was in Cincinnati, Ohio to give a speech when he fell ill. Diagnosed with erysipelas, <b>doctors</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> for him, and he died a few days later.|$|R
50|$|For the {{television}} series Star Trek: Voyager an emergency medical hologram, The Doctor, was introduced. It {{was designed to}} be an expert on all fields of medicine, able to do anything any organic <b>doctor</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|During the {{remainder}} of that day Gadarn <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> else than chuckle or laugh.|$|R
60|$|The youth below {{raised his}} hands feebly. But his {{strength}} was apparently gone, and he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to save himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{whole city}} {{was at once}} thrown into a commotion, and {{it was felt that}} the {{garrison}} <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> or nothing toward defending the place.|$|R
60|$|And now {{came the}} supreme struggle. The girl <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> {{more to help}} him. He must manage to clamber upon {{the top of the}} plank himself.|$|R
60|$|What {{the master}} of the Golden Eagle said was true, and as the {{firebrand}} was flashed on the scene, the chums <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> but stare in astonishment.|$|R
60|$|Arnold Baxter had {{recovered}} consciousness, but was evidently in great pain, for he moaned almost constantly. Dick {{was willing to}} aid the sufferer, yet <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> or nothing.|$|R
50|$|Back in England, Baltimore <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to {{help the}} young colony through its tribulations, which {{included}} an ongoing feud with Claiborne {{that led to a}} series of naval skirmishes.|$|R
60|$|Patsy now claimed him, with a frank greeting, and Arthur Weldon <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> {{more than}} press her hand when the line {{forced him to}} move on and give place to others.|$|R
60|$|Neal and Teddy <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> {{more than}} lie under the awning aft, working hard but unsuccessfully to keep cool by {{the aid of}} fans and such iced drinks as the steward prepared.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} the boy <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> but hold fast, but as his breath {{came back to him}} he climbed on top of the tree and took a look at the situation.|$|R
50|$|Campbell was {{replaced}} as Warriors boss by his assistant Sean Lineen on 28 March 2006. With the season almost over Lineen <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> {{to stop the}} Warriors finishing bottom of the Magners League.|$|R
60|$|He was in {{the midst}} of his labors when Songbird came in, {{followed}} by Spud, Stanley, Max and several others. All wanted to assist him, yet they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little.</b> Each was deeply sympathetic.|$|R
60|$|The guards struggled, {{but with}} four against them <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> or nothing. One, however, had a {{powerful}} pair of lungs, and before he could be stopped, set up a loud cry of alarm.|$|R
50|$|Alexandra and new husband, Dimitri Marick, {{were headed}} back to town from London {{to break the news}} of their marriage. Before they could tell the good news, Dimitri fell ill and {{subsequently}} died. She elected to remain hidden at the airport while Dimitri and his loved ones traveled to Seaview Hospital {{to see if there was}} anything that the <b>doctors</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to resurrect Dimitri.|$|R
60|$|He was {{supposed}} to be aiding Poyor; but, {{as a matter of fact}} he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> more than look out over the fortifications, fearing each moment that the enemy would make a sudden dash.|$|R
60|$|At first, of course, they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> else {{than make}} each other {{partially}} {{acquainted with the}} circumstances which had so strangely thrown them together, but Dominick soon {{put an end to}} this desultory talk.|$|R
50|$|Cassidy, who had {{previously}} managed in Cyprus and Northern Ireland, <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to reverse the slide in Rovers’ fortunes following the departure of previous manager Jim McInally and they were relegated from the Premier Division.|$|R
25|$|His career took a {{turn for}} the worse in the tour of West Indies in 1989–90. The batsmen {{deliberately}} attacked his bowling and even at Port of Spain, where the wicket helped spinners, he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|Seeing they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> with Sack Todd, the Rovers {{decided to}} put him down in the hold with the sailors and this was done. Then the party with Baxter {{gathered}} on deck to discuss the situation.|$|R
25|$|During World War II, under Clemence B. Horrall, {{the overall}} number of {{personnel}} was depleted by {{the demands of}} the military. Despite efforts to maintain numbers, the police <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to control the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots.|$|R
60|$|The young captain {{felt that}} he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> or nothing more, and {{expected}} each instant to have his assailants hurl themselves directly upon him, when a shout came from Sorrel which gave all of our friends hope.|$|R
50|$|The main Ifriqiyan army under Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri arrived {{too late}} to prevent the {{slaughter}} of the original army, and <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> more than hold the line around Tlemcen and appeal to Kairouan and Damascus for reinforcements.|$|R
25|$|Political {{instability}} began troubling {{the colony}} and revolts became commonplace. Given his limited resources and manpower, Irala <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> {{to check the}} raids of Portuguese marauders along his eastern borders. Irala left Paraguay prosperous for the Europeans and relatively at peace.|$|R
60|$|It took fully {{a quarter}} of an hour longer to get out of the rocky cave, and when the boys reached the surface of the earth they were so {{exhausted}} they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> but sit on the ground and pant for breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is quite}} {{as well as it}} is, Sir Gervaise," [...] {{returned}} the captain. [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> besides look at each other, in this gale, and Admiral Bluewater ought to join before I should like even to do that." ...|$|R
50|$|Croghan Hall {{gave the}} ailing Croghan a refuge from {{lawsuits}} and debtors' prison, but he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> more than watch as settlers {{poured into the}} Ohio Country on land he considered to be his. Pennsylvania appointed officials for newly established Bedford County in 1771.|$|R
5000|$|Chazny grouped three {{divisions}} in defensive positions at Beugency {{to make a}} stand with the Loire river on his right flank and his left in the forest of Marchenoir. Continual rain and snow coupled with flagging morale and disorganization he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> else.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} Matt <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> more than {{stare at the}} two men that confronted him. In a dim way he {{realized}} that Isaac Marvelling's store had been entered and robbed, and that the mean-minded store-keeper fully believed {{that he was the}} guilty party.|$|R
50|$|During {{operations}} on the Eastern Front in early 1944, often {{carried out in}} daylight at about 6,000 m (19,690 ft) or higher, losses were relatively light. The Soviet Air Force, equipped mainly for low-level interception and ground-attack roles, <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> to hinder the high-flying bombers.|$|R
50|$|In April 1915, the Imperial German Navy {{sent their}} first {{submarines}} to the Mediterranean {{in response to}} the Anglo-French Dardanelles campaign, after it became obvious that their Austro-Hungarian allies <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>little</b> against it with their small submarine force, which nevertheless was successful in defending the Adriatic.|$|R
