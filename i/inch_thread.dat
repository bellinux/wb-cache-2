50|$|On {{manually}} controlled lathes, {{the thread}} pitches {{that can be}} cut are, in some ways, determined by the pitch of the lead-screw: A lathe with a metric lead-screw will readily cut metric threads (including BA), while one with an imperial lead-screw will readily cut imperial-unit-based threads such as BSW or UTS (UNF, UNC). This limitation is not insurmountable, because a 127-tooth gear, called a transposing gear, is used to translate between metric and <b>inch</b> <b>thread</b> pitches. However, this is optional equipment that many lathe owners do not own. It is also a larger change-wheel than the others, and on some lathes may be larger than the change-wheel mounting banjo is capable of mounting.|$|E
5000|$|The American Petroleum Institute (API) {{specification}} 5B lists a [...] "round thread" [...] for tubing, {{often referred}} to as [...] "8 round" [...] or [...] "8rd" [...] for 8 threads per inch. The only other pitch listed is 10 threads per inch. The thread angle at the flank is 60 degrees, and the crest and root rounding radius is approximately p/6 for threads of pitch p. Both the thread angle and rounding radius are more like ordinary ISO threads than DIN. For 0.125 <b>inch</b> <b>thread</b> pitch (8 threads per inch), the API round thread root radius is 0.017 inch, and the crest radius is 0.020 inch. API threads taper at 3/4 inch of diameter per foot of length.|$|E
5000|$|The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most {{commonly}} used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes [...] inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16. The integer sizes {{can be converted to}} the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 &times; number. For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + 0.013 &times; 4 = 0.112 inches in diameter. There are also screw sizes smaller than [...] "0" [...] (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought - seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of [...] "ought" [...] size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by [...]013 and subtract from [...]060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is [...]060 - (3 x [...]013) = [...]060-.039 = [...]021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO Metric Screw Thread System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (<b>Inch)</b> <b>Thread</b> System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.67 ...|$|E

50|$|Ends {{per inch}} is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends per inch in order to pick the right reed to weave with.
