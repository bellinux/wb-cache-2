60|$|Soames, {{coming up}} to the City, with the {{intention}} of calling in at Green Street {{at the end of his}} day and taking Fleur back home with him, suffered from rumination. Sleeping partner that he was, he seldom visited the City now, but he still had a room of his own at Cuthcott Kingson & Forsyte's, and one special clerk and a half assigned to the management of purely Forsyte affairs. They were somewhat in flux just now--an auspicious moment for the disposal of house property. And Soames was unloading the estates of his father and uncle Roger, and to some extent of his uncle Nicholas. His shrewd and matter-of-course probity in all money concerns had made him something of an autocrat in connection with these trusts. If Soames thought this or thought that, one had better save oneself the bother of thinking too. He guaranteed, as it were, irresponsibility to numerous Forsytes of the third and fourth generations. His fellow trustees, such as his cousins Roger or Nicholas, his cousins-in-law Tweetyman and Spender, or his sister Cicely's husband all trusted him; he signed first, and where he signed first they signed after, and nobody was a penny the worse. Just now they were all a good many pennies the better, and Soames was beginning to see the close of certain trusts, except for distribution of the <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>securities</b> as gilt-edged as was compatible with the period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims at {{identifying}} the contributing factors to the solvency condition of selected commercial banks of Bangladesh and {{to propose a}} model that can be utilized to identify insolvency of the banks. The assumption behind the study entails that a bank may fail due to insolvency and there are factors with both systematic and idiosyncratic contents to influence the condition. The study further focuses on discovering significance of those contributing factors to the solvency of commercial banks of Bangladesh so that the model can be better utilized. The study used data of selected Bangladeshi commercial banks listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange and some macroeconomic data {{during the period of}} 2004 - 11. The data were analyzed using panel data regression method under both fixed effect and random effect frameworks. The study further conducts Hausman test, Wooldridge test, and Heterokedasticity test to validate the regressions models. The paper utilizes an insolvency ratio as a proxy of the solvency condition of the banks. The results show that the market valuation component, the ratio of <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>securities</b> to effective capital and the interaction term between Texas ratio and unemployment rate have significant impact on the insolvency ratio. Although serious liquidity problems theoretically can cause an otherwise solvent bank to fail under certain conditions, however, the findings of the study indicate that liquidity does not significantly affect the solvency condition of Bangladeshi commercial banks...|$|E

In accord with the generally good economy in the 1990 ’s, the share of property type income in total household <b>income</b> increased <b>from</b> 1990 to 2000. And with welfare reform in the mid- 1990 ’s the share of public assistance type income decreased {{as a share of}} household income. In order to better understand the relative importance of alternative sources of income to Washington households, each household was identified according to the income source which provided the largest contribution to household income. For example, a household whose largest source of <b>income</b> comes <b>from</b> salary and wages was identified as a Labor household. Similarly, households whose largest source of income was interest, dividends or net rentals were identified as Capital households. Labor and capital households are not very different in terms of mean household income. In 2000, average household income of Labor households was $ 65, 300 while the average household income of Capital households was $ 96, 200. However, Labor households were very different than Capital household regarding diversification of income source. Labor households depended upon wage income for 92 percent of mean household income.

Analyzing the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) for calendar year 2011, this briefing paper examines the role of Social Security and other income sources in the retirement security of older Americans. It explores the unique value of Social Security to different gender, age, race/ethnic, and marital groups. It finds that significant shares of the older population rely on Social Security for the majority of their income and that Social Security lifts 14. 8 million people out of poverty.

40|$|Working Paper: WP 2012 - 268 A {{review of}} the {{literature}} suggests that when pension values are measured by the wealth equivalent of promised DB pension benefits and DC balances for those approaching retirement, pensions account for more support in retirement than is suggested when their contribution is measured by <b>incomes</b> received directly <b>from</b> pension plans by those who have already retired. Estimates from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for respondents in their early fifties suggest that pension wealth is about 82 percent as valuable as Social Security wealth. In data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), for members of the same cohort, measured when they are 65 to 69, pension incomes are about 58 percent as valuable as <b>incomes</b> <b>from</b> Social <b>Security.</b> Our empirical analysis uses data from the HRS to examine the reasons for these differences in the contributions of pensions as measured in income and wealth data. Key factors accounting for these difference include: a difference in methodology between surveys affecting what is included in pension income; some pension wealth "disappears" at retirement because respondents change their pension into other forms that are not counted as pension income; and the form of annuitization may influence the measure of pension income.

40|$|This Briefing Paper {{examines}} {{major sources}} of income for older Americans—earnings, Social Security, pensions and assets—by gender and marital status. It shows that during retirement, Social Security {{is the most common}} and the largest source of income for both women and men. Approximately 90 percent of women and men 65 and older receive <b>income</b> <b>from</b> Social <b>Security.</b> During the retirement years, however, women face greater financial insecurity than men.

Having less access to other sources of income, women rely on Social Security even more than men do. The study is based on data from the 1999 - 2001 March Current Population Survey (CPS), collected by the Census Bureau. The March CPS is the primary source of detailed information on income in the United States, as it gathers annual information on more than 50 sources of income including earnings, Social Security payments, pension income, and other government cash and noncash benefits (e. g., food stamps, health insurance, etc.).
