5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of <b>development</b> <b>from</b> the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} <b>development</b> <b>from</b> embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Astrology {{was taken}} up by Islamic {{scholars}} following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and {{the founding of the}} Abbasid empire in the 8th. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754–775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as Bayt al-Hikma 'House of Wisdom', which continued to receive <b>development</b> <b>from</b> his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic-Persian translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad, and Sahl ibn Bishr, (a.k.a. Zael), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Country estates {{had been}} built in the area as early as the 1830s, and some of Louisville's great early mansions, {{predominantly}} in the Italianate style, were built along Broadway, very near Old Louisville, before the Civil War. <b>Development</b> <b>from</b> 1850 to 1870 occurred between Broadway and Kentucky Street, the northern extreme of what came to be called Old Louisville. North-south city streets were extended throughout the area in the 1850s, and a mulecar line was extended down Fourth to Oak in 1865.|$|E

5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing <b>development</b> <b>from</b> outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E
5|$|Lionel's <b>development</b> <b>from</b> a main {{antagonist}} to an ally {{was difficult}} for the writers, who felt the character's arc failed to achieve the status they wanted. Although they continued with the story arc, Lionel returned to using deception to protect Clark rather than exploit him. He is characterized as a sinister character who tried hard to further his own ambitions. Lionel's relationship with his son has been likened to that of Harry Osborn and Norman Osborn from Spider-Man comics.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from <b>development.</b> <b>From</b> sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E

5|$|The 400-year {{period from}} the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the Islamic Renaissance, {{a time when}} Islamic culture and science thrived. Greco-Roman texts were preserved, copied and {{extended}} although new texts always emphasised the medicinal aspects of plants. Kurdish biologist Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī (828–896 AD) {{is known as the}} founder of Arabic botany; his Kitâb al-nabât (‘Book of Plants’) describes 637 species, discussing plant <b>development</b> <b>from</b> germination to senescence and including details of flowers and fruits. The Mutazilite philosopher and physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (c. 980–1037 AD) was another influential figure, his The Canon of Medicine being a landmark in the history of medicine treasured until the Enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|The Dime Store was a {{short-lived}} restaurant in Portland, Oregon, in the United States.

Despite receiving a positive critical reception, the restaurant closed in November 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Four Quartets {{was first}} {{published}} as a series in New York in 1943 and London in 1944. The original title {{was supposed to be}} the Kensington Quartets after his time in Kensington. The poems were kept as a separate entity in the United States until they were collected in 1952 as Eliot's Complete Poems and Plays, and in the United Kingdom until 1963 as part of Eliot's Complete Poems 1909–62. The delay in collecting the Four Quartets with the rest of Eliot's poetry separated them from his other work, even though they were the result of a <b>development</b> <b>from</b> his earlier poems.|$|E
