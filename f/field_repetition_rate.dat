40|$|A {{new class}} of linear {{accelerator}} (linac) based THz facilities, aiming to provide peak THz fields in the GV/m regime from highly charged, ultra-short relativistic electron bunches is currently studied and developed worldwide. These facilities are based on low emittance, electron beams delivered by a linear radio frequency (RF) driven accelerator followed by one or several magnetic chicanes that act as bunch compressor. THz radiation is then emitted coherently for wavelengths appropriately longer than the longitudinal electron bunch length upon one single pass through any of the typical sources of synchrotron radiation. This allows for an enormous flexibility in the generated spectral, spatial and temporal properties of the THz pulses. Together with the theoretically large scalability and simplicity of these sources, they are discussed as extension of the THz pulses from laser-based THz sources towards extreme transient THz <b>fields</b> and high <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> with more than 10 projects currently being pursued worldwide. In this respect it is timely to investigate if current idealized theoretical descriptions can be technically fully realized.

In this thesis work, {{we describe the}} development of high repetition-rate fiber laser-based systems for the realization of these applications at 1550 nm wavelengths. To realize these systems, frequency comb sources are needed that are compatible with electric field stabilization techniques, are compatible with integrated arrayed waveguide grating and modulator technology, and have high <b>repetition</b> <b>rates</b> to allow full use of current modulator bandwidths.

40|$|Fulltext: From {{experiments}} with Q-switched solid state lasers {{it is known}} that a typical <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> exists, being characteristical for the employed laser crystal. If the actual <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> is below this value the pulse width taui s small, but the average power P decreases, while for a higer <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> the pulses become broad and P increases. The first case is preferable in order to achieve high peak powers, and crystals with a long fluorecence lifetime like Nd:YLF are the preferable choice. Nevertheless, for applications like marking or drilling the <b>repetition</b> <b>rate</b> is of high interest because it increases the processing speed.
