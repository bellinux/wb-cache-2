5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being {{less than that of}} water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus.

40|$|The {{joint action}} {{of a plant}} {{parasitic}} nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans (root-lesion nematode), and an insect defoliator, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle), on growth, development, and yield of Solanum tuberosum cv. Superior was studied in the field. Three population <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> P. penetrans were superimposed on each of three population levels of L. decemlineata. The major impact of P. penetrans on final yield was through {{a reduction in the}} number of tubers formed during tuber initiation. Defoliation by L. decemlineata increased with time as larvae advanced through successive instars and densities increased. This resulted in a significant reduction in tuber weight and numbers. Total yield of S. tuberosum was decreased by 66 % with increasing population <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> L. decemlineata and 27 % with increasing <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> P. penetrans.

40|$|AIMS: To {{quantify}} tau pathology {{of chronic}} traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and investigate influence of dot-like lesions (DL), brain region, co-morbidity, and sporting career length. METHODS: <b>Densities</b> <b>of</b> neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), astrocytic tangles (AT), DL, oligodendroglial inclusions (GI), neuropil threads (NT), vacuoles, neurons, and enlarged neurons (EN) were measured in tau-immunoreactive sections of upper cortical laminae of frontal and temporal lobe, hippocampus (HC), amygdala, and substantia nigra (SN) of eleven cases of CTE. RESULTS: DL were a consistent finding in CTE. <b>Densities</b> <b>of</b> NFT, NT and DL were greatest in sectors CA 1 and CA 2 <b>of</b> the HC. <b>Densities</b> <b>of</b> AT {{were lower than}} NFT, small numbers of GI were recorded in temporal lobe, and low <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> vacuoles and EN were consistently present. β-amyloid containing neuritic plaques (NP) also occurred at low <b>density.</b> <b>Densities</b> <b>of</b> NFT, NT, DL, and AT were greater in sulci than gyri while vacuole density was greater in gyri. Principal components analysis (PCA) suggested that sporting career length and <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> NFT in entorhinal cortex, NT in CA 2 and SN, and vacuolation in the DG were significant sources of variation among cases. CONCLUSION: DL are frequent in CTE suggesting affinity with argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-Dem). <b>Densities</b> <b>of</b> AT in all regions and NT/DL in sectors CA 2 / 4 were consistent features of CTE. The eleven cases are neuropathologically heterogeneous which may result from genetic diversity, and variation in anatomical pathways subjected to trauma. This article is protected by copyright.
