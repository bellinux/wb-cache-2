Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had {{the highest number of}} pilots per capita of any U.S. state.|$|E

[...] "And that's about all there <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bush</b> tribes behind have most probably got the other two hundred thousand. Return in three months, and the salt-water crowd will have traded back for it; also they {{will be out of}} tobacco by that time." ...|$|E

Jim says that, by what he heard, they have got some sort of houses they have built there. Let us make {{straight}} for them. If the blacks attack, drive them off; but we can settle with them, afterwards. The great point is to capture or kill the bush rangers." ...|$|E

6000|$|Great nerve, {{considerable}} skill, and first-rate horsemanship {{are required}} for the sport of pigsticking. The horse, too, must be fast, steady, well- trained and quick, for without all these advantages the sport is a dangerous one. The wild boar is, at the start, {{as fast as a}} horse. He is very quick at turning, and when pressed always attacks his pursuers, and as he rushes past will lay open the leg or flank of a horse with a sweeping cut with his sharp tusk. If he can knock a horse down the position of his rider would be serious indeed, were not help to arrive in time to draw off the attention of the enraged animal from his foe. Heavy falls, too, take place over watercourses and nullahs, and in some parts of India the difficulties are greatly increased by bowlders of all kinds being scattered over the ground, and by the frequent occurrence of bushes and shrubs armed with most formidable spines and thorns. Conspicuous among these <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> known as the [...] "wait-a-bit thorn," [...] which is furnished with two kinds of thorn--the one long, stiff, and penetrating, the other short and curved, with a forked point almost like a fishhook. When this once takes hold it is almost necessary to cut the cloth to obtain a release.|$|E

He repeated in September 2006 with an equally-heated speech criticizing what he felt to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's tendency to distract the public from key issues like the war in Iraq and the economy.|$|R

The Beastie, a smaller version of <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> Beast which catered to younger riders, {{was also one}} of the original rides. The park would later add rides such as the Demon (1992) and Space Probe 7 (1995; sponsored by the Seven Network, who bought naming rights to the ride. After this contract expired, the ride dropped the '7' from its name).|$|R

50|$|The {{maned wolf}} is not {{closely related to}} any other living canid. It is not a fox, wolf, coyote, dog, or jackal, but a {{distinct}} canid. Although based only on morphological similarities, it previously {{had been placed in}} Canis and Vulpes genera. Its closest living relative <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> dog (genus Speothos) and it has a more distant relationship to other South American canines (the short-eared dog, the crab-eating fox, and the 'false foxes' or Pseudalopex).|$|E

They have been porcupines (Sphiggurus insidiosus), cuchicuchis (Potos flavus) and weasels (Mustela nivalis), which are creatures of habit, and generally arboreal. Another interesting mammal from zoological point of view <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> dog (Speothos venaticus), seldom sighted and only in forests of this region.|$|E

W. Bush and George W. Bush respectively. The Bush mansion itself was sold and converted to non-residential use (as group home for the elderly). As of May 2007, it was renovated into upscale condominiums (Prescott Place).|$|E

[...] Secretary General Irene Khan also responded saying, [...] "The administration's response has been that our report is absurd, that our allegations have no basis, and our answer is very simple: if that is so, open up these detention centres, allow us and others to visit them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Accordingly, the Rockridge Institute {{attempted}} {{to monitor the}} manipulative use of framing, particularly by right wing organizations and politicians, and to promote frames that encourage progressive thinking. A much discussed example of framing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's use of the phrase War on Terror to describe its policies following the September 11th attacks. The use of the [...] "war" [...] metaphor, the Rockridge Institute and others contended, had a tremendous effect on U.S. policy and public debate. They further contended it has allowed the president to assume war powers, makes opposition to the [...] "war" [...] seem unpatriotic, and was used to justify the invasion of Iraq, although cooperation between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein had not occurred.If the U.S. response to September 11 had been framed as a criminal proceeding, the Rockridge Institute and others argued, such extraordinary measures would never have garnered sufficient political support.|$|E
500|$|The term Brumby {{refers to}} a feral horse in Australia.

In 1885, the Once a Month magazine suggested that rumbies was a New South Wales term, and the poet Banjo Paterson stated in the introduction for his poem Brumby's Run published in the Bulletin in 1894 that Brumby <b>was</b> <b>the</b> word for free-roaming horses.
