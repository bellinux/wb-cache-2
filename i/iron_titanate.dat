5000|$|Reactions {{in which}} {{one or more of}} the {{reactants}} are not known to occur naturally. Studies of reactions among materials related to naturally occurring materials may contribute to understanding of natural processes. These complementary studies are relevant to photogeochemistry in that they illustrate reactions that may have a natural counterpart. For example, it has been shown that soils, when irradiated, can generate reactive oxygen species and that clay minerals present in soils can accelerate the degradation of synthetic chemicals; it may therefore be postulated that naturally occurring compounds are similarly affected by sunlight acting on soil. The conversion of N2 to NH3 has been observed upon irradiation in the presence of the <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> Fe2Ti2O7. While such a compound is not known to occur naturally, it is related to ilmenite (FeTiO3) and pseudobrookite (Fe2TiO5), and can form upon heating of ilmenite; this may imply a similar reaction with N2 for the naturally occurring minerals.|$|E
30|$|The {{synthesized}} undoped {{and nitrogen}} doped <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films treated at 450 and 500  °C were crystallized forming pseudobrookite and landauite phase {{as shown by}} XRD patterns. The presence of urea in the synthesis procedure promoted the crystallization rate. XPS data indicated that iron ions existed in divalent and trivalent forms, and their ratio was changed for nitrogen-doped sample. The formation of the complexes between iron and urea during sol aging with the following reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + within calcination can be a reason not only for accumulation of iron onto the surface as shown by EDS but also for twice increase of divalent iron as registered by XPS. The <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films extended the visible light absorption. Two band gap energy values for all iron-contained films were calculated. The photocatalytic response of all <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films treated at 450  °C compared to pure titania films was spectacularly enhanced under UV and visible light.

30|$|The {{synthesized}} undoped and nitrogen-doped <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> {{films with}} the high ratio of iron to titanium were tested as the potential photocatalysts to remove organic and inorganic contaminations. The photocatalytic response of all <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films treated at 450  °C compared to pure titania films is sharply enhanced for both reactions under UV and visible light. The slight enhance in photocatalytic activity of nitrogen-doped <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films compared to undoped <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> {{can be explained by}} the interstitial nitrogen incorporation. Nevertheless, the structural properties of the films are certainly changed in the presence of this doping agent, and the films contained pseudobrookite as well as landauite can be used for the application in ferroalloy industry and catalytic reaction, for instance chemical looping combustion and methane decomposition. It is suggested that urea addition to the iron titanium contained sol led to the shift of the reaction equilibrium towards Fe 2 TiO 5 and Fe 2 Ti 2 O 7 formation rather than to oxygen substitution by nitrogen. The appearance of the peak attributed to divalent iron was detected for FexTiyOz films as shown by XPS. Twice increase in the relative intensity of Fe 2 + in N/FexTiyOz surface can be interpreted by the formation of the complex compound between urea and iron leading to the saturation of the surface by iron ions (proven by EDS), and the appropriate conditions for iron reduction. It should be stressed that the higher content of divalent iron could be related to the appearance of more XRD peaks belong to landauite phase. The <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films showed high absorption in the visible part of the spectrum and, consequently, the band gap energy values are decreased. The calculated two band gap energy values for all iron contained films are an additional evident of two phase formation. The synthesis procedure proposed herein for <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films can be more potential for practical application in comparison with the traditional sol-gel method due to the fast and the lower cost of synthesis process.|$|E

Recently, we have shown [15] the influence of the calcination temperature (450, 500, and 600  °C) of <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films obtained {{in the same manner as}} the present films on their structural phase transformation. The XRD patters and the calculated d values clearly pointed on the transformation of pseudobrookite to landauite as well as the crystallization degree increase by reaching the calcination to 600  °C. The additional peak(s) was observed at 2 Ɵ near 31.5 for FexTiyOz (500  °C); near 28.2, 32.0, 38.7, 41.8, 58.2, 63.9, 66.5, 74.2, and 75.9 related to Fe 2 Ti 2 O 7 phase [15], and only some peaks belong to pseudobrookite were noted in the case of the <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films treated at 600  °C. Hence, the higher fraction of Fe 2 Ti 2 O 7 phase can be formed using urea pointing on the acceleration of phase transformation taking into account the brookite formation {{in the structure of}} urea-doped titania. The absence of titania crystalline phase (anatase or rutile) in XRD spectra (Fig.  3 b) can be explained by gradual crystallization of every layer at 300  °C leading to the formation of crystallization centers that can cause to the preferential and faster crystallization of iron titanates rather than titania along.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the viability of oxide magnetic semiconductors as potential materials for spintronics. We identified some members of the solid solution series of ilmenite (FeTiO 3) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3), abbreviated as (IH) for simplicity, for our investigations based on their ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties. With this objective in focus we limited our investigations to the following members of the modified Fe-titanates: IH 33 (ilmenitehematite with 33 atomic percent hematite), IH 45 (ilmenite-hematite with 45 atomic percent hematite), Mn-substituted ilmenite (Mn-FeTiO 3), and Mn-substituted pseudobrookite (Mn- Fe 2 TiO 5). All of them are: 1. wide bandgap semiconductors with band gaps ranging in values between 2. 5 to 3. 5 eV; 2. n-type semiconductors; 3. they exhibit well defined magnetic hysteresis loops and 4. their magnetic Curie points are greater than 400 K. Ceramic, film and single crystal samples were studied and based on their properties we produced varistors (also known as voltage dependent resistors) for microelectronic circuit protection from power surges, three-terminal microelectronic devices capable of generating bipolar currents, and an integrated structured device with controlled magnetic switching of spins. Eleven refereed journal papers, three refereed conference papers and three invention disclosures resulted from our investigations. We also presented invited papers in three international conferences and one national conference. Furthermore two students graduated with Ph. D. degrees, three with M. S. degrees and one with B.

In consideration of the probable existence of a redox cycle between Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + species in the NH 3 -SCR reaction, the deoxidation behavior of the FeTiOx catalyst in an H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction process was studied extensively by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) methods. Owing to the presence of an electronic inductive effect between Fe and Ti species in the unique edge-shared Fe 3 +(O) (2) Ti 4 + structure, the reducibility of Fe 3 + species in the FeTiOx catalyst was greatly enhanced compared with that in pristine Fe 2 O 3, leading to the higher oxidation ability of Fe species in FeTiOx. In the H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction process, the well-dispersed Fe 3 + species in <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> crystallites could be totally converted into Fe 2 + in the form of ilmenite FeTiO 3 below 500 degrees C, whereas pristine Fe 2 O 3 could only be reduced to Fe 3 O 4 up to this temperature point. The typical NH 3 -SCR reaction is usually conducted below 500 degrees C, and the enhanced oxidation ability of Fe 3 + species in FeTiOx catalyst is responsible for its excellent catalytic NOx reduction performance at low temperatures. Based on XANES linear fitting and EXAFS curve-fitting results, the specific deoxidation process of the FeTiOx catalyst was proposed, which can provide useful information for the characterization of the microstructure and redox ability of active sites simultaneously in mixed oxide catalysts for certain catalytic reactions...|$|E

These vehicles use batteries that store a significant amount (kWh) of energy and thus will offer the possibilities for second-use in utility related applications such as residential and commercial backup systems and solar and wind generation systems. Cell test data are presented {{for the performance of}} lithium-ion batteries of several chemistries suitable for use in plug-in vehicles. The energy density of cells using NiCo (nickelate) in the positive electrode have the highest energy density being in the range of 100 - 170 Wh/kg. Cells using iron phosphate in the positive have energy density between 80 - 110 Wh/kg and those using lithium titanate oxide in the negative electrode can have energy density between 60 - 70 Wh/kg. Tests were performed for charging rates between 1 C and 6 C. The test results indicate that both <b>iron</b> phosphate and <b>titanate</b> oxide battery chemistries can be fast charged. However, the fast charge capability of the titanate oxide chemistry is superior to that of the iron phosphate chemistry both with respect to temperature rise during charging and the Ah capacity retention for charging up to the maximum voltage without taper. There are a number of possible second-use applications. Some of these applications are closely linked to utility operations and others are connected to commercial and residential end-users. Since the energy storage and power requirements for the end-user applications are comparable to those of the original vehicle applications and would require only minor reconfiguring of the packs, these applications are well suited for second-use. The applications closely related to utility operations do not seem well suited for second-use. Those applications require MW power and MWh of energy storage which are orders of magnitude larger than that of the vehicle applications.

40|$|The strong {{evolution}} of electronics and its rapid performance {{progress in the}} past decades call for ever faster, better scalable, more power efficient and low cost memory technology. The dominating contemporary memory types, {{dynamic random access memory}} (DRAM) and Flash, now approach the physical and technological limits beyond which no further scaling is possible. Hence, there is an urgent need for a successor technology. The redox-based resistive switching random access memory (ReRAM) is a novel memory type which is based on a two terminal device structure. The stored information is represented by the resistance of the device which can be switched between two or more different levels. The resistive switching is controlled by applying an appropriate voltage to the device, defined in amplitude and length. The findings presented up to now show a supreme performance of ReRAM. Excelling in speed, scalability, energy efficiency and endurance, ReRAM is a very promising candidate to replace both DRAM as well as Flash. In this thesis, transient processes of the resistive switching are studied at two extreme speeds: First, a slow electrocoloration of <b>iron</b> doped strontium <b>titanate</b> (Fe:STO) single crystals is investigated by means of high resolution transmission optical microscopy. The experiment makes the electro-chemical changes in the crystal visible and demonstrates the homogeneity of the redox processes at a maximum optical resolution down to 500 nm. As a model process, the electrocoloration is linked to the initial electroforming of a ReRAM cell. Second, resistive switching and kinetics of ReRAM devices are investigated. For the first time a multi-level resistive switching of tantalum oxide (TaOx) devices at sub-nanosecond times is presented and the switching kinetics on an extended time scale over 15 decades is demonstrated, performed on the same device. At the nanosecond range the switching event is determined from the pulse signal transients and the dependency of the switching time on the driving signal magnitude is shown. The ultra-fast performance of the TaOx ReRAM devices reaches the speed of the static random access memory (SRAM) but additionally benefits from the non-volatility. The write speed surpasses the concurrent DRAM and it is more than six orders of magnitude faster when compared to Flash. The presented study includes a design of the high-speed ReRAM device as well as a design and construction of a customized measurement setup. A connecting topic of this thesis is metrology. In regard of ReRAM characterization, correct measurement techniques represent a crucial prerequisite for valid results and a correct interpretation. Demonstrated testing of several commercial measurement instruments shows an incorrect operation, representing principal errors of the measurement and a potential risk for the device under test. The errors are analyzed in depth and subsequently a custom setup, optimized for the ReRAM testing, is presented...|$|R
40|$|The role of crystallographic texture in {{determining}} the fracture behavior of a highly anisotropic ceramic, <b>iron</b> <b>titanate,</b> has been examined. By exploiting the anisotropy in its single crystal magnetic susceptibility, crystallographically textured and untextured <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> microstructures were formed by gelcasting in the presence and absence of a strong magnetic field, respectively. The magnetic field-assisted processing imparted a fiber-like texture to the processed ceramic material in which the crystallographic b-axes of the grains aligned parallel to the applied field. Triaxial residual stress and lattice parameter measurements showed that both the untextured and textured materials had undergone significant stress–relaxation, presumably due to spontaneous microcracking. Further, ‘aggregates’ of non-textured material were discovered within textured material {{that led to a}} population of meso-scale cracks (meso-cracks) in the microstructure oriented normal to the direction of alignment. Both crack populations were examined using a finite element simulation and confirmed by small angle neutron scattering measurements, and for meso-cracks, by X-ray tomography. Bend strength and R-curve behavior were evaluated as a function of texture and orientation in the magnetically processed materials. Strengths remained within 20 % of that of the control material, except for one orientation, for which the strength decreased with increasing degree of texture due to favorably oriented meso-cracks. The R-curve behavior was highly anisotropic, with the peak fracture toughness of the magnetically processed material ranging from approximately equal to 2. 5 times that of the control material. Additionally, the peak fracture toughness of each orientation increased with the degree of texture.

30|$|The {{activity}} of <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> films was estimated using two photocatalytic {{processes of the}} anthropogenic pollutant removal: (i) the tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) originated from extensive development of pharmaceutical industry, and the wide human consumption, its accumulation in the soil and water sources leads to the change in ecological equilibrium of our Earth and (ii) the dichromate ions derived from the chrome-plating and electronic industries. These processes include two different mechanisms where a photogenerated hole {{is involved in the}} TC degradation and a photoformed electron participates in the dichromate reduction. Comparing the conversion efficiency of both processes, the estimation of the photocatalytic properties of the films can be done. Based on the obtained data, it was concluded that the photocatalytic {{activity of}} the films is connected with the adsorption capability of the films that is, in turn, dependent on the annealing temperature.|$|E
40|$|Photocatalytic {{activity}} of TiO 2 was studied in {{two types of}} Calcium Aluminate Cement (CAC) under two different curing regimes. The effect of the TiO 2 addition on the setting time, consistency and mechanical properties of the CACs was evaluated. The abatement of gaseous pollutants (NOx) under UV irradiation was also assessed. These cementitious matrices were found to successfully retain NO 2 : more abundant presence of aluminates in white cement (w-CAC, iron-lean) helped to better adsorb NO 2, thus improving the conversion performance of the catalyst resulting in a larger NOx removal under UV irradiation. As evidenced by XRD, SEM, EDAX and zeta potential analyses, the presence of ferrite in dark cement (d-CAC, iron-reach) induced a certain chemical interaction with TiO 2. The experimental findings suggest the formation of new <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> phases, namely pseudobrookite. The reduced band-gap energy of these compounds {{compared with that of}} TiO 2 accounts for the photocatalytic {{activity of}} these samples...|$|E
40|$|Highly ordered <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> (Fe 2 TiO 5) {{nanotube}} array photoanode is synthesized on F:SnO 2 {{glass with}} ultrathin anodized aluminum oxide as a hard template. Highly crystalline, yet the nanotube array morphology-preserved Fe 2 TiO 5 is fabricated by hybrid microwave annealing (HMA). The {{effects of the}} synthesis parameters on photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting activity under simulated sunlight are systematically studied including HMA time, pore size, wall thickness, and length of the nanotubes to optimize the nanotube array photoanode. In addition, triple modification strategies of TiO 2 underlayer, hydrogen treatment, and FeNiOx cocatalyst loading effectively improve the PEC activity further. The systematically engineered nanotube array photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 0. 93 mA cm(- 2) at 1. 23 V-RHE under 1 sun (100 mW cm(- 2)) irradiation, which corresponds to 2. 6 {{times that of the}} previous best Fe 2 TiO 5 photoanode. In addition, the photocurrent onset potential shifts cathodically by approximate to 280 mV relative to the pristine nanotube array electrode...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{catalytic}} reduction (SCR) of NO with NH 3 over manganese substituted <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> catalysts was fully studied. The low temperature SCR activity was greatly enhanced when partial Fe was substituted by Mn, although the N- 2 selectivity showed some decrease {{to a certain}} extent. The Mn substitution amounts showed obvious influence on the catalyst structure, redox behavior and NH 3 /NOx adsorption ability of the catalysts. Among FeaMn 1 -aTiOx (a = 1, 0. 75, 0. 5, 0. 2, 0) serial catalysts, Fe 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 TiOx with the molar ratio of Fe:Mn = 1 : 1 showed the highest SCR activity, because the interaction of iron, manganese and titanium species in this catalyst led to the largest surface area and the highest porosity, the severest structural distortion and most appropriate structural disorder, the enhanced oxidative ability of manganese species, the highest mobility of lattice oxygen, the proper ratio of Bronsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites together with the enhanced NOx adsorption capacity.

40|$|The {{influence}} of calcination temperature on the microstructure, redox behavior, reactant adsorption capability and catalytic activity of <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> catalyst (FeTiOx) for the {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of NOx with NH 3 was investigated in detail using various characterization methods. After high temperature calcination (above 600 degrees C), the apparent SCR activity of FeTiOx catalyst obviously decreased, which was mainly due to decrease of surface area, pore volume, mobility of lattice oxygen and reactant adsorption capability. However, well crystallized pseudobrookite Fe 2 TiO 5 showed much higher intrinsic SCR activity after normalization by surface area. This is mainly owing {{to the formation of}} larger proportion of monodentate nitrate, which is the real reactive nitrate species in the NOx reduction process, among total nitrate species on the surface of FeTiOx catalysts with higher crystallization degree. This implies a possibility that the FeTiOx catalyst after high temperature calcination (600 or 700 degrees C) with higher thermal stability could be loaded onto porous support with large surface area to further improve its dispersion and thus the apparent SCR activity for practical use, such as the DeNO(x) process for diesel engines.

40|$|The {{application}} of energy absorbing surface layers to Si 3 N 4 and SiC was investigated. Among the layers studied were microcracked {{materials such as}} <b>iron</b> <b>titanate</b> and a silica-zircon mixture and porous materials such as reaction sintered Si 3 N 4. Energy absorption due to microcrack extension upon impact was found not {{to be an important}} mechanism. Instead, the fivefold improvement in Charpy and ballistic impact at elevated temperature (1250 C and 1370 C) found for Fe 2 TiO 5 was due to plastic deformation while similar improvement found for silica-zircon mixtures at RT was due to crushing of the porous material. Due to thermal expansion mismatch, these two materials could not withstand thermal cycling when used as energy absorbing surface layers on Si 3 N 4. Reaction sintered Si 3 N 4 layers on dense Si 3 N 4 were found to give up to a sevenfold increase in ballistic impact resistance due to crushing of the layer upon impact. High porosity (45 %), large particle size R. S. Si 3 N 4 layers fabricated from - 100, + 200 mesh Si powder gave better impact improvement than less porous (30 %), small particle size layers fabricated from - 325 mesh Si powder...|$|E
