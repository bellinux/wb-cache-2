As importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> can induce fatal disorders including obesity and cancer. Using diverse biological tools, the potential molecular mechanisms related with these diseases by exposure of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors.</b> Recently, pathway analysis, a bioinformatics tool, is being widely used to predict the potential mechanism or biological network of certain chemicals. In this review, we initially summarize the major molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of the above mentioned diseases by <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors.</b> Additionally, we provide the potential markers and signaling mechanisms discovered via pathway analysis under exposure to representative <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors,</b> bisphenol, diethylhexylphthalate, and nonylphenol.

40|$|<b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> are {{chemicals}} {{affecting the}} body, disrupting {{the functioning of}} the endocrine system and thus altering the balance of physiological functions in the entire organism. There are countless <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> in the ecosystem, in addition to accumulated substances in the environment, these elements are found in a wide range of products that we encounter on a daily basis. Most often, these materials include various plastics, such as packaging of beverages and foods. According to the presence of these chemicals, <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> can be divided into synthetic and natural. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> are characterised by a long half-live and significant bioaccumulation. These harmful substances enter the organism in various ways, for example through skin and food. Exposure of the organism to endocrine disrupters has a negative effect on its health. In a large quantity, they also affect the reproductive functions. In addition to the effect on reproduction, a negative impact was demonstrated also on other systems, such as nervous. Some <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> have a confirmed carcinogenic effect. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> work primarily through the oestrogen, androgen, progestin or aryl hydrocarbon receptors. Their combinations and metabolites are often more dangerous than the actual substances. The research of the impact of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> on the reproduction of animals proved their negative effect on gonads, production of gametes (spermatocyte and oocyte), fertilisation, implantation, embryonic development, completion of gravidity and birth weight; therefore the changes may occur in the entire reproductive system. Despite numerous studies examining the effect of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> on animal health, there are certain unexplained inconsistencies, which is why it is necessary to continue in the research intensively in the future...|$|R
40|$|<b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> {{and their}} {{possible}} impact {{on human health}} have become a topic of discussion.

25|$|DDT is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptor.</b> It is {{considered}} {{likely to be}} a human carcinogen although the majority of studies suggest it is not directly genotoxic.

25|$|The primary {{building}} block of polycarbonates, bisphenol A (BPA), is an estrogen-like <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptor</b> that may leach into food. Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from {{the lining of}} tin cans, dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals' offspring. A more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance, {{which can lead to}} inflammation and heart disease.|$|E
25|$|BisphenolA is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptor</b> {{that can}} mimic {{estrogen}} {{and has been}} shown to cause negative health effects in animal studies. Bisphenol A closely mimics the structure and function of the hormone estradiol by binding to and activating the same estrogen receptor as the natural hormone. Early developmental stages appear to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects, and some studies have linked prenatal exposure to later physical and neurological difficulties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Backgrounds Previous studies {{suggested}} that <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> (ED) are toxic on preimplantation embryos and inhibit development of embryos in vitro culture. However, {{information about the}} toxicity of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> on preimplantation development of embryo in human reproductive environment is lacking. Methods Bisphenol A (BPA) and Aroclor 1254 (polychlorinated biphenyls) were used as <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> in this study. Mouse 2 -cell embryos were cultured in medium alone or vehicle or co-cultured with human endometrial epithelial layers in increasing ED concentrations. Results At 72 hours the percentage of normal blastocyst were decreased by ED in a dose-dependent manner while the co-culture system significantly enhanced the rate and reduced the toxicity of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> on the embryonic development in vitro. Conclusions In conclusion, although EDs have the toxic effect on embryo development, the co-culture with human endometrial cell reduced the preimplantation embryo from it thereby making human reproductive environment protective to preimplantation embryo from the toxicity of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{undertook}} a fundamental {{investigation of the}} removal of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> from aqueous solution by a sorption method using activated carbons, and compared the removal ability of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> by activated carbons to that by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes. The activated carbons exhibited high removal ability of 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane (DBCP), 100 fold increased adsorption over that with PDMS membranes from aqueous solution of DBCP. The removal ratio of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors,</b> e. g., 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane, dibenzo-p-dioxin, and hexachlorocyclohexane, increased linearly in an aqueous solution with increasing the logarithm of Pow of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors.</b> Almost complete removal of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> (i. e., 85) was observed above log Pow 3. 5 in 25 mL of an aqueous solution using 0. 05 g activated carbon. One aim {{of the present study}} is to use preferential sorption of chemical contaminants onto activated carbons for removal of the chemical contaminants from aqueous solutions including drinking water, beverages, milk, and human milk. When the removal of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> contained in milk or human milk is targeted, water soluble vitamins in the milk, such as vitamin B 2, vitamin B 12, and niacin are expected to be co-currently adsorbed on the activated carbons. Therefore, the present sorption method using activated carbon was applied to the removal of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors,</b> such as di-n-octylphthalate, from the mineral water and 89 of di-n-octylphthalate was removed. 1...|$|R
40|$|In tro duc ti on <b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> (xenohormones) are {{exogenous}} substances or {{compounds that}} cause {{adverse health effects}} in the organism by disrupting the endocrine functions (1, 2, 3). Endocrine disruptions mostly occur {{on the basis of}} genetic predisposition. Natural or synthetic chemical endocrine disrupting substances that we are surrounded with and are exposed to in the modern world lead to clinical disorders by intervening with hormonal physiology (4). At first, <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> were thought to act only via nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogen, androgen, progesterone, thyroid and retinoid receptors. However, recent {{studies have shown that the}} mechanism of action of <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> is not that simple. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> are thought to exert effects on endocrine and reproductive systems through nuclear receptors, non-nuclear steroid hormone receptors (membrane estrogen receptors), non-steroid receptors (neurotransmitter receptors such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine receptors), orphan receptors (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), enzymatic pathways involving steroid biosynthesis and/or metabolism, and numerous other mechanisms (3). <b>Endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> are also known as endocrine modulators, hormone active agents, endocrine active agents, endocrine toxins or xenohormones (5, 6). Molecules defined as <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptors</b> constitute an extremely heterogeneous group and include synthetic chemicals used as industrial solvents/lubricants and their by-products (polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenyls, dioxins), plastics (bisphenol A), plasticisers (phthalates), pesticides [methoxychlor, chlorphyrifos...|$|R

25|$|Endosulfan {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{pesticides}} on the market today, responsible for many fatal pesticide poisoning incidents around the world. Endosulfan is also a xenoestrogen—a synthetic substance that imitates or enhances the effect of estrogens—and it can act as an <b>endocrine</b> <b>disruptor,</b> causing reproductive and developmental damage in both animals and humans. It has also been found to act as an aromatase inhibitor. Whether endosulfan can cause cancer is debated. With regard to consumers' intake of endosulfan from residues on food, the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations has concluded that long-term exposure from food is unlikely to present a public health concern, but short-term exposure can exceed acute reference doses.|$|E
