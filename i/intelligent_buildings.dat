The type clearly represents the excitement, prosperity, and vision of Australia and indicates the economic rationalism and progress in the period. Indicating their status, they were often ceremoniously opened by important dignitaries. In cities nationally and internationally, Modernist architects were unencumbered by traditions when designing this new type, challenging aesthetic and symbolic values, and the provision of public and private amenity. Their impact was unprecedented and it was not until critical analysis of tall buildings in the late 1960s that the approach to highrise development changed. Designed in a time when Australia was little concerned about the ethics of energy consumption, typical highrises exploited this abundance. Orientation and shading was generally dismissed and windows were inoperable, relying on mechanical air-conditioning. Floor plates were vast, relying on artificial light. However, some architects designed <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> that were connected to the traditions of architecture and were better attuned to their environment. Sophisticated in its design, Langer's MRD Building is representative of the better designs in Queensland of the period.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of microprocessor-based technologies and the increasingly sophisticated demands for high performance working environments have prompted {{an increasing number}} of developers to consider adding [`]intelligence' to their new buildings in order to improve the buildings' operational effectiveness and efficiency to enhance marketability. However, the lack of satisfactory consensus for characterizing the system intelligence and structured analytical decision models, inhibit the developers and practitioners to understand and configure optimum <b>intelligent</b> <b>building</b> systems in a fully informed manner. Little research has been conducted towards aiding in decisions and appraisal of the building systems and components in the <b>intelligent</b> <b>building.</b> This paper (Part 1 of a two-part research project) aims to identify the key intelligent indicators, and map the analytical decision models for the system intelligence appraisal of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>building</b> systems. A total of 69 key intelligent indicators were identified for eight major <b>intelligent</b> <b>building</b> systems. The development of system intelligence analytical models will be described in Part 2 of the research. The analytic network process (ANP), a systemic analytical approach, is proposed to prioritize the intelligent indicators and develop the model for computing the system intelligent score (SIS) [...] a measurement of the system intelligence of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>building</b> systems. ANP further enables the decision-makers to take the interdependent relationships between the intelligent attributes and the building's operational goals/benefits into consideration. Their applicability will be also validated and demonstrated using a real <b>intelligent</b> <b>building</b> project as a case study. The main contribution of this research is to promote and enhance understanding of the key intelligent indicators, and to set the foundation for a systemic framework {{that can be used for}} appraising system intelligence of various <b>intelligent</b> <b>building</b> systems.
