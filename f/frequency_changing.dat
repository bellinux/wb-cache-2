50|$|The <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changing</b> Station in Spokane, Washington is a {{building}} {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. It was built by the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad in 1908 to house electrical equipment used by the electric railway. Power was generated at the Nine Mile Falls dam and transmitted to the <b>Frequency</b> <b>Changing</b> Station. The station provided direct current to the streetcar network within the city of Spokane. To provide power to the rail network outside Spokane, the station converted {{a portion of the}} power to alternating current and fed it to a series of electrical substations spaced about 15 mi on the operating line. The substations then converted power back to direct current for the streetcars, but also sold power at 110 volts AC to the communities.|$|E
50|$|A {{radar system}} that can operate on several {{different}} frequencies makes these countermeasures more difficult to implement. For instance, if a jammer is developed to operate against a known <b>frequency,</b> <b>changing</b> that frequency {{in some of the}} in-field sets will render the jammer ineffective against those units. To counter this, the jammer has to listen on both frequencies, and broadcast on the one that particular radar is using.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not long}} before the triode and hexode {{structures}} were placed in the same glass envelope - by no means a new idea. The triode grid was usually internally connected to the hexode grid 3, but this practice was dropped in later designs when the mixer section operated as a straight IF amplifier in AM/FM sets when operating on FM, the mixing being carried out in a dedicated FM <b>frequency</b> <b>changing</b> section.|$|E

50|$|A crystal {{oscillator}} is one {{common type of}} local oscillator that provides good stability and performance at relatively low cost, but its frequency is fixed, so <b>changing</b> <b>frequencies</b> requires <b>changing</b> the crystal. Tuning to different frequencies requires a variable-frequency oscillator {{which leads to a}} compromise between stability and tunability. With the advent of high-speed digital microelectronics, modern systems can use frequency synthesizers to obtain a stable tunable local oscillator, but care must still be taken to maintain adequate noise characteristics in the result.|$|R

50|$|The ring {{oscillator}} is a distributed {{version of the}} delay oscillator. The {{ring oscillator}} uses an odd number of inverters to give {{the effect of a}} single inverting amplifier with a gain of greater than one. Rather than having a single delay element, each inverter contributes to the delay of the signal around the ring of inverters, hence the name ring oscillator. Adding pairs of inverters to the ring increases the total delay and thereby decreases the oscillator <b>frequency.</b> <b>Changing</b> the supply voltage changes the delay through each inverter, with higher voltages typically decreasing the delay and increasing the oscillator frequency. Vratislav describes some methods of frequency-stability and power consumption improving of the CMOS ring-oscillator.|$|E

Routine replacement of intra-venous administration sets has been advocated to prevent infectious complications. Current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are that intravenous administration sets used to administer fluids other than lipid, blood, or blood products should be changed no more frequently than at 72 -hour intervals. 1 However, reducing the <b>frequency</b> of <b>changing</b> intravenous administration sets has important cost implications.

30|$|A new {{approach}} of two-layered iterative DFT is proposed {{to track the}} input frequency in dynamic states. Inner-layered DFT iteration is adopted in every cycle, and frequency estimated in the previous cycle is used as the initial frequency in the following one. And a simple and fast method, exponential sampling is amended {{to adapt to the}} non-steady states. This algorithm is more accurate than the traditional one. New algorithms are compared with the old one with different situations, e.g., input <b>frequencies</b> <b>changing</b> randomly, signal modulated by a cosine signal, and in the presence of decaying DC offsets. New algorithms are tested with different simulation parameters, such as different SNR and maximal numbers of iteration predefined to stop the iteration process.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{investigation of}} the frequency of photoparoxysmal responses (PPR) in the white, mixed and African populations of the Cape Peninsula is presented, based on 9697 consecutive referrals for EEG.

In the present material there were more patients with epilepsy in the mixed than in the white group, the <b>frequencies</b> <b>changing</b> with age in the two groups. Minor interrelationships of PPR exist with sex, age and race considered separately. Another minor relationship could be demonstrated between PPR and epilepsy. Three-factor interaction exists among epilepsy, age and race, and a further three-way interaction could be shown among sex, age and epilepsy. These relations and interactions were all significant below the 1 % level.

40|$|A {{method and}} a {{detailed}} adaptive algorithm for wide-range frequency change measurement is presented. The method {{is based on}} a two-stage operating principle in which the results of a coarse frequency measurement are used for both orthogonal filter adjustment and modifications to the basic algorithm that is applied to fine frequency estimation. The adaptive features ensure good selectivity of the algorithm (in the sense of higher and subharmonic attenuation) within the range 5 to 80 Hz.

By precisely modeling the voicing structure, it can more accurately account for the content in a voiced speech segment. Index Terms: speech analysis, pitch estimation, fundamental frequenc...|$|E
