5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist. For a time <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence {{he was able to}} complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Beach Thomas {{was the son}} of a rural clergyman. He {{attended}} Shrewsbury School and the University of Oxford before {{embarking on}} a short-lived career as a schoolmaster. Finding that work unpleasant, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to writing articles for newspapers and periodicals, and began to write books.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made his}} own electrical-mechanical {{apparatuses}} and tools. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> interests, hobbies and experiments into early entrepreneurial ventures that earned money for him. He became {{at one time or}} another a delivery agent, bill collector, bank clerk, carpenter, chemist, electrician, gas-fitter, mechanic, photographer, plumber, printer, telegrapher, and writer.|$|E
5|$|Their first target, the isle of Saint Vincent, fell on June 18th, and d'Estaing {{turned his}} {{attention}} to other islands.

5|$|After Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant {{captured}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River in February 1862, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> {{sights on}} nearby Fort Donelson on the Cumberland. Western Theater commander Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston sent Buckner {{to be one}} of four brigadier generals defending the fort. In overall command was the influential politician and military novice John B. Floyd; Buckner's peers were Gideon J. Pillow and Bushrod Johnson.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House. Congress formed {{a committee to}} investigate the circumstances that allowed Washington to be captured. Johnson chaired this committee, and delivered its final report. After the sacking of Washington, the tide of battle turned against the British, and the Treaty of Ghent ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. With {{the end of the}} war, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E

5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention {{to the problem of}} Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This {{was the first time that}} Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a reclining figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.|$|E
5|$|Sebille {{commanded}} the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron at {{the outbreak of}} the Korean War, flying F-51 Mustangs in close air support and air strike missions. On August 5, 1950, he attacked a North Korean armored column advancing on United Nations military units. Though his aircraft was heavily damaged and he was wounded during the first pass on the column, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> plane around and deliberately crashed into the convoy at the cost of his life.|$|E

5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, golf {{became a}} varsity sport, and Trueblood was the school's first {{official}} coach. In 1926, Trueblood {{retired as a}} professor emeritus at age 70. At that time, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention full-time to coaching. His coaching record at Michigan was 71-9-2. During his 15 official seasons as golf coach, his teams won two NCAA National Championships (1934-1935) and five Big Ten Conference championships (1932-1936), and were Big Ten runners-up eight times. He coached two NCAA individual champions, John Fischer (1932) and Chuck Kocsis (1936). Trueblood continued as golf coach until he was 80, when athletic director Fielding H. Yost named him emeritus coach.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E

5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The most radical faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince {{the vast majority of the}} population that a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1868, a Progressive cabinet led by Zacarias {{resigned}} {{following a}} political crisis and PedroII asked the Conservatives {{to form a}} new government. As always when a party returned to power, new elections were held, though marked by fraud. The two main wings of the Progressive Party (Progressive, to which Porto Alegre belonged, and Historical) set aside their disputes, became more disciplined in their unity and renamed their party the Liberal Party. When Porto Alegre's term as general deputy ended in 1866, the ongoing war precluded elections in Rio Grande do Sul. Predictably, in the elections organized under the Conservative Party's direction in early 1869, he was not elected. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to organizing a Liberal stronghold in his native province. At the request of the national Liberal Center, Porto Alegre created and became president of the province's Liberal board of directors.|$|E
