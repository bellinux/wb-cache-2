5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns {{and led to the}} extinction of some species, primarily in North America.|$|E
5|$|The French {{operations}} in the area were hampered {{by a lack of}} a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to Malta, but it was <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> The Austrians also possessed several submarines, one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914. The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic. As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area. Together with the pre-dreadnought , the ship covered the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli in January 1916.|$|E

50|$|Malaysia was {{affected}} by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami on 26 December 2004. Despite its proximity to the epicentre of the earthquake, Malaysia escaped the kind of damage that struck countries <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> further <b>away.</b> Since the epicentre was on the western coast of Sumatra, the island largely protected the country from {{the worst of the}} tsunami. The country's worst affected areas were the northern coastal areas and outlying islands like Penang and Langkawi. The simple red flag warning system used by lifeguards on beaches in some resort areas in Penang was credited to reducing the number of fatalities.|$|R

25|$|The war deeply {{affected}} the local population. The Japanese enforced a harsh regime, particularly on Chinese labourers who {{they saw as}} being {{at the bottom of}} the racial hierarchy; forced labour and brutal treatment were commonplace. They decided to deport the majority of Nauru's indigenous population to the Truk islands, <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> where mortality was extremely high. Still overpopulated with troops and imported labourers, the island was subject to food shortages, which worsened as the Allies' island-hopping strategy left Nauru completely cut off.|$|E
25|$|The labeled 18F-FDG {{compound}} has {{a relatively}} short shelf life which {{is dominated by the}} physical decay of 18F with a half-life of 109.8 minutes, or slightly less than 2 hours. Still, this half life is sufficiently long to allow shipping the compound to remote PET scanning facilities, in contrast to other medical radioisotopes like 11C. Due to transport regulations for radioactive compounds, delivery is normally done by specially licensed road transport, but means of transport may also include dedicated small commercial jet services. Transport by air allows to expand the distribution area around a 18F-FDG production site to deliver the compound to PET scanning centres even <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1980, the peacetime USAR {{chain of}} command was {{overlaid}} with a wartime trace. In {{an expansion of the}} roundout and affiliation programs begun ten years earlier, CAPSTONE purported to align every Army Reserve unit with the active and reserve component units with which they were anticipated to deploy. Units maintained lines of communication with the units - often <b>hundreds</b> or thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> in peacetime - who would presumably serve above or below them in the event of mobilization. This communication, in some cases, extended to coordinated annual training opportunities.|$|R
5000|$|Modest {{gains were}} made with the Army Reserve's {{institution}} of the Military Intelligence Special Training Element (MISTE, pronounced [...] "misty") program, in which military intelligence units, including the 140th, were assigned language-qualified, MOS-qualified reserve soldiers (primarily those with prior active duty service) residing <b>hundreds</b> or thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Given the distance to be traveled, the MISTE soldiers would fly in to drill only bi-monthly, usually at Regional Training Site - Intelligence (RTS-I) at Hamilton Army Airfield north of San Francisco, California.

25|$|The play {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in Cambridge on 10 February 1951 {{although}} Christie was absent as she was in Iraq accompanying her husband Max Mallowan {{on one of his}} archaeological expeditions. She arranged for flowers to be sent to the female members of the cast. <b>Hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> she was as nervous as ever at the public reaction although she was reassured by telegrams which told her that the opening night was a success. Even so, Saunders and director Hubert Gregg had to make some amendments to take out some of the unintentional comic moments that had occurred on the first night.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 20th century, Tallahassee {{remained}} a sleepy government and college town, where politicians would meet to discuss spending money on grand public improvement projects to accommodate growth {{in places such as}} Miami and Tampa, <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from the capital. By 1901, the infrastructure development continued to trend growth to the south, first by the Plant System Railroads to the fledgling port of Tampa and then the Flagler railroad to the remote outpost of Miami. However, Tallahassee was firmly entrenched as capital and in that year the 1845 capitol building was expanded with two new wings, and a small dome.|$|E
25|$|These {{cetaceans}} {{are highly}} sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain {{between two and}} 25 individuals, {{with an average of}} 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from that pod. These pods contain animals of both sexes, and are led by a dominant male. Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the pods join together in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the Minitor's {{operating}} distance depends on the strength ("wattage") of the paging transmitter. A repeater {{is often used to}} improve paging coverage, as it can be located for better range than the dispatch center where the page originates from. Weather conditions, low battery, and even atmospheric conditions can affect the Minitor's ability to receive transmissions. In fact, a remote transmitter <b>hundreds,</b> even thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> belonging to a separate agency, can activate a Minitor (and also block it) unknowingly if the atmospheric conditions let the signal propagate that far. This is commonly known as radio skip.|$|R

50|$|Financial {{troubles}} only worsened in Emperor Shun's reign, as {{many public}} works projects were handled {{at the local level}} without the central government's assistance. Yet his court still managed to supervise the major efforts of disaster relief, aided in part by a new invention in 132 CE of a seismometer by the court astronomer Zhang Heng (78-139 CE) who used a complex system of a vibration-sensitive swinging pendulum, mechanical gears, and falling metal balls to determine the direction <b>of</b> earthquakes <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> kilometers (<b>miles)</b> <b>away.</b> Shun's greatest patronage of scholarship was repairing the now dilapidated Imperial University in 131 CE, which still operated as a pathway for young gentrymen to enter civil service. Officials protested against the enfeoffment of eunuch Sun Cheng and his associates as marquesses, with further protest in 135 CE when Shun allowed the sons of eunuchs to inherit their fiefs, yet the larger concern was over the rising power of the Liang faction.|$|R

500|$|The {{eruption}} {{was heard}} <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> {{but some of}} those who survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the United States Forest Service, recalled, [...] "There was no sound to it, not a sound. It was like a silent movie and we were all in it." [...] The reason for this discrepancy is a [...] "quiet zone", created {{as a result of the}} motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.|$|E
500|$|Following the Mexican War of Independence, Texas {{became part}} of Mexico. [...] Under the Constitution of 1824, which defined {{the country as a}} federal republic, the provinces of Texas and Coahuila were {{combined}} to become the state Coahuila y Tejas.

5000|$|Chapter one of States and Social Revolutions, {{entitled}} [...] "Explaining Social Revolutions: Alternatives to Existing Theories", starts {{by explaining}} {{not just the}} rarity of social revolutions, but also their momentous occurrences {{in the history of}} the world. These revolutions change the lives of every citizen of the country; they completely alter the organization of the state, including their class structures, as well as the prominent beliefs and theories held by the people. The rise of the new regimes in these countries completely exceeds the previous, prerevolutionary establishments. In France, the revolution allowed for the country to become an omnipresent, conquering force in Europe, the Russian Revolution created an unstoppable military and industrial superpower, and the Chinese Revolution was finally able to unify and transform a previously broken China. Such revolutions not only alter the state of the nation in question, but also impact the world as a whole, for a number of these countries (especially France, Russia, and China) have gone on to become Great Powers. Once they gained such a status, these countries were seen as examples of what needs to and should happen in nations even <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Revolutionized countries gave others the hope that perhaps one day, if they fought for it, they could also possess a strong military, a solid economy, and rights that every human being deserves. It is without a doubt that other factors can lead to social and political change, however, social revolutions deserve special attention for their specific pattern of sociopolitical change.|$|R

50|$|Sunshine (Yang-Guang or Yangguang, 阳光) UAV is a {{fixed-wing}} UAV {{in conventional}} layout developed by GAIC and has entered service with Chinese authorities mainly for remote sensing. There are several features that distinguish Sunshine {{from the rest}} of Chinese UAVs; Sunshine adopts a low wing configuration and a retractable tricycle landing gear system. Sunshine is also equipped with a satellite dish communication antenna housed in the bulge in the fuselage, where the cockpit of manned aircraft would be located, so that information such as data and images can be passed down to a command and control center <b>hundreds</b> or thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> in near real time. Sunshine is powered by a three-blade propeller driven by a tractor engine moutnted in the nose, as opposed to most Chinese UAVs that are equipped with a two-blade propeller driven by an engine.|$|R
