5000|$|<b>De</b> <b>minimis</b> is a Latin {{expression}} meaning [...] "about minimal things", {{normally in}} the locutions <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> non curat praetor ("The praetor does not concern himself with trifles") or <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> non curat lex ("The {{law does not}} concern itself with trifles") a legal doctrine by which a court refuses to consider trifling matters.

50|$|Courts will {{occasionally}} not uphold {{a copyright}} on modified public domain material if {{the changes are}} deemed to be <b>de</b> <b>minimis.</b> Similarly, courts have dismissed copyright infringement cases {{on the grounds that}} the alleged infringer's use of the copyrighted work (such as sampling) was so insignificant as to be <b>de</b> <b>minimis.</b> However, in Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, such a ruling was overturned on appeal, the US appeals court explicitly declining to recognize a <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> standard for digital sampling.|$|R

40|$|<b>De</b> <b>minimis</b> cutoffs are a {{familiar}} feature of risk regulation. This includes the quantitative "individual risk" thresholds for fatality risks employed in many contexts by EPA, FDA, and other agencies, {{such as the}} 1 -in- 1 million lifetime cancer risk cutoff; extreme event cutoffs for addressing natural hazards, such as the 100 -year-flood or 475 -year-earthquake; <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> failure probabilities for built structures; the exclusion of low-probability causal models; and other policymaking criteria. All these tests have a common structure, as I show in the Article. A <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> test, broadly defined, tells the decisionmaker {{to determine whether the}} probability of some outcome is above a low threshold and makes this determination relevant, in some way, to her choice. <b>De</b> <b>minimis</b> cutoffs are deeply problematic, and have been generally misunderstood by scholars. First, they are warranted [...] if at all [...] by virtue of policymakers' bounded rationality. If policymakers were fully rational, <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> cutoffs would have no justification. Second, although it seems plausible that some <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> tests are justified once bounded rationality is brought into the picture, it is not clear which those are, or even how we should go about identifying them.

50|$|Under U.S. tax rules, the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> rule {{governs the}} {{treatment}} of small amounts of market discount. Under the rule, if a bond is purchased {{with a small amount}} of market discount (an amount less than 0.25% of the face value of a bond times the number of complete years between the bond's acquisition date and its maturity date) the market discount is considered to be zero. If the market discount is less than the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> amount, the discount on the bond is generally treated as a capital gain upon disposition or redemption rather than as ordinary income. Under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> rule can also apply to any benefit, property, or service provided to an employee that has so little value that reporting for it would be unreasonable or administratively impracticable; for example, use of a company photocopier to copy personal documents - see <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> fringe benefit.

50|$|Specifically in U.S. State income tax, <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> {{refers to}} {{the point at which}} withholdings should be {{initiated}} for a nonresident working in a state which taxes personal income. Not all U.S. states levy income taxes, and there's little consistency among nonresident <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> standards for those that do. Some states base <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> on the number of days worked (although the definition of what counts as a workday has been controversial), others on the dollars earned or a percentage of total income derived from work in the state, still others using a combination of methods. These inconsistencies have led to repeated attempts to pass the so-called Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act without success.|$|R

The <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> rules make a significant difference for future allowed support. Under the U. S. proposal the Overall commitment constrains neither the USA nor the EU. Under the EU and especially the G- 20 proposals the Overall commitment constrains distorting support {{to be less than}} the sum of the cap on blue and the Maximum Usable Components (MUC). The MUC is smaller than the sum of the commitment on Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (TAMS) and all <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> allowances.

The <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> regime {{is one of the}} instruments of finance regulations of finance from public budgets, in relations to enterprises in the Czech Republic. As it is an instrument of so-called state aid with considerable selective features, is it a subject of thorough regulations by the European Union. These regulations thus directly affect legal systems of member countries of the EU. The aim of the master thesis is to describe how the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> regime affects the opportunities of Czech theatres to receive financial support from public budgets and to find out how the legal acts of the European Union affect the financial situation of these theatres. The thesis also deals with the problem as seen {{from the point of view}} of providers of these financial supports so that it could be possible to reflect the issue as a whole. The theoretical background of the thesis is formed by the relevant legal acts, issued by the European Commission and by the commentaries made about them. An inseparable part of this work is also grant calls of individual grant providers in the Czech Republic. The practical part of the master thesis is then based on thorough research of all Czech theatres with regards to their relations to <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> issues. The master thesis also works with data provided by the Czech Register of the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> regime...|$|R

25|$|Due to redefined and reinterpreted {{copyright}} laws, {{and increased}} financial interests, {{some forms of}} collage art are significantly restricted. For example, {{in the area of}} sound collage (such as hip hop music), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> doctrine as a defense to copyright infringement, thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on fair use or <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> protections, and toward licensing.

5000|$|As amended, IFRS 9 {{had four}} {{possible}} classification categories for financial assets, including a FVOCI classification for debt instruments. [...] The classification {{is dependent on}} two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) and a business model assessment. [...] Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reporting in profit and loss (FVPL). [...] In {{order to meet the}} contractual cash flow test, the cash flows from the instrument must consist of only principal and interest. [...] Among the amendments to classification and measurement made in the 2014 update, <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> and [...] "non-genuine" [...] features can be disregarded from the test, meaning that a <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> feature would not preclude an instrument from being reported at amortized cost or FVOCI.

40|$|Society has yet {{to agree}} on the most {{critical}} step in risk management: identifying risk goals and translating them into regulations. say Daniel Byrd and Lester B. Lave. As a result, decisions about what to regulate have been inconsistent and sometimes arbitrary. How should society set priorities among the many actual and potential hazards? To avoid squandering limited resources, the authors say. regulators should focus on the significant risks and ignore the trivial, or <b>de</b> <b>minimis,</b> ones. Byrd and Lave propose that regulatory agencies adopt the concepts of significant and <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> risks to guide their decision making. This approach would narrow the regulatory agenda. they say: instead of agonizing over each new situation, agencies would have clear guidance on a major portion of them. But there are several obstacles. First, the science of risk quantification is still uncertain. Second. there is no consensus on what constitutes a significant or a <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> risk. And third. {{it is not clear how}} to handle the plethora of risks that fall in the middle. While resolution of these questions will not be easy, the authors believe that it would be a major step toward making risk management more efficient and predictable. In this article they attempt to define the concepts of significant and <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> risks and then suggest how these concepts can be used in regulatory decisionmaking...|$|R
