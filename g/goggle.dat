5|$|Stela 32 is a {{fragmented}} monument {{with a foreign}} Teotihuacan-style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god Tlaloc, including his <b>goggle</b> eyes and tasselled headdress.|$|E
5|$|A {{text from}} Tikal {{mentions}} K'uk' Mo' {{and has been}} dated to AD406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely {{to refer to the}} same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On AltarQ he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with <b>goggle</b> eyes and a war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.|$|E
50|$|Goggles: <b>Goggles</b> keep {{water and}} {{chlorine}} out of swimmers' eyes. <b>Goggles</b> may be tinted to counteract glare at outdoor pools. Prescription <b>goggles</b> {{may be used}} by swimmers who wear corrective lenses.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1911, {{the company}} {{produces}} and sells optical lenses, sunglasses, <b>goggles,</b> {{as well as}} safety glasses. The sports eyewear brand Swans includes sunglasses, ski and snowboard <b>goggles,</b> swimming <b>goggles,</b> as well as helmets.|$|R
50|$|Laser {{protection}} eyewear are glasses or <b>goggles</b> used {{to protect}} eyes from damage from visible and invisible wavelengths of laser light. They can be similar to <b>goggles</b> or be lenses incorporated into other pieces of protective eyewear. Intrabeam viewing of lasers usually requires protective <b>goggles</b> even with a low power laser. Laser protection <b>goggles</b> work {{on the basis that}} laser light is one frequency, making it easy to filter out. Laser <b>goggles</b> are subject to degradation and damage like any other kind of eyewear.|$|R
25|$|The AN/PSQ-20, {{manufactured}} by ITT (also {{known as the}} Enhanced Night Vision <b>Goggle,</b> ENVG), seeks to combine thermal imaging with image intensification, as does the Northrop Grumman Fused Multispectral Weapon Sight.|$|E
25|$|The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force {{ordered a}} utility {{variant of the}} UH-60L {{designated}} UH-60JA in 1995. The JGSDF began receiving the UH-60JA in 1997. It features improved avionics, including FLIR, Color weather radar, GPS receiver, a Night Vision <b>Goggle</b> compatible cockpit and wire cutter. The JGSDF plans to acquire 70.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} was reactivated in 2005 as the 535th Airlift Squadron at Hickam Air Force Base {{to provide}} strategic and tactical airlift in the Pacific. It {{became the first}} unit located outside the Continental United States to fly the C-17 conducting strategic and tactical airlift. It conducts night vision <b>goggle,</b> low-level, air refueling and austere-airfield operations from within the world's largest area of responsibility. The squadron has provided support for and operated in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn. Additionally, the squadron has provided emergency humanitarian relief to Haiti, Pakistan, Samoa, Kwajalein, Indonesia and Japan.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{tendency}} to fog of various <b>goggles</b> dusiqned to protect the eyes from the cold. FINDINGS There were large differences in the visibility of the low contrast target through the various <b>goggles,</b> although these differences declined a 3 the target contrast increased. Those <b>goggles</b> advertised to be resistant to fogging performed well. APPLICATION Resistance to fogging {{must be one of}} the characteristics taken into consideration when specifying the optimal characteristics for <b>goggles</b> to be supplied to Marines operating in the cold. These results will be useful in setting optimal specifications for military <b>goggles...</b>|$|R

50|$|Dark adaptor <b>goggles,</b> {{also called}} red {{adaptation}} <b>goggles,</b> {{are used in}} the field of meteorology and astronomy for adapting the eyes to the dark prior to an observation at night. They also aid with the identification of clouds during bright sunshine or glare from snow. The <b>goggles</b> are made with red-tinted plastic lenses. Such <b>goggles</b> or glasses are often used by pilots and weather observers to preserve their natural night vision.|$|R
500|$|These weapons {{included}} the HK416 assault rifle {{used as the}} SEALs main weapon, Mark. 48 machine guns used for fire support, and the MP7 personal defense weapon used by some SEALs for close quarters and greater silence. Sidearms were also used, such as the SIG P226 and the HK45C. Other gear worn or carried by the operators included a variety of plate carriers, Ops Core FAST Maritime ballistic helmets, chemlights, hand grenades, breaching tools, and night-vision goggles. The particular night vision device used by the SEALs, the GPNVG-18, was unlike any standard night vision <b>goggle</b> offered to servicemen, and featured four-tubes for a much better field of view.|$|E
500|$|In January 1958, at age nine, she {{obtained}} her Actors Equity Card in {{the name}} Bernadette Peters to avoid ethnic stereotyping, with the stage name taken from her father's first name. She made her professional stage debut the same month in This is <b>Goggle,</b> a comedy directed by Otto Preminger that closed during out-of-town tryouts before reaching New York. She then appeared on NBC television as Anna Stieman in A Boy Called Ciske, a Kraft Mystery Theatre production, in May 1958, and in a vignette entitled [...] "Miracle in the Orphanage", part of [...] "The Christmas Tree", a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, in December 1958 with fellow child actor Richard Thomas and veteran actors Jessica Tandy and Margaret Hamilton. She first appeared on the New York stage at age 10 as Tessie in the New York City Center revival of The Most Happy Fella (1959).

500|$|The Task Force began {{night flight}} {{training}} using night vision goggles (NVG) to develop nighttime extraction capabilities; however, {{they were doing}} so with AN/PVS-5 NVGs which were originally developed for ground forces. Never before had anyone in the U.S. Department of Defense flown in NVGs and the Task Force quickly adapted the NVGs for flying and by Brown's own words [...] "a warrant officer figured out we could cut them apart and mount them to our helmets and increase our efficiency and safety by a huge margin. So there we were, without authority, cutting up goggles and building our own NVGs." [...] Their nighttime training took place at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. As {{a result of the}} night vision <b>goggle</b> training Brown asserted in a 2011 interview that [...] "most of today's NVG tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as Black Hawk and Chinook modifications came directly from that mission." [...] Ultimately Operation Credible Sport did not come to fruition due to a peaceful resolution to the crisis where the hostages were released as a result of long negotiations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goggles!</b> is a 1969 children's {{picture book}} by American author and {{illustrator}} Ezra Jack Keats {{published by the}} Penguin Group in 1998.

25|$|Snow <b>goggles</b> (niguak ~ niiguak dual or nigaugek dual nigauget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, igguag in Cup'ig) is old-style snow <b>goggles</b> {{made out}} of wood with narrow slits, which admit only a little light. Snow <b>goggles</b> were carved from {{driftwood}} (esp. spruce), walrus ivory, bone or caribou antler, and sometimes made with coarse seashore grass. They always paint the inside of <b>goggles</b> black, so our eyes won’t be bothered by the glare and can stay wide open. <b>goggles</b> were created in various styles by artists from different regions, and they often resembled animals underscoring a pervasive Native theme of human-animal transformation. Some snow <b>goggles</b> are carved {{in the form of}} an animal mask. Arctic foxes have keen eyesight for hunting on the land and sea ice, a quality that the mask/goggles may have been intended to transfer to the person wearing them. The <b>goggles</b> with narrow slits not only protect the eyes from excess light, but also sharpen and focus vision, like a pinhole camera. Some <b>goggles</b> have large eye openings and are blackened with soot inside to eliminate reflections. Snow <b>goggles</b> are an ancient element of Eskimo hunting cultures, appearing in archaeological sites up to 2000 years old.|$|R

2500|$|In 1998, Stirling Moss {{became the}} only driver to have been given his own {{distinctive}} helmeted design, differing from Bamber's standard full face helmet style, incorporating his overalls, helmet and <b>goggle</b> that he had worn during his professional career, with which he has become associated. His cartoon incorporates a Damon Hill fan being asked a question by an ITV F1 correspondent, [...] "Who's the greatest driver"; he is threatened at gunpoint from behind by a Michael Schumacher caricature, who in turn is threatened at gunpoint from behind by Moss, who says, [...] "Moss - pass it on!". Bamber claimed the cartoon was not as funny with only Schumacher; as such, he drew in Moss, {{and found that it}} increased the humor of the cartoon.|$|E
2500|$|Spending {{four years}} in {{development}} and eventually building a dedicated manufacturing plant in China, Nintendo worked to turn its VR32 vision into an affordable and health-conscious console design. Yokoi retained RTI's choice of red LED {{because it was the}} cheapest, and because unlike a totally backlit LCD, its [...] perfect blackness could achieve a more immersive sense of infinite depth. RTI and Nintendo said a color LCD system would have been prohibitively expensive, retailing for more than [...] A color LCD system was also said to have caused [...] "jumpy images in tests". With ongoing concerns about motion sickness, the risk of developing lazy eye conditions in young children, and Japan's new Product Liability Act of 1995, Nintendo eliminated the head tracking functionality and converted its headmounted <b>goggle</b> design into a stationary, heavy, precision steel-shielded, tabletop form factor conformant to the recommendation of the Schepens Eye Research Institute.|$|E

Homer desperately asks the <b>goggles</b> to find a gift for Marge under five dollars. Homer then asks the <b>goggles</b> to take him back in time to two minutes ago. In the morning, Marge flips pancakes in anger. When Homer decides to give up the <b>goggles,</b> he places the <b>goggles</b> on the lazy Susan before it lands on Maggie. Marge grabs the <b>goggles</b> and puts them on to which Maggie spits her pacifier at her in defiance.|$|R
50|$|The Inuit and Yupik people carved Inuit snow <b>goggles</b> from caribou antler, wood, {{and shell}} {{to help prevent}} snow blindness. The <b>goggles</b> were curved to fit the user's face and had a large groove cut in the back {{to allow for the}} nose. A long thin slit was cut through the <b>goggles</b> to allow in a small amount of light, {{diminishing}} subsequent ultraviolet rays. The <b>goggles</b> were held to the head by a cord made of caribou sinew.|$|R

2500|$|Within the year, ABS-CBN also {{beefed up}} its news {{programmes}} with TV Patrol, anchored {{by a team}} of newsreaders composed of now former Vice-President Noli de Castro, Mel Tiangco, Frankie Evangelista, and Angelique Lazo, with the late Ernie Baron telling the daily weather forecast. Other reputable news programmes followed, such as Magandang Gabi, Bayan and Hoy Gising!. [...] The entertainment programmes of ABS-CBN were also revamped with series that previously aired on RPN 9 and IBC 13: (Eat Bulaga!, Okey Ka Fairy Ko!, The Sharon Cuneta Show, Coney Reyes on Camera) while producing original content (The Maricel Soriano Drama Special, Palibhasa Lalake, Home Along Da Riles). [...] Another feature of its return {{to the top of the}} ratings is the introduction of the live-action sentai and tokusatsu show formats from Japan (with Bioman, <b>Goggle</b> V Gavan and Shaider, the latter the first ever tokusatsu program to be aired in English and Filipino) to Philippine television full-time (after a brief appearance on RPN). Filipino-dubbed anime programmes, another network and Philippine television first, would only begin in the transition to the 1990s, and 1987's Hikari Sentai Maskman, aired by the network, was first ever sentai program to dub in Filipino.|$|E

50|$|The first {{competitive}} swimmer to use <b>goggles</b> was Thomas William Burgess, {{during his}} {{crossing of the}} English Channel in 1911. His motorcycle <b>goggles</b> leaked water, yet they protected his eyes from water splashes during his breaststroke-only swim. In 1926, Gertrude Ederle also used motorcycle <b>goggles</b> when crossing the Channel. She swam crawl and therefore sealed her <b>goggles</b> with paraffin to render them water tight. Meanwhile, {{the vast majority of}} pool swimmers had no eye protection until the late 1960s, which limited their training time due to the eye irritation with disinfectants added to the pool water. When the first commercial <b>goggles</b> were introduced to competitive swimmers in 1968 they were met with limited success because of their fixed and rigid shape. Most swimmers could not fit them to their face and complained about leaks, especially after starts and turns. Only two years later David Wilkie became the first swimmer to use <b>goggles</b> in international pool competitions, at the 1970 Commonwealth Games. <b>Goggles</b> were first allowed at the Olympics in 1976, and many athletes used them in preparation for the 1972 Games.|$|R

50|$|<b>Goggles,</b> or safety glasses, are {{forms of}} {{protective}} eyewear that usually enclose or protect the area surrounding the eye {{in order to}} prevent particulates, water or chemicals from striking the eyes. They are used in chemistry laboratories and in woodworking. They are often used in snow sports as well, and in swimming. <b>Goggles</b> are often worn when using power tools such as drills or chainsaws to prevent flying particles from damaging the eyes. Many types of <b>goggles</b> are available as prescription <b>goggles</b> for those with vision problems.|$|R
50|$|The Toon <b>Goggles</b> {{application}} is developed by Toon <b>Goggles</b> Inc., a start-up based in Los Angeles, CA. In 2011, a demo website (www.toongoggles.com) {{was created to}} take to MIPCOM to show animation companies the exposure they could receive by placing their cartoons on the Toon <b>Goggles</b> service. The mobile application was created soon after. In 2012, the platform secured one of its first partnerships with Panasonic {{to appear on the}} VIERA Connect television. Toon <b>Goggles</b> has been pre-installed and promoted on a variety of devices for sale.|$|R
