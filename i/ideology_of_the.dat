5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E

5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha {{with a plan to}} infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E

However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs.

5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Epitome de Caesaribus offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E
5|$|The film reignited {{the debate}} over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of {{creating}} a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of U.S. foreign policy, the military industrial complex, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel has been disputed.|$|E
5|$|The {{picture of}} Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself {{on the brink of}} invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedMost {{narratives}} {{created by}} the temperance movement in the mid-to-late Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries focused on <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drunkard as violent social outcast. Ostensibly <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperance narrative was to reform drunkards and to prevent <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> future drunkards. However, many temperance narratives were less concerned with the drunkard than with propagating an ideology that juxtaposed teleological narratives about alcohol with American identities. With <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> national Prohibition, {{it was easy to}} assume that <b>the</b> <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperance movement had emerged triumphant, but in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> World War I and with <b>the</b> advent <b>of</b> American Modernism, a suspicion of all things Victorian arose. Modern suspicion encouraged a closer look at <b>the</b> <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> temperance, especially <b>the</b> movement's juxtaposition <b>of</b> narrative, alcohol, and identity.; This dissertation will explore <b>the</b> <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperance movement as they were expressed through a selection of temperance narratives, including Luther Benson’s Fifteen Years in Hell, Dave Ranney’s eponymous Dave Ranney, or Thirty Years on the Bowery, Walt Whitman’s Franklin Evans, T.

F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, Wallace Thurman’s Infants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spring, and Charles Henri Ford and Parker Tyler’s The Young and The Evil form the core for this exploration of Prohibition-era responses, providing a model for future readings of Prohibition-era texts. As Prohibition came to a close and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperance movement waned, these Prohibition-era texts problematized the form and assumptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperance narrative, changing Americans’ relationships with alcohol and freeing alcohol from the teleological ideologies that the temperance movement had sought to ensure...|$|R

5|$|Monastic reform {{inspired}} {{change in}} the secular Church. The ideals that it was based upon {{were brought to the}} papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage {{in the creation of a}} papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Vajpayee's {{moderate}} strategy {{led to a}} shift in the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign {{for the construction of a}} temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a dispute about whether a temple once stood there. The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh.|$|E

5|$|The film {{rights to}} the novel were {{licensed}} in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein's death. The project was originally entitled Bug Hunt at Outpost 9, and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to Starship Troopers. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who found the book too boring to read, and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to gender. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, in order to undermine the political <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel. The mechanized suits that featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.|$|E
5|$|While the Progress Party {{dropped out}} of {{parliament}} altogether in 1977, it returned in the following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives. In this election, the political right in general had a great upturn, which garnered the Progress Party increased support. The <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared {{that it was a}} libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization of medical care, education and government-owned enterprises, as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with some power as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.|$|E
5|$|The current 500 {{members of}} the National Assembly were elected during the 2011 {{parliamentary}} election, {{and they have a}} five-year term. Despite foreign criticism, it is generally believed that the National Assembly has become more powerful in recent years. The last election was held, according to the authorities, in a democratic, fair, lawful and safe manner and was considered a success. Voter turnout was 99.51 percent; nearly 62 million people voted. In their respective constituencies, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary, was elected to the National Assembly with 85.63 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was elected with 95.38 percent and President Trương Tấn Sang was elected with 80.19 percent. Outside the ruling troika, it was Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, the Chairman of the Government Office, who was elected with the highest margin, with 94.59 percent of the votes. The number of self-nominated candidates was four times higher than the previous election. Fifteen out of the 182 candidates nominated by the central government and the central party leadership were defeated in the elections. Lê Thị Thu Ba, a member of the Party's Central Committee and Chairman of the Committee of Law during the 12th National Assembly (2007–2011), was not re-elected to the National Assembly.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} whether <b>the</b> governing <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poor Law Act (Ireland) 1834 {{were physically}} manifested in Wilkinson's workhouse.

This research, through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> archaeology and historical records, investigated whether the struggles around the Poor Law were reflected in the workhouse building. There were several struggles. The Poor Law Commissioners struggled against the guardians, the guardians struggled to implement the Law and the workhouse inmates struggled against the system.
