40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{deals with}} the {{theoretical}} investigation of edge magnetoplasmons {{in an array of}} two-dimensional <b>gas</b> <b>strips,</b> consisting of a finite number of strips, arranged at an equal distance from each other and placed into an external magnetic field. Two types of arrays of two-dimensional <b>gas</b> <b>strips</b> are under consideration: an ordered array of two-dimensional <b>gas</b> <b>strips</b> with equal electron concentrations in all strips and a weakly disordered array of two-dimensional <b>gas</b> <b>strips,</b> which is characterized {{by the fact that the}} electron concentration of one defect strip differs from that of other strips. It is shown, that the edge magnetoplasmon spectrum contains an infinite number of modes, which differ from each other by the distribution of the electromagnetic field applied across the strips. The anomalous dispersion of the edge magnetoplasmons of higher modes in a long-wavelength region is predicted. The existence of edge magnetoplasmon local modes of each kind, properties of which differ from properties of other modes of edge magnetoplasmons, is shown for the case of the weakly disordered array of two-dimensional electron <b>gas</b> <b>strips.</b> In the case where the defect strip is arranged inside the array of strips, the existence of edge magnetoplasmo...|$|R
40|$|In {{the deep}} narrow band {{image of the}} Coma Cluster taken with Suprime-Cam of the Subaru telescope, we found an {{extremely}} long and narrow (~ 60 kpc x 2 kpc) Halpha emitting region associated with a poststarburst galaxy (D 100). Follow up spectroscopy shows that the region has the same redshift as D 100. The surface brightness of the region is typically 25 mag(AB) arcsec^- 2 in Halpha, which corresponds to 0. 5 [...] 4 x 10 ^- 17 erg s^- 1 cm^- 2 arcsec^- 2.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{continuously}} regenerating absorbent recovering solvent from an effluent air stream, {{in which the}} solvent-containing absorbent is supplied to a desorber, and contacted by <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> to remove the solvent. The solvent-saturated <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> {{is fed to a}} vapour permeation module forming solvent-enriched permeate and a retentate stream with solvent-depleted <b>stripping</b> <b>gas,</b> the latter being re-supplied to the desorption unit via a closed circuit. In the permeate stream from the permeation module, a reduced pressure source follows and is transferred, via the vapour permeation module, into the feed stream. A condensation stage occurs in the permeate stream followed by a portion of solvent-depleted <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> being locked-out. The remaining solvent-depleted <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> is introduced into the retentate stream. Preferably the locked out fraction of solvent-depleted <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> from the condensation stage is supplied to the solvent-saturated effluent air stream, or is dispo sed of via an adsorption unit. A separator, partly in fluid form, follows the source of low pressure leading back to an intermediate condensate vessel. The gas stream leaving this stage is sent to the stripping gas-stream and saturated with solvent before entering the vapour permeation module. The gas stream leaving the condensate stage is at least partially sent to the retentate stream after the vapour permeation module. The vapour permeation module has a membrane exhibiting a selectivity between solvent and <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> not more than 10; preferably exceeding 30. <b>Stripping</b> <b>gas</b> is heated before or in the desorption unit and before arriving at the vapour permeation module, is cooled. The <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> being steam, air or inert gas. USE - To regenerate a solvent absorbent. ADVANTAGE - The process regenerates continuously and efficiently, increasing the absorption and/or the achievable throughput for given recovery. The quantity of <b>stripping</b> <b>gas</b> needing to be sent to the condensing unit is reduced, with reduced process cost implications. Emissions are minimised and recycling of process materials are maximised...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the Fe {{abundance}} in the intra cluster medium (ICM) provides strong constraints on the integrated star formation history and supernova rate of the cluster galaxies, {{as well as on}} the ICM enrichment mechanisms. In this Letter, using chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphological types, we study the evolution of the Fe content of clusters of galaxies. We assume that the ICM Fe enrichment occurs by means of galactic winds arising from elliptical galaxies and from <b>gas</b> <b>stripped</b> from the progenitors of S 0 galaxies via external mechanisms, due to the interaction of the inter stellar medium with the ICM. The Fe-rich gas ejected by ellipticals accounts for the X_Fe,ICM values observed at z > 0. 5, whereas the <b>gas</b> <b>stripped</b> from the progenitors of the S 0 galaxies accounts for the increase of X_Fe,ICM observed at z< 0. 5. We tested two different scenarios for Type Ia supernova (SN) progenitors and we model the Type Ia SN rate observed in clusters, finding a good agreement between our predictions and the available observations.

30|$|Ezeji [3] used <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> for in situ {{separation}} {{because it}} is a simple technique that is free of emulsion formation and it does not require a membrane or expensive chemicals. The production of ABE using <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> in the fermentation of 500  g/L of sugar using the strain C. beijerinckii BA 101 was 232.8  g/L compared to a control batch reactor, where 17.6  g/L ABE was produced. Moreover, <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> was more selective in removing butanol than acetone and ethanol [38]. <b>Gas</b> <b>stripping</b> is more efficient when butanol concentration in the fermentation broth is higher than 8  g/L [49]. According to Ezeji et al. [40], the production of ABE increased from 18.6  g/L to 81.3  g/L, whereas sugar consumption increased about 487 % (compared with the control of the same substrate without <b>gas</b> <b>stripping)</b> using <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> in the fermentation of liquefied corn starch with C. beijerinckii BA 101.|$|E

40|$|Henry’s law {{constants}} (KH) {{for seven}} {{polybrominated diphenyl ether}} (PBDE) congeners and nine polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were determined using three variations of the <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> method. A modified <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> and an integrated <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> method were compared with the standard <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> method to identify the most accurate approach for PCB and PBDE KH determination between 5 °C and 35 °C. All three methods were equivalent for PCB measurements while the modified <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> method was more appropriate for PBDEs at or below 25 °C and the integrated <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> method was preferred for temperatures above 25 °C. Mass balance was achieved for the first time, providing a quantitative account of buffering effects and verifying the lack of degradation of the analytes during the experiment. Furthermore, the mass balance approach provided {{a deeper understanding of}} the quality of results and of the behaviour of individual compounds that cannot be achieved otherwise. The measured Henry’s Law constants for PBDE ranged from 0. 18 ± 0. 34 Pa·m 3 ·mol- 1 (5 °C) for 2, 4, 4 ’-tribromodiphenyl ether to 29 ± 5. 7 Pa·m 3 ·mol- 1 (35 °C) for 4 -bromodiphenyl ether. For PCBs, Henry’s law constants ranged between 0. 60 ± 0. 45 Pa·m 3 ·mol- 1 (5 °C) for 2, 4, 4 ’-trichlorobiphenyl to 123 ± 12 Pa·m 3 ·mol- 1 (35 °C) for 2, 2 ’, 4, 4 ’, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl. KH values were generally higher for the PCBs since they were more readily volatilized from water into the air than the corresponding PBDE congeners. Although PCB KH values were not correlated to the degree of chlorine substitution, PCB KH values increased with ortho-chlorine substitution. In contrast, PBDE KH values decreased with the increasing bromine substitution and ortho-bromine substitution. The enthalpies of phase change (ΔHH) for PBDEs varied from – 2. 3 kJ mol- 1 for 2, 2 ’, 4, 4 ’, 6 -pentabromodiphenyl ether to 105 kJ mol- 1 for 2, 4, 4 ’-tribromodiphenyl ether. For PCBs, ΔHH values varied from – 53 kJ·mol- 1 for 2, 2 ’, 4, 4 ’-tetrachlorobiphenyl to 114 kJ·mol- 1 for 2, 3 ’, 4, 4 ’, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanism of}} tidal dwarf galaxies means {{they are expected}} to contain little or no dark matter. As such, they might be expected to be very sensitive to their environment. We investigate the impact of ram pressure on tidal dwarf galaxies in a parameter study, varying dwarf galaxy properties and ram pressures. We submit model tidal dwarf galaxies to wind-tunnel style tests using a toy ram pressure model. The effects of ram pressure are found to be substantial, resulting in stellar losses. If tidal dwarf galaxies have their <b>gas</b> <b>stripped,</b> they may be completely destroyed. Ram pressure drag causes acceleration of our dwarf galaxy models, and this further enhances stellar losses. The dragging can also cause stars to lie in a low surface brightness stellar stream that points in the opposite direction to the <b>stripped</b> <b>gas,</b> in a manner distinctive from tidal streams.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that nonlinear perturbations which lead to thermal instabilities in cooling flows might start as blobs of interstellar gas which are stipped out of cluster galaxies.

It is possible that {{a substantial portion of the}} cooling gas originates as blobs of interstellar <b>gas</b> <b>stripped</b> from galaxies. The magnetic fields within and outside of the low-entropy perturbations may help to maintain their identities by suppressing both thermal conduction and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

40|$|Background: Bioethanol {{production}} from biomass {{is becoming a}} hot topic internationally. Traditional static solid state fermentation (TS-SSF) for bioethanol production {{is similar to the}} traditional method of intermittent operation. The main problems of its large-scale intensive production are the low efficiency of mass and heat transfer and the high ethanol inhibition effect. In order to achieve continuous production and high conversion efficiency, <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> solid state fermentation (GS-SSF) for bioethanol {{production from}} sweet sorghum stalk (SSS) was systematically investigated in the present study. Results: TS-SSF and GS-SSF were conducted and evaluated based on different SSS particle thicknesses under identical conditions. The ethanol yield reached 22. 7 g/ 100 g dry SSS during GS-SSF, which was obviously higher than that during TS-SSF. The optimal initial <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> time, <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> temperature, fermentation time, and particle thickness of GS-SSF were 10 h, 35 C, 28 h, and 0. 15 cm, respectively, and the corresponding ethanol stripping efficiency was 77. 5 %. The ethanol yield apparently increased by 30 % with the particle thickness decreasing from 0. 4 cm to 0. 05 cm during GS-SSF. Meanwhile, the ethanol yield increased by 6 % to 10 % during GS-SSF compared with that during TS-SSF under the same particle thickness. The results revealed that <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> removed the ethanol inhibition effect and improved the mass and heat transfer efficiency, and hence strongly enhanced the solid state fermentation (SSF) performance of SSS. GS-SSF also eliminated the need for separate reactors and further simplified the bioethanol production process from SSS. As a result, a continuous conversion process of SSS and online separation of bioethanol were achieved by GS-SSF. Conclusions: SSF coupled with <b>gas</b> <b>stripping</b> meet the requirements of high yield and efficient industrial bioethanol production. It should be a novel bioconversion process for bioethanol production from SSS biomass. Background: Bioethanol production from biomass is becoming a hot topic internationally.
