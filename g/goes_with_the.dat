In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is an {{archaeologist}} who discovers star charts in caves {{around the world}} with his lover, Elizabeth Shaw. After awakening from cryosleep near LV-223, he introduces the purpose of the mission with Shaw. While the Prometheus flies over the moon, Holloway spots an artificial arrangement of structures and directs the ship to land near one. He <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first expedition crew to the concealed Juggernaut, discovers that the air is clearer than anywhere on Earth and removes his helmet. After Shaw retrieves a preserved Engineer head, the expedition is informed of an incoming storm and Holloway {{and the rest of the}} crew return to the Prometheus. Disappointed by the Engineers' apparent extinction, he sulks and berates Shaw for still being a Christian. David brings Holloway a drink, and they discuss the merits of creating beings; he tainted the drink with a minute organism from a cylinder he brought from he structure, infecting Holloway. Holloway has sex with Shaw shortly afterwards, impregnating her with an alien embryo. After seeing a small, extraterrestrial parasite in his eye, Holloway returns to the Engineer ship and becomes ill. As the expedition returns, Holloway worsens; the infection becomes obvious, and Vickers obeys his request to kill him with a flamethrower outside the ship.|$|E

500|$|A {{person does}} not need to be a member of a clan society to be able to wear a crest badge. Any clan member has a right to it, not just clan {{societies}} and clan society members. According to the Court of the Lord Lyon clan membership <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surname. [...] Although, today many people who do not bear a clan surname do wear crest badges of their mother's clan, and anyone who offers their allegiance to a clan chief is a member of a clan (unless the chief decides to refuse that person's allegiance). Many people bear names that, while not actual clan surnames, are sept names or associated names of certain clans. Surnames such as Smith, Wright, Fletcher, and Miller are examples as such names that are associated names of many clans (as every clan would have its own smiths, wrights, fletchers and millers). It is up to the individual to explore their personal ancestry and discovery the correct clan that they belong to.|$|E

500|$|Balthier and his companion, Fran, {{prefer to}} remain outside {{the war between}} the kingdoms of Ivalice. However, their attempt to steal the Goddess's Magicite—later {{revealed}} to be the Dusk Shard—from the Dalmascan Royal Palace goes bad; Vaan steals it first, and, caught in the fray of a rebel assault against the Imperial Palace, Balthier and Fran find themselves embroiled in the conflict against Archadia. Born as , he {{is the son of}} Dr. Cid (Cidolfus Demen Bunansa), though he grew weary of his father's madness and obsession with nethicite. Although Cid had made him an Imperial Judge, Ffamran eventually decided to cut his ties with his father and his role as a judge, becoming a sky pirate under a new name. With this new career change, Balthier amounted a sizable bounty on his head, attracting the attention of bounty hunters such as Ba'Gamnan. Unfortunately for Balthier, it took him a while to realize he'd been following his father in pursuing nethicite while he served in the resistance. Though he makes peace with his father prior to his death, Balthier <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for his father's deeds. Balthier claims to be the [...] "leading man" [...] of the story many times throughout the game, and insists that this status makes him invincible. Though never blatantly said a romantic relationship between Fran and Balthier is heavily suggested. During the final fight on the Sky Fortress Bahamut, Fran is badly injured and Balthier refuses to abandon her. While cradling her in his arms the ship crashes with them inside. They remain out of contact until they retrieve the Strahl back from Vaan and Penelo a year later, leaving a note for the new Queen Ashe which held her wedding ring that she used to purchase his services.|$|E
