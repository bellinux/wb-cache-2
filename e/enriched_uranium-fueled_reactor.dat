40|$|Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 {{was very}} {{successful}} in terms of Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) project completions. This photobriefing book highlights these projects and activities in one ongoing project. Brief descriptions of projects planned for the future are also provided. Two D&D projects funded by the US DOE Office of Environmental Management (EM- 40) were completed safely and on schedule in FY 1998 : (1) Argonne Thermal Source Reactor (ATSR) was a low-power research reactor that operated from 1950 to 1989; and (2) The Building 594 (a. k. a. 579) Waste Ion-Exchange Facility was an obsolete facility constructed in the 1950 s to process waste fluids from a collecting lagoon. Field work at one project was ongoing during FY 1998 : (1) Chicago Pile 5 (CP- 5) was a 5 -megawatt, heavy water-moderated, <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium-fueled</b> <b>reactor</b> used to produce neutrons for scientific research from 1954 - 79. The reactor was shut down and defueled in 1979. D&D {{is scheduled to be}} completed in FY 2000. Project experience has lent itself to developing unique staff capabilities. The D&D group was chosen as lead organization for a project supported with operating funds provided by Argonne's Plant Facilities and Services (PFS) Division. This project was also completed safely and on schedule in FY 1998 : (1) The Building 200 / 205 Pneumatic Transfer Tube was constructed in the late 1960 s between Hot Cell M- 4 in Building 200 and a glove box in Room F- 131, Building 205, and used to transfer irradiated fuel specimens and other samples between the two buildings...|$|E
40|$|The Chicago Pile 5 (CP- 5) Reactor, {{the first}} reactor {{built on the}} Argonne National Laboratory-East site, {{followed}} a rich history that had begun in 1942 with Enrico Fermi's original pile built under the west stands at the Stagg Field Stadium of The University of Chicago. CP- 5 was a 5 -megawatt, heavy water-moderated, <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium-fueled</b> <b>reactor</b> used to produce neutrons for scientific research from 1954 [...] 79. The reactor was shut down and defueled in 1979, and placed into a lay-up condition pending funding for decontamination and decommissioning (D and D). In 1990, work was initiated on the D and D of the facility in order to alleviate safety and environmental concerns associated with the site due to {{the deterioration of the}} building and its associated support systems. A decision was made in early Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 to direct focus and resources to the completion of the CP- 5 Reactor D and D Project. An award of contract was made in December 1998 to Duke Engineering and Services (Marlborough, MA), and a D and D crew was on site in March 1999 to begin work, The project is scheduled to be completed in July 2000. The Laboratory has determined that the building housing the CP- 5 facility is surplus to the Laboratory's needs and will be a candidate for demolition. In addition to a photographic chronology of FY 1999 activities at the CP- 5 Reactor D and D Project, brief descriptions of other FY 1999 activities and of projects planned for the future are provided in this photobriefing book...|$|E
40|$|A major {{milestone}} {{was reached}} in Fiscal Year (FY) 2000 [...] {{the completion of}} the Chicago Pile- 5 (CP- 5) D and D Project. CP- 5, the first reactor built on the Argonne National Laboratory-East (ANL-E) site, was a 5 -megawatt, heavy water-moderated, <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium-fueled</b> <b>reactor.</b> It was the principal reactor on the Argonne site used to produce neutrons for scientific research from 1954 to 1979. The reactor was shut down and defueled in 1979, and placed in a lay-up condition. In 1990, funding was provided to begin the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) of this facility, and work began in June 1991. D and D tasks were performed by both ANL-E personnel and subcontractor personnel from Duke Engineering and Services, Marlborough MA, under the management of ANL-E D and D Program personnel. In July 2000, the final project report was presented to the Department of Energy, and the facility was formally decommissioned and transferred to the landlord. Total project duration was 97 months, and total project cost was $ 29. 5 M. Also, in FY 2000, work began on the 60 Cyclotron D and D Project. An accelerator used for basic research, this facility produced beams of deuterons, helium ions, singly charged hydrogen molecules, and neutrons of a broad energy spectrum. This machine was built in 1952; operations ended in 1992. Late in FY 1999, MOTA Corporation, Columbia SC, was selected as subcontractor. MOTA used a custom-built 76 -inch reciprocating saw manufactured by Reverse Engineering, Columbia SC, to cut the cyclotron's 220 -ton steel yoke into blocks that were approximately 17, 000 pounds each. This project is scheduled to be completed in March 2001.

40|$|The Chicago Pile 5 (CP- 5) Research Reactor Facility is {{currently}} undergoing decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Illinois site. CP- 5 was the principle nuclear reactor {{used to produce}} neutrons for scientific research at Argonne from 1954 to 1979. The CP- 5 reactor was a heavy-water cooled and moderated, <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium-fueled</b> <b>reactor</b> with a graphite reflector. The CP- 5 D&D project includes the disassembly, segmentation and removal of all the radioactive components, equipment and structures associated with the CP- 5 facility. The Department of Energy's Robotics Technology Development Program and the Federal Energy Technology Center, Morgantown Office provided teleoperated, remote systems {{for use in the}} dismantlement of the CP- 5 reactor assembly for tasks requiring remote dismantlement as part of the EM- 50 Large-Scale Demonstration Program (LSDP). The teleoperated systems provided were the Dual Arm Work Platform (DAWP), the Rosie Mobile Teleoperated Robot Work System (ROSIE), and a remotely-operated crane control system with installed swing-reduction control system. Another remotely operated apparatus, a Brokk BM 250, was loaned to ANL by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). This machine is not teleoperated and {{was not part of the}} LSDP, but deserves some mention in this discussion. The DAWP is a robotic dismantlement system that includes a pair of Schilling Robotic Systems Titan III hydraulic manipulator arms mounted to a specially designed support platform: a hydraulic power unit (HPU) and a remote operator console. The DAWP is designed to be crane-suspended for remote positioning. ROSIE, developed by RedZone Robotics, Inc. is a mobile, electro-hydraulic, omnidirectional platform with a heavy-duty telescoping boom mounted to the platform's deck. The work system includes the mobile platform (locomotor), a power distribution unit (PDU) and a remote operator console. ROSIE moves about the reactor building floor around the reactor assembly and, like the DAWP, is controlled from a console in the control room. The remotely-operated crane control system with installed swing-reduction control system was installed on the CP- 5 polar crane and allows a load suspended from the crane to be remotely operated while reducing the induced swing in the load, The system includes a remote-controlled rotational hook, two remote-reading load cells and a lightweight portable operator controller. The last component in this discussion, the Brokk BM 250, is a commercially-available electro-hydraulically operated demolition tool. A variety of attachments including a 750 lb. jackhammer, hydraulic shear or 1 / 3 cubic yard bucket can be quickly installed onto its articulated boom. This paper will primarily discuss the teleoperated robotics systems, DAWP and Rosie, their performance, tooling and lessons learned during the dismantlement of the CP- 5 reactor structures. Other aspects of the robotics systems' deployment and use such as operator training and maintenance will be briefly discussed as they pertain to the overall performance of the robots...|$|E

5000|$|In 1973, {{however, the}} US {{government}} settled on uranium technology and largely discontinued thorium-related nuclear research.

5000|$|Fast {{reactors}} technically {{solve the}} [...] "fuel shortage" [...] argument against <b>uranium-fueled</b> <b>reactors</b> without assuming unexplored reserves, or extraction from dilute {{sources such as}} ordinary granite or the ocean. They permit nuclear fuels to be bred from almost all the actinides, including known, abundant sources of depleted uranium and thorium, and light water reactor wastes. On average, more neutrons per fission are produced from fissions caused by fast neutrons than from those caused by thermal neutrons. This results in a larger surplus of neutrons beyond those required to sustain the chain reaction. These neutrons {{can be used to}} produce extra fuel, or to transmute long half-life waste to less troublesome isotopes, such as was done at the Phénix reactor in Marcoule in France, or some can be used for each purpose. Though conventional thermal reactors also produce excess neutrons, fast reactors can produce enough of them to breed more fuel than they consume. Such designs are known as fast breeder reactors.|$|R

40|$|The CP- 5 reactor was a heavy-water moderated and cooled, highly-enriched <b>uranium-fueled</b> thermal <b>reactor</b> {{designed}} for supplying neutrons for research. The reactor was operated almost continuously for 25 years until its final shutdown in 1979. It is situated on approximately three {{acres in the}} southwestern section of Argonne National Laboratory. In 1980, all nuclear fuel and the heavy water that could be drained from the process systems were shipped off-site, and the CP- 5 facility was placed into lay-up pending funding for decommissioning. It was maintained in the lay-up condition {{with a minimum of}} maintenance until 1990, when the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) project began. This D and D project provides for the disassembly and removal of all radioactive components, equipment, and structures that are associated with the CP- 5 facility. The experimental area around the CP- 5 reactor has been prepared for D and D, and the area outside the facility has been remediated. The reactor primary coolant and support systems have been removed and packaged as waste. The significant remaining tasks are (1) removal of the reactor internals and the biological shield structure; (2) decontamination of the rod storage area; (3) decontamination of the various radioactive material storage and handling facilities, including the fuel pool; and (4) decontamination and dismantlement of the building.

40|$|This {{engineering}} study evaluates different {{alternatives for}} decontamination and decommissioning of the Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR). Cooled and moderated with pressurized heavy water, this <b>uranium-fueled</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> {{was designed to}} test fuel assemblies for heavy water power reactors. It was operated for this purpose from march of 1962 until December of 1964. Four alternatives studied in detail include: (1) dismantlement, in which all radioactive and hazardous contaminants would be removed, the containment dome dismantled and the property restored to a condition similar to its original preconstruction state; (2) partial dismantlement and interim safe storage, where radioactive equipment except for the reactor vessel and steam generators would be removed, along with hazardous materials, and the building sealed with remote monitoring equipment in place to permit limited inspections at five-year intervals; (3) conversion for beneficial reuse, in which most radioactive equipment and hazardous materials would be removed and the containment building converted to another use such as a storage facility for radioactive materials, and (4) entombment, which involves removing hazardous materials, filling the below-ground structure with concrete, removing the containment dome and pouring a concrete cap on the tomb. Also considered was safe storage, but this approach, which has, in effect, been followed for the past 30 years, did not warrant detailed evaluation. The four other alternatives were evaluate, taking into account factors such as potential effects on the environment, risks, effectiveness, ease of implementation and cost. The preferred alternative {{was determined to be}} dismantlement. This approach is recommended because it ranks highest in the comparative analysis, would serve as the best prototype for the site reactor decommissioning program and would be most compatible with site property reuse plans for the future...|$|R
40|$|Reactors {{utilizing}} a highly energetic neutron spectrum, often termed fast reactors, offer large fuel utilization improvements over the thermal reactors currently used for nuclear energy generation. Conventional fast reactor deployment has been hindered by the perceived {{need to use}} plutonium as fuel, coupling the commercial introduction of fast reactors to the deployment of large-scale thermal reactor used fuel reprocessing. However, the future of used fuel treatment in the United States is highly uncertain, creating a bottleneck for the introduction of fast reactor technology. A strategy centered around using <b>uranium-fueled</b> fast <b>reactor</b> cores in a once-through mode-a uranium startup fast reactor (USFR) -decouples fast reactor commercialization from fuel reprocessing and enables transition to a recycle mode once the technology becomes available and economic. The present work investigates the optimal strategy for recycling spent fuel from once-through sodium cooled fast reactors (SFRs), by analyzing the performance of various designs. A range of acceptable transitions are described and their economic, breeding, nonproliferation, and safety performance are characterized. A key finding is that the burnups of all cores were limited by the allowable fluence to the cladding {{rather than by the}} core reactivity. The carbide cores achieve fluence-limited burnups 15 - 25 % greater than the comparable metal cores, though the metal cores can be optimized via decrementing the fuel volume fraction to reach fluence-limited burnups within 10 % of the carbide cores. The removal of minor actinides from the recycled fuel has a minimal impact on the achievable burnups of both types of fuels, decreasing the fluence-limited burnup by less than half a percent in all cases. Similarly, long-term storage of the USFR fuel had minimal impact on the achievable burnups of all cores, decreasing the fluencelimited burnup by no more than 2 % in all cases. Levelized fuel costs were in the range of 5. 98 mills/kWh to 7. 27 mills/kWh for the carbide cores, and 6. 81 mills/kWh to 7. 57 mills/kWh for the optimized metal cores, which is competitive with fuel costs of current LWRs and once-through SFRs. The metal and carbide multicore cores, made using slightly more than one once-through SFR core, functioned as slight fissile burners with fissile inventory ratios (FIRs) near 0. 9. The uranium+ cores, made using one oncethrough SFR core plus natural uranium makeup, functioned in a fissile self-sustaining mode with FIRs near unity. All cores discharged fuel that was less attractive for weapon use than that of an LWR. The carbide cores had maximum sodium void worths in the range of $ 2. 81 -$ 2. 86, approximately half the worth of the metal cores, which were in the range of $ 4. 97 -$ 5. 14. Carbide and metal multicore cores possessed initial reactivities in the range of 15, 000 pcm, requiring either multi-batch staggered reloading or control system modifications to achieve acceptable shutdown margins. The uranium+ carbide and metal cores achieved acceptable shutdown margin with the nominal control configuration and the single-batch reloading scheme. The overall conclusion is that USFR spent fuel is readily usable for recycle. by Joshua Richard. Thesis (S. M.)

2500|$|Less {{long-lived}} waste. LFTRs can dramatically {{reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of their reactor wastes. Light water reactors with uranium fuel have fuel {{that is more}} than 95% U-238. These reactors normally transmute part of the U-238 to Pu-239, a long-lived isotope. Almost all of the fuel is therefore only one step away from becoming a transuranic long-lived element. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years, and is the most common transuranic in spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. Transuranics like Pu-239 cause the perception that reactor wastes are an eternal problem. In contrast, the LFTR uses the thorium fuel cycle, which transmutes thorium to U-233. Because thorium is a lighter element, more neutron captures are required to produce the transuranic elements. U-233 has two chances to fission in a LFTR. First as U-233 (90% will fission) and then the remaining 10% has another chance as it transmutes to U-235 (80% will fission). The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely transuranic element, is therefore only 2%, about 15kg perGWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor neutronics and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as reprocessing losses, goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional once-through <b>uranium-fueled</b> light water <b>reactor.</b> The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the radiotoxicity of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|R
