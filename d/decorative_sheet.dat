50|$|Sheet iron can {{be subject}} to rapid corrosion, forming rust. Sheet iron was used {{throughout}} the 19th century, {{although it is not}} clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became. Pressed <b>decorative</b> <b>sheet</b> iron used for ceilings was frequently called a “tin ceiling,” although tin was generally not used indoors.|$|E
5000|$|The water flame (extra=lit. [...] "water smoke"), {{consisting}} of four <b>decorative</b> <b>sheets</b> of metal set at 90° {{to each other}} and installed {{over the top of the}} main pillar of a pagoda.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} architectural uses of tin {{fall into}} two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as copper to form bronze, and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term “tin ceiling” is a misnomer, as these <b>decorative</b> <b>sheets</b> were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel.|$|R
40|$|A model solvent {{technique}} for the recycling of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) <b>decorative</b> <b>sheets</b> is studied. The process comprises {{dissolution of the}} sheets in toluene, reprecipitation by n-hexane, washing and drying. Moreover, the toluene-hexane mixtures involved are separated by distillation for further reuse. Within our experimental conditions, the polymer was totally recovered {{in the form of}} grains with the solvents yields also being very satisfactory. The recycled grades proved to resemble closely the virgin material. (C) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was thought}} that such an {{approach}} would lead to producing large panels, usable for example as wall decor in a hotel lobby or corporate office. In a further development, the researchers used very thin copper sheets {{in place of the}} <b>decorative</b> <b>sheet</b> (still overlaying that with the melamine-impregnated top sheet). The overall effect was like a large metal medallion, or a copper sculpture. Many impressive samples emerged from the research lab. The product simulating natural slate proved to be a very popular product and was a leading seller for many years.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{variant of}} the product was also developed, known as Deep-Textured Formica Surfacing. Use of the cellulosic paste allowed using a deeply textured, or even sculptured, metal press sheet atop the <b>decorative</b> <b>sheet,</b> producing a formed surface. The researchers overlaid the stainless steel sheets with furnace cement, a material easily sculptured or textured, and able to withstand the high heat during curing. They would carve into this cement an illustration, such as natural slate in negative form. When the furnace cement hardened, and the sheet was used in a press pack, the final Unified Core product would have a raised or three-dimensional image.|$|E

2500|$|Atop the {{foundational}} layer of iron were placed <b>decorative</b> <b>sheets</b> of tinned bronze. These sheets, divided into five figural or zoomorphic designs, were manufactured by the pressblech process. Preformed dies {{similar to the}} Torslunda plates (...) were covered with thin metal which, through applied force, took up the design underneath; identical designs could thus be [...] "mass-produced" [...] from the same die, allowing for their repeated use on the helmet and other objects. Fluted strips of white alloyed moulding—possibly of tin and copper, and possibly swaged—divided the designs into framed panels, held to the helmet by bronze rivets. The two strips running {{from front to back}} alongside the crest were gilded. The edges of the helmet were further protected by U-shaped brass tubing, fastened by swaged bronze clips and themselves further holding in place the pressblech panels that shared edges with the helmet.|$|R

50|$|Built to an L-shaped {{plan the}} outer faces {{of which are}} {{oriented}} {{to the north and}} east, Fassifern Homestead has a bungalow-style hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. The southern projection of the L ends in a half-hip centred beneath which is a small gabled porch with timber framing, later lattice infill, and timber stairs. Two brick chimneystacks (one of which is a double chimney) pierce the roof ridge running parallel with the north-facing wing of the house. Four <b>decorative</b> <b>sheet</b> metal roof ventilators straddle the two roof ridges, two along each line. They consist of two cylinders surmounted by an overhanging low-pitched cone with a highly decorative edge and capping piece. Timber-framed, with exterior walls clad variously with two widths of chamferboard and weatherboards, the house is raised off the gently sloping ground on ant-capped timber stumps. The spaces between the perimeter stumps have been in-filled with painted, slatted timber screens.|$|E
50|$|Decorative {{laminates}} {{were made}} by impregnating large sheets of kraft paper with phenolic resin, which was then partially cured (B-staged by passing through a long drying oven) and cut to sheet lengths at the oven exit. The dry treated sheets were stiff and somewhat brittle. A <b>decorative</b> <b>sheet</b> (solid colored, or wood-grained, or patterned), impregnated with melamine resin and B-staged and cut to length {{in a similar manner}} to the phenolic core sheets, was laid on a polished stainless steel press plate. Then several plies or layers of kraft paper impregnated with a phenolic resin were placed on top of the decorative layer. The number of plies of kraft used yielded products of varying thickness depending upon end-use requirements. Next, a sheet of release paper that would not bond to the phenolic resin was placed on top of the phenolic kraft and following this a mirror image build-up of the assembly already on the press plate. Finally, another polished stainless steel press plate was placed on top of the pack assembly. On {{the other side of this}} plate another similar assembly was built until there were several laminates in one press pack to go into a single opening in the hydraulic press. The huge hydraulic presses, perhaps 5 feet by 12 feet, had many heated openings thus many laminates could be produced in a single press cycle of about one hour duration. Great pressure (in excess of 1000 psi and heat to 150 degrees Celsius) were applied to each press pack. The B-staged melamine and phenolic resins first flowed to bond the interlaminar plies together, then the plastic resins thermoset to provide a very durable product that could tolerate much heat and abrasion.|$|E
5000|$|Victoria Hall is {{a former}} -storey {{commercial}} building in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Overlooking Gore Park, it is located in downtown Hamilton's central commercial district. For many years, the building (alongside the MacKay Building) was jointly known as the [...] "Foster Building" [...] due to its most recent use as a high-end clothing store. Some people still refer to Victoria Hall by this nickname today. It is a superior and rare example of a commercial building with a <b>decorative</b> architectonic <b>sheet</b> metal facade, which is completely hand-made.

40|$|Multilayered {{samples of}} {{contemporary}} and improved fire resistant aircraft seat materials (foam cushion, <b>decorative</b> fabric, slip <b>sheet,</b> fire blocking layer, and cushion reinforcement layer) were evaluated for their rates of heat release and smoke generation. Top layers (<b>decorative</b> fabric, slip <b>sheet,</b> fire blocking, and cushion reinforcement) with glass fiber block cushion were evaluated {{to determine which}} materials based on their minimum contributions to the total heat release of the multilayered assembly may be added or deleted. Top layers exhibiting desirable burning profiles were combined with foam cushion materials. The smoke and heat release rates of multilayered seat materials were then measured at heat fluxes of 1. 5 and 3. 5 W/sq cm. Choices of contact and silicone adhesives for bonding multilayered assemblies were based on flammability, burn and smoke generation, animal toxicity tests, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Abrasion tests were conducted on the decorative fabric covering and slip sheet to ascertain service life and compatibility of layers...|$|R

2500|$|When {{creating}} new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound {{in many different}} materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are leather, decorative paper, and cloth (see also: buckram). Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of particularly high-quality materials (especially full leather bindings), are known as fine or extra bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book {{that has already been}} printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. [...] "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, <b>decorative</b> end <b>sheets,</b> leather cover etc." ...|$|R
