Enforcement {{is one of the most}} challenging aspects of <b>export</b> <b>control,</b> even in the so-called developed countries. It is legitimate to seek models which can be exported to help building capacity in countries where they don’t exist yet, but it requires three conditions at least: good models must exist, they must be suitable to the local context and they must be transferable (i. e. the elements of the model can be built or provided via assistance programs). We will see that these conditions are difficult to fulfil when it comes to <b>export</b> <b>control</b> enforcement in a context like Western Africa. However, talking about <b>export</b> <b>control</b> enforcement models may be looking at it from the wrong angle. As often, taking a broader perspective and thinking out of the <b>export</b> <b>control</b> and non-proliferation box may help. <b>Export</b> <b>control</b> enforcement is not only about <b>export</b> <b>control,</b> it is also about enforcement.
