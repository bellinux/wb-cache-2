5|$|The Egyptian {{identification}} card controversy {{began in the}} 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity <b>documents,</b> which introduced a de facto requirement that <b>documents</b> must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government).

Without <b>documents,</b> {{they could not be}} employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification <b>documents</b> that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Surveys of {{the basic}} {{concepts}} and underlying techniques are presented in this paper. A basic model for <b>document</b> processing is described. In this model, <b>document</b> processing {{can be divided into}} two phases: <b>document</b> analysis and <b>document</b> understanding. A <b>document</b> has two structures: geometric (layout) structure and logical structure. Extraction of the geometric structure from a <b>document</b> refers to <b>document</b> analysis; mapping the geometric structure into logical structure deals with <b>document</b> understanding. Both types of <b>document</b> structures and the two areas of <b>document</b> processing are discussed. Two categories of methods have been used in <b>document</b> analysis, namely, (1) hierarchical methods including top-down and bottom-up approaches, (2) no-hierarchical methods including modified fractal signature. Tree transform, formatting knowledge and description language approaches have been used in <b>document</b> understanding. A particular case of form <b>document</b> processing is discussed. Form description and form registration approaches are presented. A form processing system is also introduced. Finally, many techniques, uch as skew detection, Hough transform, Gabor filters, projection, crossing counts, form definition language, etc. which have been used in these appro-aches are discussed.
