40|$|Abstract — Recent {{advances}} {{have shown that}} all digital phase locked loops have several desirable advantages over its analog counterpart. One important element in the all digital phase locked loop is the <b>digital</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator whose frequency resolution restricts the frequency resolution of the entire system. In this {{paper we propose a}} new structure for <b>digital</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillators utilizing the capacitance’s sensitivity dependence on position of the shorted transmission line to increase the frequency resolution. A 9 GHz transmission line based <b>digital</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator was fabricated as a proof of concept. Measured results show that more than 100 times frequency step resolution increase is possible utilizing the same tuning capacitor size located at different points in the transmission line. I...|$|R

25|$|The Spectronic 20 was {{replaced}} by the Spectronic 200 in the Thermo Scientific spectrophotometer product line in 2011. The Spectronic 200 utilizes an array detector and <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> of the measured wavelength, while retaining the characteristic λ knob of the Spec 20 for setting the wavelength. In addition to replicating the user modes of the Spec 20D+ (which it can emulate on a color LCD screen) the Spec 200 accommodates both test-tubes and square cuvettes without needing to install an adapter. Software modes described in the Spectronic 200's specifications include scanning, four wavelength simultaneous measurement, and quantitative analysis with up to four standards, in contrast to the SPEC 20D+ which offered only single point calibration.|$|E
25|$|N scale {{locomotives}} are {{powered by}} DC motors which accept {{a maximum of}} 12 V DC. In traditional DC control, {{the speed of the}} train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by surface mount technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> systems used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix.|$|E
40|$|The thesis has {{evaluated}} {{the suitability of}} <b>Digital</b> Deadbeat <b>Control</b> of the Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation-Voltage Source Converter (SPWM-VSC) for electric power utility applications. The <b>Digital</b> Deadbeat <b>Controlled</b> SPWM-VSC operates as a current controller where short circuit faults are not destructive. In addition, it eliminates the L-R mode at the ac terminals of the SPWM-VSC. The thesis considers methods to immunize the control from system and parameter uncertainties. A novel closed-loop <b>Digital</b> Deadbeat <b>Control</b> has been proposed. A Phase Lock Loop (PLL) suitable for this application is developed.

25|$|Modern {{microwave}} ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> panel for operation. Control panels feature an LED, liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible {{functions such as}} a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, frozen vegetables, frozen dinners, and popcorn. In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. As such, the choice of power level {{does not affect the}} intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.|$|E
25|$|Bode {{designed}} the velocity computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a {{finite difference method}} instead of differentiation. Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a potentiometer or a cam. The velocity was then calculated by taking {{the difference between the}} coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times. This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to random signal impulses (spikes). It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical Calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it {{is an integral part of}} modern <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm. In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating coordinate transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.|$|E
