5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating the <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous building.

In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established the <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal {{belief in the}} divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and {{the abolition of the}} monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapter house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished {{more than they}} had in the previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E

By 1995, numerous Croat-owned houses in Hrvatska Dubica, all Croat-owned houses in Cerovljani and about half the Croat-owned houses in Baćin were torched, dynamited or otherwise destroyed.

5|$|Coins of both Carausius and Allectus {{have been}} {{discovered}} buried in the <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort's walls. A later coin of 330–335 was found under a tower in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a major repair or reconstruction around that time.

5|$|Conisbrough Castle {{was bought}} by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the freehold ownership of the land. Two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969, exposing the <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings in the inner bailey, and then from 1973 to 1977, examining options for future visitor facilities.

The church suffered some severe damage during the 19th century, the time of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria; it was mostly destroyed, leaving only the <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arches.

5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, in addition to the <b>foundations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
