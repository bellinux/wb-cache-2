5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

Mass homogeneity of each mass group thus appears statistically important; furthermore, the number of biopsies might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> low.|$|R

25|$|Some critics {{believe that}} the FDA <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> to {{overlook}} safety concerns in approving new drugs, and is slow to withdraw approved drugs once evidence shows them to be unsafe.

25|$|Wd1 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> remote {{for direct}} {{measurement}} of the distance via parallax measurements, but the Gaia space mission is expected to provide such a measurement in 2018. In the mean time, the distance to Wd1 must be estimated from the expected absolute magnitude of the stars and estimates of the extinction towards the cluster. This has been done for both the yellow hypergiant and Wolf–Rayet populations, yielding estimates around 5kpc in both cases, while a determination from the main-sequence population suggests 3.6kpc. These estimates all place Wd1 near {{the outer edge of}} the Galactic bar, which may be significant in determining how such a massive cluster formed.|$|E

De La Hoya has been seen wearing Dynamo colors on his boxing uniform with a small Houston Dynamo logo on his right leg in a fight against boxer Steve Forbes. He has also pledged to help find Dynamo a soccer-specific stadium, though he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> busy with training to participate significantly in Dynamo decision-making.

25|$|Whilst {{elements}} with atomic numbers {{expected for}} the island of stability have been produced, the total nucleon count of these nuclides <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> low. These synthesised nuclides have contained too few neutrons to reach the supposed stable region. It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and, if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well). In particular, the very small critical masses of transplutonic elements (possibly as small as grams) implies that if stable elements could be found, they would enable small and compact nuclear bombs either directly or by serving as primaries to help ignite fission/fusion secondaries; this possibility motivated much of the early research in the 1960s and multiple nuclear tests by the United States (including Operation Plowshare) and the Soviet Union aimed at producing such elements.|$|E

25|$|Transpersonal art {{is one of}} the {{disciplines}} considered by Boucovolas, in listing how transpersonal psychology may relate to other areas of transpersonal study. In writing about transpersonal art, Boucovolas begins by noting how, according to Breccia and also to the definitions employed by the International Transpersonal Association in 1971, transpersonal art may be understood as art work which draws upon important themes beyond the individual self, such as the transpersonal consciousness. This makes transpersonal art criticism germane to mystical approaches to creativity. Transpersonal art criticism, as Boucovolas notes, can be considered that which claims conventional art criticism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> committed to stressing rational dimensions of art and has subsequently said little on art's spiritual dimensions, or as that which holds art work has a meaning beyond the individual person. Certain aspects of the psychology of Carl Jung, as well as movements such as music therapy and art therapy, may also relate to the field. Boucovolas' paper cites Breccia (1971) as an early example of transpersonal art, and claims that at the time his article appeared, integral theorist Ken Wilber had made recent contributions to the field. More recently, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, in 2005, Volume 37, launched a special edition devoted to the media, which contained articles on film criticism that can be related to this field.|$|E

In 2005, Ortiz {{was shot to death}} in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, [...] "I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> high. I would have liked to retire a long time ago ... I cannot allow drug traffickers to think {{that they were able to}} crush Zeta's spirit, and our readers to believe that we are afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{has been}} in {{evidence}} in Ireland since prehistoric times. Although in the early Middle Ages the church was [...] "quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe", there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland {{and the rest of}} Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (goltraige), laughing music (geantraige) and sleeping music (suantraige). Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various string instruments) was transmitted orally, but the Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as Dublin Castle, St Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of Handel's Messiah (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants.|$|E

500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] is a disco revival {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, pop and R styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Several critics highlighted the track as {{following in the}} recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material. The song begins with Carey singing about how {{she is in a}} dilemma {{as to whether or not}} she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover, as he is no longer capable of romancing her. In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance. Carey then decides that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> long that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic's 1979 single [...] "Good Times". Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] to Carey's previous singles [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995) and [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] (1999), but noted that it felt like a [...] "logical extension of post-Pharrell disco revivalism". Christina Lee for Idolator thought that the 70s disco feel embodied Daft Punk's 2013 single, [...] "Get Lucky".|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Moynihan wrote {{a memo to}} President Nixon saying, [...] "The {{time may}} have come when {{the issue of race}} could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect'.

We need a period in which Negro {{progress}} continues and racial rhetoric fades." [...] Moynihan regretted that critics misinterpreted his memo as advocating that the government should neglect minorities.|$|E
