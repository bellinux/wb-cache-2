30|$|There are {{two major}} farming systems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study areas: enset-based and cereal-based. Enset (Ensete ventricosum) dominates the enset-based farming system. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> cereal-based farming system, farmers rotate cereals such as maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and teff (Eragrostis tef) with pulses such as field pea (Pisum sativum), faba bean (Vicia faba), and haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Farmers in Meskan {{practice}} intercropping of these cereals with chat (Catha edulis) and enset. They also plant trees around their homesteads and outfields for multiple purposes, including construction, fuel wood, fruits, and cash generation. The main tree species grown around Meskan homesteads are fruit (e.g. avocado and mango) and high-value cash crop trees (e.g. chat), whereas non-fruit trees (e.g. Acacia sp.) are grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outfields.</b>|$|R
25|$|In cricket, an {{overthrow}} (sometimes {{called a}} buzzer) is an extra run scored by a batsman {{as a result}} of the ball not being collected by a fielder <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre, having been thrown <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> <b>outfield.</b> Overthrows usually occur when a fielder aims unsuccessfully at <b>the</b> stumps <b>in</b> an attempt to run out a batsman, although sometimes they are due to handling errors by the fielder receiving the ball.|$|R
50|$|A {{competitive}} {{player and}} highly disciplined hitter, Fairly {{had a short}} and compact swing with occasional power to all fields. With his glove, he was a competent first baseman {{as well as all}} three outfield positions, being best suited for right field. His talents were overshadowed by a notorious lack of speed. He is one of very few players to play 1000 games or more <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> and <b>the</b> infield.|$|R
5|$|He was {{the first}} major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two {{different}} positions, registering 1,896 games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> and 1,016 at first base.

5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> along the foul lines.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outfield.</b> Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League.

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} varies markedly {{within and}} between African smallholder farms, both {{as a consequence of}} inherent factors and differential management. Fields closest to homesteads (homefields) typically receive most nutrients and are more fertile than outlying fields (outfields), with implications for crop production and nutrient use efficiencies. Maize yields following application of 100 kg N ha(- 1) and different rates and sources of P were assessed on homefields and outfields of smallholder farms in Zimbabwe. Soil organic carbon, available P and exchangeable bases were greater on <b>the</b> homefields than <b>outfields.</b> <b>In</b> each of three experimental seasons, maize yields in homefield control plots were greater than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outfields</b> of farms on a granitic sandy and a red-clay soil. Application of mineral N significantly increased maize yields on homefields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first season (2. 1 - 3. 0 t ha(- 1) on the clay soil and 1. 0 - 1. 5 t ha(- 1) on the sandy soil) but the effects of N alone were not significant on <b>the</b> <b>outfields</b> due to other yield-limiting factors. Greatest yields of about 6 t ha(- 1) were achieved on the clayey homefield with 100 kg N ha(- 1) and 30 kg P ha(- 1) applied as single super phosphate (SSP). Manure application gave greater yields (3 - 4 t ha(- 1)) than SSP (2 - 3 t ha(- 1)) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sandy homefield and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clayey <b>outfield.</b> Maize did not respond significantly to N, dolomitic lime, manure and P on <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfield</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first and second seasons. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third season, manure application (similar to 17 t manure ha(- 1) year(- 1)) on <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfield</b> did result in a significant response in grain yields. Apparent P recovery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first season was 55 - 65 % when P was applied at 10 kg ha(- 1) on the clayey homefield (SSP), clayey outfield (SSP and manure) and sandy homefield (manure) with apparent P recovery less than 40 % when P was applied at 30 kg ha(- 1). On <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfield,</b> P recovery was initially poor ( 50 kg grain kg(- 1) N on the infields, to less than 5 kg grain kg(- 1) N on <b>the</b> sandy <b>outfields.</b> Apparent N recovery efficiency by maize was greatest at small N application rates with P applied. We conclude that blanket fertilizer recommendations are of limited relevance for heterogeneous smallholder farms. Targeted application of mineral fertilizers and manure according to soil type and past management of fields is imperative for improving crop yields and nutrient use efficiencies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.

5|$|Historical {{statistical}} analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his {{ten years in}} the major leagues and at virtually every position he played. After playing his rookie season at first base, Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman. He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951.

50|$|For {{the most}} part, Zobrist {{was used as}} a right fielder and a back-up shortstop during <b>the</b> 2008 season. <b>In</b> certain {{situations}} where a fifth infielder was needed, he or Melvin Upton, Jr. (a former infielder himself) would be moved <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> <b>outfield</b> during <b>the</b> season.

His versatility was showcased during Game 3 of the 2008 World Series against the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies when he came in as part of a double switch to play right field. However, Zobrist initially played unusually shallow, in essence becoming a fifth infielder.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> East African highlands, {{crop yields}} tend to {{increase}} with {{proximity of the}} farm plots to homesteads. Farmers identified soil erosion as the most detrimental cause of low crop yield <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outfields</b> followed by soil compaction due to livestock trampling. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether zai pits (i. e. small water harvesting pits) developed for dryland regions of the Sahel could increase crop yield and water productivity of degraded outfields in high rainfall areas, where mean annual rainfall exceeds 1300 mmbut soil water infiltration is reduced by slope, low soil organic matter and hardpans. The pits were enlarged to resist strong runoff flows. The research was conducted over three years from 2004 to 2006. Potatoes and beans were used as test crops. Overall, compared to control plots, <b>the</b> zai pits, <b>in</b> combination with nitrogen (N) inputs, increased potato yields from 500 % to 2000 % (p ≤ 0. 001). The pits contributed more to increased crop yield than N inputs. Similarly, bean yields from the zai pits were up to 250 % higher. Crop water productivity was 300 – 700 % higher with zai pits than with control plots. The income of farmers who used zai pits was up to 20 -fold higher than the labour costs required to prepare them. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this study reveals that the major constraint of <b>the</b> <b>outfields</b> is not nutrient deficiency per se rather low soil water holding capacity, which hinders crop growth and efficient utilization of available nutrients...|$|R
