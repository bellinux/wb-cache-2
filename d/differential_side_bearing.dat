50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was {{the failure of the}} 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> clearance of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> wedge plate attachment bolt, which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car. Contributing to the derailment was (1) the undesirable contact of the truck bolster bowl rim with the car body center plate and (2) the hollow worn wheels on the 18th car, which further diminished the steering ability of the truck assembly.|$|R
40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of X-section cast-in-place concrete pile (XCC pile), a special cross-section pile, is significantly influenced by side resistance. The single-piled composite foundation including XCC pile and circular pile is simulated {{by means of}} the finite element program ABAQUS. The side resistance and <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity are compared between XCC pile and circular pile. The distribution of side resistance of XCC pile is analyzed via cross-section plan and depth. The results indicate that both the side resistance and the <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity for XCC pile are better than those of circular pile, and that the <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of XCC pile is significantly larger than that of circular pile at the relative depth of 0. 9. At the cross-section plan, because of the soil arching, the side resistance of convex arc is about 1. 5 to 3 times as large as that of concave arc for XCC pile. The ratio of the side resistance for convex arc to that of concave arc increases with the relative depth. The results are available for the design of XCC pile...|$|R

40|$|Etiolated pea {{seedlings}} require {{transformation of}} Pr phytochrome to Pfr before they display optimal phototropic response to unilateral blue light. This study investigates the possible role of auxin transport in explaining these phenomena. Labeled [2 - 14 C]IAA {{applied to the}} intact terminal buds of dark-grown and red light-treated pea seedlings was measured 210 min later on the shaded and illuminated sides of the epicotyl {{as a function of}} direction and duration of irradiation with blue light. Totally darkened epicotyls show an asymmetry in distribution of radioactivity in the upper growth zone of the epicotyl, in favor of the side under the concave part of the apical hook. Red light, which greatly potentiates curvature toward subsequent unilateral blue light, lowers this asymmetry. Blue light directed to the epicotyl of red-pretreated plants in a plane parallel to the hook and from the <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> the convex portion of the hook induces positive phototropic curvature as well as a surplus of radioactivity on the illuminated side of the upper epicotyl and on the shaded side of the lower growth zone of the epicotyl. Light directed to the <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> the concave part of the hook also causes an accumulation of counts in {{the upper part of the}} lighted side but produces neither curvature of the epicotyl nor accumulation of counts in the lower shaded side. Because of this built-in physiological asymmetry in the growth zone just below the apical hook, it is difficult to explain the effects of red and blue light on curvature in terms of patterns of auxin distribution alone...|$|R

40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the oil system. Strip examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the cover <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the cover side, the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab washers. The damaged bearing along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the cover <b>side</b> <b>bearing.</b> There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab washers in assembly in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the cover side was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the cover <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the casing side as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the cover <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper assembly of tab washers or inappropriate choice of the tab washer type for the present application...|$|R
