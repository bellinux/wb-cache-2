5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed {{that he was}} satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 Holst {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, feeling that she might possess the required light touch that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic Hour, was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, he {{was heavily}} criticised for saying pupil–teacher {{relationships}} could be 'experiential and educative on both sides'; he later said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> remarks had {{been off the}} record.|$|E

25|$|After Alabama freed Roy Wright, the Scottsboro Defense Committee {{took him}} on a {{national}} lecture tour. He joined the United States Army. Later he married and joined the Merchant Marine. After Wright {{came back from a}} lengthy time at sea in 1959, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> wife had been unfaithful. He shot and killed her before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide.|$|E

He spent two years finding a comeback vehicle and picked Sinbad the Sailor, which was not a big hit. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> career would be revived by That Lady in Ermine with Betty Grable but director Ernst Lubitsch died during production and was replaced by Otto Preminger; the resulting film was not a success and Fairbanks Jr believes this cost his career momentum.|$|E
25|$|Alf Gover {{was born}} in Epsom, Surrey in 1908. A fast {{right-hand}} bowler with a deadly outswinger and a cleverly disguised breakback, Gover began bowling {{at a young age}} and was first taken on trial by Essex in July 1926. He bowled Johnny Douglas at the nets several times and travelled with Essex as twelfth man to The Oval in 1927. A chance conversation with Herbert Strudwick, the great Surrey wicket-keeper, led Gover to changing county because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> prospects would be brighter with Surrey.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle dined with Monnet on {{his first}} evening in Britain after his flight with Winston Churchill's envoy Edward Spears (17 June). Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> appeal was “too personal” and had broken too far with the Pétain government, and that French opinion would not rally {{to a man who}} was seen to be {{operating}} from British soil. He claimed to have shared his concerns about de Gaulle with the Foreign Office mandarins Alexander Cadogan and Robert Vansittart, and Spears. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the USA.|$|E

60|$|<b>His</b> <b>thoughts</b> grew firmer and clearer; {{they went}} deeper and wider. His first {{superficial}} judgments were endorsed and deepened or replaced by others. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> along the lonely lanes at night; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> at <b>his</b> desk; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> in bed; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> in <b>his</b> bath; <b>he</b> tried over <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> in essays and leading articles and reviewed them and corrected them. Now {{and then came}} relaxation and lassitude, but never release. The war towered over him like a vigilant teacher, day after day, week after week, regardless of fatigue and impatience, holding a rod in its hand.|$|R

25|$|At Brown's urging, NATO members pledged in 1977 to {{increase}} their individual defense spending three percent per year in real terms for the 1979-86 period. The objective, Brown explained, was to ensure that alliance resources and capabilities-both conventional and nuclear-would balance those of the Soviet bloc. Although some NATO members hesitated to confirm the agreement to accept new missiles and did not always attain the three percent target, Brown was pleased with NATO's progress. Midway in his term he told an interviewer that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> most important achievement thus far had been the revitalization of NATO.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{was born}} in 1939 to a middle-class family in the Via Castrofilippo near the seaport {{district}} La Kalsa, a neighbourhood of central Palermo that suffered extensive destruction by aerial attacks during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. His father, Arturo Falcone, {{the director of a}} provincial chemical laboratory, was married to Luisa Bentivegna. Giovanni had two older sisters, Anna and Maria. Falcone's parents emphasised the importance of hard work, bravery and patriotism; he later said they 'expected the maximum' from him. At school Falcone would get into fights with larger children if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> friends were being picked on.|$|E
25|$|Edward Gorsuch was {{not known}} to beat his slaves. As a wealthy Maryland wheat farmer, he had manumitted several slaves in their 20s. He allowed his slaves to work for cash {{elsewhere}} during the slow season. Upon finding some of his wheat missing, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> slaves sold it to a local farmer. His slaves Noah Buley, Nelson Ford, George Ford, and Joshua Hammond, fearing his bad temper, fled across the Mason–Dixon line to the farm of William Parker, a mulatto free man and abolitionist who lived in Christiana, Pennsylvania. Parker, 29, {{was a member of}} the Lancaster Black Self-Protection Society and known to use violence to defend himself and the fugitive slaves who sought refuge in the area.|$|E

6000|$|But the {{thoughts}} that coursed through the youth's brain that night were not centred alone upon the means or {{the prospects of}} deliverance. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>his</b> mother,--her gentleness, her goodness, her unaccountable partiality for Gascoyne; but more than all, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of her love for himself. <b>He</b> <b>thought,</b> too, of <b>his</b> former life--his joys, his sorrows, and his sins. As he remembered these last, his soul was startled, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>his</b> God and his Saviour as <b>he</b> had never <b>thought</b> before. Despite <b>his</b> efforts to restrain them, tears, but not unmanly tears, would flow down his cheeks as he sat that evening on his raft; meditated on the past, the present, and the future, and realised the terrible solemnity of his position--without water or food--almost without hope--alone on the deep.

25|$|In a {{press conference}} November 5, 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan {{government}} offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that {{after six years of}} doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was not the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so {{there is no need for}} him to take that money. In addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|After the {{armistice}} was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 8pm on 22 June to denounce it. The Bordeaux government declared him compulsorily retired (with {{the rank of}} colonel) on 23 June 1940. On 23 June the British Government denounced the Armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated {{that they no longer}} regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also “took note” of the plan to establish a French National Committee (FNC) in exile, but did not specifically mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> appeal was “too personal” and went too far, and that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He said he had warned the Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and Robert Vansittart, as well as Edward Spears, of his concerns about de Gaulle. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the USA. De Gaulle broadcast again on 24 June.|$|E

At his interview, Cartier told Barry that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>his</b> department's output was [...] "dreadful", and that television drama needed [...] "new scripts and a new approach". In a 1990 interview about his career, he told BBC Two's The Late Show that the BBC drama department had [...] "needed me like water in the desert". Barry shared many of Cartier's views {{on the need to}} improve television drama, and he hired him for the producer's job.|$|E
