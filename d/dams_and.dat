5|$|Following {{the loss}} of {{territory}} required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire. This divided {{the resources of the}} country. Furthermore, <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> canals became derelict, and a devastating plague erupted in the western provinces of Iran, killing half of the population along with Kavadh II, who was succeeded by Ardashir III.|$|E
5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in riparian areas. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{electricity}} generated by Hydro-Québec Generation comes from hydroelectric dams located far from load centres such as Montreal. Of the 33,000MW of electrical power generated, over 93% of that comes from hydroelectric <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> 85% of that generation capacity comes from three hydroelectric generation centers: James Bay, Manic-Outardes, and Churchill Falls.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their upland habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, siltation, <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> weirs blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E
5|$|The Romans built many <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> {{reservoirs}} {{for water}} collection, {{such as the}} Subiaco Dams, two of which fed the Anio Novus, {{one of the largest}} aqueducts of Rome. They built 72 dams just on the Iberian peninsula, and many more are known across the Empire, some still in use. Several earthen dams are known from Roman Britain, including a well-preserved example from Longovicium (Lanchester).|$|E
5|$|The rare floods that do {{break free}} of the <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> weirs of the Murray-Darling system have their {{magnitude}} and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators. Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide.|$|E

5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, McNary {{supported}} the development of federal hydroelectric power <b>dams,</b> <b>and</b> in 1933, he introduced legislation {{that led to the}} building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as public works projects. He voted for the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, reforestation, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation of the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> their reservoirs.|$|E
50|$|Four dams are {{involved}} in the scheme; the Driekloof Dam (joined to the Sterkfontein Dam), the Kilburn Dam, the Woodstock <b>Dam</b> <b>and</b> the Driel Barrage. Electricity generation equipment is located between Driekloof <b>Dam</b> <b>and</b> Kilburn <b>Dam.</b> Since the Driekloof Dam/Sterkfontein Dam also forms part of the Tugela-Vaal Water Project some of the water pumped to Driekloof Dam might end up flowing to the Vaal <b>Dam</b> <b>and</b> not be available for return to the Kilburn Dam. The Woodstock <b>Dam</b> <b>and</b> Driel Barrage are used to supply this additional water to Kilburn Dam when required.|$|R

5|$|In 1948 floods {{swept through}} the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> {{locks on}} the lower Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports {{on the lower}} Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the main product shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the United States and Canada {{signed the}} Columbia River Treaty, {{which focused on}} flood control and the {{maximization}} of downstream power generation. Canada agreed to build <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> provide reservoir storage, and the United States agreed to deliver to Canada one-half {{of the increase in}} USdownstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance. Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Many of Canberra's suburbs {{are named}} after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.

5|$|Members of the Desert Archaic Culture {{were the}} {{earliest}} known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000 years. Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young were the first European American settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries. The growing population, needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built <b>dams,</b> <b>and</b> installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.|$|E
5|$|On April4, 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior {{released}} its final {{environmental impact statement}} on the plan, recommending the removal of all four <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> $1billion in other environmental restoration to aid native salmon runs on the Klamath.
