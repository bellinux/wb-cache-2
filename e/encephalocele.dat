25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, <b>encephalocele</b> and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{folic acid}} during {{pregnancy}} {{is vital to}} normal development {{of the nervous system}} in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder, a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely. NTDs are {{not to be confused with}} spina bifida, which does not involve neural elements. Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes <b>encephalocele,</b> craniorachischisis, and anencephaly. In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and <b>encephalocele.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{iniencephaly}}. The more severe group is iniencephaly apertus, involving the development of an <b>encephalocele.</b> In the other group, iniencephaly clausus, the <b>encephalocele</b> is absent.|$|E
50|$|Nasal glial heterotopia is rare, {{while an}} <b>encephalocele</b> is uncommon. NGH usually {{presents}} in infancy, while <b>encephalocele</b> may present in older children and adults. It {{is seen in}} both genders equally.|$|E

50|$|Knobloch {{syndrome}} is also characterised by cataracts, dislocated lens with skull defects such as occipital <b>encephalocele</b> and occipital aplasia. <b>Encephalocele</b> is a neural tube defect where the skull has not completely closed and sac-like protrusions {{of the brain}} can push through the skull; (it can also result from other causes).In Knobloch’s syndrome this is usually seen in the occipital region, and aplasia is the underdevelopment of tissue again in this reference in the occipital area.|$|E
5000|$|In craniofacial malformations, mildly {{affected}} {{individuals will}} have no abnormalities of the palate. The most severely affected will have a fronto-ethmoid-nasal-maxillary <b>encephalocele.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Encephalocele,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} cranium bifidum, is a neural tube defect characterized by sac-like protrusions {{of the brain}} and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull. These defects are caused by failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development. Encephaloceles cause a groove {{down the middle of the}} skull, or between the forehead and nose, or on the back side of the skull. The severity of <b>encephalocele</b> varies, depending on its location.|$|E
50|$|If dermoid cysts {{appear on}} the medial aspect, the {{possibility}} of an <b>encephalocele</b> becomes greater and should be considered among the differential diagnoses.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>encephalocele</b> {{is based on}} surgery to repair the bony gap and provide adequate protection of the underlying brain. The question remains if the external brain tissue should be put back into the skull {{or if it is}} possible to cut off that piece of brain tissue, because its claimed that the external piece of brain tissue often isn’t functional, {{with the exception of a}} basal <b>encephalocele,</b> in which the pituitary gland can be found in the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Specific types include: {{spina bifida}} which affects the spine, {{anencephaly}} {{which results in}} little to no brain, <b>encephalocele</b> which affects the skull, and iniencephaly which results in severe neck problems.|$|E
50|$|Occipital <b>encephalocele</b> {{is present}} in 60% to 80% of all cases, and post-axial {{polydactyly}} {{is present in}} 55% to 75% {{of the total number}} of identified cases. Bowing or shortening of the limbs are also common.|$|E
50|$|Usually encephaloceles are {{noticeable}} deformities and {{are diagnosed}} immediately after birth, {{but a small}} <b>encephalocele</b> in the nasal or forehead region can go undetected. Various physical and mental developmental delays can indicate the presence of encephaloceles.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} prenatally; routine obstetric ultrasound {{can identify}} the characteristic hypoechoic lesion inferior and medial to the globe. It is important to distinguish a dacrocystocele from the more serious <b>encephalocele,</b> which is a neural tube defect.|$|E
50|$|Meckel {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, Gruber Syndrome, Dysencephalia Splanchnocystica) is a rare, lethal, ciliopathic, genetic disorder, characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, {{central nervous system}} malformations (occipital <b>encephalocele),</b> polydactyly (post axial), hepatic developmental defects, and pulmonary hypoplasia due to oligohydramnios.|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, <b>encephalocele</b> and anencephaly.

50|$|On December 4, 2012, Dr. Meara again led a cranio-facial {{surgical}} team {{to remove}} the <b>encephalocele</b> of an infant, Dominic Gundrum, {{the son of a}} Wisconsin Court of Appeals judge and his wife. The surgery also closed the baby's skull, repaired a Tessier facial cleft, and brought the baby's facial features together.|$|E
50|$|Gundrum and his wife, Mary, {{married in}} 1996. They are Catholic and have eight children, who they homeschooled through Wisconsin Virtual Academy. Their {{youngest}} {{child was born}} with <b>encephalocele</b> and a facial cleft, which required surgery to correct at Boston Children's Hospital. Gundrum appeared in the 2015 Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer, detailing Avery's case.|$|E
50|$|Nasal glial heterotopia {{refers to}} {{congenital}} malformations of displaced normal, mature glial tissue, which {{are no longer}} in continuity with an intracranial component. This is distinctly different from an <b>encephalocele,</b> which is a herniation of brain tissue and/or leptomeninges, that develops through a defect in the skull, where there is a continuity with the cranial cavity.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2006, {{there was}} an hour-long {{documentary}} on the British television network Channel 4 about Facing the World, an organization that helps children with severe facial disfigurements in developing countries. One of the children featured on the documentary was Ney, a Cambodian boy who suffered from a severe form of <b>encephalocele,</b> wherein part of his brain protruded through his face.|$|E
5000|$|The Facemakers: Operation Smile is a {{documentary}} co-produced by the Discovery Channel and BBC 1 {{in conjunction with}} century films aired on 21 June 2000. The Facemakers documents the remarkable changes {{that occurred in the}} lives of three children as a result of Operation Smile's visit to Davao City in the Philippines in 1999. One child in particular, Abel Gastardo, had a condition too severe to be treated {{during the time of the}} mission. Abel suffered from a rare nasofrontal facial <b>encephalocele,</b> an extreme protrusion of brain tissue from the front of his skull. The documentary follows Abel to the United States seven months later to receive corrective surgery. He was brought over by Operation Smile to receive the major surgery in Virginia, at the Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters. The other facial defects within the fifty-minute programme consisted of children with facial cleft and cleft lip and palate which may be associated with <b>encephalocele.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Others: {{polydactyly}} (an {{excess of}} fingers or toes), syndactyly (fused fingers or toes), brachydactyly (short fingers and/or toes), clinodactyly (bending {{of the fifth}} fingers towards the fourth fingers), preauricular skin tags, an absent tragus, low set ears, deafness, small frontal sinuses, mental retardation, <b>encephalocele</b> (protrusion of the brain), spina bifida (split spine), meningoencephalocele (protrusion of both meninges), umbilical hernia, cryptorchidism (absence {{of one or two}} testes) and possibly cardiac anomalies.|$|E
50|$|Patients come to {{clinical}} attention {{early in life}} (usually at birth or within the first few months), with a firm subcutaneous nodule at bridge of nose, or as a polypoid mass within the nasal cavity, or somewhere along the upper border of the nasal bow. If the patient presents with an intranasal mass, there may be obstruction, chronic rhinosinusitis, or nasal drainage. If there is a concurrent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, then an <b>encephalocele</b> is much more likely.|$|E
50|$|While nasal glial heterotopia (NGH) is the {{preferred}} term, synonyms have included nasal glioma. However, this term is to be discouraged, as it implies a neoplasm or tumor, which it is not. By definition, nasal glial heterotopia is {{a specific type of}} choristoma. It is not a teratoma, however, which is a neoplasm comprising all three germ cell layers (ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm). As a congenital malformation or ectopia, it is distinctly different from the trauma or iatrogenic development of an <b>encephalocele.</b>|$|E
50|$|Encephaloceles of {{the face}} are {{generally}} classified as nasofrontal, nasoethmoidal, or naso-orbital, however, there can be some overlap {{in the type of}} <b>encephalocele.</b> They can also appear along any part of the cranial vault as they result from abnormal closure of cranial bones; the most common location for enncephaloceles is the occipital region. If the bulging portion contains only cerebrospinal fluid and the overlying membrane, it may be called a meningocele. If brain tissue is present, it may be referred to as a meningoencephalocele.|$|E
5000|$|Live {{cells or}} tissues with intact cell {{membranes}} are not coloured. Since cells are very selective in the compounds that {{pass through the}} membrane, in a viable cell trypan blue is not absorbed; however, it traverses the membrane in a dead cell. Hence, dead cells are shown as a distinctive blue colour under a microscope. Since live cells are excluded from staining, this staining method is also described as a dye exclusion method. This dye may be a cause of certain birth defects such as <b>encephalocele.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main signs of acalvaria: {{absence of the}} flat bones of the cranial vault, absence of the dura mater and muscles {{associated}} with it, skull abnormalities, {{and the absence of}} a skull cap. This condition can be diagnosed prior to birth using ultrasonography. Physicians often use magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis because in utero, acalvaria is sometimes confused with anencephaly or <b>encephalocele.</b> A distinguishable difference is that with anencephaly, the cerebral hemispheres are missing, but with acalvaria, all parts of the cerebrum are usually present and developed, whereas parts of the calvarium are missing.|$|E
50|$|Syrinxes usually {{result from}} lesions that {{partially}} obstruct CSF flow. At least ½ of syrinxes occur {{in patients with}} congenital abnormalities of the craniocervical junction (e.g. herniation of cerebellar tissue into the spinal canal, called Chiari malformation), brain (e.g. <b>encephalocele),</b> or spinal cord (e.g. myelomeningocele—see Congenital Neurologic Anomalies: Brain Anomalies). For unknown reasons, these congenital abnormalities often expand during the teen or young adult years. A syrinx can also develop in patients who have a spinal cord tumor, scarring due to previous spinal trauma, or no known predisposing factors. About 30% of people with a spinal cord tumor eventually develop a syrinx.|$|E
50|$|Facing the World was {{featured}} in an hour-long Channel 4 documentary My New Face on 15 November 2006. The documentary covered {{the work of the}} charity over the period of a year, and featured the cases of Arianto from Jakarta, who suffered gigantism of one side of his face caused by neurofibromatosis; Ney, a Cambodian boy who was born with <b>encephalocele</b> (his brain protruded into his face through a defect in his skull); Zaynab, an eight-month-old girl from Gaza who had a cleft lip and palate; and Eyerusalem from Addis Ababa, one of the charity's earliest patients who had a vascular malformation removed in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Frontonasal {{dysplasia}} (FND) is a {{congenital malformation}} of the midface.For {{the diagnosis of}} FND, a patient should present {{at least two of}} the following characteristics: hypertelorism (an increased distance between the eyes), a wide nasal root, vertical midline cleft of the nose and/or upper lip, cleft of the wings of the nose, malformed nasal tip, <b>encephalocele</b> (an opening of the skull with protrusion of the brain) or V-shaped hair pattern on the forehead.The cause of FND remains unknown. FND seems to be sporadic (random) and multiple environmental factors are suggested as possible causes for the syndrome. However, in some families multiple cases of FND were reported, which suggests a genetic cause of FND.|$|E
