5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the <b>dried</b> <b>fish</b> are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the <b>dried</b> <b>fish</b> with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with <b>dried</b> <b>fish.</b> Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To combat malaria, the Kenya Ministry of Health {{and nongovernmental}} {{organizations}} (NGOs) have distributed insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for use over beds, with coverage for children under five years of age increasing rapidly. Nevertheless, residents of fishing villages have started to use these bed nets for <b>drying</b> <b>fish</b> and fishing in Lake Victoria. This study investigated the extent of bed net misuse in fishing villages. Methods Seven fishing villages along the lake were surveyed to estimate how widely bed nets were being used for <b>fishing</b> and <b>drying</b> <b>fish.</b> Villagers were asked why they used the bed nets for such purposes. Results In total, 283 bed nets were being used for <b>drying</b> <b>fish.</b> Of these, 239 were long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLIN) and 44 were non-long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (NLLIN). Further, 72 of the 283 bed nets were also being used for fishing. The most popular reasons were because the bed nets were inexpensive or free and because <b>fish</b> <b>dried</b> faster on the nets. LLINs were preferred to NLLINs for <b>fishing</b> and <b>drying</b> <b>fish.</b> Conclusion There is considerable misuse of bed nets for <b>drying</b> <b>fish</b> and fishing. Many villagers are not yet fully convinced {{of the effectiveness of}} LLINs for malaria prevention. Such misuses may hamper the efforts of NGOs and governmental health organizations. </p...|$|R

Total numbers of samples were 24 that were analyzed in the laboratory. Results: The results of the study show that the mean concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the samples of Ribbon fish, Bombay duck and Sin croaker were ranged between 130. 85 - 153. 47 ppb, 125. 21 - 181. 4 ppb and 119. 86 – 208. 65 ppb respectively. The mean concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were found at a lower amount in shrimp sp. than the other.

As far {{the concern of}} the researcher, {{this study is the}} first of its kind to explore the <b>dry</b> <b>fish</b> consumption behaviour in Bangladesh. The general purpose of this study is to apply the general framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), explain attitudes, intention and <b>dry</b> <b>fish</b> consumption in Chittagong city and to extend the traditional TPB-model with some additional variables; perceived risk, knowledge, price and cost. The field experiments were performed in Chittagong city, Bangladesh with convenience sample of 208 respondents. The measurement scales used in this study were selected or adapted from previous studies. The study employs the methods of factor analysis, test of reliability, principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis to analyze the data. The findings showed that attitude, norms and procedural knowledge emerge as the key determinants of intention, while intention, attitude, norms and perceived risk effect on the consumption frequency. PBC, price and cost had no significant effect on intention and <b>dry</b> <b>fish</b> consumption. Perceived quality is found as the most important attribute to forming consumers’ attitude towards <b>dry</b> <b>fish</b> consumption. The proposed TPB and the extended model both of them fit well with the data and proved the expectations of this study in a promising way. The study found that people are more concerned about potential long-term risk to their family and others. Therefore, management attention should focus on reducing risks with which consumers may be faced through producing safe and hazard free <b>dry</b> <b>fish.</b> A communication strategy should focus much more on improving procedural knowledge and signing food safety for consumers with lower knowledge than the others.
