40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a multiparallel plate denuder able to operate at low and high-flow (3 − 30 L/min) for the collection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) vapor is described. The denuder, in combination with a micro orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) {{was used to assess}} processes of artifact formation in MOUDIs used with and without an upstream denuder. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> trains with an upstream denuder showed good repeatability of the measured gas and particle-phase concentrations and low break-through in the denuder (3. 5 − 15 %). The PAH size distributions within undenuded and denuded MOUDIs were studied. Use of the denuder altered the measured size distribution of PAHs toward smaller sizes, but both denuded and undenuded systems are subject to sampling artifacts. 1...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of {{particulate}} matter (PM) from poultry and pig houses may {{contribute significantly to}} ambient concentrations. Yet, our knowledge on the accuracy and comparability of samplers available for measuring the high PM 10 concentrations (> 100 µg m– 3) in the inside air directly upstream of the ventilation exhausts of these buildings is very limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide insight into this matter for five candidate samplers: a filter-based cyclone sampler (CYS), the Thermo Scientific FH 62 I-R beta-attenuation sampler (BAS), the Thermo Scientific Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance, model 1400 ab (TEOM), the TSI DustTrak model 8520 (DT), and the GRIMM Portable Aerosol Spectrometer model 1. 109 (PAS). Equivalence tests were carried out following European Standard EN 12341 using two devices for each candidate sampler (CAS) and four filter-based low-volume reference samplers (RES). Measurements were performed inside three major animal housings (a fattening pig house, a laying hen house, and a broiler house) and inside an office room. Our key results and conclusions are: (1) neither one of the five CASs, nor the RES itself, met the EN 12341 requirement for comparability between devices of the same sampler type. Using a less strict boundary for this aspect – in concert with performing <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> – may be appropriate. (2) The CYS met the EN 12341 accuracy requirements in pigs and layers, but overestimated the RES concentration in broilers. The BAS, TEOM, and DT underestimated, and the PAS overestimated, RES concentrations in a systematic manner. The use of correction factors seems to be a promising method to calibrate measured values to RES concentrations. (3) The BAS, TEOM, DT, and PAS started to show scattered regression after 432 – 500 h of sampling, which stresses the need for shortened time intervals between full services. In conclusion, some of the samplers tested could be regarded acceptable when appropriate measures (such as <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling,</b> correction factors, and more frequent servicing) are applied...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Adrenal vein {{sampling}} (AVS) is {{the preferred}} test for subtyping primary aldosteronism. However, the procedure is technically demanding and costly. In AVS it is common practice to take duplicate blood samples at each location. In this paper we explore whether a single sample procedure leads to a different conclusion concerning the location of adrenal aldosterone secretion than a duplicate sample procedure. METHODS: AVS procedures with duplicate measurements performed in our university medical center between 2005 and 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. We compared the conclusions regarding selectivity and lateralization based on the first sample taken (A) to the conclusions based on the average of duplicate samples (AB). We also calculated the number needed to be sampled in duplicate to prevent one misclassification. RESULTS: Ninety-six AVS procedures of 82 patients were included. The concordance in AVS conclusions between samples A and AB was 98 - 100 %, depending on the criteria used for selectivity and lateralization. With permissive and strict criteria the number needed to be sampled in duplicate were infinite and 48, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental benefit of <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> compared to single sampling is low. Therefore, {{in the case of}} technical difficulties during AVS, conclusions can also be reliably drawn from a single blood sample...|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} study was undertaken to compare bronchial brushings with dry catheter aspiration for the cytological diagnosis {{of lung cancer}} at fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Duplicate samples taken by aspirate and brush were obtained at 103 consecutive routine bronchoscopies. Aspirate and brush samples were reported on separately by two cytologists. At {{the end of the}} study a 30 % sample, including the 19 cases with different findings by the two methods, were subjected to a blind crossover review, and then an open review. Forceps biopsy specimens for routine histological assessment were taken in 94 cases (92 %). Ninety-eight of 103 (95 %) aspirates and 99 of 103 (96 %) brush specimens were technically satisfactory. Carcinoma was diagnosed at bronchoscopy on cytological or histological evidence or both in 57 cases. Fifty-five of these tumours (96 %) were recognised by either the aspirate or the brush method, 52 (91 %) by brush, and 50 (88 %) by aspirate. Thirty-four cases (60 %) could be diagnosed from histological specimens. The order of cytological sampling did not systematically affect yield. It is concluded that fine-catheter aspirates, permitting smears to be prepared in the laboratory, are a satisfactory alternative to brush smears for the cytological diagnosis of lung cancer at bronchoscopy. The routine use of both techniques at bronchoscopy will increase diagnostic yield by about 5 %. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> may be especially useful in obtaining diagnostic material from upper-lobe or apical-segment tumours...|$|E

40|$|It {{is certain}} that all {{chemical}} components contained in Antarctic ice have been derived from the atmosphere. However, the detailed mechanism of their inclusion into glacier ice is still a subject of research. Comparisons of chemical composition of atmospheric aerosol and falling snow or surface depositing snow {{have been carried out}} at the South Pole Station and Antarctic Peninsula areas and good linear relationships have been found, especially in the latter case. But these studies were focused on the behavior of heavy metal elements. Furthermore, the same kinds of studies carried out in Alaska gave a negative conclusion. The authors studied the relationship between chemical compositions of atmospheric aerosol and fresh drifting snow in 1990 - 1993 on the Mizuho Plateau and found a loose linear relationship with regard to the most of main chemical species contained in aerosol and snow. The extent to which the linear relationship holds differs among chemical species. Even with such uncertainty, these results suggest a general conclusion that the chemical composition of impurities contained in Antarctic glacier ice is ultimately controlled by surface aerosols. In 1993 - 1994,the study was repeated with the expanded survey area from the sea surface to near the Dome Fuji Station. However, this time the linear relationship was much more diffuse than expected from previous studies. Most typically, quite different results were observed by <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> with time lag of nearly a month, one with a linear relationship and the other without it.

Introgression {{with the}} domesticated hop plant (Humulus lupulus L., Cannabaceae) makes some {{morphological}} indentifications difficult for wild or heirloom hop plants found on wild or fallow lands. As a result, this dissertation takes an approach using DNA barcodes {{to investigate the}} proposed polytypic model for Humulus, which is mostly based on morphology. Results from two standard DNA barcode studies with fresh and herbarium materials show the genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships. In addition, putatively wild as well as unknown hop plants were sorted into three species (H. lupulus, H. scandens, and H. yunnanensis), while H. lupulus was further split into Western to Central Eurasia, East Asia, and the New World clades. Low resolution was found for the putative varieties of H. lupulus from East Asia and the New World. Furthermore, results from two chloroplast genome (plastome) barcode studies show the conserved relationships and unique evolutionary history within the Cannabaceae (s. s.). The phylogenomic analyses presented here suggest the Cannabaceae (s. s.) is much more ancient than previously proposed. With a mid-Cretaceous origin based on high bootstrap and posterior probability support on a polyphyletic tree with basal East Asian taxa, a Laurasian migration hypothesis is probable for Humulus. Compared to single or several DNA regions used to barcode plants, the plastome as a single DNA barcode supports {{the unity of the}} H. lupulus complex in a polytypic model. Further <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> on the phyloplastome tree is required to test the varietal relationships of H. lupulus from East Asian and the New World.

Electronic noses can distinguish VOC mixtures by pattern recognition. Objective: We hypothesized that an electronic nose can discriminate exhaled air of patients with asthma from healthy controls, and between patients with different disease severities. Methods: Ten young patients with mild asthma (25. 1 +/- 5. 9 years; FEV 1, 99. 9 +/- 7. 7 % predicted), 10 young controls (26. 8 +/- 6. 4 years; FEV 1, 101. 9 +/- 10. 3), 10 older patients with severe asthma (49. 5 +/- 12. 0 years; FEV 1, 62. 3 +/- 23. 6), and 10 older controls (57. 3 +/- 7. 1 years; FEV 1, 108. 3 +/- 14. 7) joined a cross-sectional study with <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> of exhaled breath with an interval of 2 to 5 minutes. Subjects inspired VOC-filtered air by tidal breathing for 5 minutes, and a single expiratory vital capacity was collected into a Tedlar bag that was sampled by electronic nose (Cyranose 320) within 10 minutes. Smellprints were analyzed by linear discriminant analysis on principal component reduction. Cross-validation values (CVVs) were calculated. Results: Smellprints of patients with mild asthma were fully separated from young controls (CVV, 100 %; Mahalanobis distance [M-distance], 5. 32), and patients with severe asthma could be distinguished from old controls (CVV, 90 %; M-distance, 2. 77). Patients with mild and severe asthma could be less well discriminated (CVV, 65 %; M-distance, 1. 23), whereas the 2 control groups were indistinguishable (CVV, 50 %; M-distance, 1. 56).

For {{each of the four}} parameters, the contribution of the intraindividual variation to the total variance [13 % and 9 % for fibrinogen, 3 % and 5 % for TPA antigen, 4 % and 20 % for In [PAI activity], and 14 % and 9 % for In[CRP] for the healthy volunteers and AP patients, respectively) was smaller than the contribution from the interindividual variation. These results indicate that single sampling is sufficient to assess an individual level for TPA antigen and PAI activity, whereas <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> for fibrinogen and triplicate sampling for CRP are recommended. In an epidemiological study the sample sizes, based on the variances found in the transverse part of the study, needed to detect a 15 % {{difference between the two groups}} (with α=. 01 and a statistical power=. 90) are 31 and 40 for fibrinogen 568 and 146 for TPA antigen, 603 and 119 for PAl activity, and 1490 and 2263 for CRP in healthy volunteers and patients with AP, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} trout to naturally fishless mountain lakes {{in the western}} United States {{has been accompanied by}} little research. The ecological role of trout populations occurring in 91 lakes of the central Selway Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho, was examined with respect to 1) the sampling variability of biological and chemical lake characteristics measured, 2) possible effects of trout on biotic communities of crustacean zooplankton, macro-invertebrates, amphibians and reptiles, and 3) the relation of fish population characteristics (condition and maximum body length) to stocking rate, angling pressure, natural recruitment and lake habitat characteristics. Based on 22 lakes surveyed two or three times over a three year period, sampling variability was relatively low for individual species, biotic communities and length and weight of the largest fish in the population. Water conductivity measured at the lake surface from shore was the most reliable index of water quality, exhibiting low seasonal and <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> variability and a high correlation with alkalinity samples. Based on Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), an ordination method used to organize the 91 lakes by {{the presence or absence of}} taxa, the composition of indigenous biotic communities was strongly related to the presence or absence of fish. The Multi-Response Permutation Procedure indicated that the difference in communities was statistically significant. Fewer taxa were sampled in lakes with fish and the taxa expected to be most vulnerable to predation due to their large size and frequent occurrence in open water were rarely found in lakes containing fish. DCA ordinations indicated that characteristics of the fish population (fish species, condition and maximum body length) were also related to the composition of the biotic community. This was probably due to the bottom up:top down trophic level interactions of predator and prey; fish affecting the structure of biotic communities by predation and prey affecting growth and condition of fish by their abundance and availability as determined by both physical habitat characteristics and impacts of predation by fish. Average condition and maximum body length of fish populations were related to stocking rate, natural recruitment, angling pressure and lake habitat variables by stepwise multiple regression. Average condition and maximum body length increased with decreasing level of natural recruitment for all fish population classes, except brook trout (all with high natural recruitment) and populations with no natural recruitment. Average fish condition increased with increasing angling pressure (measured by campsite impact and access distance ratings). Maximum body length of fish increased in relation to habitat variables, particularly presence of the large (2 - 3 mm) calanoid copepod, Diaptomus sp. Stocking rate was not related to average condition or maximum body length for any fish population class tested except one, where it may represent a spurious correlation. The findings of this study suggest the need to reassess high lake research and management policies that have promoted 1) widespread stocking of un-surveyed lakes on a regular basis and 2) considered stocking rate adjustments as an effective means of manipulating fish populations. Management direction can now be based on a recognition of the potential usefulness of one-time sampling of biological and chemical lake characteristics, the potential for significant impacts of fish on indigenous biotic communities, and the importance of natural recruitment, angling pressure and habitat variables in determining characteristics of the fish population. Recommendations include the identification and maintenance without further stocking of fishless lakes and lakes containing self sustaining trout populations (wild trout lakes) ...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{houses are}} {{extremely}} dusty environments. Airborne particulate matter (PM) poses a health threat {{not only to}} the farmer and the animals, but, as a result of emissions from ventilation systems, also to residents living in livestock farming areas. In relation to this problem, the objectives of this thesis were threefold. The first objective was to increase our understanding and knowledge of concentrations and emission rates of PM in commonly applied animal housing systems. This objective is worked out in chapter 2 which presents a national emission survey into the concentrations and emissions of PM, which covered 13 common housing systems for poultry, pigs, and dairy in the Netherlands and included 202 24 -h measurements at 36 farms. The emission figures from this work are currently used in the Netherlands in environmental permit granting procedures (to model the local dispersion of PM 10 in the vicinity of livestock farms), to estimate national emissions, to compute large-scale pollutant concentration maps, and to annually evaluate the state of affairs of the National Air Quality Cooperation Programme (NSL). The second objective was to develop, test, and validate technologies to mitigate PM concentrations and emissions in poultry farms and ultimately contribute to cleaner outdoor air. This objective is worked out in chapters 3 through 7. Chapters 3 and 4 describe two experiments, one in broilers, one in layers, that investigated the effects of spraying rapeseed oil droplets onto the litter of poultry houses which prevents particles from the litter from becoming airborne. On the basis of chapters 3 and 4, chapter 5 describes a field evaluation of four systems that mitigate PM emissions by reducing indoor concentrations: a fixed oil spraying system, an autonomously driving oil spraying vehicle, a negative air ionization system, and a positive air ionization system. Chapter 6 describes a field evaluation of two ‘end of pipe’ systems to remove PM from the exhaust air of poultry farms, namely: a dry filter wall and an electrostatic precipitator. Chapter 7 describes an emission survey carried out at a total of 16 commercial poultry farms with an ‘end of pipe’ manure drying tunnel. This chapter aimed to elucidate the PM abatement potential and possible additional emissions of ammonia and odor of these tunnels. Furthermore, this chapter aimed to elucidate the perspective of two strategies to reduce any additional emissions from the manure drying tunnels. The results from chapters 5 through 7, carried out at commercial farms, have been used to adopt accurate PM removal figures in Dutch regulations on PM emissions from livestock houses. Finally, the third objective was to determine the applicability (in terms of acceptable accuracy and comparability) of alternative PM 10 measurement methods – i. e., alternative to the ‘cyclone sampler’ developed prior to this thesis and used in chapters 2 through 7. Such alternative samplers could then be applied in future for determination of PM 10 emission rates of animal houses. This objective has been worked out in chapter 8 as an equivalence study between the European reference sampler for PM 10 (described in EN 12341) and five different candidate measurement methods (the cyclone sampler, a beta-ray attenuation sampler, a microbalance device, and two light-scattering devices) in four different environments (a fattening pig house, a laying hen house, a broiler house, and an office room). Results show that all samplers showed a systematic deviation from ‘true’ values, that between-device variation was relatively high, and that samplers started to dysfunction after about 432 to 500 h of operation. Therefore, appropriate measures (such as <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling,</b> correction factors, and more frequent servicing) must be taken. The results can be used to harmonize PM 10 measurement methods across institutes and to further increase the availability of samplers for the measurement of PM 10 in animal production...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the digestible amino acid composition of human milk. The gross amino acid composition of human milk was corrected for digestibility using true ileal amino acid digestibility coefficients for human milk determined in the piglet. The digestible amino acid composition of human milk was used to evaluate protein quality in a commercial infant formula. In {{the first part of the}} study the piglet was evaluated as a model animal for studying aspects of protein digestion in human infants. Three-week-old male piglets and three-month-old male human infants were bottle-fed an infant formula over a 17 day balance study which included a 10 day total faecal collection period. Small but statistically significant differences between the piglets and infants were found for the apparent faecal digestibility of dietary dry matter, organic matter and total nitrogen. The faecal digestibilities for most of the amino acids, however, were not significantly different between the species. It was concluded that the digestion of protein, to the end of the gastrointestinal tract, appeared to be similar in the two species. For application of an ileal digestibility assay, it is necessary to assume that amino acids are not absorbed in significant amounts posterior to the ileo-caecal junction. An experiment was conducted, therefore, {{to determine}} whether lysine and/or methionine, two dietary essential amino acids, were absorbed in nutritionally significant amounts from the large intestine of the three-week-old piglet. Piglets, surgically prepared with simple catheters which allowed infusion into the proximal colon, were given one of two milk-formula diets which were deficient in either lysine or in the sulphur amino acids, yet were balanced for all other amino acids. An isotonic solution containing the respective deficient amino acid or physiological saline was infused via the catheter at each feeding. Total daily excretions of urinary urea and total nitrogen were determined. There were no significant differences in urinary nitrogen metabolite excretion for piglets infused with amino acids compared with those infused with saline. Lysine and methionine did not appear to be absorbed in nutritionally significant amounts from the proximal colon of the milk-fed piglet. Two experiments were conducted to develop a method for accurately determining the amino acid composition of human milk. In the first, a non-linear model, that describes the simultaneous processes of amino acid yield and decay that occur during acid hydrolysis of a protein prior to amino acid detection, was used to regress data derived from multiple hydrolysis intervals. Most of the amino acids underwent some degree of loss during hydrolysis. Of particular note was the loss rate for cysteic acid, which was greater than that found for serine. Using the routine <b>duplicate</b> <b>sampling</b> system, a non-linear regression including 10 hydrolysis intervals resulted in a mean amino acid recovery of 100 % and provided an acceptable compromise between accuracy and the cost of analysis. In the second experiment, the non-linear model was modified to account for samples, such as human milk, having amino acids in free form prior to hydrolysis. The original and new models were compared. A biological sample (human milk) was hydrolysed in acid for multiple hydrolysis intervals. As in the previous experiment, most of the amino acids (and in particular, cysteic acid) underwent some degree of loss during hydrolysis. It was concluded that using the original model to analyse data obtained from hydrolysis of a sample containing protein and free amino acids will not lead to the introduction of any large bias in the determination of amino acid composition. The modified model, however, is more accurate for application where a sample contains both protein-bound and free amino acids. In the penultimate experiment of the study, human milk was collected from women in their 10 th- 14 th weeks of lactation, and was analysed for amino acids with correction for losses of amino acids during acid hydrolysis, using the model parameters determined in the earlier experiment. The mean amino acid composition of the human milk was similar to previously reported estimates, though the cysteine content of the human milk was 20 % higher than the mean literature estimate. True (corrected for endogenous amino acid excretion) ileal amino acid digestibility coefficients for human milk, determined in three-week-old piglets fed human milk, ranged from 81 - 101 % with threonine (86 %) being the least digestible essential amino acid. The overall digestibility of amino acid nitrogen was 95 %. When the true ileal digestibility values were used to correct the amino acid composition of human milk, the pattern of amino acids absorbed from human milk was different compared to the currently recommended dietary pattern of amino acids for the infant. In the final study, true ileal amino acid digestibility coefficients for a commercial infant formula were determined using the three-week-old piglet. Coefficients ranged from 95 % for lysine to 103 % for arginine, indicating near-complete digestion of the protein in the infant formula. The profile of absorbed amino acids for the infant formula was compared with that for human milk to evaluate protein quality in the infant formula. It was concluded that the protein in the formula was of high quality...|$|E

The composition of fatty acids was determined by methanolysis gas chromatography and Mass spectrophotometry of the resultant methyl esters. The results indicate that nutrients of all preserved samples did not vary significantly from the control except for some fatty acids. The Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in fresh samples declined from 6. 72...|$|R
30|$|<b>Duplicate</b> <b>samples</b> were {{collected}} at 24 -h intervals, and biomass concentration {{was determined by}} measuring optical density at 683 nm, OD 683 [30], using a V- 1200 spectrophotometer (VWR International China Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). The relationship between OD 683 (y) and cell dry weight (x) of C. vulgaris and P. subcapitata was established by linear regression: y[*]=[*] 1.841 x(R 2 [*]=[*] 0.997) and y[*]=[*] 2.732 x(R 2 [*]=[*] 0.993), respectively.|$|R

Accuracy being measured as the percentage of recoveries after the acid digestion (ratio between values measured and certified in the reference material) was in the range of 90 – 110.|$|R
30|$|The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin {{components}} of the fiber have been determined through fiber analysis performed on <b>duplicate</b> <b>samples</b> of the raw cow feces and wheat straw separately for each batch of these substrates. Hemicellulose has been determined by subtracting the quantity of acid detergent fiber (ADF) from the quantity of neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Cellulose was determined by subtracting the quantity of acid detergent lignin (ADL) from the quantity of acid detergent fiber (ADF) (Bauer et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|A biuret {{method has}} been {{developed}} which provides quantitative measurements of protein in normal urine without interference from drugs or pigments. This method is intended for use in monitoring clinical trials of new drugs-to detect nephrotoxicity. Protein is precipitated from <b>duplicate</b> <b>samples</b> of urine by addition of cold ethanolic phosphotungstic acid. The protein precipitates are separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol. Protein {{from one of the}} <b>duplicate</b> <b>samples</b> is dissolvel in biuret reagent. Protein from the second sample is dissolved in an alkaline tartrate reagent which is identical to the biuret reagent, excepting that copper sulfate has been omitted. After 20 mm., the differential absorbance of the two samples is measured at 540 m. The limit of sensitivity for detection of protein in urine is 0. 5 mg. / 100 ml. The coefficient of variation of replicate analyses of protein in normal urine is 4. 2 %. The recovery of protein added to urine averages 103 ± 3 %. Analyses of urinary protein by the biuret procedure provide close correlation with measurements by an amido black staining method. Systematic search has failed to reveal interference from urinary pigments, compounds, or drugs which are normally or occasionally encountere...|$|R
