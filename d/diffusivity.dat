These field <b>diffusivities</b> were compared to theoretical <b>diffusivities</b> (assuming no interaction between the chemical vapour and ice surfaces) and effective <b>diffusivities</b> (assuming sorption of the chemical vapour to the ice surface). Theoretical <b>diffusivities</b> were the highest values and were in good agreement with the empirical <b>diffusivities</b> derived from the field data. This suggests that the test chemicals {{used in this study}} have a low affinity for the snow/ice surfaces during diffusion into the snow. Differences in calculated <b>diffusivities</b> between these compounds can be largely accounted for by their physical–chemical properties, notably their snow interfacial-air partition coefficients (Kia snow). However, using calculated values of Kia snow to describe sorption to the snow surfaces greatly reduced the effective <b>diffusivities</b> of the chemicals relative to the empirical field <b>diffusivities,</b> and calls into question the accuracy of Kia snow and/or its suitability for describing snow/air interactions at the relatively mild temperatures encountered in this study. Comparison of <b>diffusivities</b> between fresh and aged snow revealed similar values (within the same order of magnitude) and may be due to similar porosities between the snow types, although this parameter was not measured. Mass transfer coefficients {{were determined}} using the empirical field <b>diffusivities</b> and depth of the snow-layer, allowing chemical fluxes from snow to air to be calculated through use of the Whitman two-film resistance model. Using derived fluxes the chemical half-lives (t 1 / 2) in fresh snow were calculated assuming that snow metamorphosis did not occur. The half-lives were in good agreement to half-lives measured in a separate field study for POPs, and serve to validate the empirical <b>diffusivities</b> measured in this study...|$|R

Self-diffusion in {{magnetron}} sputtered nanocrystalline Fe films {{was investigated}} by neutron reflectometry on [natFe(10 nm) / 57 Fe(5 nm) ] 20 isotope multilayers between 310 and 510 °C. The determined <b>diffusivities</b> corresponding to diffusion length between 0. 8 – 2. 1 nm are time dependent and decrease {{by more than}} two orders of magnitude during isothermal annealing. This behaviour can be attributed due to the annihilation of frozen-in point defects, formed during sputtering. For very long annealing times of more than 8 days the <b>diffusivities</b> above 400 °C are in good accordance with the volume <b>diffusivities</b> on single crystals given in the literature. However, at temperatures below 400 °C the <b>diffusivities</b> are higher than extrapolated literature data, indicating that defect annihilation is still an ongoing process.

The water migration fluxes and moisture <b>diffusivities</b> were higher in xylitol plasticized films compared to the glycerol plasticized ones. For low plasticizer concentrations, the presence of both the plasticizers competitively reduced the effective moisture <b>diffusivities</b> and moisture migration fluxes due to antiplasticization. However, at higher plasticizer contents (at and above 15 wt%), the presence of multiple plasticizers enhanced the moisture migration fluxes and effective moisture <b>diffusivities</b> due to synergistic plasticization.

25|$|Diffusion is the {{movement}} of molecules or ions in a medium {{when there is no}} gross mass flow of the medium, and can occur in gases, liquids or solids, or any combination. Diffusion is driven by the kinetic energy of the diffusing molecules – it is faster in gases and slower in solids when compared with liquids due to the variation in distance between collisions, and diffusion is faster when the temperature is higher as the average energy of the molecules is greater.

40|$|International audienceAn {{approach}} for computing Fick <b>diffusivities</b> directly from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is presented and demonstrated for a ternary chloroform-acetone-methanol liquid mixture. In our approach, Fick <b>diffusivities</b> are {{calculated from the}} Maxwell-Stefan (MS) <b>diffusivities</b> and the so-called matrix of thermodynamic factors. MS <b>diffusivities</b> describe the friction between different molecular species and can be directly computed from MD simulations. The thermodynamic factor describes the deviation from ideal mixing behavior and is difficult to extract from both experiments and simulations. Here, we show that the thermodynamic factor in ternary systems {{can be obtained from}} density fluctuations in small subsystems embedded in a larger simulation box. Since the computation uses the Kirkwood-Buff coefficients, the present approach provides a general route toward the thermodynamics of the mixture. In experiments, Fick diffusion coefficients are measured, while previously equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation only provided MS transport <b>diffusivities.</b> Our approach provides an efficient and accurate route to predict multicomponent diffusion coefficients in liquids based on a consistent molecular picture and therefore bridges the gap between theory and experiment...|$|R
25|$|Three of {{the four}} probes have tiny heating {{elements}} and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring {{the rate at which}} the heat is dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles sense when the heat pulse arrives. The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal <b>diffusivity</b> (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E
25|$|Nabarro–Herring creep is {{strongly}} temperature dependent. For lattice diffusion of atoms {{to occur in}} a material, neighboring lattice sites or interstitial sites in the crystal structure must be free. A given atom must also overcome the energy barrier to move from its current site (it lies in an energetically favorable potential well) to the nearby vacant site (another potential well). The general form of the diffusion equation is D = D0exp(E/KT) where D0 has a dependence on both the attempted jump frequency {{and the number of}} nearest neighbor sites and the probability of the sites being vacant. Thus there is a double dependence upon temperature. At higher temperatures the <b>diffusivity</b> increases due to the direct temperature dependence of the equation, the increase in vacancies through Schottky defect formation, and an increase in the average energy of atoms in the material. Nabarro–Herring creep dominates at very high temperatures relative to a material's melting temperature.|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{properties}} of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. Snow and ice have much lower thermal diffusivities than air. Thermal <b>diffusivity</b> {{is a measure}} of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. Snow and ice are many orders of magnitude less efficient at diffusing heat than air. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the hydrological cycle. In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.|$|E
