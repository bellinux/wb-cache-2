50|$|Every file on a Files-11 disk (or volume set) has {{a unique}} <b>file</b> <b>identification</b> (FID), {{composed}} of three numbers: the file number (NUM), the file sequence number (SEQ), and the relative volume number (RVN). The NUM indicates where in the INDEXF.SYS file (see below) the metadata for the file is located; the SEQ is a generation number which incremented when the file is deleted and another file is created reusing the same INDEXF.SYS entry (so any dangling references to the old file do not accidentally point to the new one); and the RVN indicates the volume number on which the file is stored when using a volume set.|$|E
50|$|Files {{are divided}} in full chunks of 9,728,000 bytes (9500 KiB) plus a {{remainder}} chunk, {{and a separate}} 128-bit MD4 checksum is computed for each. That way, if a transmission error is detected, only one chunk is corrupted instead of the whole file. Furthermore, valid downloaded chunks are available for sharing {{before the rest of}} the file is downloaded, speeding up the distribution of large files throughout the network.A file's identification checksum is computed by concatenating the chunks' MD4 checksums in order and hashing the result. In cryptographic terms, the list of MD4 checksums is a hash list, and the <b>file</b> <b>identification</b> checksum is the root hash, also called top hash or master hash.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common type}} of <b>file</b> <b>identification</b> is the filename. Implementing a file naming {{protocol}} is essential to maintaining consistency and efficient discovery and retrieval of objects in a collection, and is especially applicable during digitization of analog media. Using a file naming convention, such as the 8.3 filename, will ensure compatibility with other systems and facilitate migration of data, and deciding between descriptive (containing descriptive words and numbers) and non-descriptive (often randomly generated numbers) file names is generally determined by the {{size and scope of}} a given collection. However, filenames are not good for semantic identification, because they are non-permanent labels for a specific location on a system and can be modified without affecting the bit-level profile of a digital file.|$|E

50|$|Other <b>file</b> <b>identification</b> types exist: for example, MIME {{types are}} used for {{identifying}} data that is transferred over the web.

For instance, the public.jpeg and public.png UTIs inherit from the public.image UTI, allowing users to search narrowly for JPEG images or PNG images or broadly {{for any kind of}} image merely by changing the specificity of the UTI used in the search. Further, application developers who design new data types can easily extend the UTIs available. For example, a new image format developed by a company may have a UTI of com.company.proprietary-image and be specified to inherit from the public.image type.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Proton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive measurement technique which provides information about concentrations of up to 20 metabolites participating in intracellular biochemical processes. In order to obtain any metabolic information from measured spectra a processing {{should be done in}} specialized software, like jMRUI. The processing is interactive and complex and often requires many trials before obtaining a correct result. This paper proposes a jMRUI enhancement for efficient and unambiguous history tracking and <b>file</b> <b>identification.</b> Results A database storing all processing steps, parameters and files used in processing was developed for jMRUI. The solution was developed in Java, authors used a SQL database for robust storage of parameters and SHA- 256 hash code for unambiguous <b>file</b> <b>identification.</b> The developed system was integrated directly in jMRUI and it will be publically available. A graphical user interface was implemented {{in order to make the}} user experience more comfortable. The database operation is invisible from the point of view of the common user, all tracking operations are performed in the background. Conclusions The implemented jMRUI database is a tool that can significantly help the user to track the processing history performed on data in jMRUI. The created tool is oriented to be user-friendly, robust and easy to use. The database GUI allows the user to browse the whole processing history of a selected file and learn e. g. what processing lead to the results, where the original data are stored, to obtain the list of all processing actions performed on spectra...|$|E
