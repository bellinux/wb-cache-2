25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections <b>in</b> <b>English</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spanish.</b> A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an ethnobotany (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the past half century) is part of their legacy.|$|E
