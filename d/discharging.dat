The sequence of coal <b>discharge</b> can be categorized as sequential coal <b>discharge</b> and alternated coal <b>discharge.</b> The times of coal <b>discharge</b> at each <b>discharge</b> window can be categorized as single, double and multiple coal <b>discharges.</b> The number of coal <b>discharge</b> window opened in the same time can be categorized as single window <b>discharge</b> and multiple window <b>discharge.</b> The number of simultaneously opened <b>discharge</b> window can be categorized as single coal <b>discharge</b> and multiple coal <b>discharge.</b> The quantity of coal <b>discharge</b> can be categorized as equal quantity and non-equal quantity.
