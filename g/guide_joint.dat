In this paper, the relative deformation of guide interface was analyzed based on Hertz theory and normal contact stiffness of <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> was calculated first. Then, the vibration model of linear rolling <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> was performed. The kinetic energy and potential energy of carriage-rail system was derived. Based on Lagrange’s approach, motion equilibrium equations of different vibration modes were derived. At last, vibration test was designed to get natural frequencies and mode shapes of the carriage. The natural frequencies agreed well with the values calculated by analytical approach. The research results provided a theoretical foundation for obtaining vibration characteristics parameters of linear rolling <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> and a reliable way for analysis of the dynamic characteristics of similar machine joints...|$|E

A potential drawback of ultrasound-guided arthrography is the limited view of the whole joint and potential communications with neighbouring structures during injection.|$|R

Materials and Methods: This study involved 2 patients with TMJ pain and mandibular motion dysfunction. Axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the TMJ was obtained and loaded into an intra-operative navigation system to <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> space injection. With a navigated syringe, 1 mL synvisc Hylan G-F 20 was directly injected into the superior and inferior joint spaces under navigation guidance. Results: With the assistance of an intraoperative navigational system, the TMJ MRI images were visualized in 3 dimensions and enabled guiding a needle into the superior and inferior joint spaces for therapeutic injection. The treatment outcome for both patients was satisfactory with improvement in pain score and mandibular motion. Conclusions: A protocol for image-guided minimally invasive surgical access to the TMJ was established.

Although {{it is clear that}} regulatory genes <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> formation, the mechanisms that are responsible for morphogenesis of the knee are poorly understood.

Through imaging developing cartilage, tendons, ligaments and muscle across developmental stages from HH 28 – 34 we have built 3 D representations of the forming structure including the various components important in knee formation. We describe the timing of muscle and tendon development in parallel with the refinement of cartilage shape, showing when and where (tendon attachment points) muscle forces are applied to the cartilage elements. Shape begins to emerge as the tendons are forming (HH 30 – 32) but is fully refined (HH 34) in the presence of tendons.

Finally, we solve the scene radiance using the atmosphere attenuation mod-el. Compared with exiting state of the art dehazing methods, our method could get a better dehazing ef-fect at distant scene and places where depth changes abruptly. Our method is fast with linear complexity in the number of pixels of the input image, furthermore, as our method can be performed in parallel, thus, it can be further accelerated using GPU, which makes our method applicable for real-time requirement...|$|R
40|$|Independent firms may be {{interested}} in collaborative alliances in order to reduce their costs and risks, among others benefits. Particularly in operations, different firms can gain from economies of scale by pooling their production resources. Even though there may be a significant reduction of the overall cost, the success of the partnership may generally depend on the fairness of the agreement. With this in mind, the firms can utilize transfer payments with the aim to achieve a balanced allocation of benefits. The implementation of such payments, however, could be difficult in practice, {{because of the presence of}} legal constraints or additional contracts that make such agreements more complicated. Therefore, the partners should jointly plan operations as to deal with the trade-off between the efficiency and the fairness. We propose a novel methodology to <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> operations based on the Rawls’ theory of justice, such that we prioritize improving the firm that tends to benefit less from the collaboration. When comparing the quality of such approach with other notions of fairness, we pay particular attention to the effect of the uncertainty on the collaboration. We prove that agreements based on basic notions of fairness have a positive impact on the risk reduction of the firms. Furthermore, our numerical results show that the firms can reduce even more their risk when the agreement is based on more advanced notions of fairness. In particular, our proposed methodology outperforms other approaches of collaboration in terms of risk, while the efficiency is not significantly damaged...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of firms {{worldwide}} causes that relationships in supply chains become more complex, the competition between firms become stronger and customer ask for more demanding products and services. All these changes trigger that a firm looks for opportunities to get more from their scarce resources or to use resources that are beyond its direct control. Thus, a firm can achieve competitive advantages by setting partnerships with other supply chains {{in order to increase}} its production capacity, by adapting its operations and pricing strategies to the requirements of the market, and by differentiating between customers according to necessities and willingness to pay for its offered products. We start by studying how firms with similar supply chain roles can collaborate in their operations. Through this collaboration, the firms can mutually benefit from the synergies of pooling operations. A successful collaboration should be efficient in reducing the global cost of the firms. Nevertheless, the willingness of each firm to collaborate may also depend on the fairness of the global cost allocation. In order to <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> operations, we propose a novel approach that gives priority to the firm that tends to benefit less from the collaboration. In particular, our approach balances the global cost reduction and the inequalities of allocating such cost. Moreover, when analyzing the effect of the uncertainty on the collaboration, our approach shows a high efficiency in reducing risk in comparison to other approaches. We continue by studying how a firm can coordinate its pricing strategy and production and inventory decisions in order to compete with other firms in terms of the prices offered to the customers. We propose a framework for simultaneously planning prices and operations of a firm. We model the operations of the firms as a Lot sizing problem, so computing equilibrium between the prices becomes a time demanding task. We reduce significantly the computational time by providing bounds for the profits that firms can achieve by selecting a pricing strategy. Also, we show the convenience for the firms of using dynamic pricing strategy instead of static pricing strategy, and we show the negative effects that may arise when increasing production capacities. We also study how a firm can gain from differentiating the demand of their customers based on profits and manufacturing requirements. Our study is motivated by the case of a firm that faces two types of demand: on the one hand there are the socalled regular orders that have a relatively long lead time; on the other hand there are urgent orders, whose delay is much shorter but their margins are higher. We study the order acceptance problem for a firm that serves two classes of demand over an infinite horizon. The firm has to decide whether to accept a regular order (or equivalently how much capacity to set aside for urgent orders) in order to maximize its profit. We formulate this problem as a multi-dimensional Markovian Decision Process. We propose a family of approximate formulations to reduce the dimension of the state space via aggregation. We show how our approach can be used to compute bounds on the profit associated with the optimal order acceptance policy. Finally, we show that the value of revenue management is commensurate with the operational flexibility of the firm. (ECGE - Sciences économiques et de gestion) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

METHOD: Six healthy participants performed the JPBA under three test conditions (uninformed, informed, completely <b>guided</b> <b>joint</b> protection behavior). The 18 test performances were videotaped and scored by nine independent raters. RESULTS: Analysis of these data showed that interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) was. 90 or higher, and intrarater reliability was. 95 or higher (ICC). The correlation between the JPBA and its two shortened versions was. 95 or higher (ICC). Internal consistency was also high, with a coefficient alpha of 0. 95 for the complete JPBA.

Some improvements in the test manual suggested by the present study may further improve the measure.
