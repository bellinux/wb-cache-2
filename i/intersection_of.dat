More generally, the <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> a family of convex sets is a convex set. In particular, the <b>intersection</b> <b>of</b> two disjoint sets is the empty set, which is convex.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that theta characteristics on smooth plane curves over {{a field of}} characteristic different from two are in bijection with certain smooth complete <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> three quadrics. We generalize this bijection to possibly singular hypersurfaces of any dimension over arbitrary fields including those of characteristic two. It is accomplished in terms of linear orbits of tuples of symmetric matrices instead <b>of</b> smooth complete <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> quadrics. As an application of our methods, we give {{a description of the}} projective automorphism groups <b>of</b> complete <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> quadrics generalizing Beauville's results.

40|$|We give a new {{algorithm}} {{for learning}} <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> halfspaces with a margin, i. e. {{under the assumption}} that no example lies too close to any separating hyperplane. Our algorithm combines random projection techniques for dimensionality reduction, polynomial threshold function constructions, and kernel methods. The algorithm is fast and simple. It learns a broader class of functions and achieves an exponential runtime improvement compared with previous work on learning <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> halfspaces with a margin. Key words: computational learning theory, <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> halfspaces, margin, polynomial threshold function, random projection, kernel Perceptron. ∗ Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion with}} <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> {{relativistic}} gravitating shells in the Schwarzschild gravitational field {{of a central}} body is considered. Formulas are derived for calculating parameters of the shells after intersection via their parameters before intersection. Such special cases as the Newtonian approximation, <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> light shells, and <b>intersections</b> <b>of</b> a test shell with a gravitating shell are also considered. The ejection {{of one of the}} shells to infinity in the relativistic region is described. The equations of motion for the shells are analyzed numerically. Comment: 21 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
