5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
25|$|Old Trafford has a {{reputation}} for unpredictable weather. Old Trafford is the only ground in England where a Test match has been abandoned without a ball being bowled – and this <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> twice in 1890 and 1938, though before 5 day test matches were introduced. Before Cardiff hosted its first Test match in July 2009, Old Trafford was reputedly the wettest Test ground in the country; Manchester is situated {{to the west of the}} Pennines and faces prevailing winds and weather fronts from the Atlantic.|$|E
2500|$|The Memphis Album {{received}} many favourable reviews. Terry Reilly of The West Australian said, [...] "To Memphis buffs these songs are the Holy Grail and outsiders {{such as the}} Malaysian-born Sebastian are not welcome. But even the hardest followers of songs caked in Memphis mud should bow generously to the subtleties in band performance and the singer's deft use of falsetto and depth of feeling." [...] Bryan Patterson from the Herald Sun wrote, [...] "Even the true Memphis buffs are crowing about Guy Sebastian's excellent work on such songs as Soul Man, Hold On, I'm Comin', In the Midnight Hour and (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay, accompanied {{by many of the}} revered musicians who played on the originals. Sebastian nails the tunes. He's respectful yet unafraid to inject them with a joyous individuality." [...] In a review on Allmusic, Laurie Mercer said although Sebastian was unable to capture the [...] "nebulous vibe" [...] of the original versions, what he [...] "brings to the table is a wonderful voice, heartfelt respect, and skillful presentation. His range, style, and tone are all remarkable, and his technique so polished that it could be argued (at the risk of being blasphemous) that he occasionally improves on the original recordings". Ian Cuthbertson, a Weekend Australian reviewer wrote, [...] "But some kind of alchemy <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> he has lifted his bar to match the talent around him, pulling astonishing, authentic soul performances out of the depths. While his vocal performances are technically amazing, more impressively he has absolutely nailed the rhythm and spirit of the material." ...|$|E
5000|$|Three major {{excavation}} works <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> {{through the}} last century: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the {{surrounding}} regions {{are filled with}} the noise of late wonders that <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here!</b> You didn't hear of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly; well, things <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> To be brief, I {{mean that}} a lot of silly women have got up a scandal about them--no, scandal is too strong a word--gossip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vaya con Dios, and {{the good}} saints send you happiness! I think we neither of us forget what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> Don Ilton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God for that," [...] Mrs. Dormay said earnestly, and Ciceley gave {{an exclamation}} of pleasure. [...] "That accounts, then, for what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{expedient}} seems a favourite {{one with}} you," [...] said Jessie. [...] "I suppose no news of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> can have reached him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You may go now,” he said. “A {{dynamite}} outrage must be provoked. I {{give you}} a month. The sittings of the Conference are suspended. Before it reassembles again something must <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> or your connection with us ceases.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Junius turned {{slightly}} pale, {{and addressing}} Mr Croft, said: [...] "Something very strange must <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here!</b> Miss March is ill, and Mr Brandon {{has gone to}} a place to which I think nothing but {{a matter of the}} utmost importance could take him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't let's {{talk about}} it," [...] cried Dave, before Roger could speak. He {{did not wish}} the Mrs. Breen affair to become public property. [...] "Tell us about the wild man, {{and all the other}} things that <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> since we went away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you will, lad, as you will. Explain to Colonel Ethan Allen what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> {{and let him}} say {{how these}} venomous snakes are to be treated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I {{have heard}} steps," [...] said Mrs. Royer, [...] "and wailing--wailing. No wonder {{after all that}} <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> Oh yes, steps as of the guard being turned out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so glad!" [...] {{said the}} lady. [...] "I didn't know but {{she might be}} at church. What in the world <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here?</b> Is there {{anything}} unusual going on inside?" ...|$|E
50|$|Like most of {{the places}} in Malabar, Edavanna is also a football-crazy land. Edavanna has a lovely full fledged stadium called Seethi Haji Stadium. It is named after famous {{politician}} Hon.Seethi Haji. The stadium is owned by a Club called Juvanile Sports Club. Many state and national level Football tournaments <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Very. I {{was most}} kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I {{received}} any letter from Mansfield, {{to tell me}} how you were all going on, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long enough." ...|$|R
50|$|Antiochus the Great transported 2,000 Jewish {{families}} to Phrygia from Babylonia. Many of Laodicea's inhabitants were Jews, and Cicero records that Flaccus confiscated the considerable sum of 9 kg of gold which was being sent annually to Jerusalem for the Temple (Pro Flacco 28-68). The martyrdom of Lulianos and Paphos {{is believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Key {{looked at}} his {{changing}} face. [...] "Tell me," [...] he said gently, [...] "if it does not tax your strength, all that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> all you know. It is for HER sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{often takes}} place {{between me and}} my mother, but which I am sorry now <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> for I like this place, and should like to come often. A row is a quarrel.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope, Towlinson,' says Miss Tox, who, in her {{instruction}} of the Toodle family, has acquired an admonitorial tone, and {{a habit of}} improving passing occasions, 'that what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> will be a warning to you, Towlinson.' ...|$|E
50|$|For having playfully {{closed the}} eyes of Lord Shiva for three seconds and thus darkening the world he cursed his consort Parvati to be borne in the world thrice (Icha Sakthi, Gnana Sakthi and Kriya Sakthi) after which he will appear and marry her again. This is {{the story behind the}} three temples. The divine wedding is also {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two railway {{accidents}} <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> both involving runaway {{china clay}} trains. On the first occasion a train had left Burngullow with wagons for Par harbour on 29 October 1872. It {{was unable to}} stop for signals at St Austell but {{the driver of the}} passenger train coming in the other direction saw the train sliding towards it and reversed his train back to Par.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{very tough}} slope on NH 47 58 km from Trivandrum and 13 km from Kollam. The Bridges & Highways {{authority}} have studied & reported this area as a [...] "Dangerous Zone." [...] Several road accidents <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> with deaths and injuries. Some ideas and plans to modify this heavily sloped road have been suggested, but no changes have been made.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> to-day. Van's marked {{retreat and}} how, {{with the time}} that has passed, it makes us at last know where we are. You of course for yourself," [...] Mrs. Brook wound up, [...] "see that." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE GENERAL. But, my dear Lesbia, you {{see what}} <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> to-day. [Coming a little nearer and bending his face towards hers] Now I put it to you, does it not show you the folly of not marrying? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{are just}} as angry. Of course, the news of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> was sent off to them at once, and has brought them back again. I trust that it reached them before they came upon Oswald's party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I refer. You {{know what}} I'm talking about. What <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here</b> since I left? The place is {{positively}} stiff with happy endings." ...|$|R
50|$|Basheerbagh was {{a sports}} hub and the {{multipurpose}} L.B Stadium {{which is used}} for football and athletics is located here. It was previously called as Fateh Maidan, because the handing over of Hyderabad to the Indian Army <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> Earlier {{it was used to}} host international cricket matches. An indoor stadium is also present here used for Badminton and Tennis. Presently they are not used much and Gachibowli has become the sports hub of the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Gessler, {{when the}} drying was done, and Friesshardt's tears had ceased, [...] "what <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here?</b> I heard {{a cry of}} 'Help!' as I came up. Who cried 'Help!'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was weak}} and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now {{you take me}} out. The parting {{interview}} has overpowered me. Such a thing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here,</b> often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands. Quick! Call assistance!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By my hand, friend Woodcock," [...] {{said the}} page, [...] "though I know {{you for a}} hardy gospeller, that fear neither saint nor devil, yet, if I were you, I would not sing your profane songs in this valley of Glendearg, {{considering}} what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> before our time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] she asserted, bitterly. [...] "I {{mean just}} that. So saddle up and pull out. All I ask {{of you is}} to say nothing about what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> You'd better leave the state. If Wayland should get worse it might go hard with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And some idle people, perfect {{strangers to}} us, {{are trying to}} trace a {{connexion}} between what happened at our house in Yorkshire and what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> since, <b>here</b> in London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} glad, sir, {{if you will}} tell us what <b>has</b> been <b>happening</b> <b>here.</b> All {{we know is that}} the fort of Coomassie is surrounded, and that we have come up to relieve it." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1989, he entered a {{contract}} stand off with Kings GM Rogie Vachon before a deal was reached during the pre-season. [...] "You know, I went through a holdout with the Islanders in '86, and that was terrible. I was out for 23 days {{and it became a}} bitter thing. That's something that I didn't want to <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> <b>here.</b> I told you that I was looking at other teams this summer. My agent was, really. My heart was right here," [...] said Tonelli.|$|R
