40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multiphase}} level set algorithm for solving the minimal partition problem for image segmentation. Our {{starting point is}} the piecewiseconstant Mumford-Shah model for segmentation. The proposed method can also {{be viewed as an}} extension and generalization of an active contour model without <b>edges</b> <b>based</b> on a 2 -phase segmentation, developed by us earlier (Chan and Vese, 1999). Our multiphase level set formulation is new and of interest on its own: by construction, it automatically avoids the problems of vacuum and overlap; it needs only log n level set functions for n phases; it can represent boundaries with complex topologies, including triple junctions.

50|$|One way {{to reduce}} the effects of {{extinction}} is to use grouping of items. Brightness and <b>edge</b> <b>based</b> grouping reduces visual extinction and they act in an additive way.
