Parameters Rtot, L, C and G may be calculated from geometric dimensions of the coaxial cable (inner conductor diameter D, thickness dIns. of the polyurethane insulation and depoxy for the epoxy outer conductor), and material properties such as the dielectric constant Ins. of the polyurethane insulation and the conductivity σCu, σepoxy, σIns. of inner conductor, outer conductor and the insulator, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Recently, inkjet {{printing}} technology has received growing attention {{as a method}} to produce low-cost large-area electronics, sensors, and antennas on polymer substrates. This technology relies on printing techniques to deposit electrically functional materials onto polymer substrates to fabricate <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> or sensing <b>elements.</b> In this paper, we applied an inkjet printed technology for the development and characterization of films on a polymer substrate aiming at giving design considerations for the optimization of strain sensors or printed electronics obtained by {{inkjet printing}}. Two inks were tested over a polyimide substrate, a water-based conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, and a silver nanoparticles ink. Their sensing capabilities were investigated under tensile conditions and various strain histories (strain ramp; cyclic loading-unloading tests; application of constant strain over prolonged time) aiming at highlighting the correlation between electrical response, applied strain, time and mechanical histories. Furthermore, the mechanical viscoelastic response of the substrate was investigated under similar strain histories interpreting the results at {{the light of the}} substrate deformational characteristics and evaluating its influence.

30|$|Neither {{electronic}} nor mechanical structures {{fit well}} with the body. They are not typically designed to be used on moving, unprotected and unstable “surfaces” that include elements such as skin and muscle structures that move. While this is changing, {{with the advent of}} new, flexible materials, mechanical and electric engineers typically undertake explorations and tests on a bench in a lab, because <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> and the <b>elements</b> of mechanical structures tend to be well suited to being fixed to hard surfaces and worked on in a stable environment. Prototyping and testing electronics directly on the body thus can be difficult. Doing so in context brings further challenges. In the case of Open Up, for example, the programing and material explorations were done on a table in a lab. The “body” used (the table), was static and horizontal and the context (the lab), an enclosed area with people walking around. If the designers wanted to use another body or context, they would have to imagine them from the ground up. However, without leaving the lab, they {{would not be able to}} decontextualize themselves from the lab. The lab, therefore will have an impact on the creative process.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} resonant Raman scattering {{within the framework of}} a localized model. Expressions for the scattering amplitude and cross section are derived by employing the methods of spherical-tensor analysis. a simple factorization is obtained for the geometrical (angular dependence) and <b>electronic</b> (matrix <b>element)</b> <b>components,</b> which can therefore be studied independently. Photon polarization effects are examined. It is shown that, for fast collisions, the integrated intensity is expressible by way of spin and orbital effective operators, thus allowing for a simple interpretation of the scattering process. For the 2 p [...] > 4 f, 3 d [...] > 2 p resonance in Gd 3 +, Dy 3 +, Ho 3 + and Er 3 +, numerical calculations of the cross section are discussed. In the case gadolinium, the agreement between calculations and experiments provides further evidence for the quadrupolar nature of certain spectral features...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. A {{method for}} {{diagnosing}} <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> with minimally complicated control and measuring instrumentation {{and the ability}} to obtain information from internal control points of operating units is developed. Methods. The developed method for control of groups of <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> presupposes the passage of a controllable influence through a few control points, connected via several <b>electronic</b> <b>components.</b> In addition, each <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> contributes its share to the transformation of the parameter output, so the discrepancy of its allowable values for the identification of defective <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> are required to assess the implication of the expected value of the probable defect of each <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> in the schema with the aim of isolating it. The faulty <b>component</b> in the <b>electronic</b> circuit is identified by the minimum estimated variance, by which the magnitude of the defect will match the expected value of the <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> parameter. Results. As a result of the control no more than ten groups of electrical components on functional cell matrices can be assessed as having a defective element by comparing the calculated variance values for each electrical component and the corresponding electrical component parameter itself. Conclusion. Diagnosing groups of electric components on transient characteristics for the detection of defects in the functional cell matrices enables efficiency control operations improvement and troubleshooting in the search for modern electronic equipment reliability.  </p...|$|R
