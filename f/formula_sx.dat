40|$|A {{few days}} ago I saw the paper [4]. I think I can make some {{additional}} remarks {{that might not be}} totally useless for the Fibonacci Community! Let (an) be a given sequence and sn = S^= 0 (?J^. Denoting the respective (ordinary) generating functions by A(x) and S(x), the paper in question mainly deals with the consequences of the formula Knuth [7] has introduced the binomial transform by and it is clear that this is the situation from above. But Philippe Flajolet and the present writer agreed about ten years ago that there are just exponential generating functions hidden! They have a convolution formula and upon choosing the hk's to be equal to 1, we have the old situation. So, denoting the exponential generating functions by A(x) mdS(x), we have the even simpler <b>formula</b> <b>S(x)</b> = e x A(x). This can readily be inverted as A(x) = e x S(x), whence These facts about exponential generating functions are of course folklore; one particular reference is [3]. Flajolet & Richmond [2], Schmid [8], and Kirschenhofer & Prodinger [6] all made heavy use of (1). Schmid observed (among other writers) that an exponential generating function will be transformed into an ordinary generating function by the Bore I transform. Now the generalization translates into Since S(x) = e bx A(cx). A(x) = e-i x S[± 412 [NOV.

40|$|An {{automatic}} {{analysis method}} for first-order logic with sets and relations is described. A first-order formula is translated to a quantifier-free boolean formula, {{which has a}} model when the original formula has a model within a given scope (that is, involving no more than some finite number of atoms). Because the satisfiable formulas that occur in practice tend to have small models, a small scope usually suffices and the analysis is efficient. The paper presents a simple logic and gives a compositional translation scheme. It also reports briefly on experience using the Alloy Analyzer, a tool that implements the scheme. Keywords First-order logic; relational logic; Z specification; object models; automatic analysis; model finding; constraint solvers; SAT solvers. 1 Introduction Relational logic adds to first-order logic the ability to combine predicates with special operators. For example, we can write the <b>formula</b> #x,y. <b>S(x)</b> #R(x,y) # T(y) as S. R in T, where S. R denotes the image of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the current work is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of isoelectronic substitution (IS) principle on a series of complexes with general <b>formula</b> OsCl 2 (<b>SX</b> 3 H 3) (PH 3) 2, where X 3 represents the moieties CCC, CCB, CCN, CBN, CNB or NCB, formed by substitution of the carbon atoms in CCC by either the isoelectronic B- or N+ separately, or by both. The SX 3 H 3 moiety forms, together with Os, an aromatic five-membered ring (5 -MR) called osmathiophene. The preservation of stability and aromaticity in the resulting systems is used to indicate the effectiveness of the IS principle. The aromaticity of the proposed molecules is analyzed according to magnetic (induced magnetic field (Bind)) and electronic (through the multicenter index (MCI)) criteria. Besides, a chemical bonding analysis on selected species is performed by the adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP) metho...|$|R
