5000|$|Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) - SCAT is {{an active}} {{microwave}} device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It {{will be used to}} determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual <b>feed</b> <b>assembly</b> to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer {{is an active}} microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90° and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 84) The {{purpose of}} this study is to investigate the radiation pattern distribution produced by scattering from an electrically intermediate sized parabolic reflector antenna. This investigation has been prompted by the fact that very little has been written on pattern prediction for this size class of antennas. Three methods are employed for the actual numerical calculation of the patterns. These methods are compared by considering the deviations from existing radiation patterns obtained experimentally. Two methods are based on a prior knowledge of the field distribution over the aperture; the scattered field in the far zone being expressible in terms of the integrals of the field vectors over the aperture surface. This is known in the literature as the aperture-field method. The problem is first attacked by assuming a uniformly illuminated circular aperture. Secondly, the aperture fields are modified in accordance with the natural or "space" tapering of these fields due to the parabolic reflector. The third method, termed as the induced surface current method, computes scattered fields by integration of surface currents induced on the reflector by known incident fields from sources located at the focus of the parabola. Due to the complexity of the integrands generated by the latter two techniques, it was necessary to numerically integrate the expressions to arrive at the far zone field values. Included in all three models is the effects of aperture blockage due to the <b>feed</b> <b>assembly.</b> All the techniques employ the assumption of a "point source" feed; the simplest case being the superposition of electric and magnetic dipoles forming a "Huygen's source" illumination. These three methods and their implementation comprise Sections 2. 0 and 3. 0. In Section 4. 0 the accuracy achieved by these methods is compared to measured data.

We have obtained 1, 626, 969 reads by pyrosequencing a salivary gland cDNA library from adult females Amblyomma maculatum ticks {{at different times of}} <b>feeding.</b> <b>Assembly</b> of this data produced 72, 441 sequences larger than 149 nucleotides from which 15, 914 coding sequences were extracted. Of these, 5, 353 had > 75 % coverage to their best match in the non-redundant database from the National Center for Biotechnology information, allowing for the deposition of 4, 850 sequences to GenBank. The annotated data sets are available as hyperlinked spreadsheets. Putative secreted proteins were classified in 133 families, most of which have no known function. This data set of proteins constitutes a mining platform for novel pharmacologically active proteins and for uncovering vaccine targets against A. maculatum and the diseases they carry...|$|R
50|$|Because the M2 was {{intentionally}} {{designed to}} operate in many configurations, it {{can be adapted to}} feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch. The operator must also convert the top-cover belt <b>feed</b> slide <b>assembly</b> from left to right hand feed as well as the spring and plunger in the feed arm. This will take a well trained individual less than two minutes to perform.|$|R
40|$|Different {{aspects of}} {{assembly}} line optimization have been extensively studied. Part <b>feeding</b> at <b>assembly</b> lines, however, is quite an undeveloped area of research. This study {{focuses on the}} optimization of part <b>feeding</b> at mixed-model <b>assembly</b> lines {{with respect to the}} Just-In-Time principle motivated by a real situation encountered at one of the major automobile assembly plants in Spain. The study presents a mixed integer linear programming model and a novel simulated annealing algorithm-based heuristic {{to pave the way for}} the minimization of the number of tours as well as inventory level. In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm proposed and validate the mathematical model, a set of generated test problems and two real-life instances are solved. The solutions found by both the mathematical model and proposed algorithm are compared in terms of minimizing the number of tours and inventory levels, as well as a performance measure called workload variation. The results show that although the exact mathematical model had computational difficulty solving the problems, the proposed algorithm provides good solutions in a short computational time...|$|R
