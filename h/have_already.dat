5|$|Actuaries do {{not always}} attempt to predict {{aggregate}} future events. Often, their work may relate to determining the cost of financial liabilities that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> occurred, called retrospective reinsurance, or the development or re-pricing of new products.|$|E
5|$|Because {{almost all}} {{other species of}} amphidromine gastropods, such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, <b>have</b> <b>already</b> become extinct, the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, and this is why the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E

5|$|The West Kootenay, however, is {{transitioning}} from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and {{the rest}} of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is becoming increasingly reliant on tourism, and several Canadian national and state parks <b>have</b> <b>already</b> been established, and several national forests in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|Until {{then the}} village <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> many landlords. For {{lack of money}} - {{something}} similar <b>had</b> <b>already</b> happened earlier - the Emperor had pledged Dexheim in 1315 to the Archbishop of Mainz, redeeming it in 1353.|$|R

5|$|The ancestral {{function}} of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes.

5|$|The {{segment of}} SR85 between Buckeye and Gila Bend is a {{connector}} between I-8 and I-10, and serves {{both as a}} connector from I-8 from San Diego, California to Phoenix.

5|$|Viruses infect all {{cellular}} life and, although viruses occur universally, each cellular {{species has}} its own specific range that often infect only that species.

5|$|After {{shearing}} ewes {{are typically}} placed in well sheltered paddocks that have good feed and water. Attention to ewes that are lambing {{varies according to}} the breed, size and locations of properties. Unless they are stud ewes it unlikely that they will receive intensive care. On stations with large paddocks there is a policy of non-interference. On other properties the mobs are inspected by stockmen at varying intervals to stand cast ewes and deal with dystocia. Producers also sometimes quietly drift pregnant ewes away from ewes that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> lambed, {{in order to prevent}} mis-mothering.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Rodrigues is {{eventually}} taken {{to meet an}} older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and states that after 15 years {{in the country and}} a year in the temple, he believes Christianity is futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.|$|E
5|$|Age, {{cognitive}} growth, {{and continued}} social experience advance {{the development and}} complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver <b>have</b> <b>already</b> negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.|$|E

5|$|An Australian version {{titled the}} Adult Swim Meat Tray Collection was {{released}} on November 28, 2012; a Region 2 version of Adult Swim in a Box had been released a year earlier.

5|$|Apu {{refuses to}} help any further, so Bart takes {{it upon himself}} to foil Kang and Kodos' plan. He asks Krusty for help, but Krusty informs Bart that he has already helped the Duff Brewery set up free laser gun stands around Springfield. Bart then goes to his father, Homer, for help, and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery. However, the aliens escape, and before departing, they reveal that they <b>have</b> <b>already</b> {{released}} Buzz Cola throughout Springfield's water supply. As the cola seeps into the ground, it releases the undead from the Springfield Cemetery, who invade Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Extensive {{tests have}} been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are {{satisfied}} that the water will support fish life.

It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.|$|E
5|$|From 2017-18 onwards, the £9,000 fee cap {{will rise}} with inflation. Maintenance grants are also {{available}} to current students in England, although these are scheduled to cease with the 2016-17 academic year. Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016-17, when the maintenance grant system is phased out. There will be {{a vote in the}} autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017-18 year. Several universities <b>have</b> <b>already</b> advertised fees of £9,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing.|$|E
