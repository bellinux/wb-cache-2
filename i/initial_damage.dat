40|$|Mitotic {{compaction}} of chromatin {{was generated}} by treatment of cells with nocodazole. Alternatively, chromatin structure was altered by incubating cells in 500 mM NaCl. The irradiation {{response in the}} dose range of 1 - 10 Gy was measured by colony assay and by a modified fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU) assay which measures the amount of undamaged DNA by EtBr fluorescence. Cell survival curves of irradiated CHO-K 1 cells showed that treatment with nocodazole increases radiosensitivity as indicated by a decrease of the mean inactivation dose (D̄) from 4. 446 to 4. 376. Nocodazole treatment increased the <b>initial</b> radiation-induced DNA <b>damage</b> detected by the FADU assay from 7 % to 13 %. In repair-defective xrs 1 cells, the same conditions increased the radiosensitivity from D̄ 1. 209 to 0. 7836 and the <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> from 43 % to 57 %. Alterations to chromatin structure by hypertonic medium increased radiosensitivity in CHO-K 1 cells from D of 4. 446 to 3. 092 and the <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> from 7 % to 15 %. In xrs 1 cells these conditions caused radiosensitivity to decrease from D̄ 1. 209 to 1. 609 and the <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> to decrease from 43 % to 36 %. Disruption of chromatin structure by hypertonic treatment {{was found to be}} time-dependent. A threefold increase of exposure time to hypertonic medium from 40 to 120 min increased the <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> in CHO-K 1 cells from 7 % to 18 % but decreased <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> in xrs 1 cells from 43 % to 21 %. Perturbation of chromatin structure with hypertonic treatment has been shown to increase the radiosensitivity and the <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> in repair-competent CHO-K 1 cells and decrease the radiosensitivity and DNA damage in repair-defective xrs 1 cells. Hypertonic treatment thus abolishes differences in chromatin structure between cell lines and differences in <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> Radiosensitivity and <b>initial</b> DNA <b>damage</b> are correlated (r 2 = 0. 92; p= 0. 0026) and this correlation also holds when chromatin compaction is altered.

40|$|Synopsis: Both {{short and}} {{long-term}} performances of repaired or strengthened concrete structures using external FRP bonding are greatly affected by states of bonding substrates, which are covercrete and may have experienced various damages. One of them is frost damage in cold regions. This paper intends to investigate how the <b>initial</b> frost <b>damages</b> in concrete influence the static and fatigue bond performances of CFRP/concrete interfaces. Concrete specimens were exposed to freeze and thaw cycles before being bonded with CFRP sheets. The <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage</b> of concrete was controlled approximately at three different levels {{in terms of its}} relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, which was 100 % (non frost damage), 85 % and 70 %, respectively. Test results showed that failure modes of CFRP/concrete bonded joints with <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage</b> in concrete were the delamination of covercrete. By contrast the joints without <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage</b> failed in a thin concrete layer as usual. Moreover, CFRP/concrete joints with and without <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage</b> showed different manners in their interface bonding strength and stiffness. If the <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage</b> existed in concrete substrate the effective bond length of CFRP/concrete joints was increased due to the decrease of the bonding stiffness and interfacial fracture energy. Fatigue testing results indicated that the linear slopes of S-N curves of CFRP/concrete bonded joints were not influenced by the <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage.</b> The <b>initial</b> frost <b>damage</b> did not shorten the fatigue life of CFRP/concrete joints if a same relative tensile stress level was kept in the FRP sheets, where the relative tensile stress level was defined as a ratio of the applied tensile force in FRP sheets for the fatigue tests to the maximum static pullout one achieved in each test series...|$|R
5|$|A few {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued {{in anticipation of}} Fay's impact on Bermuda, and public schools were closed as a precaution. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100mph (155km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left {{a majority of the}} island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F.

5|$|After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another {{thunderstorm}} {{developed over}} Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40p.m. CST (00:40UTC). At 7:05p.m. CST (01:05UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Road, causing <b>initial</b> <b>damage</b> to a restaurant; the tornado's touchdown {{coincided with the}} appearance of a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and push out exterior walls. As a consequence, homes that faced the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly anchored to the homes' frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12p.m. CST (01:12UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The twister continued to track northeast, causing F2damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20p.m. CST (01:20UTC).|$|E

25|$|The {{heavy snow}} was {{accompanied}} by damaging wind gusts of near hurricane-force, which created snowdrifts of up to two stories high in some places. Widespread power outages were reported and some were left without power for up to ten days. The city of Montreal was left paralyzed following the storm for a few days. Bus service was stopped and snowmobiles were the easiest transportation option possible throughout the city while bridges and roads were completely shut down. For {{the first time in}} over 50 years a Montreal Canadiens National Hockey League game at the Montreal Forum was postponed. 17people were killed in Montreal while there were several other injuries related to the storm. Fatalities were resulted by heart attacks or people stuck inside stranded vehicles. At least 2people were killed in the Quebec City region and at least 30 fatalities were reported province-wide.

Retinoids and vitamins A, C, and E are probably the most well-known and studied natural radioprotectors, but hormones (e.g., melatonin), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and phytochemicals from plant extracts (including green tea and cruciferous vegetables), as well as metals (especially selenium, zinc, and copper salts) are also under study as dietary supplements for individuals, including astronauts, who have been overexposed to radiation. Antioxidants should provide reduced or no protection against the <b>initial</b> <b>damage</b> from densely ionizing radiation such as HZE nuclei, because the direct effect {{is more important than the}} free-radical-mediated indirect radiation damage at high LET. However, there is an expectation that some benefits should occur for persistent oxidative damage that is related to inflammation and immune responses. Some recent experiments suggest that, at least for acute high-dose irradiation, an efficient radioprotection by dietary supplements can be achieved, even in the case of exposure to high-LET radiation. Although there is evidence that dietary antioxidants (especially strawberries) can protect the CNS from the deleterious effects of high doses of HZE particles, because the mechanisms of biological effects are different at low dose-rates compared to those of acute irradiation, new studies for protracted exposures will be needed to understand the potential benefits of biological countermeasures.|$|E
