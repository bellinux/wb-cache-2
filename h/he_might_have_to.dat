5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson {{would have to be}} carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resort to a siege.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
25|$|Orwell had {{requested}} {{to be buried}} in accordance with the Anglican rite in the graveyard of the closest church to wherever he happened to die. The graveyards in central London had no space, and fearing that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be cremated against his wishes, his widow appealed to his friends to see whether any of them knew of a church with space in its graveyard.|$|E
50|$|The reason, or reasons, for Fromm's {{dealing with}} the conspirators are unclear: <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> wished <b>to</b> cover up {{potential}} allegations that he himself was involved; also, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> wished <b>to</b> spare his comrades a humiliating trial and possible torture. In any case, the executions did not save him.|$|R

They look out to sea and notice a large ship departing and a lighthouse shining, Mélisande foretells that it will sink. Night falls. Geneviève goes off to look after Yniold, Golaud's young son by his previous marriage. Pelléas attempts to take Melisande's hand to help her down the steep path but she refuses saying that she is holding flowers. He tells her <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go away tomorrow. Mélisande asks him why.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, FIDE {{changed the}} world {{championship}} rules so that a defeated champion would {{have the right to}} a return match. Yuri Averbakh alleged that this was done at the urging of the two Soviet representatives in FIDE, who were personal friends of Botvinnik. Averbakh also claims that Botvinnik's friends were behind FIDE's decision in 1956 {{to limit the number of}} players from the same country that could compete in the Candidates Tournament, and that this was to Botvinnik's advantage as it reduced the number of Soviet players <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> meet in the title match.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} announcement, there was {{reported}} panic buying of Marmite from supermarkets, and {{over one hundred}} auctions for jars of Marmite, new and used, were listed on online auction site TradeMe, with some sellers asking for up to NZ$800 per jar; over 185 times its usual retail price of around $4.25 per 250g jar People were advised to use the spread sparingly, with even Prime Minister John Key admitting <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> switch to Australian rival Vegemite once his personal supplies had run out. Throughout the shortage Marmite ran a number of marketing campaigns on social media {{which led to a}} 2,975% increase in fans and a lot of brand exposure.|$|E

25|$|Florent, of course, defeats {{the giant}} and {{immediately}} rides off {{to present the}} head to Marsabelle, explaining that the giant was unable to get {{the head of the}} King of France for her so he has brought his own instead! Then he tries to abduct her, but he is immediately set upon by all those in the castle, fights his way to safety and returns alone to Paris to a hero's welcome. Florent is knighted and the listener is treated to another comic scene as Clement worries that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay for the feast that the King of France and the Emperor of Rome have put on in Florent's honour. Yes, the Emperor of Rome, Florent's real father, has arrived in Paris to help life the siege.|$|E
25|$|The FIDE system {{followed}} its 1948 design {{through five}} cycles: 1948–51, 1951–54, 1954–57, 1957–60 and 1960–63. In 1956 FIDE introduced two apparently minor changes which Soviet grandmaster and chess official Yuri Averbakh alleged were instigated {{by the two}} Soviet representatives in FIDE, who were personal friends of reigning champion Mikhail Botvinnik. A defeated champion would {{have the right to}} a return match, a provision which enabled Botvinnik to regain his title from Vasily Smyslov in 1958 and from Mikhail Tal in 1961. FIDE also limited the number of players from the same country that could compete in the Candidates Tournament, {{on the grounds that it}} would reduce Soviet dominance of the tournament. Averbakh claimed that this was to Botvinnik's advantage as it reduced the number of Soviet players <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> meet in the title match.|$|E
25|$|It {{would take}} another sixteen years before another player, Bernie Geoffrion, managed to score 50 {{goals in a}} single season, also while playing for Montreal. When Bobby Hull finally managed to break the season record with 54 goals in 1966, fans of the then-retired Canadiens legend, noting that Hull was playing in a 70-game schedule, demanded that the NHL {{continue}} to recognize Richard's record (similar to what Major League Baseball initially did with Babe Ruth's single-season home run record after Roger Maris broke it under similar circumstances a few years previously). Hull's fans countered that Richard had achieved his record during World War II (during which many NHLers enlisted in the military — Richard, who was notoriously prone to injury throughout his career, was deemed unfit for service) and argued that Richard's failure to match the record in peacetime, with the caliber of the NHL not similarly hindered even though he played in eleven 70-game seasons, compromised any right <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> special consideration for the record {{on account of the}} shorter wartime schedule.|$|E

25|$|The abbey's modest but {{sufficient}} wealth was threatened, before many of {{the grants}} were confirmed by royal charter, when Earl Roger's son, Robert of Bellême, revolted against Henry I in 1102. The king exiled and expropriated his unruly vassal and the patronage of the abbey escheated to the Crown. This deprived the abbey of powerful local protection and gave the descendants and successors of donors an opportunity to wriggle out of their obligations. For example, Siward had given up any claims <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> the abbey site {{in return for a}} life-time grant from Earl Roger of the estate of Langafeld, now Cheney Longville, which would pass to the abbey on his death. Siward's son, Aldred, refused to surrender the estate to the abbey until Abbot Fulchred gave him £15. This arrangement was engineered by Richard de Belmeis I, later Bishop of London, whom the king had sent to exercise viceregal powers in Shropshire after Early Robert's expropriation. However, Richard was not to be trusted. On his death bed in 1127 he admitted to his confessors that he had lied about his tenure of Betton in Berrington, which really belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey – probably a grant from Robert de Limesey, then Bishop of Chester His confessor tried to clear up the matter by stating the facts to the interested parties. Although Richard had directed that the estate be restored to Shrewsbury Abbey, its status was contested by his lay successors for decades. In 1127 Philip de Belmeis sued for the estate, although he quickly defaulted. His younger son, Ranulph, tried again a few decades later, but gave up in return for acceptance into the abbey's lay fraternity. As late as 1212 Roger de la Zouche launched a fresh suit, in which he persisted for years, unsuccessfully. These were only examples of a morass of complex litigation into which the abbey was drawn.|$|E
500|$|Johansen was rescued, and {{the pair}} {{taken to the}} base at Cape Flora, where they posed for {{photographs}} (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson–Nansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts. Both men seemed in good health, despite their ordeal; Nansen had put on [...] in weight {{since the start of}} the expedition, and Johansen [...] In honour of his rescuer, Nansen named the island where he had wintered [...] "Frederick Jackson Island". For the next six weeks Nansen had little to do but await the arrival of Windward, worrying that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> spend the winter at Cape Flora, and sometimes regretting that he and Johansen had not pressed on to Spitsbergen. Johansen noted in his journal that Nansen had changed from the overbearing personality of the Fram days, and was now subdued and polite, adamant that he would never undertake such a journey again. On 26 July Windward finally arrived; on 7 August, with Nansen and Johansen aboard, she sailed south and on 13 August reached Vardø. A batch of telegrams was sent, informing the world of Nansen's safe return.|$|E
500|$|Work {{commenced}} on 5 October. Equipment {{and personnel}} were ferried across to Tatana Island {{so it could}} proceed from both ends. Some [...] of fill totalling [...] was required to establish a roadway [...] long and [...] wide [...] above the high tide mark. Work was completed on 30 October and the first ship berthed there on 3 November. Port capacity was increased from [...] per day. However, the project did not proceed without controversy. A heavy downpour on 21 October confirmed the airmen's worst fears, and Lieutenant General George C. Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces, {{sent a letter to}} MacArthur on 26 October informing him that while work to upgrade the airfield runways before the wet season was nearly completed, aircraft could not operate from them without taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads, all of which were far from ready. He warned that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> withdraw at least two squadrons back to Australia. Major General Richard Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff at GHQ, and Brigadier General Hugh J. Casey, his chief engineer, reassured Kenney everything possible would be done to keep the airfields operational in the wet season. Additional engineer units were ordered to Port Moresby, and work on the port and the Nine Mile Quarry was handed over to the Australians.|$|E

500|$|Control of Egypt was a decades-old {{dream of}} the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and king Amalric I of Jerusalem needed all the {{military}} and financial support he could get for his policy of military intervention in Egypt. Amalric also realised {{that if he were}} to pursue his ambitions in Egypt, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave Antioch to the hegemony of Manuel who had paid 100,000 dinars for the release of Bohemond III.* J. G. Rowe, Alexander III and the Jerusalem Crusade, 117 In 1165, he sent envoys to the Byzantine court to negotiate a marriage alliance (Manuel had already married Amalric's cousin Maria of Antioch in 1161). After a long interval of two years, Amalric married Manuel's grandniece Maria Komnene in 1167, and [...] "swore all that his brother Baldwin had sworn before." [...] A formal alliance was negotiated in 1168, whereby the two rulers arranged for a conquest and partition of Egypt, with Manuel taking the coastal area, and Amalric the interior. In the autumn of 1169 Manuel sent a joint expedition with Amalric to Egypt: a Byzantine army and a naval force of 20 large warships, 150 galleys, and 60 transports, under the command of the megas doux Andronikos Kontostephanos, joined forces with Amalric at Ascalon. William of Tyre, who negotiated the alliance, was impressed in particular by the large transport ships that were used to transport the cavalry forces of the army.|$|E

By nightfall, Dessaix held Tairier and had troops moving along the Turnes ravine. Marchand ordered another assault against Saint-Julien, but his column encountered a battery of 14 Austrian guns, including four 12-pound cannons. The Austrian guns outdueled the French artillery, knocking out {{two or three of}} their adversaries' cannons.

2500|$|Blofeld {{took a job}} at the {{merchant}} bank Robert Benson Lonsdale for three years, but it was not to his taste and he drifted into sports journalism. He reported on the England tour to India in 1963/4 for The Guardian, and was close to being picked as an emergency batsman to replace the ill Micky Stewart for the 2nd Test in Bombay. When he was told by David Clark, the tour manager, that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play, Blofeld replied [...] "I would certainly play if needed, but if I scored 50 or upwards in either innings I was damned if I would stand down for the Calcutta Test". On the day of the Test Stewart discharged himself from hospital and played despite his illness. After tea on the first day, Stewart was rushed back to hospital and played no further part in the tour. Blofeld continued as a print journalist until 1972 when he joined the Test Match Special team. He had also previously commentated for ITV in the 1960s.|$|E
