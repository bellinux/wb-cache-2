40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results on studies of chemical and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>catalysis</b> using single molecule fluorescence microscopy. With its real-time, single-turnover observations at millisecond, sub-diffraction limit resolutions, the single molecule fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technique in interrogating nanocatalysts in catalyzing chemical and electrochemical transformations. In this work, three major topics are covered: (i) revealing a hidden surface reaction intermediate in a catalytic process on a single nanoparticle, (ii) visualizing monolayer graphene oxide sheets in electrocatalysis and monitoring their activity changes upon electrochemical reduction, and (iii) studying <b>electrochemical</b> <b>catalysis</b> of arrays of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes. Detecting and characterizing reaction intermediates is important and powerful for elucidating reaction mechanisms, but challenging in general because of the low populations of intermediates in a reaction mixture. Studying surface reaction intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis presents additional challenges, especially the ubiquitous structural heterogeneity among the catalyst particles and the accompanying polydispersion in reaction kinetics. The single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy {{was used in this}} work to study the oxidative N-deacetylation of amplex red catalyzed by Au@mSiO 2 nanorods and 5. 3 nm Au nanoparticles. The distribution of microscopic reaction times for the catalysts followed the initial-rise-and-then-decay behaviors, indicating a kinetic intermediate straddled by two rate determining steps. The rate constant for each step was quantified, and a working mechanism was formulated for the catalytic kinetics. Graphene oxide sheets are a novel material that can be potentially used for the electrochemical, optoelectronic and mechanical related applications. Challenges in the research of graphene oxide sheets include imaging the single-sheet and understanding the electrochemical activity. By using a fluorogenic reaction, the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>catalysis</b> of graphene oxide sheets was studied in real time. Morphologies of individual sheets were revealed by this fluorescence microscopy approach, including the boundaries, wrinkles and folded regions. A graphene oxide sheet might be divided into different regions whose electrochemical activities were studied and compared. A constant negative potential was applied to the graphene oxide sheets for their partial reduction while monitoring the activity changes. The fundamental understanding of single-walled carbon nanotubes in electrochemical processes is important for tailoring their structures for optimal performances. Single molecule fluorescence microscope was applied to study large arrays of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes. Super-resolution imaging technique was used to precisely locate the active sites at the sub-diffraction limit resolution. After the single molecule study, the same piece of sample was imaged by AFM and SEM to overlay the active sites on top of nanotubes. Multiple active sites were observed on the same nanotube at different locations, and compared in terms of the dependence of substrate concentrations and applied potentials. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E

The critical thickness of copper, silver and nickel thin films were foundusing in-situ resistance measurements. Following this, 50 and 100 nm copper and nickel films were studied using solid electrolyte cyclic voltammetry (SECV) to determine their response to polarization. Given that silver thin films at such thicknesses are thermally unstable, a film of 800 nm {{was used in this}} study. The materials were found to respond to polarization in different ways, forming oxides according to Wagner and Mott-Cabrera oxidation models...|$|R
50|$|The <b>electrochemical</b> {{promotion}} of <b>catalysis</b> (EPOC) {{effect in the}} realm of chemistry refers to the pronounced enhancement of catalytic reactions or significant changes in the catalytic properties of a conductive catalyst in the presence of electrical currents or interfacial potentials. Additionally, the EPOC effect can be utilized in a reverse manner in order to influence the selectivity of versatile heterogeneous catalytic reactions. In most cases, the electronically conductive catalyst is in metallic or metal oxide states {{in the form of a}} porous film deposited on a solid electrolyte (O2− or mixed O2− electronic conductor). The EPOC effect was firstly discovered by M. Stoukides and C. Vayenas in the early 1980s and have been widely studied by various research groups for more than 100 heterogeneous catalytic reactions of mostly gaseous molecules. The EPOC effect has been evaluated as an important phenomenon which can closely link electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.|$|R
