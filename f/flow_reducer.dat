40|$|Goal 6 of the United Nations Development Program’s new Sustainable Development Goals aims {{to ensure}} {{availability}} {{of clean water}} and sustainable management practices to all by the year 2030. Peace Corps Panama partners with communities {{in order to help}} provide sustainable water solutions to communities in need. Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Volunteers spend at least two years living in a community to identify and implement solutions to water problems and train local water committees on how to maintain their improved systems. A common solution for unequal distribution of flow in the distribution network of a gravity flow water system is through the installation of flow reducers before each faucet. These can be sized with the help of NeatWork, a free, downloadable compute software. In Panama, flow reducers (also referred to as orifices) are manufactured to create a perforated plastic diaphragm fitting placed in the distribution pipe or union section upstream of a faucet. They help ensure longevity of the aqueduct by balancing the flows between houses, thus, enabling continuous water flow for all users. An important characteristic of flow reducers is that while they can be installed in new water sys-tems, they can also be installed in existing systems to fix inequalities from inadequate original designs or extensions to the systems. However, little guidance exists for volunteers or commu-nities to ensure the sustainability of these projects. Accordingly, the object of this thesis was to investigate how adding houses to existing aqueducts would affect its serviceability and how to determine a way for communities to size the flow reducers for future houses. The existing gravity flow water system in Santa Cruz, Panamá was surveyed including all the potential houses which were then analyzed using NeatWork. The results demonstrate that while it is better to include all potential locations during the initial survey, if it expands at an average growth rate, additional houses may decrease serviceability, but in a negligible way that will not affect the overall reliability of the distribution system. Utilizing NeatWork, this research showed it is able to determine ideal sizes of flow reducers for additional houses that could be added. Patterns were identified and used to simplify <b>flow</b> <b>reducer</b> sizing so that community members could do it themselves. While most of the time, the ideal <b>flow</b> <b>reducer</b> size for a new house will be {{the same size as the}} <b>flow</b> <b>reducer</b> size that is installed in the closest house that is already connected to the aqueduct, sometimes this is not the case. This typically occurs towards the end of branches and in areas where not all <b>flow</b> <b>reducer</b> sizes are present. These areas are clearly identified to the water committee on a map of the distribution system that was provided to various water committee members. With this map and simple instructions, the Santa Cruz water committee can continue correctly adding flow reducers to new houses. Through the research of this thesis, fabricating and installing flow reducers in the Santa Cruz water distribution system, and working alongside community members many lessons were learned about flow reducers and best practices. This knowledge has been converted into a guide about sustainable <b>flow</b> <b>reducer</b> projects. It has been left with current volunteers and the director of training for the WASH sector of Peace Corps Panama so that the volunteers can adapt the developed tools in their own communities...|$|E
40|$|Apparent losses form an {{important}} component of the International Water Association's water balance. While apparent losses look like real losses to a municipality, this is not actually the case. The main components of apparent losses are water meter under-registration and unauthorised consumption. Water utilities in South Africa and internationally are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of good meter management practices based on the vast amount of literature published and work done by municipalities in recent years. Water meters are known to increasingly under-register as they age and register consumption. They register consumption the least accurate at low flowrates and their accuracy in this range deteriorates the fastest. This study investigates the extent of the apparent loss problem in selected areas of South Africa due to meter inaccuracy in a number of different ways, including an inspection of new residential consumer meters, interrogation of a metering database, flow logging of domestic consumers with and without an Unmeasured <b>Flow</b> <b>Reducer</b> (UFR) installed and a compilation of reports on bulk consumer meters. It was found that 16 % of 402 properties investigated in the City of Cape Town had an on-site leakage and their median flowrate was 10 litres/ hour. In Bloemfontein, it was found that 28 % of the 167 properties investigated had an on-site leakage with a median flowrate of 20 l/h. An investigation into the performance of 15 mm positive displacement meters based on eThekwini's water meter database showed that the under-registration from these meters increase by 0. 36 %-points per year and 0. 9 %-points per 1000 kL registered. Flow logging of domestic consumers with and without UFRs, showed that there was no genuine improvement in meter accuracy with meters that had UFRs installed in-line with it. However, there were only 8 properties (3 of which having a UFR installed) in the study that were investigated and no statistical conclusive conclusions could be made. Bulk meter audits in Ekurhuleni and Tshwane showed apparent losses of 18 % and 19 % respectively...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, subsea {{systems have}} been {{designed}} to achieve a lifetime of 20 to 30 years without the need for maintenance. Still, experience has shown that failures may occur, leading to expensive interventions requiring partial or full production shutdown. This thesis evaluates which condition data that is necessary to collect when monitoring the condition of pipe components and pipe joints found in Statoil’s future subsea production facility. An evaluation of commercial technologies used for such collection has been done. The pipe components are defined as bends, injection points, <b>flow</b> <b>reducers</b> and headers, while the pipe joints are assumed to be non-welded. The necessary condition data was found to be pipe wall thickness, pipe diameter and crack propagation. An evaluation if the data collection is able to provide a sufficient description of the pipe components and joints current condition is further on reviewed. Finally, to which extent there will be compliance between the measured condition and {{the current state of the}} components and joints have been evaluated. Three commercial technologies have been evaluated after recommendations from Statoil. These are ClampOn’s Corrosion Erosion Monitor and Sensorlink’s Ultramonit for material loss, and Mistras Physical Acoustic’s monitoring system for crack propagation. The monitoring equipment manufactured by ClampOn and Sensorlink utilize ultrasonic technology. Both are designed for monitoring new and existing subsea pipelines, but have at present limited experience. Sensorlink’s Ultramonit is applicable for all the defined subsea components, and is stated to have an accuracy in the range of ± 0, 1 mm and ± 0, 2 mm when used subsea. ClampOn’s Corrosion Erosion Monitor can be used on pipe bends and <b>flow</b> <b>reducers,</b> and is considered to provide a sufficient description of the monitored components in general. However, no scientific research was found available on its accuracy when used subsea. Mistras Physical Acoustic’s monitoring system utilizes acoustic emission and can be placed on all of the defined pipe components. A sufficient description of the components’ state cannot be achieved with their monitoring system as it is not possible to obtain information of the size or geometry of the crack. Any scientific research of the compliance between the measured condition and the current state of the monitored pipe components was not found to be available. </p...|$|R
