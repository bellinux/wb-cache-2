25|$|The 'jungle' in {{the center}} of the bird house has <b>free-flying</b> birds, who can hide in the thick vegetation. Some like the Knysna turaco can be heard but are only visible in flight.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 20th century, modern {{veterinary}} {{practices and}} {{the advent of}} radio telemetry (transmitters attached to <b>free-flying</b> birds) increased the average lifespan of falconry birds and allowed falconers to pursue quarry and styles of flight that had previously resulted in the loss of their hawk or falcon.|$|E
25|$|The Hypervelocity Free-Flight (HFF) Range {{currently}} comprises two active facilities: the Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF) and the Gun Development Facility (HFFGDF). The HFFAF is {{a combined}} Ballistic Range and Shock-tube Driven Wind Tunnel. Its primary {{purpose is to}} examine the aerodynamic characteristics and flow-field structural details of <b>free-flying</b> aeroballistic models.|$|E
25|$|Roberts House was {{originally}} built in 1898, and {{designed by the}} architect Laurence Aloysius McDonnell. The building is currently a <b>free-flying</b> aviary, which houses a group of Rodrigues fruit bats, as well as exotic birds such as great Indian hornbills, red junglefowl, yellow-backed lories and Victoria crowned pigeons.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} flying diagonally with a determinate relation between angle and trajectory {{speed of the}} body, to obtain an air stream that allows for control of flight. The aim is to fly in formation {{at the same level}} and angle, {{and to be able to}} perform different aerial games, such as freestyle, three-dimensional flight formation with grip, or acrobatic <b>free-flying.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chester's Tropical Realm is Britain's largest {{tropical}} {{house at}} over 26,000 cubic metres. Opened in 1964, {{most of the}} interior is an open-plan space extending to roof level and themed with pools and mature tropical plants, with pathways for visitors through the undergrowth. Here, more than 30 species of birds are <b>free-flying,</b> including Nicobar pigeons, various species of starlings and ground birds such as crested partridges.|$|E
25|$|An {{enclosure}} formerly housing maned wolves was demolished {{and replaced}} in 2008 by a heated butterfly house called Butterfly Journey, {{which is based}} around {{the life cycle of}} a butterfly, featuring <b>free-flying</b> butterflies and moths (The exotic species on show include blue morphos, giant owls, glasswings, swallowtails and Atlas moths), a cabinet of cocoons, and an area with caterpillars. Also featured in this exhibit is an area for a variety of different invertebrates and a mesh enclosure for some panther chameleons.|$|E
25|$|The Berggarten is an {{important}} European botanical garden. Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, which hosts one of the world's biggest collection of orchids, and <b>free-flying</b> birds and butterflies. Near {{the entrance to the}} Berggarten is the historic Library Pavillon. The Mausoleum of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the Paradies and the Prairie Garden. There is also the Sea Life Centre Hanover, which is the first tropical aquarium in Germany.|$|E
25|$|STS-87 (November 19 to December 5, 1997) was {{the fourth}} U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on {{experiments}} designed to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun’s outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) that featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, and tested EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. During the EVA, Lindsey piloted the first flight of the AERCam Sprint, a <b>free-flying</b> robotic camera. The mission was accomplished in 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{effectiveness}} of the Union Army Balloon Corps, the Confederates felt compelled to incorporate balloons as well. Since coke gas was not readily available in Richmond, the first balloons were made of the Montgolfier rigid style: cotton stretched over wood framing and filled with hot smoke from fires made of oil-soaked pine cones. They were piloted by Captain John R. Bryan for use at Yorktown. Bryan's handlers were poorly experienced, and his balloon began spinning in the air. In another incident, one of the handlers became entangled in the ascending tether rope which had to be chopped loose, leaving the captain <b>free-flying</b> over his own Confederate positions whose troops threatened to shoot him down.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than <b>free-flying</b> juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E

500|$|This list {{of birds}} of Florida {{includes}} species {{documented in the}} U.S. state of Florida and accepted by the Florida Ornithological Society Records Committee (FOSRC). As of August 2013, there were 515 species included in the official list. Subsequent decisions by the FOSRC deleted one species and added six more, resulting in an official list total of 520 as of August 2015. Of the 520, 121 species and three identifable subspecies are classed as accidental, 16 have been introduced to North America, three are extinct, and one has been extirpated. An additional 127 [...] "verifiable...exotic species [...] found <b>free-flying</b> in the wild" [...] according to the FOSRC.|$|E
500|$|Over {{a series}} of {{tethered}} and <b>free-flying</b> test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the contra-rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and {{it was discovered that}} the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable pitching motion, but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient. The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined {{with the fact that the}} [...] "personal lifting device" [...] concept was failing to live up to its expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.|$|E
500|$|... "Bees of {{all species}} {{are likely to}} {{encounter}} multiple stressors during their lives, and each is likely to reduce the ability of bees {{to cope with the}} others. A bee or bee colony that appears to have succumbed to a pathogen may not have died if it had not also been exposed to a sublethal dose of a pesticide and/or been subject to food stress (which might in turn be due to drought or heavy rain induced by climate change, or competition from a high density of honey bee hives placed nearby). Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult. The number of stressor combinations rapidly becomes large, and exposure to stressors is hard or impossible to control with <b>free-flying</b> bees. Nonetheless, a strong argument can be made that it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that {{lies at the heart of}} current bee health problems." ...|$|E
