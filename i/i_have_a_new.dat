500|$|On 5 December, Benzema {{appeared}} {{as a substitute for}} Rafael van der Vaart and scored the third goal in a 6–0 romp of Almería. The day after the match against Almería, Benzema responded to the criticism by stating, [...] "I am totally integrated and very happy at Real Madrid," [...] and, [...] "Yes, I have improved my adaptation. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> home and I'm learning Spanish to understand myself better with my teammates." [...] After nearly a month coming off of the bench, he started alongside Higuaín away to Valencia on 12 December and responded by assisting on one of Higuaín's two goals. A week later, Benzema returned to the bench. On his 22nd birthday, he scored in a 6–0 home win against Real Zaragoza. Following an injury to Higuaín in early January 2010, Pellegrini inserted Benzema back into the starting lineup. After failing to score in his first two starts in the absence of Higuaín, against Deportivo La Coruña on 30 January, he scored a double in an important 3–1 away win. Following the return of Higuaín, Benzema was relegated back to a substitute's role and finished the campaign by making eight consecutive appearances off the bench. Included in one of those appearances was his final goal of the season against Athletic Bilbao in a 5–1 win.|$|E
500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E

6000|$|... "Here are the snipe, Mrs. Quest," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have had}} rather good luck. I killed four couple and missed two couple more; but then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> gun, {{and one can}} never shoot so well with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> gun." ...|$|R

60|$|Young as I was, I {{believe that}} I dated <b>a</b> <b>new</b> admiration of Joe from that night.

5000|$|The late Charles Hawtrey... {{was one of}} {{the best}} judges of cocktails that I knew. Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar and say, [...] "Coley, I am tired. Give me {{something}} with a bit of punch in it." [...] It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> invented <b>a</b> <b>new</b> cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, [...] "By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!"

6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Peter, quite right about Bossy the Cow. She never has new horns, but that isn't {{any reason why}} I shouldn't have new antlers, is it?"

60|$|I {{would not}} by any means consent to this, for it {{occurred}} to me that I really ought to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little house-warming, and that there never could be <b>a</b> better opportunity. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> pride in my rooms after his approval of them, and burned with a desire to develop their utmost resources. I therefore made him promise positively in the names of his two friends, and we appointed six o'clock as the dinner-hour.|$|R
5000|$|Cohen {{also used}} {{introductions}} from Goonies director Richard Donner to get summer jobs {{on the business}} side of movie studios; he would say about that time in the ABA Journal story, [...] "I grew up loving The Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers, but suddenly <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> crop of heroes." [...] He chose to pursue a legal career upon finding out that many of the most important figures on {{the business side of}} Hollywood had law degrees.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so. Friends, {{will you}} be so good as to summon my son and the lady? The lady first, I think--and {{all three of you}} might go to escort her.

6000|$|... "Now, {{what have}} I done so far?" [...] said Mrs. Cliff, {{on the evening}} of the day when the cow came home. [...] "I have a woman to cook, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> kitchen door, and I have a cow! I do not count the horse and the wagon, for if I do not drive, myself, I shall not feel that they are mine in the way that I want them to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't flatter yourself," [...] said Boone. [...] "It is {{a matter}} of business, and equally {{possible}} that I wished to do some other person the opposite.

5000|$|... …mainly because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> toy. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{this big}} new keyboard. And Robert and I {{just got to}} rehearsals early, basically. ... With Zeppelin writing, if you came up with good things, and {{everybody}} agreed that they were good things, they got used. There was no formula for writing. So Robert and I, by the time everybody turned up for rehearsals, we’d written three or four songs. So we started rehearsing those immediately, because they were something to be getting on with.|$|R

"Well, gentlemen, I cannot indeed {{offer you}} much comfort as regards your losses, for the sea keeps a {{powerful}} hold of its possessions; {{but you will}} find my boy's camera a fairly good one, {{and there are plenty}} of dry plates. It so happens, also, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> repeating rifle in the house, which has not yet been used; so, in the meantime, at all events, neither of you will suffer much from your misfortunes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} very happy in Oz," [...] he said, [...] "but my duty to others forces me to exile myself from that {{delightful}} land.

6000|$|... "Of that ill word, this, Hugh: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> suitor up yonder, a fine French suitor, a {{very great}} lord indeed, whose wealth, I am told, none can number. From his mother he has the Valley of the Waveney up to Bungay town--ay, and beyond--and from his father, a whole county in Normandy. Five French knights ride behind his banner, and with them ten squires and I know not how many men-at-arms. There is feasting yonder at the manor, I can tell you. Ere his train leaves us our winter provender will be done, and we'll have to drink small beer till the wine ships come from France in spring." ...|$|E
60|$|Last night <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{experience}} of my Lady of the Shroud--in {{so far as}} form was concerned, at any rate. I was in bed, and just falling asleep, when I heard a queer kind of scratching at the glass door of the terrace. I listened acutely, my heart beating hard. The sound {{seemed to come from}} low down, close to the floor. I jumped out of bed, ran to the window, and, pulling aside the heavy curtains, looked out.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{think what}} weeks of it you have before you?" [...] Helen explained, {{clapping}} her hands. [...] "Philippa and <b>I</b> will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> interest in life--to make you fat." ...|$|R
50|$|Between 1607 and 1612, Sir Adam Newton, tutor to Prince Henry, {{eldest son}} of James <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> manor house, Charlton House, {{built in the}} village.

6000|$|He paused abruptly. [...] "I was {{weary of}} my days. Yesterday I moved as a {{creature}} of habit. This morning it seems that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> interest.

I must scrutinize every phase of her power, and you must help me. You are young and well-trained. You have a good mind, and I am persuaded you will go far. Your mother worships you, lives for you.
