Although past research has highlighted {{the importance of}} these nutrient subsidies to freshwater food webs, their effects on the trophic and population dynamics of freshwater fish remain poorly understood. In this thesis I examined the relative influences of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> and habitat on the diets, individual condition, and population densities of freshwater prickly sculpins (Cottus asper), and coastrange sculpins (C. aleuticus). I found that sculpin condition and salmon nutrients in sculpin diets increased with the availability and density of spawning salmon, and were influenced by season, sculpin species, body size, and habitat. I also found that salmon density, pH, and habitat were related to sculpin population densities, but that their effects differed between sculpin species. This is the first study to test such relationships for freshwater fishes across wide, natural gradients in salmon spawning density and habitat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Off shore {{distribution}} of juvenile (ocean age. 0) Alaskan pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (0. <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> with thermal otolith marks caught by midwater trawl in the North Pacific varies by geographic region. This may reflect {{differences in the}} width of the continental shelf. A few juvenile southeastern Alaska hatchery chum salmon were caught south of major exit corridors, counter to the predominant northward migration pattern. The northern Shelikof Strait may be an important summer migration corridor for juvenile pink salmon. The ocean range of central Alaska pink salmon extends further to the southwest (to 42 °N, 165 °W) than shown by high-seas tag experiments, and some maturing chum salmon caught in the coastal waters off Prince William Sound in May, are from an early southeastern Alaska hatchery run (peak harvest in mid-July). We conclude that sufficient numbers of thermally-marked hatchery salmon can be recovered during coastal and offshore salmon surveys to provide significant new stock-specific information on ocean distribution and migration patterns of salmon...|$|E
40|$|Food {{acquisition}} is {{a necessary}} component of survival for any organism {{and in order to}} feed effectively, a predator must meet the mechanical demands of its prey. This study’s focus was to make general observations and conclusions about the evolution and adaptation of several morphological traits of pacific salmon jaws based on varied feeding behaviors. Dissections of juvenile king, adult king, and <b>keta</b> <b>salmon</b> were performed, during which measurements pertaining to the articular joint and adductor mandibulae were taken and recorded. The study found that king salmon have stronger adductor mandibulae, while keta have stronger skeletal jaw components. This trade-off is a morphological adaptation in which either force or velocity can be prioritized. Each species’ jaw anatomy is specialized for their diet and feeding habits, for example stronger jaws to accommodate the crushing of tough prey or fast jaw closure for hunting fish prey. Other conclusions, like the positive correlation between head length and adductor mandibulae mass, were also drawn from the study...|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Elwha River {{was one of}} the few {{rivers in}} the {{contiguous}} United States that supported all of the anadromous salmonid species native to the Pacific Northwest. Ten stocks of anadromous salmon and trout species are known to have been present in the river before the dams were built: spring- and summer/fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum <b>salmon</b> (O. <b>keta),</b> coho <b>salmon</b> (O. kisutch), pink salmon (O. gorbuscha), sockeye salmon (O. nerka), summer- and winter-run steelhead trout (O. mykiss), bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), and cutthroat trout (O. clarki clarki). The river was considered the most prolific fish producer on the Olympic Peninsula. It was particularly known for its very large Chinook salmon, weighing as much as 45 kg. Prior to the construction of the two dams on the river in the early 20th century, an estimated 392,000 fish returned annually to spawn. By the late 20th century, the number had declined to less than 3,000.|$|R

A. salmonicida was not isolated from 480 immature chum salmon were examined from September 1919 to October 1990. We compared the prevalence of A. salmonicida in the kidney of immature and mature chum salmon which ascended the Shibetsu, Nishibetsu and Ishikari rivers. The prevalence of A. salmonicida in the immature fish was lower than that in the mature fish. A. salmonicida was neither detected from the kidneys of chum and masu salmon fry, nor isolated from the surface of chum salmon eggs in the hatcheries. From these results, we considered that these salmonids were not infected with A. salmonicida until they entered the rivers...|$|R
40|$|The risk {{of salmon}} lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) {{transmission}} to wild juvenile Pacific salmon has spurred management change to reduce lice on salmon farms. We studied {{the abundance of}} planktonic lice preceding the juvenile salmon outmigration {{as well as the}} abundance of lice on juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> in two distinct migration routes, one contain-ing only fallow farms and the other active farms that applied a parasiticide. Results indicate that fallowing reduces the abundance and flattens the spatial distribution of lice relative to that expected in areas without farms. Active farms remained the primary source of lice, but transmission was reduced 100 -fold relative to previous epizootics in the study area. On the migration route containing active farms, 50 % of the juvenile salmon showed evidence of louse damage to surface tissues and the estimated direct louse-induced mortality was, 10 %, not including indirect effects of infection on predation risk or competition. The survival of the pink salmon cohort was not stat-istically different from a reference region without salmon farms. Although repeated use of a single parasiticide can lead to resistance, reducing louse transmission from farmed salmon may help conserve some wild Pacific salmon populations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Loss of non-seasonal sea ice and {{a general}} warming trend in the Bering Sea has altered the composition, distribution, and {{abundance}} of marine organisms inhabiting the region. Juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> were found in significant numbers throughout the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait regions during early autumn 2007, reflecting significant utilization of Arctic marine habitat by Pacific salmon. Linear models of juvenile pink and chum salmon body size corrected for Day of Year were parameterized to estimate daily growth rates and habitat-specific differences in body size using 6 years of survey data. Model results revealed that juvenile pink salmon inhabiting the eastern Bering Sea grew at an average rate of 1. 17 mm•day- 1 and juvenile chum salmon grew {{at a rate of}} 1. 21 mm•day- 1. The U. S. BASIS survey area was expanded northward to include the Chukchi Sea during 2007, where larger juvenile pink and chum salmon were found in higher abundances relative to pink and chum inhabiting the eastern Bering Sea.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolutionary}} history and {{speculate about the}} evolutionary future of three basic life history ecotypes {{that contribute to the}} biocomplexity of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The ‘recurrent evolution’ (RE) hypothesis claims that the sea/river ecotype is ancestral, a ‘straying’ form with poorly differentiated (meta) population structure, and that highly structured populations of lake-type sockeye and kokanee have evolved repeatedly in parallel adaptive radiations between recurrent glaciations of the Pleistocene Epoch. Basic premises of this hypothesis are consistent with new, independent evidence from recent surveys of genetic variation in mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA: (1) sockeye salmon are most closely related to pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> with sea-type life histories; (2) the sockeye life history ecotypes exist as polyphyletic lineages within large drainages and geographic regions; (3) the sea/river ecotype exhibits less genetic differentiation among populations than the lake or kokanee ecotypes both within and among drainages; and (4) genetic diversity is typically higher in the sea/river ecotype than in the lake and kokanee ecotypes. Anthropogenic modification of estuarine habitat and intensive coastal fisheries have likely reduced and fragmented historic metapopulations of the sea/river ecotype, particularly in southern areas. In contrast, the kokanee ecotype appears to be favoured by marine fisheries and predicted changes in climate...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{historical}} distribution of anadromous fish is important to guide management decisions regarding the Klamath River including ongoing restoration and regional recovery of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Using various sources, we determined {{the historical}} distribution of anadromous fish above Iron Gate Dam. Evidence for the largest, most utilized species, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), was available from multiple sources and clearly showed that this species historically migrated upstream into tributaries of Upper Klamath Lake.

40|$|Noninvasive genetic {{sampling}} is {{an important}} tool in wildlife ecology and management, typically relying on hair snaring or scat sampling techniques, but hair snaring is labor and cost intensive, and scats yield relatively low quality DNA. New approaches utilizing environmental DNA (eDNA) may provide supplementary, cost-effective tools for noninvasive genetic sampling. We tested whether eDNA from residual saliva on partially-consumed Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses might yield suitable DNA quality for noninvasive monitoring of brown bears (Ursus arctos). We compared the efficiency of monitoring brown bear populations using both fecal DNA and salivary eDNA collected from partially-consumed salmon carcasses in Southeast Alaska. We swabbed a range of tissue types from 156 partially-consumed salmon carcasses from a midseason run of lakeshore-spawning sockeye (O. nerka) and a late season run of stream-spawning chum (O. <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> in 2014. We also swabbed a total of 272 scats from the same locations. Saliva swabs collected from the braincases of salmon had the best amplification rate, followed by swabs taken from individual bite holes. Saliva collected from salmon carcasses identified unique individuals more quickly and required much less labor to locate than scat samples. Salmon carcass swabbing is a promising method to aid in efficient and affordable monitoring of bear populations, and suggests that the swabbing of food remains or consumed baits from other animals may be an additional cost-effective and valuable tool {{in the study of}} the ecology and population biology of many elusive and/or wide-ranging species...|$|E

Annual escapement counts were 2, 025 Chinook and 33, 481 chum salmon for Gisasa River, 73 Chinook and 2, 853 chum salmon for Kateel River, and 649 Chinook and 25, 249 chum salmon for Henshaw Creek. Additional biological information was collected on age, sex, and length of each spawning population. Passage information was also recorded for longnose sucker Catostomus catostomus, northern pike Esox lucius, Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus, and whitefish (Coregoninae). Chinook and summer chum salmon escapement counts from these three tributaries assist fisheries managers in making in-season decisions during the Yukon River commercial and subsistence fishing season, provide post-season evaluation of various management practices, and assist in developing future run projections. Due {{to the complexity of}} the mixedstock Yukon River fishery and the difficulty in managing specific stocks, it is essential to continue collecting information from individual salmon populations, including stocks from the Koyukuk River drainage. It is recommended that the Gisasa River (lower Koyukuk River) and Henshaw Creek projects (upper Koyukuk River) be continued for the long term, so population trends can be analyzed over an extended time-series.

OR genes from the five salmonids examined all showed strong homology (96 - 99 %) to each other. Hypervariable regions, believed to be ligand-binding pockets, showed homologous completely matched amino acid sequences except for one amino acid in pink salmon olfactory receptor 1 (PSOR 1), revealing that these ORs may be well conserved among salmon species.

The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks {{remains one of the}} most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon.</b> Farm-origin lice induced 9 – 95 % mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first ≈ 2. 5 months of the salmon's marine life (≈ 80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies...|$|E
40|$|Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) play an {{important}} role as a keystone species and provider of ecosystem services in the North Pacific ecosystem. We review our studies on recent production trends, marine carrying capacity, climate effects and biological interactions between wild and hatchery origin populations of Pacific salmon in the open sea, with a particular focus on Japanese chum salmon (O. <b>keta).</b> <b>Salmon</b> catch data indicates that the abundance of Pacific salmon increased since the 1976 / 77 ocean regime shift. Chum and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) maintained high abundances with a sharp increase in hatchery-released populations since the late 1980 s. Since the 1990 s, the biomass contribution of hatchery returns to the total catch amounts to 50 % for chum salmon, more than 10 % for pink salmon, and less than 10 % for sockeye salmon (O. nerka). We show evidence of density-dependence of growth and survival at sea and how it might vary across spatial scales, and we provide some new information on foraging plasticity that may offer new insight into competitive interactions. The marine carrying capacity of these three species is synchronized with long-term patterns in climate change. At the present time, global warming has positively affected growth and survival of Hokkaido populations of chum salmon. In the future, however, global warming may decrease the marine carrying capacity and the area of suitable habitat for chum salmon in the North Pacific Ocean.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. <b>keta)</b> <b>salmon</b> stocks have also experienced recent declines in productivity by investigating temporal and spatial trends in productivity of 99 wild North American pink and chum salmon stocks. We used a combination of population dynamics and time series models to quantify individual stock trends as well as common temporal trends in pink and chum salmon productivity across local, regional, and continental spatial scales. Our results indicated widespread declines in productivity of wild chum salmon stocks throughout Washington (WA) and British Columbia (BC) with 81 % of stocks showing recent declines in productivity, although the exact form of the trends varied among regions. For pink salmon, the majority of stocks in WA and BC (65 %) did not have strong temporal trends in productivity; however, all stocks that did have trends in productivity showed declining productivity since at least brood year 1996. We found weaker evidence of widespread declines in productivity for Alaska pink and chum salmon, with some regions and stocks showing declines in productivity (e. g., Kodiak chum salmon stocks) and others showing increases (e. g., Alaska Peninsula pink salmon stocks). We also found strong positive covariation between stock productivity series at the regional spatial scale for both pink and chum salmon, along with evidence that this regional-scale positive covariation has become stronger since the early 1990 s in WA and BC. In general, our results suggest that common processes operating at the regional or multi-regional spatial scales drive productivity of pink and chum salmon stocks in western North America and that the effects of these process on productivity may change over time...|$|E

Ju-venile salmon partitioned Barkley Sound by time and space, and by diet except for hatchery and wild coho. The analysis of migration timing included historic data for 1987 - 89, and results showed that timing differed between species and was consistent over years. Sockeye and chum dominated the juvenile salmon community until mid-June and hatchery and wild chinook dominated subsequently. Fish tended to be dispersed contagiously. Results of correlation analyses of catch sug-gested that fish of different origins and species did not co-occur. The euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera was an important prey item but different fish species selected different sizes of T. spinifera at different times. The diet overlap between hatchery and wild coho did not affect return. Migration timing for sockeye and wild coho seems to reflect a strategy to en-ter the ocean when the biomass of the size fraction of T. spinifera that each species selects is likely to be maximal. De-scriptions of migration timing, fish interactions, and diet provide information which appears to be useful for learning about the biological basis of salmon return variability...|$|R

The tumor {{was considered to be}} malignant epithelioma because of its active proliferation and intensive invasion of the connective tissues. Tumors which developed on the corneal epithelium and inneropercular of chum salmon showed similar characteristics to those around the mouth. Two types of tumor tissues also appeared in the kidney. One of them showed similar characteristics to those around the mouth and was presumed to be a transferable tumor. The others were characterized by their hyperplastic renal tuble cells (tuble epithelial cells) and their similarity in appearance to smooth muscle fibers...|$|R
