40|$|To {{calculate}} shape {{distortions of}} powder compacts during sintering, both <b>die</b> <b>pressing</b> and sintering processes were simulated for two hard metal parts {{by using the}} finite element method.

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} confinement condition on the damage induced by a spherical impact, an experimental setup that can impact contact pressure to the specimen through a <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> was composed. The steel and the WC balls in 3 mm diameter impacted to the soda-lime glass specimen with dimension of 33 × 33 × 8 m in the impact velocity range of 30 m/s to 200 m/s. Three different conditions are given for the impact damage investigation, which are the case without a <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> and the cases of p= 0 MPa and p= 200 MPa with a <b>pressing</b> <b>die.</b> The stress distribution in the glass specimen by impacting the particle was also evaluated using MARC s/w system.

For the manufacturing of large-scale components, thus, the granules have to meet the following requirements: - Fine, preferably narrow size distribution of the granules - Homogeneous granule structure - Low to medium specific fracture load - High plastic deformation - Good flowability - High compressibility and low friction forces during pressing - Stable properties The adjustment of tailored granule properties requires a methodology as well as knowledge about technological and formulation-related influences such as, e. g., the effect of organic compaction aids.

40|$|The {{frictional}} behaviour of dry ceramic {{and metal}} granular materials (spherical beads, sand and iron powders) has been studied.

The coefficient of internal friction calculated from shear cell measurements at normal stresses of 0. 4 - 1. 4 MPa was in good agreement with that deduced from die stresses during <b>die</b> <b>pressing</b> to about 300 MPa. Internal friction in loaded granular material was also studied in terms of particle size, shape and specific surface area.

40|$|Three {{commercial}} iron powders {{have been}} studied {{in terms of their}} particle morphology and frictional characteristics. The frictional characteristics were measured in shear cell experiments at normal applied loads of up to 4. 7 MPa and deduced from measurements of axial stress and radial stress in an instrumented die used in quasi-static and dynamic compaction experiments at axial stresses of up to 300 MPa. Particle shape factor and specific surface area did not greatly affect the coefficient of internal friction. For the range of powder parameters considered, it was most affected by particle size with the smaller particle samples having the higher friction. There was good qualitative agreement between the coefficient of internal friction deduced from shear cell and <b>die</b> <b>pressing</b> experiments. Despite evidence of the development of cohesion in the powders in the <b>die</b> <b>pressing</b> experiments, the linearity of the axial stress-radial stress relations suggested that the powder response could be characterised in terms of a constant value of the coefficient of internal friction.

40|$|Design and {{manufacture}} of dies and moulds {{is a critical}} aspect of many production systems since the manufacturing and try-out of new dies and moulds often is essential in determining the lead-time and quality of a new production system. In the automotive industry, many new car models are introduced each year and {{for each of these}} models, a new set of <b>pressing</b> <b>dies</b> has to be designed {{and manufacture}}d. In manufacturing of <b>pressing</b> <b>dies,</b> the effects of manufacturing processes on functional performance are not fully understood. One of the reasons for this is the lack of effective methods for characterisation. In the work described in this thesis, experimental work is conducted to establish such methods. First, the focus is on methods for obtaining measurement data. Second, the focus is on methods for relating the measurement data to functional performance. In contrast, the technique commonly used today for characterisation is visual and tactile inspection, with the help of reference surfaces, by an experienced operator. In this work, effective 3 D measuring strategies were established for <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> surfaces, including the use a surface replication technique. It was also found that machined surfaces are more homogeneous than manually polished surfaces and therefore require fewer measurements to give representative results. Furthermore, it was established that in production, a 2 D profiler can be used for quality control of a finish milled steel surface, in regard to surface roughness, if an appropriate measuring strategy is used and limits for the evaluated parameters first are established for each combination of cutting tools, cutting data, workpiece material etc. In addition, using Rz (average peak-to-valley profile roughness) or Rp (highest peak) is better than using Ra (arithmetical mean deviation) if surface finish appearance is to be assessed. The method employed in this study, using scale-sensitive fractal analysis, for evaluating functional correlations and designing filters was very usable and gave good results. This method can surely be applied to other types of surfaces and functional correlations. Also, there is a correlation between the surface roughness parameter Sq (root-mean-square deviation of the surface) and the surface finish appearance of <b>pressing</b> <b>dies</b> and this correlation is stronger in certain wavelengths on the surface...|$|R
