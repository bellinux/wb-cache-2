The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security ratifies collective bargaining agreements, which covers roughly 75 percent of the formally employed workforce. According to the ILO, the ratification process impedes <b>free</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining because the ministry considered not only whether a collective labor agreement contained clauses violating public order standards but also whether the agreement complied with productivity, investment, technology, and vocational training criteria. However, there are no known cases of government refusal to approve any collective agreements under these criteria.|$|E
2500|$|The era was prosperous but {{political}} crises were escalating out of control. Dangerfield (1935) identified the [...] "strange death of liberal England" [...] as the multiple crises that hit simultaneously in 1910–1914 with serious {{social and political}} instability arising from the Irish crisis, labour unrest, the women's suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed [...] the Army might refuse orders dealing with Ireland. No solution appeared in sight when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold. McKibben argues that the political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance {{on the eve of}} the war in 1914. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish Nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), <b>free</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining for trades unions (which Conservatives opposed), an [...] active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together from leftovers from the 1890s. The sociological basis was non-Anglicanism and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasized by the Labour Party.|$|E

50|$|If the Conservatives want {{to signal}} the {{contentious}} Redford era is over, interim Premier Dave Hancock should seriously consider dropping draconian Bill 46 that suspended collective bargaining and imposed a wage settlement on 22,000 public servants.

5000|$|In 1952, the British magazine, The Economist, {{published}} {{a series of}} articles on an [...] "Uneasy Triangle," [...] which described [...] "the three-cornered incompatibility between a stable price level, full employment, and ... <b>free</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining." [...] The context was the difficulty maintaining external balance without sacrificing two sacrosanct political values, jobs for all and unrestricted labor rights. Inflation resulting from labor militancy in the context of full employment put powerful downward pressure on the pound sterling. Runs on the pound triggered a long series of economically and politically disruptive [...] "stop-go" [...] policies (deflation followed by reflation). John Maynard Keynes had anticipated the severe problem associated with reconciling full employment with stable prices without sacrificing democracy and the associational rights of labor. The same incompatibilities were also elaborated on in Charles Lindblom's 1949 book, Unions and Capitalism.|$|E
