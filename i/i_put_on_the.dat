25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|Corgan {{has said}} that [...] "For the solo in 'Fuck You (An Ode to No One),' I played until my fingers saw blood, You can't play a weak guitar solo in such a propulsive song. It's got to be attack-style." [...] He {{explains}} this method by saying [...] "... <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> headphones and stand one foot away from the amp. I turn the amp up so loud that I literally have to play harder than the feedback, because if I stop playing even for an instant, the whole thing explodes." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1924, Fitzgerald {{wrote to}} Perkins that [...] "I have now decided {{to stick to}} the title <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book... Trimalchio in West Egg" [...] but was {{eventually}} persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people {{would not be able to}} pronounce it. His wife, Zelda, and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed. A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, on March 19: 'CRAZY ABOUT TITLE UNDER THE RED WHITE AND BLUE STOP [...] WOULD DELAY BE'}} Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change. The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald remarked that [...] "the title is only fair, rather bad than good." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{releasing}} three successful singles from Revival, Gomez {{announced that}} she had begun recording a follow-up to the album, stating that {{she was ready to}} move on from the era. However, in an interview for 97.5 Now FM, Gomez revealed that [...] "Kill Em with Kindness" [...] was going to be released as the album's fourth and final single, saying: [...] "‘Kill Em with Kindness’ is lyrically my favorite song <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record and I definitely can’t wait to be able for that to have a story." [...] It was serviced to contemporary hit radio on May 3, 2016. On May 31, 2016, the official cover art for the single was released. It features a lipstick print against a black surface, which Mike Wass of Idolator noted [...] "vaguely ties in with the song’s message of rising above your haters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{accepted}} the Lord Lieutenancy on 10 August. The Duke of Portland wrote to Fitzwilliam {{four days later}} to say he had told Ponsonby, an Irish Whig, of the appointment. He wrote to Henry Grattan on 23 August: [...] "The chief object of my attempts will be, to purify, as far as circumstances and prudence will permit, the principles of government, {{in the hopes of}} thereby restoring to it that tone and spirit which so happily prevailed formerly, and so much to the dignity as well as the benefit of the country". He said he could only do this if Grattan and the Ponsonbys assisted him. On 8 October Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland to inform him of rumours in Ireland that Lord Westmorland was to continue as Lord Lieutenant and that if he was not announced soon as Lord Lieutenant he would resign from the government. The Duke of Portland replied that Pitt [...] "harped" [...] on needing to find Lord Westmorland another office and {{that he did not want}} the Irish Chancellor Lord FitzGibbon removed, as some Whigs were calling for. Fitzwilliam in turn responded that he would accept the office unless given a free hand in both men and measures; he would not [...] "step into Lord Westmorland's old shoes—that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old trappings, and submit to the old chains" [...] and declared he would resign.|$|E
