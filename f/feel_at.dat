5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every {{individual}} was encouraged to feel that she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community <b>feel.</b> <b>At</b> one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Test cricket {{returned}} from its hiatus in 1920 with the English touring Australia. Collins, also a selector, {{was one of}} six AIF XI players to make his début in the First Test of that series. The First Test was played on Collins's home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground and Collins had reason to <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home, scoring 70 and 104. Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test début. Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory. Over the 1920–1921 series, Collins made 557 runs {{at an average of}} 61.88.|$|E
5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home there.|$|E

25|$|This quote {{emphasizes}} the undisguised anti-Semitism present, which especially took a sharp upturn after the Gründerkrach in 1873 throughout the German Reich. Leipzig was {{a center of}} anti-Semitic movement, especially among the student body. This {{may well be the}} reason that Hausdorff did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> ease at Leipzig. Another reason was perhaps the stresses due to the hierarchical posturing of the Leipzig professors.|$|E

25|$|Baker, the character's recast, {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} taking over a prominent character. She said she had studied scenes of Havins as Babe, {{and that she was}} focused on her portrayal as the character. Before landing the role, Baker was screen tested with actors who often interact with the character (Jacob Young, who portrays JR Chandler and Bobbie Eakes, portrayer of the character's mother, Krystal). A few days after her audition, she received a phone call informing her that she had won the part. Baker said that she was treated with a warm welcome {{from the rest of the}} cast and Havins herself, and that this has made her <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home while on set.|$|E

25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition designed to make new students <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social matters {{and it is not}} uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Banco de Mexico {{began the}} gradual {{launch of a}} new series of {{bimetallic}} $100 coins. These number 32 – one for each of the nation's 31 states, plus the Federal District. While the obverse of these coins bears the traditional coat of arms of Mexico, their reverses show the individual coats of arms of the component states. The first states to be celebrated in this fashion were Zacatecas, Yucatán, Veracruz, and Tlaxcala. In circulation they are extraordinarily rare, but their novelty value offsets the unease most users <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> having such a large amount of money in a single coin. Although the Bank has tried to encourage users to collect full sets of these coins, issuing special display folders for the purpose, the high cost involved has worked against them. Bullion versions of these coins are also available, with the outer ring made of gold, instead of aluminium bronze.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{she held}} a meeting at Clarence House which brought {{together}} rape victims and rape support groups. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Theresa May were guests at the occasion. At the occasion, she introduced a plan to help the victims. About 750 wash-bags, packed with luxury toiletries, were distributed to victims at the centres. Her staff at Clarence House created the wash-bags. The Duchess thought of the gesture after she visited a centre in Derbyshire and asked victims what {{they would like to}} help them <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> ease after the trauma and forensic examinations. According to Clarence House, the event was the first meeting of high-profile figures to focus exclusively on rape and sexual abuse subjects. The same year, the Duchess travelled to Northern Ireland and opened The Rowan, a sexual assault and referral centre at Antrim Area Hospital which was the first centre to provide help and comfort to rape and sexual abuse victims in Northern Ireland. In March 2016, during a tour to the Western Balkans with her husband, the Duchess visited UNICEF programmes in Montenegro and while there, she discussed child sexual abuse and was shown an exclusive preview of a new app designed to protect children from online sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj felt like he had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E
