Higher average powers or repetition rates require water cooling. The water usually has to wash across not only the arc length of the lamp, but across the <b>electrode</b> <b>portion</b> of the glass as well. Water-cooled flashlamps are usually manufactured with the glass shrunken around the electrode to allow direct cooling of the tungsten. If the electrode is allowed to heat much more than the glass thermal expansion can crack the seal.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{simulated}} diffusion-limited time-variant currents at conical-tip microelectrodes fabricated by depositing a carbon film in and on pulled quartz capillaries. These mechanically strong microelectrodes are suitable probes for detecting neurotransmitters in vivo. The simulated {{results show that}} the currents obtained at conical-tip microelectrodes are larger than those at finite conical microelectrodes (e. g. etched carbon fibres protruding from an insulating plane) of comparable dimensions. The currents at conical-tip microelectrodes and finite conical microelectrodes both converge to that of a microdisk electrode at small cone heights and large cone angles, and to that of a cylindrical <b>electrode</b> <b>portion</b> of equal length and half the radius at large cone heights and small cone angles. At short times (scaled by the electrode dimensions), Cottrellian current is achieved at conical-tip microelectrodes and the current densities collapse to the expected chronoamperometric response at a microdisk electrode, subject to some simulation errors. Comparison between a simulated chronoamperogram and an experimental chronoamperogram then allows an estimate of parameters (such as electrode surface area and dimensions) that define the electrode geometry. Steady-state currents based on empirical functions have also been computed for conical-tip microelectrodes and finite conical microelectrodes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{obtain the}} {{transmission}} {{image of a}} commercial lithium ion (Li-ion) battery using a pulsed neutron beam at the beamline 09 of the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex.

The transmission images for three charge states (3. 2 V, 3. 7 V, and 4. 2 V) reveal differences between these three states, which we attribute to electrolyte migration. The transmission spectra show Bragg edges originating from the electrodes, current collectors, and battery vessel.

30|$|The {{low level}} doping of a {{selective}} emitter by etch back {{is an easy}} and low cost process to obtain a better blue response from a solar cell. This work suggests that the contact resistance of the selective emitter can be controlled by wet etching with the commercial acid barrier paste that is commonly applied in screen printing. Wet etching conditions such as acid barrier curing time, etchant concentration, and etching time have been optimized for the process, which is controllable as well as fast. The acid barrier formed by screen printing was etched with HF and HNO 3 (1 : 200) solution for 15 s, resulting in high sheet contact resistance of 90 Ω/sq. Doping concentrations of the <b>electrode</b> contact <b>portion</b> were 2 [*]×[*] 1021 cm− 3 in the low sheet resistance (Rs) region and 7 [*]×[*] 1019 cm− 3 in the high Rs region. Solar cells of 12.5 [*]×[*] 12.5 cm 2 in dimensions with a wet etch back selective emitter Jsc of 37 mAcm− 2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 638.3 mV and efficiency of 18.13 % were fabricated. The result showed an improvement of about 13 mV on Voc compared {{to those of the}} reference solar cell fabricated with the reactive-ion etching back selective emitter and with Jsc of 36.90 mAcm− 2, Voc of 625.7 mV, and efficiency of 17.60 %.|$|R
40|$|Terahertz {{technology}} has attracted extensive attention {{because of its}} unique applications in environmental monitoring, space explorations, chemical identification, material characterization, security screening, medical imaging, and biological sensing. In the meantime, the practical feasibility of many terahertz systems is still limited by the low power, low efficiency, and bulky nature of existing terahertz sources. Among various techniques for terahertz generation, photoconduction has demonstrated very promising performance for generating both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) terahertz radiation. Compared to other optically driven terahertz emitters based on nonlinear optical processes, performance of photoconductive terahertz emitters is not constrained by the Manley–Rowe limit and, therefore, can offer significantly higher optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies. In spite of their great promise, the performance of existing photoconductive terahertz emitters is severely limited by poor quantum efficiency of ultrafast photoconductors. This limitation is mainly caused by inefficient collection {{of the majority of}} the photocarriers in a sub-picosecond time scale. To address this limitation, we introduce novel photoconductive terahertz source designs that incorporate plasmonic contact electrodes to offer significantly higher efficiencies compared to conventional designs. By utilizing plasmonic contact <b>electrodes,</b> a large <b>portion</b> of the incident optical pump beam is concentrated and absorbed in close proximity to the plasmonic contact electrodes. Therefore, the average transport path length of photo-generated carriers to the contact electrodes is greatly reduced. As a result, higher photocurrent levels are fed to the terahertz antenna within the oscillation cycle of the terahertz radiation and higher optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies are achieved. We demonstrate record-high optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies as high as 7. 5 %, exhibiting three orders of magnitude higher efficiencies compared to conventional designs. We also demonstrate CW terahertz generation with a radiation frequency tuning range of more than 2 THz and a radiation power of 17 μW at 1 THz, exhibiting a 3 -fold higher radiation power level compared to the state-of-the art. Moreover, we demonstrate an integrated photoconductive terahertz source with compact optical pump sources, which offers a very promising solution for future high-performance and compact terahertz imaging and sensing systems...|$|R
40|$|Both {{experiments}} and numerical simulations have provided evidence that an initially fully developed two-dimensional boundary layer, {{subjected to a}} sudden spanwise forcing, exhibits a decrease of turbulent quantities such as the Reynolds shear stress, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent friction drag. In past {{experiments and}} investigations, such forcing has traditionally been {{in the form of}} spanwise wall oscillations, spanwise travelling Lorentz forcing, superimposed spanwise pressure gradients and spanwise travelling waves of an inplane flexible wall. The aim of this work is to take the idea a step further and develop an active surface which locally executes the motions described above making such a system more readily deployable. Two surfaces were developed: both executing in-plane local oscillations with amplitude close to or larger than the mean streak spacing in a turbulent flow, but based on two different technologies, electroactive polymers in the dielectric form of actuation and electromagnetic motor forcing. The effect of these two surfaces was confined to wall-normal heights on the order of the linear sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer, and frequency and wavelength similar to those reported in literature. Extensive hot-wire measurements, some PIV measurements and direct measurement of friction drag using a bespoke drag balance are presented for the systematic variation of the relevant parameters for turbulent friction drag reduction. Electroactive polymers (EAP) are able to undergo relatively large deflections at high frequencies. Developments in the field of EAP such as static and dynamic characterisation of the EAP membranes in use in this work, development of robust electrodes and their characterisation, in-house manufacturing of thin silicone membranes and post-processing of pre-built silicone membranes are presented. Numerical studies of the optimum pre-strain values and of the optimum <b>electrode</b> to passive <b>portions</b> width ratios are presented. Actuator development techniques including EAP membrane pre-stretch in a bespoke jig, EAP membrane pre-conditioning to go past the Mullins' effect, electrode preparation procedure and deposition, and frame preparation are presented. Actuator characterisation results including analysis of multi-flash photographs and laser profilometer scans for in-plane and out-plane deflections at different frequencies are also presented.
