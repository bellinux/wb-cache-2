40|$|This study {{deals with}} fuel {{injection}} in kraft recovery boilers used in pulp mills. Black <b>liquor</b> is <b>sprayed</b> into the furnace of a recovery boiler through large splashplate nozzles. The drop size and drop size distribution of black <b>liquor</b> <b>sprays</b> {{have a major}} impact on the operation of a recovery boiler. When they are entrained by upwards-flowing flue gas flow, small droplets form carry-over and cause the fouling of heat transfer surfaces. Large droplets hit the char bed and the walls of the furnace without being adequately dried. In this study, the drop size of black liquor with a high solids content was measured for two types of industrial-scale splashplate nozzles. The mass flow rate was varied between 4. 3 and 6. 1 kg/s and the spraying temperature was varied between 130 - 135 °C. The excess temperature above the elevated boiling point (EBP) varied between 14 - 18 °C. The drop size and drop size distribution of black <b>liquor</b> <b>sprays</b> were measured by an image-analysis-based method. Although the spray consisted of spherical and non-spherical particles, it was assumed that non-spherical particles would form spherical droplets.

40|$|The University of Utah's project 'Investigation of Pressurized Entrained-Flow Kraft Black Liquor Gasification in an Industrially Relevant Environment' (U. S. DOE Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 42261) was a {{response}} to U. S. DOE/NETL solicitation DE-PS 36 - 04 GO 94002, 'Biomass Research and Development Initiative' Topical Area 4 -Kraft Black Liquor Gasification. The project began September 30, 2004. The objective of the project was to improve the understanding of black liquor conversion in high pressure, high temperature reactors that gasify liquor through partial oxidation with either air or oxygen. The physical and chemical characteristics of both the gas and condensed phase were to be studied over the entire range of liquor conversion, and the rates and mechanisms of processes responsible for converting the liquor to its final smelt and syngas products were to be investigated. This would be accomplished by combining fundamental, lab-scale experiments with measurements taken using a new semi-pilot scale pressurized entrained-flow gasifier. As a result of insufficient availability of funds and changes in priority within the Office of Biomass Programs of the U. S. Department of Energy, the research program was terminated in its second year. In total, only half of the budgeted funding was made available for the program, and most of this was used during the first year for construction of the experimental systems {{to be used in the}} program. This had a severe impact on the program. As a consequence, most of the planned research was unable to be performed. Only studies that relied on computational modeling or existing experimental facilities started early enough to deliver useful results by the time to program was terminated Over the course of the program, small scale (approx. 1 ton/day) entrained-flow gasifier was designed and installed at the University of Utah's off-campus Industrial Combustion and Gasification Research Facility. The system is designed to operate at pressures as high as 32 atmospheres, and at temperatures as high as 1500 C (2730 F). Total black liquor processing capacity under pressurized, oxygen-blown conditions should be in excess of 1 ton black liquor solids per day. Many sampling ports along the conversion section of the system will allow detailed analysis of the environment in the gasifier under industrially representative conditions. Construction was mostly completed before the program was terminated, but resources were insufficient to operate the system. A system for characterizing black <b>liquor</b> <b>sprays</b> in hot environments was designed and constructed. Silhouettes of black <b>liquor</b> <b>sprays</b> formed by injection of black liquor through a twin fluid (liquor and atomizing air) nozzle were videoed with a high-speed camera, and the resulting images were analyzed to identify overall characteristics of the spray and droplet formation mechanisms. The efficiency of liquor atomization was better when the liquor was injected through the center channel of the nozzle, with atomizing air being introduced in the annulus around the center channel, than when the liquor and air feed channels were reversed. Atomizing efficiency and spray angle increased with atomizing air pressure up to a point, beyond which additional atomizing air pressure had little effect. Analysis of the spray patterns indicates that two classifications of droplets are present, a finely dispersed 'mist' of very small droplets and much larger ligaments of liquor that form at the injector tip and form one or more relatively large droplets. This ligament and subsequent large droplet formation suggests that it will be challenging to obtain a narrow distribution of droplet sizes when using an injector of this design. A model for simulating <b>liquor</b> <b>spray</b> and droplet formation was developed by Simulent, Inc. of Toronto. The model was able to predict performance when spraying water that closely matched the vendor specifications. Simulation of <b>liquor</b> <b>spray</b> indicates that droplets on the order 200 - 300 microns can be expected, and that higher liquor flow will result in better distribution of liquor in the reactor...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the potential causes {{and management of}} the clusters of diffuse lamellar keratitis(DLK) after laser corneal refractive surgery. METHODS: The study enrolled 98 eyes(53 patients) complicated with DLK after receiving laser in situ keratomileusis(LASIK), FS-LASIK or small-incision lenticule extraction(SMILE) in our center from February 10 th, 2016 to February 22 th, 2016. They were given clinical classification treatments according to corneal layer inflammatory extent and then followed up after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 d and 1 mo. RESULTS: The clusters of DLK occurred 5 times in the study period. The incidence and degree of DLK significantly decreased after changed the sterilization, surgical equipments, temperature and humidity of the operating room. There were 80 eyes(82 %) had stage 1 DLK, 11 eyes(11 %) had stage 2, 4 eyes(4 %) had stage 3 and 3 eyes(3 %) had stage 4. The incidence of DLK after FS-LASIK was 40 %(79 eyes in 42 patients), that after LASIK assistant by Hastome keratome was 45 %(10 eyes in 5 patients), that after SMILE was 20 %(9 eyes in 6 patients).

In this paper, spray properties in an operating furnace were studied with the unique furnace endoscope developed at the HUT. The velocity, the shape {{and the length of}} the black liquor sheet were measured with this furnace endoscope in five operating recovery boiler furnaces by using a multiple exposure CCD-camera and an image-analysis-system. Mass flux varied between 4 and 14 g/mm 2 s. When firing at more than 7 °C above the atmospheric boiling point it was observed that the lower the mass flux the higher the rate of flashing. When flashing occurs, the sheet velocity may be accelerated by a factor of 3. 4. No droplets were observed, only ligaments and large fragments of the sheet within the limits of the operation range (2 m) of the endoscope. When the liquor sheet was formed, two main sheet break-up mechanisms were observed, i. e. perforated-sheet disintegration and wave disintegration. In the case of flashing, the sheet break-up mechanism was different. The comparison between results from the test chamber and furnace showed that the spray properties in both environments depend on same main parameters, i. e. on the difference between the firing temperature and atmospheric boiling point {{as well as on the}} mass flux...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion {{for reducing the}} solid content of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) was compared using a conventional single pass reactor (SPR) and a two stage anaerobic-aerobic process. The first stage of the two stage system used an anaerobic hydraulic flush reactor (HFR) in which the solids and liquid retention times were decoupled by retention of solids within the system. The purpose of the hydraulic flush was to wash out rapidly the fermentation intermediates from the anaerobic reactor and thus prevent their accumulation; these were subsequently removed in the second stage aerobic activated sludge system, the effluent from which was then used as the <b>flush</b> <b>liquor</b> to the first stage. The hydraulic flush reactor was operated at hydraulic (liquid) retention times of 2, 3 and 4 days with solids retention times of 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 days. In all cases the total solid content in the feed was 10 % giving loading rates to the reactor in the range 3 to 21 kg total solids per m 3 day; this same loading range {{was used in the}} single pass reactor. At high loadings the SPR system showed an accumulation of volatile fatty acids, peaking at 13000 mg 1 - 1, which resulted in process failure and cessation of solids destruction.
