5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype <b>hygrometers</b> were devised and {{developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

Calibration standards for the most accurate measurement include the gravimetric <b>hygrometer,</b> chilled mirror <b>hygrometer,</b> and electrolytic <b>hygrometer.</b> The gravimetric method, while the most accurate, is very cumbersome. For fast and very accurate measurement the chilled mirror method is effective.|$|R

25|$|Evaporative cooling is {{restricted}} by atmospheric conditions. Humidity {{is the amount}} of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as <b>hygrometers.</b> The measurements are usually expressed as specific humidity or percent relative humidity. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition {{is often referred to as}} complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30Â°C.|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{have studied}} the {{characteristics}} of cirrus using several different methods. One, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), gives highly accurate information on the cloud's altitude, length, and width. Balloon-carried <b>hygrometers</b> give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure {{the depth of the}} cloud. Radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds. Another data source is satellite measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) program. These satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes, then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day. During the night, it determines cirrus cover by detecting the Earth's infrared emissions. The cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground, thus enabling satellites to see the [...] "shadow" [...] it casts into space. Visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds.|$|E
2500|$|Lithium {{chloride}} {{is used as}} {{a relative}} humidity standard in the calibration of <b>hygrometers.</b> [...] At [...] a saturated solution (45.8%) of the salt will yield an equilibrium relative humidity of 11.30%. Additionally, lithium chloride can itself be used as a hygrometer. This deliquescent salt forms a self-solution when exposed to air.

The percent relative humidity at [...] can be estimated, with minimal error in the range , from the following first order equation: RH=107.93-2.11C, where C is solution LiCl concentration, percent by mass.|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the small}} amounts of water vapor, the {{potential}} for rapid changes, and the very cold temperatures in the upper troposphere, moisture measuring instruments face several problems related to calibration and response. Calculations of eddy moisture fluxes are, therefore, subject to significant uncertainty. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the importance of latent heat (moisture) fluxes due to small and larger mesoscale circulations in comparison to radiative fluxes within cirrus. Scale separation is made at about 1 km because of significant changes in the structures within cirrus. Only observations at warmer than - 40 C are used in this study. The EG&G <b>hygrometer</b> that is used for measuring dewpoint temperature (Td) is believed to be fairly accurate down to - 40 C. On the other hand, Lyman-Alpha (L-alpha) <b>hygrometer</b> measurements of moisture may include large drift errors. In order to compensate for these drift errors, the L-alpha <b>hygrometer</b> is often calibrated against the EG&G <b>hygrometer.</b> However, large errors ensue for Td measurements at temperatures less than - 40 C. The cryogenic <b>hygrometer</b> frost point measurements may be used to calibrate L-alpha measurements at temperatures less than - 40 C. In this study, however, measurements obtained by EG&G <b>hygrometer</b> and L-alpha measurements are used for the flux calculations...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of reliable, reasonably accurate and relatively inexpensive estimates of sensible heat and latent energy fluxes was investigated using a commercial combination thin-film polymer capacitive relative humidity and adjacent temperature sensor instrument. Long-term and unattended {{water vapour pressure}} profile difference measurements using low-power combination instruments were compared with those from a cooled dewpoint mirror <b>hygrometer,</b> the latter often used with Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems. An error analysis, based on instrument relative humidity and temperature errors, was applied for various capacitive humidity instrument models. The main disadvantage of a combination capacitive humidity instrument is that two measurements, relative humidity and temperature, are required for estimation of water vapour pressure as opposed to one for a dewpoint <b>hygrometer.</b> In a laboratory experiment using an automated procedure, water vapour pressure differences generated using a reference dewpoint generator were measured using a commercial model (Dew- 10) dewpoint <b>hygrometer</b> and a combination capacitive humidity instrument. The laboratory measurement comparisons showed that, potentially, an inexpensive model combination capacitive humidity instrument (CS 500 or HMP 50), or for improved results a slightly more expensive model (HMP 35 C or HMP 45 C), could substitute for the more expensive dewpoint <b>hygrometer.</b> In a field study, in a mesic grassland, the water vapour pressure measurement noise for the combination capacitive humidity instruments was greater than that for the dewpoint <b>hygrometer.</b> The average water vapour pressure profile difference measured using a HMP 45 C was highly correlated with that from a dewpoint <b>hygrometer</b> with a slope less than unity. Water vapour pressure measurements using the capacitive humidity instruments were not as accurate, compared to those obtained using a dewpoint <b>hygrometer,</b> but the resolution magnitudes for the profile difference measurements were less than the minimum of 0. 01 kPa required for BREB measurements when averaged over 20 min. Furthermore, the longer-term capacitive humidity measurements are more reliable and not dependent on a sensor bias adjustment {{as is the case}} for the dewpoint <b>hygrometer.</b> A field comparison of CS 500 and HMP 45 C profile water vapour pressure differences yielded a slope of close to unity. However, the CS 500 exhibited more variable water vapour pressure measurements mainly due to its increased variation in temperature measurements compared to the HMP 45 C. Comparisons between 20 -min BREB sensible heat fluxes obtained using a HMP 45 C and a dewpoint <b>hygrometer</b> yielded a slope of almost unity. BREB sensible heat fluxes measured using a HMP 45 C were reasonably well correlated with those obtained using a surface-layer scintillometer and eddy covariance (slope of 0. 9629 and 0. 9198 respectively). This reasonable agreement showed that a combination capacitive humidity instrument, with similar relative humidity (RH) and temperature error magnitudes of at most 2 % RH and 0. 3 Â°C respectively, and similar measurement time response, would be an adequate and less expensive substitute for a dewpoint <b>hygrometer.</b> Furthermore, a combination capacitive humidity instrument requires no servicing compared to a dewpoint <b>hygrometer</b> which requires a bias adjustment and mirror cleaning each week. These findings make unattended BREB measurements of sensible heat flux and evaporation cheaper and more reliable with the system easier to assemble and service and with reduced instrument power...|$|R
