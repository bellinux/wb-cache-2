5000|$|Donna Karan's {{mainline}} label Donna Karan New York, {{also referred}} as Donna Karan Collection, debuted for fall 1985 with the women's collection Seven Easy Pieces, [...] "where {{a handful of}} <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items</b> work together to create an entire wardrobe that goes from day to evening, week day to weekend, season to season". In July 1991 she launched her first menswear collection.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{manufacturers}} of millwork goods. In one, referred to as [...] "stock millwork", commodity fabricators mass-produce trims and building components—with the end product being low cost, <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items</b> for commercial or home builders. In another, the product is custom produced for individuals or individual building projects—usually a costlier option which is referred to as [...] "architectural millwork." ...|$|E
5000|$|The term {{is widely}} used in the British and American fashion media, and {{has been the subject}} of several popular {{television}} series. The term has come to refer to a collection of clothing that is composed of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items</b> only, to maximise the number of outfits that can be created. The aim is to have an outfit suitable for any occasion without owning excessive items of clothing. This is usually achieved by buying what are considered to be [...] "key" [...] or [...] "staple" [...] items in coordinating colours.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecommender Systems (RS) pre-select and filter {{information}} {{according to}} the needs and preferences of the user. Users express their interest in items by giving their opinion (explicit data) and navigating through the webpages (implicit data). In order to personalize users experience, recommender systems exploit this data by offering the items that the user could be more interested in. However, most of the RS do not deal with domain independency and scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable and reliable recommender system based on semantic data and Matrix Factorization. The former increases the recommendations quality and domain independency. The latter offers scalability by distributing treatments over several machines. Consequently, our proposition offers quality in user's personalization in <b>interchangeable</b> <b>item's</b> environments, but also alleviates the system by balancing load among distributed machines...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} class of bias {{problems}} that arise when purchasers shift their expenditures among sellers charging different prices for units of precisely defined and <b>interchangeable</b> product <b>items</b> that are nevertheless regarded as different {{for the purposes of}} price measurement. For business-to-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Import Price Index (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input Price Index (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of promotional sales or among retailers charging different per unit prices, this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias. We recommend alternatives to conventional price indexes that make use of unit values over precisely defined and <b>interchangeable</b> product <b>items.</b> We argue that our proposed ideal target indexes could greatly reduce these biases and make use of increasingly available electronic scanner data on prices and quantities. We also address the challenges national statistics agencies must surmount to produce price index measures more like th...|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{games of}} its type, armor and weapons in Spellborn didnt provide any {{statistical}} {{improvements to the}} players character. Instead, they served aesthetic purposes. Players could choose their characters appearance {{at the beginning of}} the game, and could change it later by using different items with higher requirements. Players could enhance their gear with Sigils. These enhancements were <b>interchangeable</b> between different <b>items.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The NXI {{design study}} {{incorporated}} many innovative features, {{and attempted to}} make use of interchangeable front and rear components (the symmetrical door skins were the only <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items</b> that made it into production). Although more complex, the new vehicle also incorporated Nash's advanced single-unit (monocoque) construction. It was displayed at a number of [...] "surviews" [...] (survey/previews), commencing on 4 January 1950 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, to gauge the reaction of the American motoring public to a car of this size. The result of these surviews convinced Nash that there was indeed a market for such a car, if it could be built at a competitive price.|$|E
50|$|In July 2016 French luxury giant LVMH, {{which has}} owned Karan’s company since 2001, {{even though she}} stayed on to run the brands — shelved her {{flagship}} line Donna Karan International shortly after she left in June 2015 {{and said it would}} “substantially increase its focus” on her DKNY brand, which revolutionized women’s fashion in the ’80s with Karan’s “Seven Easy Pieces” concept of a wardrobe made up of a handful of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items.</b> Today she is looking to sell off its Donna Karan business, {{less than a year after}} the fashion designer stepped down from her namesake brand. LVMH is targeting a “single, specific American buyer” for both the DKNY and Donna Karan International businesses after several “months of disappointing performance” under its new designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osbourne.|$|E
5000|$|Attributes, {{along with}} their {{respective}} talents are leveled up by spending a specific amount of [...] "Glory". Glory is gained by the player through completing quests, discovering new locations and defeating enemies. Individual talents however can also be leveled up {{through the use of}} certain items, some with permanent or only temporary boosts. This is additional to different <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items</b> of clothing and jewelry, each with their own talent improvements and levels of defense. Certain other skills can also be learned by receiving lessons and advice from skill specific trainer characters found throughout the game world. Each skill/talent however requires a certain level attribute to already be met while also often at times an amount of in-game gold to be given. Like glory, gold is accumulated through progression while also through selling items to vendors who can also sell items at the same time. Trainer skills include useful abilities such as kicking over opponents, training monkeys and parrots to steal and distract foes, along with alchemy, gunsmithing and forging that allows the players to create talents boosting potions and new weapons made from materials found or bought throughout the game. Other abilities include the use of a voodoo doll to take direct control of other characters or rituals to weaken opponents.|$|E
40|$|Muckstadt, and Carol Shilepsky have {{conducted}} {{research on the}} inter-changeability/substitutability problem for recoverable items (items that are subject to repair when they fail). This problem arises when,e recoverable items can be substituted for one another during the repair of an assembly. The long range objective of the research project {{is to develop a}} method that the Air Force can use to assist in the management of 0 <b>interchangeable</b> recoverable <b>items.</b> To accomplish this goal we have proposed to analyze several simplified problems that will give us-insight into the form of the optimal or near-optimal policy for the U oj real problem. Specifically, we proposed: CJ (a) to understand fully the behavior of a single-echelon, two-item system over an infinite horizon when the failure processes for the items are independent, stationary Poisson processes and the repair times are exponential; Cb) to develop methods for finding optimal and near-optimal policies for the situation described in (a) ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods for}} optimal test {{construction}} from item banks {{have recently been}} proposed using information functions. The main problem with these methods is {{the large amount of}} time required to identify an optimal test. In this paper, a new method is presented for the Rasch model that considers groups of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>items,</b> instead of individual items. The process of item clustering is described, the cluster-based test construction model is outlined, and the computational procedure and results are given. Results indicate that this method produces accurate results in small amounts of time.
