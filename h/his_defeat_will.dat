500|$|The Flood {{reappear}} in the Halo 3 mission [...] "Floodgate", {{on board}} a damaged ship that escapes the quarantine around Delta Halo. While the infestation of Earth is prevented by the cauterisation of the only site of outbreak, in the East African continent, Gravemind follows Master Chief and his allies to the Ark aboard the infested High Charity. Though the Master Chief and Arbiter form a tenuous alliance with the Flood to stop the activation of all the Halo rings, {{as soon as the}} firing sequence is stopped Gravemind turns on them. The Master Chief fights his way to the center of High Charity, freeing Cortana and destroying the city, but Gravemind attempts to rebuild himself on the ring under construction by the Ark. Realizing that lighting the ring will destroy only the local Flood infestation and spare the galaxy, the Master Chief, Arbiter, Cortana and Sergeant Johnson proceed to Halo's control room, activate the ring, and escape. However, because the ring is unfinished, the firing causes it to destroy itself, damaging the Ark in the process. In his presumed final moments, the Gravemind telepathically addresses the Master Chief and the Arbiter, warning them that <b>his</b> <b>defeat</b> <b>will</b> only delay the Flood's goal of consuming all sentient life. Halo3 added new capabilities to the Flood, including the ability for the parasite to infect enemies in real time. The Flood are also seen to produce a mutable [...] "pure form" [...] which can mutate into several other Flood types.|$|E

50|$|If {{the player}} took fifteen or fewer days {{to reach the}} second chamber on {{the stairs to the}} Castle Keep, they will arrive before Charles Vincent (thus {{triggering}} the good ending). After fighting the vampire disguised as Dracula they will encounter Malus, who transforms into an adult and defeat him atop the Clock Tower. After <b>his</b> <b>defeat,</b> Malus <b>will</b> regain the form of a child. Attempting to dupe the hero, he will pretend to have no recollection of the battle, but Vincent will arrive and douse the boy with holy water. Vincent explains that Malus was not possessed, but was in fact Dracula reincarnate. Malus then transports the hero to an alternate realm to battle his true form, a centipedal dragon. After Dracula's <b>defeat</b> the player <b>will</b> receive one of the good endings: in Carrie's ending, she places a nosegay on her stepmother's grave. In Reinhardt's ending, Rosa, who sacrificed herself for him atop the Room of Clocks, is revived and her humanity restored.|$|R

25|$|Saṅkaṭa (Hindi: सङ्कट, meaning Adversity): The poet {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} adversity, which is a test for friendship, skill, intellect, and virtues. Aṣṭāvakra's body becomes {{like that of the}} egg of a turtle. Kahola starts repenting for his action of cursing the child. The sin of the Ṛṣi manifests as a drought in the forest, and all the disciples of Kahola leave the Āśrama. The birds and animals in the forest start dying out of hunger and thirst. Sujātā asks Kahola to go to the Yajña of Janaka and get some wealth by defeating the assembly of the wise in a scriptural debate. Kahola goes to Mithilā against his wishes, and is beaten in the debate by Bandī, the son of Varuṇa, who then immerses Kahola under water in the Varuṇapāśa. In the forest, Sujātā gives birth to a boy. Uddālaka comes to the aid of Sujātā and tells her about the fate of Kahola, asking her to keep this secret from her child, as the knowledge of <b>his</b> father's <b>defeat</b> <b>will</b> be a hurdle in the growth of the child. Uddālaka performs the Jātakarman Saṃskāra of the infant. The child is called Aṣṭavakra (having eight limbs deformed) by everybody, but Uddālaka names him Aṣṭāvakra, with the meanings as explained here. The canto ends with Aṣṭāvakra starting to grow in the Āśrama of his maternal grandfather.|$|R
