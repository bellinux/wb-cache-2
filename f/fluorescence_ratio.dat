40|$|Fluorescence energy {{transfer}} from dehydroergosterol (DHE) to dansylated lecithin (DL) {{was used to}} characterize lecithin-cholesterol vesicles {{in the presence of}} the bile salt, sodium taurocholate. At lipid concentrations approximating physiological levels, exposure of fluorescently labeled vesicles to the bile salt led to a dose-dependent increase in the DHE-to-DL <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> during the first 24 h after mixing. The initial changes in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> correlated well with conventional turbidity measurements that quantify partial micellization of vesicles as a function of bile salt loading. In addition, fluorescence {{energy transfer}} from DHE to DL revealed cholesterol enrichment of vesicles and re-vesiculation of micelles at bile salt loadings for which vesicles and micelles coexisted. Samples containing the cholesterol-enriched vesicle fraction exhibited further increases in the DHE-to-DL <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> during a 4 -week observation period but only after a significant lag period of several days. The lag period decreased with cholesterol loading, and the increase in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> always preceded the appearance of microscopic, birefringent, either needlelike or platelike, cholesterol crystals, in samples that were initially supersaturated with cholesterol. Cholesterol crystals were not observed, and the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> did not increase, for any sample that was undersaturated with cholesterol. Taken together, these results suggest that the latter changes in fluorescence are the result of cholesterol nucleation.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} Forster {{resonance energy}} transfer from dehydroergosterol to dansylated lecithin in lecithin-cholesterol vesicles and characterize the vesicles {{in the presence}} of the pro-nucleating enzyme, phospholipase C (PLC). Exposure to phospholipase C causes a temporary decrease in the dehydroergosterol to dansyl <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> followed by an increase to and above the initial value. The temporary decrease in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> results from an increase in the dansylated lecithin intensity that coincides with a dansyl blue shift. The extent of the blue shift correlates with the level of diacylglycerol generated in situ by PLC, suggesting an increased association between dansylated lecithin and cholesterol as membrane fluidity increases and membrane polarity decreases. The subsequent increase in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> results from both an increase in the dehydroergsterol intensity and a concomitant decrease in the dansylated lecithin intensity of equal magnitude. This signifies a reduction in energy transfer from dehydroergosterol to dansylated lecithin and indicates an increased separation between the two fluorophores. The increase in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> persists beyond the time scales for vesicle aggregation and fusion, as measured by turbidity, and precedes the onset of macroscopic cholesterol crystals observed with an optical microscope. Thus, the increased separation between dehydroergosterol and dansylated lecithin is consistent with a mechanism of cholesterol nucleation from the vesicles. Moreover, the onset and rate of increase in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> correlate with the cholesterol:lecithin mole ratio of the vesicles. Fluorescence energy transfer from dehydroergosterol to dansylated lecithin therefore shows potential as a methodology for measuring cholesterol nucleation in model bile. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Total {{resection}} of glioblastoma, {{the highly}} malignant brain tumor, {{is difficult to}} accomplish due to its diffuse growth and similarity to the surrounding brain tissue. A total resection is proven to increase patient survival. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate fiber-optical based fluorescence spectroscopy for quantitative demarcation of malignant brain tumors during the surgery. Five-aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) {{was used as a}} fluorescence contrast agent that accumulated as protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the tumor. The method was evaluated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Linköping University Hospital. The patients (n =  22) received an oral dose of 5  mg/kg body weight 5 -ALA two hours prior to craniotomy. Measurements with a developed fluorescence spectroscopy system were performed under the general procedure of surgery. The collected fluorescence spectra were quantified by defining a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> and the main challenges of measuring and quantifying spectra were investigated. The <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> was compared to visual diagnosis of the surgeon, histopathological examination and ultrasound-based neuronavigation. The main challenges of using a fluorescence spectroscopy system in the operating room were the disturbing ambient light, photobleaching and blood interference which affect the signal quantification. The superimposition of ambient light was removed by modulating the system. Using principal component analysis (PCA) the photobleaching sequences could be described by three spectral components of autofluorescence, PpIX fluorescence and blue-shift. To investigate the photobleaching induced prior to the measurements, a dynamic model was developed based on the PCA derived spectral components. Modulation and increased power of the excitation light resulted in a faster photobleaching; however, photobleaching was saturated at higher excitation powers. The system was adjusted to induce minimal photobleaching. In addition, effect of blood absorption on the fluorescence spectrum was investigated experimentally by placing blood drops on skin and theoretically by using Beer-Lambert law. The theoretical model was used to compensate for the distorted <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio.</b> According to the theoretical model of blood interference, a total 300  µm blood layer blocked the brain fluorescence signal totally and when the fluorescence signal was partially blocked, the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> was overestimated. The <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> was corrected for blood layers thinner than 50  µm. The tissue in and around the tumor was categorized into necrosis, low and high grade tumor and gliosis. The median <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> confirmed with histopathological examination (n =  45) had a lower <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> for low grade malignancies (0. 3) than high grade malignancies (2. 4) (p <  0. 05). Gliosis (1. 6) and necrosis (1. 0) showed a moderate <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio.</b> Ultrasound-based navigation in combination with fluorescence spectroscopy showed improvement in the results; however, a more extensive study is needed to confirm benefits of the method combination. In conclusion, fluorescence spectroscopy of 5 -ALA induced PpIX provided an objective method for differentiating tumor from the healthy tissue intra-operatively.

Because of the nature of exponential calculation, slight errors are multiplied and the variations of the results seem too large. We have developed a new PCR data point analysis strategy for allele ratio quantification based on normalized <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio.</b> Results In our method, initial reaction background fluorescence was determined based upon fitting of raw fluorescence data to four-parametric sigmoid function. After that, each fluorescence data point was first subtracted by respective background fluorescence and then each subtracted fluorescence data point was divided by the specific background fluorescence to get normalized fluorescence. By relating the normalized <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> to the premixed known allele ratio of two alleles in standard samples, standard linear regression equation was generated, from which unknown specimens allele ratios were extrapolated using the measured normalized <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio.</b> In this article, we have compared the results of the proposed method with those of baseline subtracted <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> method and conventional Ct method.

40|$|Comparative genomic in situ {{hybridization}} (CGH) {{provides a}} new possibility for searching genomes for imbalanced genetic material. Labeled genomic test DNA, prepared from clinical or tumor specimens, is mixed with differently labeled control DNA prepared from cells with normal chromosome complements. The mixed probe is used for chromosomal in situ suppression (CISS) hybridization to normal metaphase spreads (CGH-metaphase spreads). Hybridized test and control DNA sequences are detected via different fluorochromes, e. g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetraethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC). The ratios of FITC/TRITC fluorescence intensities for each chromosome or chromosome segment should then reflect its relative copy number in the test genome compared with the control genome, e. g., 0. 5 for monosomies, 1 for disomies, 1. 5 for trisomies, etc. Initially, model experiments were designed to test the accuracy of <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> measurements on single chromosomes. DNAs from up to five human chromosome-specific plasmid libraries were labeled with biotin and digoxigenin in different hapten proportions. Probe mixtures were used for CISS hybridization to normal human metaphase spreads and detected with FITC and TRITC. An epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charge coupled device (CCD) camera was used for image acquisition. Procedures for <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> measurements were developed {{on the basis of}} commercial image analysis software. For hapten ratios 4 / 1, 1 / 1 and 1 / 4, <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> values measured for individual chromosomes {{could be used as a}} single reliable parameter for chromosome identification.

Subsequently, genomic test DNAs, prepared from a patient with Down syndrome, from blood of a patient with Tcell prolymphocytic leukemia, and from cultured cells of a renal papillary carcinoma cell line, were applied in CGH experiments. As expected, significant differences in the fluorescence ratios could be measured for chromosome types present in different copy numbers in these test genomes, including a trisomy of chromosome 21, the smallest autosome of the human complement. In addition, chromosome material involved in partial gains and losses of the different tumors could be mapped to their normal chromosome counterparts in CGH-metaphase spreads. An alternative and simpler evaluation procedure based on visual inspection of CCD images of CGH-metaphase spreads also yielded consistent results from several independent observers.

40|$|Ratiometric imaging of styryl {{potentiometric}} dyes {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the potential gradient inside the membrane (intramembrane potential), which is the sum of contributions from transmembrane potential, dipole potential, and the difference in the surface potentials at both sides of the membrane. Here changes in intramembrane potential of the bilayer membranes in two different preparations, lipid vesicles and individual N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma cells, are calculated from the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratios</b> of di- 4 -ANEPPS and di- 8 -ANEPPS as a function of divalent cation concentration. In lipid vesicles formed from the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) or from a mixture of the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and PC, di- 4 -ANEPPS produces similar spectral changes in response to both divalent cation-induced changes in intramembrane potential and transmembrane potential. The changes in potential on addition of divalent cations measured by the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratios</b> of di- 4 -ANEPPS are consistent with a change in surface potential that can be modeled with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory. The derived intrinsic 1 : 1 association constants of Ba and Mg with PC are 1. 0 and 0. 4 M− 1; the intrinsic 1 : 1 association constants of Ba and Mg with PS are 1. 9 and 1. 8 M− 1. Ratiometric measurements of voltage sensitive dyes also allow monitoring of intramembrane potentials in living cells. In neuroblastoma cells, a tenfold increase of concentration of Ba, Mg, and Ca gives a decrease in intramembrane potential of 22 to 24 mV. The observed changes in potential could also be described by Gouy-Chapman theory. A surface charge density of 1 e−/ 115 Å 2 provides the best fit and the intrinsic 1 : 1 association constants of Ba, Mg, and Ca with acidic group in the surface are 1. 7, 6. 1, and 25. 3 M− 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there is}} great {{interest}} {{in the development of}} polymer blend morphology arising from processing to control the properties of blends. A non-destructive technique, non-radiative energy transfer (NRET), was utilized to investigate polymer blend mixing ex and in situ. Donor (naphthyl) labeled polymers and acceptor (anthryl) labeled polymers were segregated to either phase domain limiting NRET to the interphase, and therefore permitting superior spatial resolution than obtained by other techniques such as light scattering. Observed donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities were correlated to respective concentrations, sample geometry, and interphase volume using a fluorescence model derived from the Beer-Lambert Law and Förster 2 ̆ 7 s description of NRET between a single donor-acceptor chromophore pair. Particular attention was devoted to the phenomena of direct chromophore excitation, NRET, and radiative energy transfer. ^ The model was used to interpret experiments on the two determinant attributes of polymer mixing: interphase thickness and interphase area. Relative interphase thickness comparisons via polymer interdiffusion in a miscible blend of donor-labeled polystyrene and acceptor-labeled polystyrene indicated increasing ratios of acceptor fluorescence to donor fluorescence resulting from (1) longer diffusion time and (2) higher temperatures. Interphase area effects in an immiscible donor-labeled poly(methyl methacrylate) /acceptor-labeled polystyrene blend revealed a linear relationship between interphase area and donor to acceptor <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio.</b> Further interphase area investigation revealed that as the ratio of interphase area to sample volume increases, the resulting donor to acceptor <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> approaches that of a homogenous mixed sample of equivalent thickness and dye concentration. ^ The observed <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> response to mixing was utilized to interpret two commercial applications: interphase contact and random immiscible blend mixing. Improved contact between a donor-labeled poly(methyl methacrylate) film and an acceptor-labeled polystyrene film were observed via significant increases in acceptor to donor fluorescence ratios that can only arise from NRET between donor and acceptor moieties in the interphase region. Acceptor to donor <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> responses to random mixing of commercial polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) in a commercial mixer indicate interphase area differences resulting from morphology changes. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of trifluoromethylphenylimidazole (TRIM) on tone, and calcium entry, in mouse anococcygeus stimulated by either thapsigargin (Tg; 100 [*]nM) which activates capacitative calcium entry (CCE), or high K (60 [*]mM) which activates voltage-operated calcium channels. TRIM (1 [*]–[*] 333 [*]μM) produced concentration-related relaxation of Tg-induced tone (EC 50, 42 [*]μM) but was much less effective against high K. In single smooth muscle cells loaded with FURA- 2, TRIM reduced the increase in <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> produced by Tg but had no effect on that produced by high K. The relaxations of Tg-induced tone, and reduction in <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio,</b> were obtained in the presence of L-NG-nitroarginine and were thus independent of nitric oxide synthase inhibition; further, TRIM had no discernible effect on nitrergic responses. TRIM provides a novel drug for the selective inhibition of CCE and a template for the development of more potent inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} channel-forming peptide {{gramicidin}} A on the dipole potential of phospholipid monolayers and bilayers has been studied. Surface pressure and surface potential isotherms of monolayers have been {{measured with a}} Langmuir trough equipped with a Wilhelmy balance and a surface potential meter (Kelvin probe). Gramicidin {{has been shown to}} shift pressure-area isotherms of phospholipids and to reduce their monolayer surface potentials. Both effects increase with the increase in gramicidin concentration and depend on the kind of phosphatidylcholine used. Application of the dual-wavelength ratiometric fluorescence method using the potential-sensitive dye RH 421 has revealed that the addition of gramicidin A to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes leads to a decrease in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> of RH 421. This is similar to the effect of phloretin, which is known to decrease the dipole potential. The comparison of the concentration dependences of the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratio</b> for gramicidin and phloretin shows that gramicidin is as potent as phloretin in modifying the membrane dipole potential...|$|E
40|$|Alkali metal atoms show {{an intense}} natural {{fluorescence}} in the burned gas region of internal combustion engines. This fluorescence offers {{great opportunity for}} spectroscopic combustion analysis in internal combustion engines without the requirement of laser excitation or image intensifiers. To quantify this fluorescence intensity, spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of the alkali metals lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs) and their oxidation products and ions were analyzed. Collisional energy transfer and reabsorption effects (including temperature- and pressure dependent lineshapes) were calculated over the range of engine environments. Three compounds containing Li, Na and K, respectively, were selected as fuel additives for engine experiments. The experiments were conducted on an optical, single cylinder, spark-ignition, direct-injection research engine, and the fluorescence of the three alkali components was recorded simultaneously using three CMOS high-speed cameras. The two-component <b>fluorescence</b> intensity <b>ratios</b> (Na/K, Li/K and Na/Li) are shown to depend on temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio. However, the three-component ratio Na•Li/K 2 is nearly independent of pressure and equivalence ratio in the tested range of operating conditions and {{can serve as a}} direct marker for burned gas temperature. Subsequently, equivalence ratio can be determined from any of the bi-component <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratios.</b> The spatially integrated fluorescence intensity of the single components is a function of burned gas temperature, cylinder pressure, equivalence ratio and mass fraction of burned fuel. When temperature and equivalence ratio are determined from the <b>fluorescence</b> intensity <b>ratios,</b> the spatially integrated fluorescence signal of sodium can serve as a marker for the mass fraction of burned fuel. The tool was applied to various cases of direct injected, stratified engine combustion to illustrate the potential of this technique for optimization of the combustion strategy and engine hardware configuration...|$|R
40|$|The role of iron in {{regulating}} light harvesting and photochemical energy conversion processes was {{examined in the}} marine unicellular chlorophyte Dunaliella tertiolecta and the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In both species, iron limitation led {{to a reduction in}} cellular chlorophyll concentrations, but an increase in the in vivo, chlorophyll-specific, optical absorption cross-sections. Moreover, the absorption cross-section of photosystem II, a measure of the photon target area of the traps, was higher in iron-limited cells and decreased rapidly following iron addition. Iron-limited cells exhibited reduced variable/maximum <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratios</b> and a reduced fluorescence per unit absorption at all wave-lengths between 400 and 575 nm. Following iron addition, variable/maximum <b>fluorescence</b> <b>ratios</b> increased rapidly, reaching 90 % of the maximum within 18 to 25 h. Thus, although more light was absorbed per unit of chlorophyll, iron limitation reduced the transfer efficiency of excitation energy in photosystem II. The half-time for the oxidation of primary electron acceptor of photosystem II, calculated from the kinetics of decay of variable maximum fluorescence, increased 2 -fold under iron limitation. Quantitative analysis of western blots revealed that cytochrome f and subunit IV (the plastoquinone-docking protein) of the cytochrome b 6 /f complex were also significantly reduced by lack of iron; recovery from iron limitation was completely inhibited by either cycloheximide or chloramphenicol. The recovery of maximum photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency occurs in three stages: (a) a rapid (3 - 5 h) increase in electron transfer rates on the acceptor side of photosystem II correlated with de novo synthesis of the cytochrome b 6 /f complex; (b) an increase (10 - 15 h) in the quantum efficiency correlated with an increase in D 1 accumulation; and (c) a slow (> 18 h) increase in chlorophyll levels accompanied by an increase in the efficiency of energy transfer from the light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins to the reaction centers...|$|R
