The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research {{has been carried out}} on the species, especially <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies</b> involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E
40|$|<b>Feasibility</b> <b>study</b> is {{essential}} {{to be carried out}} at the early stage of project life cycle before entering into actual construction works. However, there are abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> occurred in construction industry in which this issue is seldom being given attention by the developers. Hence, there are four objectives in this research that aims to be achieved, which include to identify the causes of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry, {{to determine the effects of}} abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry, to highlight the types of abuses occurred in <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry, and to examine the relationship between the causes and effects of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry. The respondents of this research are developers who are the REHDA (Real Estate and Housing Developers‘ Association) members in Johor, Malaysia. The research data are collected by using postal questionnaires to 109 developers in Johor, Malaysia. Statistical analysis is used for data analysis in this research. For achieving first three research objectives, mean frequencies are used, whereas for achieving the fourth research objective, Pearson correlation is used. The results of data analysis showed that there are occurrences of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> where types of abuses occurred in <b>feasibility</b> <b>study,</b> causes and effects of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry are determined and ranked according to their mean frequencies. In addition, the findings of this research also showed that there are positive and significant relationships between the causes and effects of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study.</b> As conclusion, the developers and project team should aware of the issue of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry. Besides that, the developers and project team should also alert to the causes of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in order to avoid from suffering of bearing the effects of abuses of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> in construction industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{needs of}} <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report is {{important}} in the new era of development. Problem from the ineffective <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> has resulted the financing process faced difficulty to be approved. The developer could hardly fulfilled the standards for the financing approval. This happens because there is no guideline for the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report to facilitate the approval of the bank. The developer also failed {{to take into account the}} important element in the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report. This study focus on the bank which financing the development and the evaluation from registered valuer. The valuers who are responsible for preparing for the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report to the developer and the bank. The purpose of this study is to identify the main requirements to produce a comprehensive <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report. In addition, the contents of the existing research reports prepared by the developer do not meet the needs of construction projects that are competent. The main agenda of this research is to analyse the factors that had been emphasized and the standard of the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report. Next, is to identify the element of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report that is comprehensive toward the approval of development financing. A case study is chosen in Johor Bahru, Johor. The premier data is collected from interviews with the respondent of bank and valuers, secondary data collected through reports and guidelines. Sixteen respondents consist of ten bank and six valuer selected for this research. Therefore, the results using qualitative methods are presented in tables, diagrams, pie charts, descriptions and explanations. The result that achieved are the main objective to identify the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> factor made according to it priority, the party responsible to assess the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study,</b> the regulation involved with the approval of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report, priority factor of the approval of development financing, factor of the valuation toward the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report, the weaknesses in the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report, and the standards in the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report. Then, the standard operational procedure of bank approval, critical success factors, failure factors in the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report and resolve problems in the <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> report. The contribution of the knowledge in this study are to improved the current concept of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> and to reform old-dimensional measurement of development loan approval. Therefore, it contribute toward the best practice of bankers and developers profession. Lastly, the need of <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> are the basic requirement to secure the approval of the development financing to the developer from the banker...|$|R

5|$|In 1958, the Bureau of Ships {{prepared}} two <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies</b> {{to explore}} whether Alaska and Guam could be suitably converted into guided-missile cruisers. The first study involved removing {{all of the}} guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160million, {{the cost of this}} proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a second study was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study's plan ($82million), it was still seen as too expensive. As a result, both ships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. Alaska was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and Guam on 24 May 1961.|$|E

The effectiveness in considering sustainable attributes in <b>feasibility</b> <b>study</b> will directly influence {{the success of a}} project.

This research utilised quantitative approach where questionnaires were distributed among developers.

5|$|In 1960, Democrat Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first {{introduced}} legislation for a feasibility study {{to survey the}} area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted {{that it was not}} designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough <b>feasibility</b> <b>studies</b> by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan, another Senator from Idaho, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's members of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
