Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were estimated for 542 cases and 2, 197 controls who reported never using tobacco, and the heterogeneity among the study-specific ORs was assessed. In addition, stratified analyses were done by subsite. No effect of ever <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> exposure either at home or at work was observed for head and neck cancer overall. However, long duration of <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> exposure at home and at work was associated with an increased risk (OR for > 15 years at home, 1. 60; 95 % CI, 1. 12 - 2. 28; P(trend) 15 years at work, 1. 55; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 2. 30; P(trend) = 0. 13). The effect of duration of <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> exposure at home was stronger for pharyngeal and laryngeal cancers than for other subsites. An association between <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> exposure and the risk of head and neck cancer, particularly pharyngeal and laryngeal cancers, was observed for long duration of exposure. These results are consistent with those for active smoking and suggest that elimination of <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> exposure might reduce head and neck cancer risk among never smokers.

The pooled unadjusted RR from these studies is almost 5, which suggests that infants of mothers that smoke have almost a five times risk of SIDS compared with infants of mothers who do not smoke. Adjustment for potential confounders lowers the risk estimate; however, many studies over adjust, such as controlling for birthweight, resulting in an inappropriate low estimate of the risk. Epidemiologically it is difficult to distinguish the effect of active maternal smoking during pregnancy from <b>involuntary</b> postnatal tobacco <b>smoking</b> of the infant to smoking by the mother. The mechanism for SIDS is unknown; however, it is generally believed that the predominant effect from maternal smoking is from in utero exposure of the fetus. Clear evidence for environmental tobacco smoke exposure can be obtained by examining the risk of SIDS from paternal smoking where the mother is non-smoker. There have been 6 such studies.

International audienceBACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking, as a {{cause of}} cancer, is common in China. Few studies have been {{conducted}} to assess the burden of tobacco-related cancer in the Chinese population. METHODS: We calculated the proportion of cancers attributable to tobacco smoking to estimate the burden of tobacco-related cancer. Population attributable fraction was calculated based on the assumption of total avoidance of smoking. Data on smoking prevalence were from two large-scale national surveys of representative samples of the Chinese population. Data on relative risk were derived from the meta-analyses and large-scale studies. Cancer mortality and incidence were originated from the third national death cause survey and cancer registries in China. RESULTS: We estimated that a total of 405, 112 deaths of cancer were attributable to smoking in China in 2005, including 372, 264 among men (32. 7 % of all cancer deaths) and 32, 848 among women (5. 0 %).

The total number of deaths from lung cancer attributable to exposure to tobacco smoke from spouses and other sources (mainly the workplace) was derived by applying estimated age- and sex-specific rates of death from lung cancer attributable to such exposure to the population of Canadians who have never smoked; about 330 deaths from lung cancer annually are attributable to such exposure...|$|E

40|$|ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) is {{a mixture}} of exhaled {{mainstream}} smoke and of the sidestream smoke from smouldering tobacco. It is a complex mixture of very many compounds including over 50 known or suspected human carcinogens. Of the 87 agents or groups of agents classified by the WHO-IARC (World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer) into its Group 1 category, as being known human carcinogens, nine of these are present in ETS. In 2002 WHO-IARC declared that <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> is carcinogenic to humans thus placing ETS itself in Group 1. In addition to carcinogens a number of irritants and cardiovascular toxicants such as nicotine and carbon monoxide are also present in ETS. As a consequence of the differences in temperatures at which they are produced in tobacco combustion, in pH value and due to air dilution effects many carcinogens and other toxicants are generated at greater amounts in sidestream compared to mainstream smoke. Many studies in recent years have shown that involuntary or passive smoking due to ETS exposure gives rise to a range of serious health effects such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems in adults and children and lung cancer. It also has adverse effects on reproduction including low birth weight. Exposure to ETS is essentially a phenomenon of indoor or other enclosed air spaces.

In addition, the changing societal intolerance of smoking and passage of local ordinances has been an extra impetus for employers to address this issue. This study documents the cost-effectiveness of a smoking awareness program which was held in Sacramento for state employees in departments under the Health and welfare Agency. The Smoking Awareness Campaign consisted of public awareness on the hazards of smoking, related participatory activities and on-site opportunities for those wanting to quit. This program was conducted with a minimum of resources, primarily consisting of redirected staff time. The cost-effectiveness of the Smoking Awareness Campaign was determined by comparing the amount of resources that was needed to conduct this program with the cost savings realized as a result of employees who quit smoking.

This cross sectional study used pre-constructed self administered questionnaire adapted from Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) WHO and was conducted during July-August 2006. Total sample in this study was 1, 651 students of 29 junior high schools in Depok, West Java, Indonesia. Descriptive data analysis was used to describe the proportion distribution of health risk issues and smoking behaviour. Results: The major behaviour health risk issues includes smoking, diet related risk behavior, unhygienic behavior, injury, physical activity and mental health related behaviour. The proportions were significantly different between male and female. The proportion of smoking 39. 2 % among males and 3. 7 % among females. In comparison with the male students who never smoked, those who smoke had significantly lower mean of academic score (mean: 6. 90 (95 %CI: 6. 79 - 7. 01) vs 7. 13 (95 % CI: 7. 06 - 7. 20) p-value: 0. 001) and higher school absenteeism (6. 4 vs 3. 5, p-value: 0. 001). Conclusion: Males and females adolescents had significantly different health risk issues. <b>Involuntary</b> <b>smoking</b> shows the highest proportion of health risk behaviour among both male and female adolescents. Smoking behaviour has significant relationship with the academic score among male adolescents.   Keywords: smoking, adolescent, behaviour risk factors, school-based health survey</p...|$|E
40|$|THE HEALTH COMMUNITY {{has been}} {{concerned}} about {{the health effects of}} smoking on smokers for over two decades. With recent reports by the Surgeon General ' and the National Academy of Sciences, 2 a consensus has emerged that smoking also endangers nonsmokers who breathe secondhand smoke (table 1). Although there are always more details to learn, these reports effectively close the scientific case against sec-ondhand smoke and will most certainly speed the spread of legislation protecting nonsmokers from the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke. The history of such legislation dates back to the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act passed in 1975. As the health estab-lishment, with its considerable resources, joins existing activist groups that have been working in this area for the last 10 years, {{there is no question that}} the rate of progress toward clean indoor air will substantially increase. The early years Before discussing how to pursue clean indoor air legislation, we should consider why the health estab-lishment waited so long to take up the nonsmokers' rights cause. First, the major voluntary health agencies have long been concerned with the effect of smoking on the smoker, and there is no doubt that primary smoking is more dangerous than <b>involuntary</b> <b>smoking.</b> Many people viewed the nonsmokers ' rights movement as a sideshow compared with the more important busi-ness of attacking smoking directly. Second, the health community viewed the problem of smoking in a med-ical rather than a social and environmental context, in which the focus should be on the smoker (the patient) rather than on the environment, which moves into politics. Moreover, people considered forays into the political arena intrinsically controversial and worried that taking a position on smoking as a social act coul...|$|E
40|$|This Surgeon General 2 ̆ 019 s report {{returns to}} the topic of the health effects of {{involuntary}} exposure to tobacco smoke. The last comprehensive review of this evidence by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was in the 1986 Surgeon General 2 ̆ 019 s report, The Health Consequences of <b>Involuntary</b> <b>Smoking,</b> published 20 years ago this year. This new report updates the evidence of the harmful effects of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. This large body of research findings is captured in an accompanying dynamic database that profiles key epidemiologic findings, and allows the evidence on health effects of exposure to tobacco smoke to be synthesized and updated (following the format of the 2004 report, The Health Consequences of Smoking). The database enables users to explore the data and studies supporting the conclusions in the report. The database is available on the Web site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at [URL] I am grateful to the leadership of the Surgeon General, CDC 2 ̆ 019 s Office on Smoking and Health, and all of the contributors for preparing this important report and bringing this topic to the forefront once again. Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke, is a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of tobacco products (sidestream smoke) and the mainstream smoke exhaled by smokers. People are exposed to secondhand smoke at home, in the workplace, and in other public places such as bars, restaurants, and recreation venues. It is harmful and hazardous {{to the health of the}} general public and particularly dangerous to children. It increases the risk of serious respiratory problems in children, such as a greater number and severity of asthma attacks and lower respiratory tract infections, and increases the risk for middle ear infections. It is also a known human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent). Inhaling secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults. We have made great progress since the late 1980 s in reducing the involuntary exposure of nonsmokers in this country to secondhand smoke. The proportion of nonsmokers aged 4 and older with a blood cotinine level (a metabolite of nicotine) indicating exposure has declined from 88 percent in 19882 ̆ 0131991 down to 43 percent in 20012 ̆ 0132002, a decline that exceeds the Healthy People 2010 objective for this measure. Despite the great progress that has been made, involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke remains a serious public health hazard that can be prevented by making homes, workplaces, and public places completely smoke-free. As of the year 2000, more than 126 million residents of the United States aged 3 or older still are estimated to be exposed to secondhand smoke. Smoke-free environments are the most effective method for reducing exposures. Healthy People 2010 objectives address this issue and seek optimal protection of nonsmokers through policies, regulations, and laws requiring smoke-free environments in all schools, workplaces, and public places.
