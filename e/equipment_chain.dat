The available literature lacks sufficient information to provide an understanding of the characteristics of the heavy <b>equipment</b> supply <b>chain.</b> The purpose of this research is to examine the heavy <b>equipment</b> supply <b>chain</b> in Indonesia and to identify barriers and opportunities. This research was conducted based on a two-stage research design, starting with qualitative interviews and followed by a focus group discussion. The heavy <b>equipment</b> supply <b>chain</b> shows unique characteristics of production, distribution, and utilization cycles. The findings from the analysis show typical problems faced by the heavy <b>equipment</b> supply <b>chain</b> in Indonesia are that it lacks communication and incentives...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and {{experimental study of}} a smart panel designed for active structural acoustic control. The system consists of a clamped aluminium panel 1 mm thick with dimensions 414 mm × 314 mm. Polyvinylidene fluoride films 0. 5 mm thick with a quadratic electrode shape are bonded {{to either side of}} the plate, to form a matched volume velocity sensor and uniform force actuator pair. In this paper the design of the smart panel is described in detail. The main properties of the frequency response from distributed actuator to distributed sensor are then discussed with reference to the requirements for direct velocity feedback control. In particular, three problems encountered in the measurement of the transfer function between the sensor and actuator are addressed: first, the unwanted coupling between the sensor and actuator via in-plane plate vibration; second, the high-frequency effects produced by the non-perfect shaping of the actuator and sensor electrodes; third, the phase delays due to the measurement <b>equipment</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) {{is to improve}} the maximum economic benefit from end-of-use products. Nevertheless, the literature within this stream of research advocates that closing the loop also helps to mitigate the undesirable environmental footprint of supply chains.

We illustrate our findings based on the Electric and Electronic <b>Equipment</b> (EEE) supply <b>chain.</b> For all phases of the supply chain, i. e. manufacturing, usage, transportation and end-of-life activities, we assess the magnitude of the environmental impacts, based on a single environmental metric, namely the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED).

40|$|We {{study the}} demand {{forecast}} sharing process between a buyer of customized production equipment {{and a set}} of equipment suppliers. Based on a large data collection we undertook in the semiconductor <b>equipment</b> supply <b>chain,</b> we empirically investigate the relationship between the buyer’s forecasting behavior and the supplier’s delivery performance. The buyer’s forecasting behavior is characterized by the frequency and magnitude of forecast revisions she requests (forecast volatility) {{as well as by the}} fraction of orders that were forecasted, yet never actually purchased (forecast inflation). The supplier’s delivery performance is measured by the supplier’s ability to meet delivery dates requested by the customers. Based on a duration analysis, we are able to show that suppliers penalize the buyer for unreliable forecasts by providing lower service levels. Vice versa, we also show that the buyer penalizes suppliers with a history of poor service by providing them with overly inflated forecasts. ...|$|R
