2500|$|An <b>enlargement</b> <b>programme</b> {{commenced}} in 1256. This 'New Work' was consecrated in 1300 but {{not complete}} until 1314. During the later Medieval period St Paul's was exceeded in length {{only by the}} Abbey Church of Cluny and in the height of its spire only by Lincoln Cathedral and St. Mary's Church, Stralsund. Excavations by Francis Penrose in 1878 showed that it was [...] long and [...] wide (290 feet or 87 m across the transepts and crossing). The spire was about 489 feet (149 m) in height.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, the Government of Margaret Thatcher {{launched}} {{proposals for}} a trunk road <b>enlargement</b> <b>programme,</b> {{outlined in the}} Roads for Prosperity white paper (often incorrectly referred to as 'Roads to Prosperity'). [...] The stated aims of the proposals were to assist economic growth, improve the environment, and improve road safety. [...] The 10-year programme was estimated to cost of £23 billion (1989 prices), with 2700 mi of new or improved road to the trunk road network and 150 new bypasses. The benefits of each scheme within the programme {{would need to be}} validated through a thorough financial assessment and planning process in accordance with HM Treasury's Green Book.|$|E
50|$|There are {{records that}} there was a church at this {{location}} before the Norman conquest of Wales as it is mentioned in Domesday Book and by a charter from King John of England however there is nothing surviving in the current church building from that period. This is reportedly because of Augustinian canons from Llanthony Secunda visited and built the church on top of the older church that was dedicated to St Bride dating from around AD 900 at the behest of Walter of Gloucester after the construction of Caldicot Castle. The earliest part of the church is the base of the tower, which comes from the 14th century, along with the nave and chancel, which was part of an <b>enlargement</b> <b>programme</b> at the time. The tower was not fully completed until the 16th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{workshop}} covers are {{range of}} technologies for zero or low emissions power generation {{with the main}} focus on gasification of biomass {{for the production of}} a syngas for further treatment. The type of biomass ranged from simple sugars to various woods and also waste materials such as tyres and municipal solid waste in the form of solid recovered fuels. Syngas cleaning and treatment included the use of zeolite to capture CO 2, novel scrubbers and Fischer Tropsch synthesis. Also addressed were legislative requirements. The proceedings contain the original presentations made at the workshop as well full papers containing details of the individual projects presented.

30|$|Human Induced Succession (hereafter HS) occurs {{throughout}} the post-Soviet countries, with seedlings planted in abandoned fields and meadows {{as part of}} a policy of afforestation. In Lithuania, the actions of the Forest Cover <b>Enlargement</b> <b>Programme</b> have accelerated in recent years in particular. For example, forest cover in the territory of Lithuania had increased by 104, 000  ha during the previous decade (Butkus et al. 2013), compared to 44, 900  ha in the decade before (Kavaliauskienė and Tarvydienė 2005). Simultaneous in 1992 – 2002 the area of arable land fell by 118, 000  ha and that of meadows and natural pastures by 89, 100  ha.|$|E
30|$|Forests {{may also}} develop in localities of former meadows {{as a process}} of Natural Succession (hereafter NS) when {{abandoned}} arable land and/or hay meadows are recolonized by shrubs and eventually become forests. This has become common in Lithuania and other Baltic countries since 1990, where following land reform, less intensive farming has led to a decrease in agricultural areas (Aleknavičius and Aleknavičius 2010) and 4000 – 5000  ha of abandoned land has seen natural forest regrowth on an annual basis (Lithuanian Forest Cover <b>Enlargement</b> <b>Programme</b> 2002). Currently, forest and newly afforested land occupies 33.3 % of the territory of the country (Butkus et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades a deep process of {{institutional}} reforms and economic reorganization took place {{in central and eastern}} EU countries (CEE). These changes occurred in a context of general economic integration. On the one hand, the European Union <b>enlargement</b> <b>programme</b> was launched and all CEE countries applied to become EU member between 1994 and 1996. On the other hand, the globalization of the world economy characterized this historical phase. This article explores to what extent openness to global markets mediated the impact of EU integration on the economic performance of CEE regions in different periods. The periods examined are defined by the main institutional changes that occurred on the road towards EU integration. Results show that globally open regions performed better than the others, at least in the first two periods analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{environment}} of dance events brings, apart from entertainment, considerable risks and stress {{to those who}} attend these events. This does not concern only the easy availability of drugs in this environment. The individual person is exposed to further external factors that may, directly or indirectly, endanger his / her health. The main task of services provided by Harm Reduction in the {{environment of}} dance events by field programmes of non-profit organizations fulfilling tasks of the state antidrug policy, is to minimise and not to eliminate these risks. The theoretical part is focused on defining the term of "Harm Reduction. It explains to the readers not only the general principle of the model, but also acquaints them with specific services, such as testing tablets of synthetic drugs that become available to visitors to dance events. Further, this thesis presents characteristic features of the environment of dance events, informs on the development and the present state in the Czech Republic. It informs comprehensively on the most frequent psychoactive substances that are overused in this environment and the risks thereof. In the final chapter, I deal with the term of the safe dance event environment, {{which is based on}} Czech and foreign recommendations by government organizations. The objective of my thesis was to compare the provided services, with a subjective view of the recipients of these services. The objective of the thesis was fulfilled. The first hypothesis confirms that the presence of the Harm Reduction services is positively viewed by over 70 per cent of the participants, as part of a safe environment of a dance event. The second hypothesis confirms that the continuous <b>enlargement</b> of the <b>programme</b> with new services, including services already cancelled, is positively viewed by the participants in dance events. I used the quantitative method for the investigation. The data were obtained by means of anonymous questionnaires. The research set comprised sixty participants in dance events in the towns of Pilsen, Prague and České Budějovice. The results of my thesis could be sued as a feed back for field programmes applied in the environment of dance events. The thesis points out topical problems and suggests possible solutions and starting points for the future...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the third}} Workshop on Physics-Based Models and Experimental Validation funded by the European Union's <b>Enlargement</b> and Integration <b>Programme</b> with creep and plastic {{deformation}} of metals as the focus theme this year. In addition to provide a platform for collaboration and exchange of information between researchers in EU Member States and the target countries, the Workshop also aims to bring together students and international experts, scientists addressing more basic research with code developers and industrial end-users and to provide cross-cutting by involving scientists from different sectors such as nuclear, aerospace and automotive. Material is the key {{for the development of}} our future society such as new energy system, transport system and electronic equipment. The material properties, performance of components in different environments and associated material degradation mechanism depend on the microstructure and chemical composition of the material. By "physics-based" we refer to models that address microstructures and associated thermodynamic non-equilibrium mechanisms and processes at different length and time scales. Such models include molecular dynamics, dislocation dynamics and crystal plasticity. The basic foundation for such models were established in the 20 th century but the further development and application to industrial problems is of more recent date thanks to the dramatic improvement of computational power. The ultimate goal is to combine several models, including continuum based phenomenological models, into a multi-scale approach to address complex material properties and also application to industrial components. Although one of the drivers for physics-based models is to replace the need for expensive material testing, experiments will be needed to develop, calibrate and validate physics-based and multi-scale models. Thus the integration of physics-based models and innovative experimental techniques are clearly coupled. The physics based models can be used for design of new materials with tailored properties or reducing the cost and time for development of new materials using physics-based models integrated with experiments. This research is therefore singled out as a key priority in broader research programmes. The Workshop consists of ten keynote lectures, 19 oral presentations and a Poster session with over 50 posters. New developments and applications of the various physics-based models as well as some cases for scale bridging will be presented. There are also presentations on specific experimental techniques and on some that address the applicability for industrial applications. JRC. G.
