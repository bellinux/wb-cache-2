5000|$|In 1906, David Fairchild {{imported}} 1000 {{cherry trees}} from the Yokohama Nursery Company in Japan and planted {{them on his}} own property in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

On September 26, {{with the help of the}} Fairchilds' friends, the Chevy Chase Land Company ordered 300 Oriental cherry trees for the Chevy Chase area. In 1908, Fairchild donated cherry saplings to every D.C. school to plant on its school grounds in observance of Arbor Day.

50|$|The famous sakura (Japanese cherry trees) of Washington {{line the}} Tidal Basin {{and are the}} main {{attraction}} at the National Cherry Blossom Festival in early spring, when the cherry blossoms bloom. Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, upon returning to Washington from a visit to Japan, initiated the idea of cherry trees in Washington, approaching the Superintendent of Public Building and Grounds (then Colonel Spencer Cosby) in 1885. Her idea was rejected; over the next 24 years, Scidmore approached every new superintendent, but the idea never came to fruition. In 1906, Dr. David Fairchild, a botanist {{who worked for the}} U.S. Department of Agriculture, imported 75 flowering cherry trees and 25 single-flowered weeping types from the Yokohama Nursery Company in Japan. Fairchild planted these trees on a hillside on his own property in Chevy Chase, Maryland, testing their hardiness in the Washington area. In 1907, pleased with the success of the trees, Fairchild and his wife began to promote <b>Japanese</b> <b>flowering</b> <b>cherry</b> trees as the ideal type of tree to plant along avenues in the Washington area. Friends of family also became interested, and on September 26, arrangements were completed with the Chevy Chase Land Company to order 300 Oriental cherry trees for the Chevy Chase area.|$|E

Even under such difficult environment that was rather unexpected and uncontrollable, we could obtain fruitful results on the growth of cherry tree, and found them scientifically significant, especially in terms of biological effects of gravity on earth. Moreover, a lot of interesting interactions of cherry trees with various kinds of animals were observed in parallel to the plant physiology...|$|E

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} rate, {{the leaf}} characteristics related to photosynthesis, {{such as the}} chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a/b ratio and density of the stomata, the leaf area and the dry weight in seedlings of <b>Japanese</b> <b>flowering</b> <b>cherry</b> grown under normal gravity and simulated microgravity conditions were examined. No {{significant differences were found}} in the photosynthetic rates between the two conditions. Moreover, leaf characteristics such as the chlorophyll content, chlorophyll a/b ratio and density of the stomata in the seedlings grown under the simulated microgravity condition were not affected. However, the photosynthetic product of the whole seedling under the simulated microgravity condition increased compared with the control due to its leaf area increase. The results suggest that dynamic gravitational stimulus controls the partitioning of the products of photosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Expressions of the {{gibberellin}} biosynthesis gene {{were investigated}} {{in a normal}} upright type and a gravi-response mutant, a weeping type of <b>Japanese</b> <b>flowering</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus spachiana), that is unable to support its own weight and elongates downward. A segment of the gibberellin 3 beta-hydroxylase cDNA of Prunus spachiana (Ps 3 ox), {{which is responsible for}} active gibberellin synthesis, was amplified by using real-time RT-PCR. The content of Ps 3 ox mRNA in the weeping type was much greater than that in the upright type, while the endogenous gibberellin level was much higher in the elongating zone of the weeping type. These results suggest that the amount and distribution of synthesized gibberellin regulate secondary xylem formation, and the unbalanced distribution of gibberellin affects the gravi-response of the Prunus tree...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRadiocesium (134 Cs +  137 Cs) concentrations, {{primarily}} {{derived from}} the Fukushima accident in March 2011, were measured in litterfalls and green leaves of <b>Japanese</b> <b>flowering</b> <b>cherry</b> trees (Prunus x yedoensis cv. Somei-Yoshino). The sampling was performed mainly during the defoliation season in 2011 and 2012 using traps to collect litterfalls before contact with the ground. The average radiocesium concentration in litterfalls in 2012 fell to one-third of that in 2011 (0. 43 and 1. 2  kBq kg-DW− 1, respectively). Interestingly, the concentrations in litterfalls collected in late autumn in both 2011 and 2012 (0. 68 and 0. 19  kBq kg-DW− 1, respectively) were significantly lower than those in litterfalls collected in the early autumn (1. 7 and 1. 1  kBq kg-DW− 1, respectively). In addition, the reductions in radiocesium concentrations in the litterfall were nearly synchronous with those in potassium concentrations (p ≤  0. 05). On the contrary, radiocesium concentrations in green leaves were also correlated with potassium concentrations; however, {{the slopes of the}} regression lines between the radiocesium and potassium concentrations were very similar in the 2011 litterfalls and the 2012 litterfalls, while the slopes were significantly different between these litterfalls and the green leaves. Consequently, the correlation between potassium and radiocesium was clear but independently observable in each of the litterfalls and the green leaves. It is possible that the reduction in radiocesium concentration occurred as a part of physiological demand, a translocation of potassium from the leaves to the body/twigs...|$|E

40|$|Dehydrogenase {{polymorphism}} was {{studied in}} 36 sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.), sweet cherry (Prunus avuim L.), mahaleb (Prunus mahaleb L.), ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa Pall.), duke cherry (Prunus gondounii Redh.), <b>Japanese</b> <b>flowering</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus serrulata Lindl.) and four iterspecific hybrids (standard cherry rootstocks ‘Gisela 5 ’, ‘Gisela 6 ’, ‘Max Ma’ and ‘Colt’). Inner bark of one-year-old shoots, in dormant stage, {{was used for}} enzyme extraction. Vertical PAGE was used for isoenzyme analysis: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), isocitrate dehydrogenaze (IDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), and shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH). All studied systems were polymorphic at 10 loci: Adh - 1 (3 genotypes) and Adh- 2 (5 genotypes), Fdh- 1 (2 genotypes), Gdh- 1 (3 genotypes), Idh- 1 (4 genotypes) i Idh - 2 (5 genotypes), Mdh- 1 (3 genotypes), Pgd- 1 (4 genotypes), Sdh- 1 (1 genotype) i Sdh- 2 (3 genotypes). Cluster {{analysis was used to}} construct dendrogram on which four groups of similar genotypes were separated. Obtained results indicate that studied enzyme systems can be used for determination of genus Prunus, subgenus Cerasus. Among studied enzyme systems ADH, IDH and SDH were the most polymorphic and most useful to identify genetic variability. Polymorphism of FDH and GDH in genus Prunus, subgenus Cerasus was described first time in this work. First results for dehydrogenase variability of Oblačinska indicate that polymorphism of loci Idh- 2 and Sdh- 2 can be useful for discrimination of different clones...|$|E

40|$|More than 100 years ago, the <b>Japanese</b> {{government}} presented <b>flowering</b> <b>cherry</b> {{trees as}} a gift to the U. S. government. Those wonderful living gifts have blossomed along the National Mall’s Tidal Basin, as well as at other locations around Washington, D. C., since then. In April 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a gift of 3, 000 flowering dogwood trees to Japan to commemorate the 100 th anniversary of Japan’s gift of cherry trees to the United States. The job of finding the right dogwoods belongs to scientists at the U. S. National Arboretum, in Washington, D. C. Agricultural Research Service plant geneticist Richard Olsen has worked to determine the appropriate dogwood cultivars for the varied Japanese climate and to locate the planting material. “There are many things to consider, including temperature range and insect pests to which particular dogwood candidates may be susceptible,” says Olsen. The planning group—which includes the U. S. Department of State; the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Forest Service, and ARS; and the U. S. /Japan Bridging Foundation, a nonprofit organization—sent the first batch of 150 trees to Japan, and they were planted in Tokyo in November 2012. Altogether, a total of 1, 000 will be planted in Tokyo, 1, 000 in the Tohoku region in honor of the tsunami victims, and the final 1, 000 will be distributed to schools and other organizations throughout the country. “We are evaluating the performance of dogwood germplasm at the arboretum as well as novel cultivars available in the American nursery industry to find those most suited to the Japanese clime,” says Olsen. The arboretum has, for decades, collected dogwood germplasm from across the United States—it is found from Florida to Michigan and as far west as Missouri and Texas...|$|R
