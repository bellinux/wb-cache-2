60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit, {{and then}} I hazarded a {{suggestion}} myself.|$|E
60|$|She lay in my arms, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment she}} had fainted.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment {{over this}} reply. It was obscure, perhaps, but I thought that I saw dimly his meaning.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{disturbs}} you? What are you {{staring at}} the book <b>for?</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant that {{you must have been}} overcome again!" [...] I jumped up.|$|R
6000|$|... "He told me little I did not know," [...] Mr. Esmond answered. [...] "But <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> of that little, and here's the result: I have {{no right}} to the name I bear, dear lady; and it is only by your sufferance that I am allowed to keep it. If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour of what has perhaps crossed your mind too--" ...|$|R
60|$|When, {{stretching}} my cramped limbs, I drew back, {{exhausted and}} shivering, from the empty tent, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant {{that the figure}} which sat crouching {{in the corner of}} the recess was asleep. But no: with head averted, sweat gleaming on his forehead, he rose to his feet. His consciousness had been my theatre in a degree past even my realization.|$|R
60|$|Hereupon Marble {{made what}} he called a rumpus in good earnest. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, he would kick the cabin-doors down.|$|E
60|$|When we {{returned}} {{there in a}} couple of hours' time, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, that I was looking into a mirror.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that, in her despair, {{she would}} find {{something}} that would do. But she only found: [...] "It didn't come in a flash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment,' {{wound up}} His Excellency, 'that my dear, good Wonder had hired an assassin {{to clear his}} way to the throne!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Wait a moment, Mr. Robbie,’ said I. ‘You {{forget the}} chapter of expenses. <b>I</b> had <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beginning, of placing a {{thousand}} pounds in your hands.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment," [...] {{wound up}} His Excellency, [...] "that my dear, good Wonder had hired an assassin {{to clear his}} way to the throne!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By George," [...] Harry exclaimed, {{taking his}} pipe {{suddenly}} from his mouth, and jumping {{up from his}} chair,--"By George, if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that Percy Desborough----" ...|$|E
60|$|In another {{instant he}} had me by the throat. His grasp {{was that of a}} band of steel, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> surety my last hour had come.|$|E
60|$|Of course I'd ask her {{to marry}} me if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that she'd accept. But I'm so terrified that she'll refuse, and then perhaps I shall never see her again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a moment, Mr. Robbie," [...] said I. [...] "You {{forget the}} chapter of expenses. <b>I</b> had <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beginning, of placing a {{thousand}} pounds in your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|The canoe was {{at least}} forty feet long, about two wide, and four deep. The upper part--consisting of narrow planks laced {{together}} with cords of sinnate--had in many places fallen off, and lay decaying upon the ground. Still, there were ample accommodations left for sleeping; and in we sprang--the doctor into the bow, and I into the stern. I soon fell asleep; but waking suddenly, cramped in every joint from my constrained posture, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, that <b>I</b> must have been prematurely screwed down in my coffin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, to be sure! <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment you}} {{had come for}} pleasure, or out of civility, as it might be. Of course I didn't expect that when I saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I realize that. If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment that}} baby {{was in any}} peril I would go distracted, and scream louder than poor Louise is doing. Do you hear her? Isn’t it awful?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be {{very sure}} that you do," [...] Anna said slowly. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment {{that there was any}} chance of a relapse, I should stop here and tell him the truth even now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is up?' {{the latter}} asked angrily. 'Confound it, {{there is no}} {{occasion}} to grip a man like that. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment a big dog had got hold of me. What is the matter with you?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes. We were speculating boldly, {{and already}} had {{undertaken}} rather {{more than we}} could manage; but the offer was tempting, and, noting Harry's eagerness, I agreed.|$|R
60|$|SAVVY. Oh, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. I can believe, {{in a sort}} of way, {{that people}} might live for three hundred years. But when you came down to tin tacks, and said that the parlor maid might, then I saw how absurd it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove! yes, I'm awfully lucky; <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment that}} she'd have me, you know--a woman like her, {{with so much}} {{attention}} and everything. I can't imagine what she sees in me." ...|$|R
60|$|Gussie {{sat down}} on the bed, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment {{that he was going to}} be in the mode by burying his face in his hands. However, he merely brushed a dead spider from his brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean--my {{peculiar}} scent? Correct {{the impression}} that I intend to hang about in the hall while life slips by, {{in the hope that}} one of these days that dashed animal will decide that I smell all right." [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit. [...] "Jeeves!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. It {{was not a}} {{very long}} absence, but the new sights would {{distract}} me, and I wanted to see Florence again. On the whole, I thought it would suffice, and that I could count on the cure of my ill before the time was up.|$|E
6000|$|... "You!" [...] Mr. Harmer said, {{stopping}} suddenly. [...] "What, {{were you}} with them? I remember {{now that the}} account {{said it was a}} one-armed sailor, but of course <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment of its being you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> so <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, she may {{be assured}} that his muddy bourgeois blood should at once be shed to {{preserve}} {{the purity of the}} family with which I have the honour to be connected.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My wife,' {{said the}} little lord, 'shall write no sonnets or billets-doux; and I'm heartily glad to think I have obtained, in good time, a {{knowledge}} of the heartless vixen with whom <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> myself <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment in love.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, boy, {{that will}} do," [...] the {{sergeant}} said, laying {{his hand on}} his shoulder. [...] "I am satisfied, now, with the truth of your story. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit, you {{had something to do with}} the franc tireurs who are about here, but I see I was mistaken.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past four; {{we had no}} time to lose. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute. Andrea {{would have}} to go to his mother's and find the needful clothes, then come back; it would all take time, and time meant life and death. Then, the sight of a young and {{beautiful}} woman might arouse the guard's attention, and Giulia might be recognised.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he does," [...] said Micklethwaite, going {{purple and}} staring at me very hard. He seemed to ask mutely whether I of all people {{proposed}} to turn on him and back up this infamous scoundrel. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment he would have apoplexy, but happily he remembered his duty as my host. So he turned very suddenly on a meditative waiter for not removing our plates.|$|E
60|$|Amicia. I also went, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it all, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sportive, wanton thing, quite painfully ugly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--there is Mr. Finn. I {{will tell}} you something, Laura. The only man I ever saw in the world whom <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that it was {{possible}} that I should like,--like enough to love as my husband,--except your brother, was Mr. Finn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the way it}} {{was told}} to me I reckon them cavalrymen went up in the air. Fine, fiery lot of young bloods, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> achin' <b>for</b> <b>a</b> scrap. But the officer in charge, bein' in a ticklish place, still held out for higher orders.|$|R
