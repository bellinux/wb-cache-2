5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios <b>huge</b> <b>profits,</b> Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In his campaign, McCarthy {{attacked}} La Follette for not enlisting {{during the}} war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> from his investments while he, McCarthy, {{had been away}} fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested {{in the stock market}} himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and <b>huge</b> <b>profits.</b> However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E

5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but also from the coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, the <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> of {{the spice}} trade financed a sumptuous {{composite}} {{style in the}} first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório Lopes and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse. Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.|$|E

25|$|The Rum Rebellion {{has slipped}} into {{historical}} oblivion {{because it is}} widely misunderstood. It is popular belief that the autocratic Bligh was removed because he threatened the <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> that were being made from trading in spirits by the officers of the NSW Corps and by businessmen such as John Macarthur. This view suggests it {{was nothing more than}} a squabble between equally unsavoury parties.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1930s, Harlow {{was one of}} {{the biggest}} stars in the United States, and it was hoped, MGM's next Greta Garbo. Still young, her star {{continued}} to rise while the popularity of other female stars at MGM, such as Garbo, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Luise Rainer, waned. Harlow's movies continued to make <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> at the box office even during the middle of the Depression.|$|E

25|$|Kennedy made <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> from reorganizing and {{refinancing}} several Hollywood film studios. Film {{production in}} the U.S. was much more decentralized than it is today, with many different movie studios producing film product. One small studio was Film Booking Offices of America (or FBO), which specialized in Westerns produced cheaply. Its owner was in financial trouble and asked Kennedy to help find a new owner. Kennedy formed his own group of investors and bought it for $1.5 million (about $ today).|$|E
25|$|On the French {{aircraft}} carrier, it {{is revealed}} that Schofield, {{along with the}} fifteen other targets, are {{the only people who}} have quick enough reactions to disable the missiles being launched from disguised ships in the Kormoran Project. The plane involves copies of different countries' missiles being launched at their bitterest enemies, resulting in a new Cold War which will bring in <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> for the members of Majestic-12. Schofield is rescued by Knight, but then Knight reveals to him that Gant was decapitated.|$|E
25|$|Under Zhou, Communist {{businessmen}} {{made great}} profits engaging in currency trading and commodity speculation, {{especially in the}} international markets for American dollars and gold. Zhou's most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas. Although the CCP had been engaged in the eradication of opium smoking since its establishment, Zhou justified opium production and distribution in KMT-controlled areas by the <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> generated for the CCP, and by the debilitating effects that opium addiction might have on KMT soldiers and government officials.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1848, President Polk {{authorized}} his {{ambassador to}} Spain, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, {{to negotiate the}} purchase of Cuba and offer Spain up to $100million, an astounding sum at the time for one territory, equal to $ in present-day terms. Cuba {{was close to the}} United States and had slavery, so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North. However, Spain was still making <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> in Cuba (notably in sugar, molasses, rum, and tobacco), and thus the Spanish government rejected Saunders' overtures. Though Polk was eager to acquire Cuba, he refused to support the proposed filibuster expedition of Narciso López, who sought to invade and annex Cuba.|$|E
25|$|Alien land {{laws in the}} West Coast states {{barred the}} Issei from owning their pre-war homes and farms. Many had {{cultivated}} land for decades as tenant farmers, but they lost their rights to farm those lands when {{they were forced to}} leave. Other Issei (and Nisei who were renting or had not completed payments on their property) had found families willing to occupy their homes or tend their farms during their incarceration. However, those unable to strike a deal with caretakers had to sell their property, often {{in a matter of days}} and at great financial loss to predatory land speculators, who made <b>huge</b> <b>profits.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kennedy {{was born}} to a {{political}} family in East Boston, Massachusetts. He embarked on a career in business and investing. He first made a large fortune as a stock market and commodity investor. Kennedy later rolled over his profits by investing in real estate and {{a wide range of}} business industries across the United States. During World War I, he was an assistant general manager of a Boston area Bethlehem Steel shipyard, through which he developed a friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the 1920s, Kennedy made <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> by reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios; several acquisitions were ultimately merged into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) studios.|$|E

25|$|The VOC {{existed for}} almost 200 years from its {{founding}} in 1602, when the States-General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly over Dutch operations in Asia until its demise in 1796. During those two centuries (between 1602 and 1796), the VOC sent almost a million Europeans {{to work in the}} Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|The ICD-11 and DSM-5 {{are being}} {{developed}} {{at the start of}} the 21st century. Any radical new developments in classification are said to be more likely to be introduced by the APA than by the WHO, mainly because the former only has to persuade its own board of trustees whereas the latter has to persuade the representatives of over 200 different countries at a formal revision conference. In addition, while the DSM is a bestselling publication that makes <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> for APA, the WHO incurs major expense in determining international consensus for revisions to the ICD. Although there is an ongoing attempt to reduce trivial or accidental differences between the DSM and ICD, it is thought that the APA and the WHO are likely to continue to produce new versions of their manuals and, in some respects, to compete with one another.|$|E
25|$|England and France soon copied its model {{but could}} not match its record. Between 1602 and 1796 the VOC sent almost a million Europeans {{to work in the}} Asia trade on 4,785 ships. It {{returned}} over 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. The VOC enjoyed <b>huge</b> <b>profits</b> from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century. The VOC was active chiefly in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, where its base was Batavia (now Jakarta). Over the next two centuries the Company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. It remained an important trading concern and paid an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years. Weighed down by corruption, the VOC went bankrupt in 1800. Its possessions were taken over by the government and turned into the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
