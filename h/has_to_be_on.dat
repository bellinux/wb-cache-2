In his victory speech, Murphy said that his election marked a [...] "fresh start" [...] for Scottish Labour: [...] "Scotland is changing and so too is Scottish Labour. I'm ambitious for our party because I'm ambitious for our country". He also said that he planned to defeat the SNP in 2016, and that he would use the increased powers being devolved to Holyrood to end poverty and inequality. Urging Labour voters who had backed independence to support his vision for the party, he claimed Labour had [...] "so much more in common with [...] voted 'Yes' in the referendum than we do with many of the political leaders who campaigned for 'No' on the 18th of September". In her speech, Dugdale said that the party's [...] "focus <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the future – a Scottish Labour party that's fighting fit and fighting for our future".|$|E

In Pisemsky's second play, The Divide (Раздел, 1853), a typical natural school piece, parallels have been found with Turgenev's comedy Breakfast at the Chief's. Speaking about Pisemsky's early works, Skabichevsky wrote: [...] "Dig deeper into the pessimism which has gone into full swing in The Muff and Marriage by Passion, put it next to the mindset of an ordinary provincial man for examination and you'll be struck by the identical nature of the two. At the bottom of this outlook lies the conviction that man deep in his soul is a scoundrel, moved only by practical interests and egotistical, mostly dirty impulses, and for this reason one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> one's guard with one's neighbour and always keep 'a stone by one's bosom'." ...|$|E
