[...] "The {{idealized}} eighth-century estate of Charlemagne's capitulary de villis was to have artificial fishponds but two hundred years later, facilities for raising fish remained very rare, even on monastic estates.". As the middle ages progressed, <b>fish</b> <b>ponds</b> became a more common feature of urbanizing environments. This meant {{the people who had}} access to these <b>fish</b> <b>ponds</b> were able to access a food supply in a controlled environment not unlike pastures for cattle and sheep. However <b>fish</b> <b>ponds</b> were a difficult environment to maintain. They were a marker of power and authority, since only rich nobles and institutions such as monastery's could afford to maintain them. During the winter, supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle. Nobles had access to meat from deer parks, but this didn't supply the needs of whole households. Though <b>fish</b> <b>ponds</b> required maintenance by the community to keep them healthy, they were an elegant way of giving monasteries and noble houses access to fresh fish. Some of the more popular species of fish farmed in <b>fish</b> <b>ponds</b> were carp and pike. From the 14th century onward these fish proved to be a popular feature of artificial <b>fish</b> <b>ponds.</b>|$|R
