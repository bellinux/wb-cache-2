500|$|Of {{the three}} top WSOP {{bracelet}} winners, only Johnny Chan still has them all. He keeps them {{locked in a}} vault because they are worth, according to him, [...] "millions." [...] Brunson did not pick up two of his. Fourteen-time bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth gave away ten of his. [...] "To me," [...] Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets {{have always been a}} really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represented history." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be watching and I wanted to let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. [...] Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represented history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Petre called Hiller's generalship, [...] "as feeble as {{it could}} {{possibly}} be" [...] and that his troops were [...] "miserably handled", noting {{that he should have}} crushed Claparède's division or ejected it from the town when the French were at a two-to-one disadvantage. Petre believed that during the rear guard action, the Austrians actually outnumbered Coëhorn, Marulaz, and Piré. Robert M. Epstein called Hiller's counterattacks, [...] "piecemeal and badly coordinated". He noted the large number of Austrian guns available (70) and their effective use to inflict losses on the French and to set fire to the town. Epstein wrote that the French ignored the lesson and carelessly went into the battle at Aspern-Essling against an opponent who was capable of handling large numbers of cannons to good effect. Napoleon indirectly criticized Masséna when he privately wrote to Lannes the next day, [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had had the stupidity to attack by force this famous position, and the only redoubtable one on the Traun which it was necessary to take, I feared some misfortune." [...] Arnold believed that Masséna's order to assault the town was [...] "far worse than ill advised". He asserted that this blunder, which sent hundreds of soldiers to a pointless death, showed how far the marshal's abilities had declined from their peak.|$|E
60|$|The beady eyes {{vanished}} behind narrowing creases of fat; and yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were still}} regarding me. Presently they appeared again.|$|E
60|$|I saw a look pass {{between the}} two, and I {{no longer had}} any doubt whatever. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in collusion, that I had been brought here to be pumped by mademoiselle.|$|E

6000|$|... "There wasn't much bravery, sir," [...] Harry said modestly, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were going}} to kill me anyhow, so that it made no difference. But I was determined, if possible, that the dispatches should be destroyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Even then I did not understand, till I saw that--that no man {{stepped on}} my shadow; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> thought {{me to be}} a God, like the God Tyr, who gave his right hand to conquer a Great Beast.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wampanoag, he {{is led by}} the wampum of a Sachem. I {{have not}} counted my young men; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are strong enough to say that what their chief hath promised shall be done." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{the fellow}} saw me there our chances of escape might quickly go glimmering, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would {{put me in}} irons {{if they had the}} {{slightest}} conception of the wonderful agility which my earthly muscles gave me upon Mars.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked out}} into the night, and there I saw new cause for danger. Before and around the hut were at a little {{distance}} some shadowy forms; they were quite still, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were all alert and on guard. Small chance for me now in that direction.|$|E
60|$|We {{were silent}} for several minutes. Suddenly my fingers gripped Louis' arm. Had I been blind {{all this time}} that they had escaped my notice?

6000|$|... "And {{even now}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{will tell me}} that I should do so. How can I take you out there to such a life as that without having the means of keeping a house over your head?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Oh," [...] he said, [...] "I {{was glad}} to hear it because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> at least would be neither wounded nor killed. They will not leave wife nor children, neither will they suffer what we are suffering."' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were among}} those of the outer world who still clung tenaciously to the discredited {{religion}} of the Holy Therns, and that Matai Shang would find a ready welcome and safe refuge among them; while John Carter could look for nothing better than an ignoble death at their hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wondered}} {{why they were}} keeping me, but was sure they would stab me presently and throw me overboard. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had killed two soldiers {{for the sake of}} the diamonds, and if it hadn't been that they had given me the water, I should not have had a shadow of doubt about my fate." ...|$|E

60|$|Besides, I was tired. I {{had had a}} {{very busy}} morning, helping the men bring {{in a lot of}} cases of beer, and running into the saloon to talk to Fred and {{generally}} looking after things. So I was just dozing off again, when I heard a voice say, 'Well, he's ugly enough!' Then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were talking about me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I had {{one point}} only that I was {{determined}} to press (Patteson says), namely, liberty to the people to follow any form of religion they might choose to adopt. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> and I were completely in his power, yet that my line was to assume that we were now about to arrange our {{plans for the future}} independently of any interference from the civil power.|$|E
