Specifically, orthogonally crossed fibre/fibre contacts under a compressive normal load over a series of 10, 000 cycle studies are investigated. Reciprocating sliding at a velocity of 0. 4 mm/s − 1, over a track length of 0. 8 mm, was performed at 18 o C and 40 - 50 % relative humidity. <b>Hair</b> <b>fibres</b> retaining their natural sebum were studied, as well as those stripped of their sebum via hexane cleaning, and <b>hair</b> <b>fibres</b> conditioned using a commercially available product.

40|$|The authors {{report the}} case of a 3 -month-old boy with hair-thread {{tourniquet}} syndrome, seen just distal to the MP joint on the right fourth toe. The patient was brought to the hospital with a history of irritability and weeping. On examination there was swelling, ecchymosis and a <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> was found wrapped around his right fourth toe. After the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> was removed there was a fast healing period and no signs of tissue necrosis were seen. Barton et al coined the term hair-thread tourni-quet syndrome in 1988 (1). Hair-thread tourniquet syndrome involves fibres of hair or thread wrapped around an appendage (toe, finger, clitoris, penis etc.) producing tissue necrosis. The earliest reports about hair tourniquet syndrome date back to 1612 (3). CASE REPORT A 3 -month old boy was brought to the hospital with constant weeping, irritability and swelling of his right 4 th toe. On physical examination there was marked oedema and ecchymosis distal to the MP joint of the toe. A <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> was found just distal to the MP joint, wrapped several times around the 4 th toe. There were no signs of tissue necrosis. The <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> was cut out and removed. The length and the colour of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> were similar to his mother’s. It was thought that the fibre might have come from the sock that the baby wore after being bathed, the day before he was brought to the hospital. Irritability and weeping immediately subsided. The foot was kept elevated and the toe was observed for one night; the oedema regressed and the colour of the toe returned to normal (fig 1). No signs of pro-gressive vascular problem or tissue necrosis were noted. The patient was called for daily visits after being discharged. Neither wound nor vascular problems were observed in the follow-up (fig 2). DISCUSSION Hair-thread tourniquet syndrome involves fibres of hair or thread wrapped around an appendage causing tissue necrosis (1, 3). Infants under 6 months are particularly at great risk. There is often a delay of 3 - 4 days before the condition is recognised (2). Fibres of hair or thread may tightly wrap around an infant’s finger, toe or genitals and act like a tourni-quet. It can cause ischaemia, tissue necrosis and occasionally amputation. The majority of the toe and external genital cases were caused by hair...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{specific}} {{production of}} the sheep belonging to the Botosani Karakul breed is the one of lamb pelts, characterized by various qualitative features (shape and size of hair curls, quality, lustre and colour of <b>hair</b> <b>fibres),</b> conferring nobility to this breed and which distinguish it from other sheep breeds. The present study tries an associative analysis of these traits of lamb pelts with different combinations between haemoglobin phenotypes and potassium phenotypes. The most valuable features, concerning shape and size of hair curls, {{as well as the}} quality and lustre of <b>hair</b> <b>fibres</b> are associated with combination of phenotypes HbAB and HK, and the weakest association of these features occur with the phenotypic combination HbBB/LK. The greyish, brown, grey, pink and white colours of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibres</b> are more associated with phenotypic combination HBB/LK, and the lowest frequencies of these colours are found in phenotype HbAB associated with phenotype HK, but this last phenotypic combination is associated to the highest degree with the black colour. The differences among the empirical distributions of qualitative features of the lamb pelts in relation to all phenotypic combinations of the haemoglobin and potassium systems are very significant, fact that recommends the use of these two biochemical genetic systems for the improvement of the Botosani Karakul breed for the lamb pelt production...|$|R

40|$|In {{the modern}} world hair plays a {{cultural}} and aesthetic role. The hair care industry accounts for {{a large portion of}} the cosmetic and dermatological industry generating large financial sums in sales, and consequently research and development into hair care products is important for companies seeking to increase their market share and profits. Currently there are very few products which specifically target certain ethnicities as the basis of knowledge underlying what nanoscopic and molecular factors cause the variation seen at the macroscale of human hair is circumscribed. Therefore a need exists within this industry to expand the information available on the origins of macroscopic variation in differential ethnic hair types. The work presented in this thesis is the embodiment of five different studies: a bulk X-ray scattering analysis of single hair fibres, a series of skin-core experiments utilising microfocus X-ray scattering, an attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study of the cuticle surface and a study of the lipids extracted from different spatial locations within hair fibres. The bulk X-ray scattering analysis on single hair fibres showed that the non-keratinous materials; namely the lipids and the amorphous/disordered material and interfaces present are responsible for the largest source of variation seen inter-ethnically at the nanoscopic and supramolecular levels. The lipids were found to be different amongst hair types with respect to their crystalline spacing, the total intensity and thus volume present and also in the preferential structural orientation of the lipid arrangement. The low angle diffuse scatter which is thought to be related to the keratin associated proteins varied with respect to the extent in q range, the angular behaviour and the behaviour of the diffuse scatter under hydration conditions. The azimuthal spread of the reflection arising from the inter-lateral packing of the keratin intermediate filaments was also found to differ between hair types. The skin-core experiments provide information on the textural variation of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> across the concentric subsections of hair enabling information to be sought on the structural components of the hair. The work presented shows that there are zonal differences in both the keratinous and non-keratinous structures present across the cross-section of the hair fibres both intra and inter-ethnically. The differences seen are in the size and location of specific hierarchical keratinous assembly structures and also in the ultra -structure of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> as whole. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a bench top technique that is widely available to investigate the surface structure of materials. The study presented has shown differences related to the keratin conformational structure and the hydrophilic properties of the hair fibres. There are also variations seen in the products of the cysteine containing structures due to weathering which may be due to a difference in the geographical location of the source. Lipids that are present on either the surface of hair fibres or located within the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> account for the largest non-proteinaceous component present in hair. An investigation characterising the lipids preferentially extracted from different spatial locations of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> has been performed. The work presented has revealed that there is significant variation both intra and inter-ethnically in the total lipid content present, the lipid classes and the fatty acid profiles. The variation in the fatty acid profiles may also possibly be related to the difference in signal seen in the X-ray diffraction study...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of curling hair {{is attributed to}} the fact that the mechanical properties of hair fibres depend on time, temperature and humidity. In this study the dependence of the viscoelastic behaviour of human hair fibres on humidity is characterised in a bending deformation. An experimental set-up was used to perform bending relaxation measurements at different humidities. The relaxation data were fitted using a so-called ?stretched exponential equation?. The humidity dependence was incorporated by applying time-humidity superposition. Also, the influence of humidity on the initial E-modulus was found. The influence of humidity on the behaviour of human hair fibres could be modelled by using a general characterisation of the behaviour of human hair fibres. The general characterisation is used to predict the recovery in a human <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> after curling.

40|$|The tactile {{sensation}} {{of human hair}} during combing by finger or brush is deteriorated by damages induced by external stimuli, such as UV irradiation or bleaching. It is because the characteristics of human hair are affected by external environments. It is reported that the damage on human hair by UV irradiation is accelerated in bleached hair. In this study, changes in physical property of bleached and UV-irradiated hair were examined. Bending stiffness of bleached hair was larger than that of normal hair, and was increased further by UV irradiation. The results of FT-IR measurement showed that the bleach treatment and subsequent UV irradiation induces the S–S bond scission which causes elution or denaturation of amorphous matrix in the cortex layer.

40|$|Background Hair and {{epithelial}} keratins {{constitute the}} major structural {{components of the}} skin and its appendages, including the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre.</b> While it is appreciated that selected steroid hormones regulate specific keratins, {{little is known about}} the neuroendocrine control of human hair keratin expression. Preliminary evidence had suggested that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) may regulate keratin gene transcription. Objectives To clarify whether TRH operates as a novel neuroendocrine regulator of human hair and epithelial keratin expression under physiologically relevant conditions in situ. Methods Microdissected human female scalp hair follicles (HFs) and female scalp skin were treated in serum-free organ culture for 12 h to 6 days with 100 ng mL - 1 TRH or vehicle. Both quantitative immunohistomorphometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were utilized to assess expression of selected keratins. Results TRH significantly increased expression of the hair keratins K 31 and K 32, while that of K 85 and K 86, and of the epithelial keratins K 14 and K 17, was reduced. In the interfollicular epidermis, TRH stimulated expression of K 6, K 14 and K 17, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Stimulation of the same keratins was also evident in the eccrine sweat and sebaceous glands. Conclusions Selected human hair and epithelial keratins are modulated in situ. This may be relevant to explain hair shaft growth-promoting effects of TRH. Our pilot study suggests that the neuroendocrine controls that regulate the expression of human keratins deserve more systematic exploration and that these may be harnessed therapeutically. What's already known about this topic? Although keratins are one of the major structural components of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> and skin epithelium, their hormonal regulation is still relatively ill understood. Because the role of neuropeptide hormones in the control of keratin expression remains largely obscure, we have followed up preliminary microarray-based evidence which had suggested that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) may modulate keratin expression in human hair follicles. What does this study add? The current study provides evidence that the neuropeptide hormone TRH can act as a novel neuroendocrine modulator of the expression of human hair and epithelial keratins in situ; this identifies the neuroendocrine regulation of keratin expression as an exciting new research frontier in skin biology and dermatology. Together with the recently identified stimulatory activity of TRH on mitochondrial activity, hair pigmentation and hair growth in human skin, the potent keratin expression-modulating effects of TRH revealed here may serve as a basis for novel therapeutic strategies that recruit neurohormones to modulate keratin expression in human skin and its appendages. © 2013 The Authors BJD © 2013 British Association of Dermatologists...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the damage induced by cosmetic processes on human hair {{is very important for}} the cosmetic industry, constituting the first step to prevent hair deterioration and to develop new products. The electrophoretical fractionation (SDS-PAGE) of hair proteins leads to a specific electrophoretical pattern, whose regions {{can be attributed to the}} morphological hair components. In the present study, assessing the status of human hair and its changes imparted by cosmetic processes is realised through gel-electrophoretical fractionation of hair proteins. The basis of the study is represented by the fact that all cosmetic processes influence the morphological components of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> and their proteins and that the modifications of the proteins are specific, a characteristic type and degree of damage being induced by each cosmetic treatment. Under standardised conditions the soluble proteins are extracted as S-carbamidomethylated derivatives, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the resulting gels are stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. The densitograms obtained by densitometric measurements of the stained gels are digitised and subjected to cluster analysis, a method of multivariate statistics able o identify the similarities between the digitised protein profiles. The cosmetic treatments are applied on a commercial, European mixed hair sample. Besides oxidative and reductive treatments, carried out as single and multiple treatments, at different treatment duration, styling procedures such as hot curling are performed. The influence of the contact with swimming pool and sea water is also investigated. Cumulative effects of cosmetic processes on hair proteins are studied applying combined cosmetic treatments. The results obtained using the analysis of the electrophoretical patterns for cosmetically treated samples are compared, for selected cases, with the results of traditional methods for assessing hair damage such as amino acid analysis, tensile strength measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. Cluster analysis performed separately for the keratin intermediate filament proteins and for the keratin-associated proteins allows the identification of the morphological components affected by a certain cosmetic treatment and the comparative evaluation of the induced damage degrees. A database of characteristic changes of the electrophoretical protein pattern is built by the analysis of hair samples subjected to standard cosmetic treatments, in conformity with the usage instructions. This database is subsequently used for evaluating the effects of any other non-standard cosmetic treatment on the morphological components of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre.</b> UV-irradiation and cosmetic processes have cumulative influence on hair proteins. The enlargement of the application area for the developed method is suggested by the efficacy evaluation of a series of hair sunscreens applied on hair samples subjected to UV-irradiation...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to {{study the effects of}} redox active {{transition}} metals present in <b>hair</b> <b>fibres</b> upon the photodegradation of hair proteins. Tyrosine based keratin model systems were developed to enable this photochemically critical amino acid to be studied in isolation from other photo-active hair components. The photochemical activity of tyrosine was found to be strongly dependent on molecular environment. In free solution, tyrosyl radicals were very short-lived, whereas radicals in solid systems persisted for many hours. PEG-Tyr block copolymers provide accurate models of tyrosine in a protein polypeptide, in the form of micelles and stable hydrogels. Tyrosine molecular environment in micelles is comparable to α-helical structures of proteins, as analysed by nitroxide spin labelling experiments. Despite significantly different bulk properties, the molecular environment and reactivity of tyrosine in micelles and gels is remarkably similar, although diffusion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Fe(III) becomes a limiting factor in gels. Spin labelling provided a method to monitor the gelation process in real-time. Both Fe(III) and Cu(II) influenced tyrosine photodegradation in PEG-Tyr systems: 100 ppm Fe(III) increased degradation by around 2. 2 times, whereas Cu(II) slowed photodegradation due to Cu-Tyr complexation. The effect of Fe(III) was attributed to increased ROS production leading to autoxidation, direct redox chemistry between metal and tyrosine, and sensitisation of tyrosine by metal complexes. Partitioning of Fe(III) within micelles resulted in a significant enhancement in activity, indicating that Fe(III) can catalytically influence tyrosine photooxidation at concentrations relevant to <b>hair</b> <b>fibres.</b> In a separate study, the effect of humidity upon the formation and decay of protein-based radicals in UV exposed human hair samples was investigated. Increased water content increases radical reactivity, explaining greater protein degradation at higher humidity.

The cuticular structure is char-acterized using a series of descriptors, such as step height, tilt angle and cuticle density, allowing quantitative analysis and comparison of different images. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by a classification study. Thirty-eight AFM images were measured, consisting of hair samples from (a) untreated and bleached hair samples, and (b) the root and distal ends of the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre.</b> The multivariate classification technique partial least squares discriminant analysis is used to test the ability of the algorithm to characterize the images according to the properties of the hair samples. Most of the images (86 %) were found to be classified correctly...|$|E
40|$|Wortmann and Kure (1) have {{developed}} a model to explain the greater ease of setting of a human <b>hair</b> <b>fibre</b> in a bent configuration as against a low extension. Their proposal for a distribution ofYoung's moduli from the surface {{to the core of}} the fibre, based on diffusion-controlled chemical breakdown during the reduction procedure, {{does not appear to be}} applicable to smaller diameter alpha-keratin fibres such as wools and cashmere goat hairs. Their model takes no account of the two-phase composite nature (4) of the cortex of alpha-keratin fibres. A simple model for setting of a fibre in a bent configuration based on the two-phase concept (2) leads to a universal explanation for the greater ease of set in bending as against set at low extensions. In a recent paper Wortmann and Kure (1) were able to explain the set obtained in the permanent waving of human hair in terms of the bending stiffness variation in single hair fibres during the reduction and reoxidation steps. They analysed the difference between change of bending stiffness and change of extensional stress during the chemical reduction step applied to the fibre. This analysis indicated that during reduction the chemical breakdown results in a distribution of Young's moduli from the surface to the core of the fibre. The analysis uggested that the action of the reducing agent is affecte...|$|E
40|$|A {{feature of}} black African hair is an {{apparent}} increased {{fragility of the}} hair shaft compared to other ethnic groups (as measured by the tensile force needed to break the <b>hair</b> <b>fibre).</b> This has certain similarities to that reported for trichorrhexis nodosa (weathering secondary to physical damage) and trichothiodystrophy [a genetic disorder associated with reduced cystine (sulphur) -rich proteins and increased fragility]. In the present study, {{the distribution of the}} cystine-rich proteins in the hair of black Africans was compared to that of Caucasian and Asian volunteers, plus patients with trichorrhexis nodosa and trichothiodystrophy, using transmission electron microscopy and specific silver stains. It was found that the silver staining pattern of the hair shafts of black Africans was similar to that observed for Caucasians, Asians and also patients with trichorrhexis nodosa. The cuticular cells exhibited an electron dense A layer and exocuticle, and in the cortex the microfibrils forming the macrofibres were outlined by electron-dense material. This contrasts with the abnormal distribution of the cystine-rich proteins seen in trichothiodystrophy. This study is the first formal comparison of the cystine-rich proteins in the various racial groups and shows that there is no abnormality in their distribution in black African hair shafts compared to the other ethnic groups. Therefore, the excessive structural damage observed in the African hair shafts is consistent with physical trauma (resulting from grooming) rather than an inherent weakness due to any structural abnormality...|$|E

40|$|Hair {{shampoos}} and conditioners commonly include lubricating {{ingredients that}} facilitate detangling, reduce combing damage {{and enhance the}} perception of smoothness. The quality of the lubrication imparted is routinely assessed using sensory tests as part of product development. The performance can also be investigated using instrumental measurements at an array level, for example, to mimic combing scenarios. In contrast, fundamental studies of friction at the fibre level are much less well-developed. This paper describes stick-slip friction measurements made on single pairs of crossed fibres using a Hanging Fibre Tribometer based around a microbalance. The effects of load and speed are described and interpreted using existing tribological models. Also quantified are differential friction effects associated with the directional surface topography of mammalian <b>hair</b> <b>fibres,</b> and discussed {{in the context of}} recent results obtained on hair using friction force microscopy. Finally, results are described concerning the lubrication imparted by some representative hair care ingredients...|$|R
