In the wind tunnel, four samplers {{designed to measure}} the horizontal dust flux and one sampler designed to measure the vertical dust fur tin the downward direction, i. e., deposition) were calibrated against an isokinetic reference sampler. The horizontal dust flux samplers were: the big spring number eight sampler (BSNE), the modified Wilson and Cooke sampler (MWAC), the suspended sediment trap (SUSTRA), and the wedge dust flux gauge (WDFG). Vertical deposition flux was measured using a marble dust collector (MDCO). A modified Sartorius SM 16711 <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> with adjustable flow rate (SARTORIUS) was used as isokinetic reference sampler. In the field experiments, the WDFG {{was replaced by a}} Sierra ultra high volume <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> (SIERRA). Wind tunnel calibrations were carried out at five wind velocities ranging from 1 to 5 m s(- 1). Field calibrations were conducted during seven periods of two weeks each. The most efficient samplers are the MWAC and the SIERRA, followed by the BSNE and the SUSTRA. The WDFG is more effective than the BSNE at velocities below 3 m s(- 1), but its efficiency drops quickly at higher wind speeds. The most recommendable sampler for field measurements is the BSNE, because its efficiency varies only very slightly with wind speed. In the absence of horizontal flux samplers, the MDCO collector can be used as an alternative to assess horizontal dust flux and airborne dust concentration provided the appropriate calibrations are made.

Most studies have analyzed floor or mattress dust endotoxin, but its validity {{as a proxy for}} airborne exposure is unknown, while active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> is not feasible in large-scale population studies because of logistic and financial limitations. We therefore developed and evaluated a simple passive airborne dust collection method for airborne endotoxin exposure assessment. We explored an electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC), consisting of a 42 - by 29. 6 -cm-sized folder with four electrostatic cloths exposed to the air. The EDC was tested during two 14 -day periods in seven nonfarm and nine farm homes and in farm stables. In parallel, active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> was performed with Harvard impactors and floor dust collected by vacuuming, using nylon sampling socks. The endotoxin levels could be measured in all EDC cloth extracts. The levels (in EU/m 2) between EDCs used simultaneously or in different sampling periods in the same home correlated strongly (r > 0. 8). EDC endotoxin also correlated moderately to strongly (r = 0. 6 to 0. 8) with the endotoxin measured by active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> and living room floor <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> and—in farm homes—with the endotoxin captured by the EDC in stables. In contrast, endotoxin levels measured by floor <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> showed only a poor correlation with the levels measured by active airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling.</b> We therefore conclude that measuring endotoxin levels with the EDC is a valid measure of average airborne endotoxin exposure, while reproducibility over time is at least equivalent to that of reservoir dust analyses...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{an urgent}} need for an {{improved}} understanding of the sources, distributions and properties of atmospheric aerosol {{in order to control}} the atmospheric pollution over northeastern Himalayas where rising anthropogenic interferences from rapid urbanization and development is becoming an increasing concern. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An extensive aerosol sampling program was conducted in Darjeeling (altitude approximately 2200 meter above sea level (masl), latitude 27 degrees 01 'N and longitude 88 degrees 15 'E), a high altitude station in northeastern Himalayas, during January-December 2005. Samples were collected using a respirable <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> and a fine <b>dust</b> <b>sampler</b> simultaneously. Ion chromatograph was used to analyze the water soluble ionic species of aerosol. The average concentrations of fine and coarse mode aerosol were found to be 29. 5 +/- 20. 8 microg m(- 3) and 19. 6 +/- 11. 1 microg m(- 3) respectively. Fine mode aerosol dominated during dry seasons and coarse mode aerosol dominated during monsoon. Nitrate existed as NH(4) NO(3) in fine mode aerosol during winter and as NaNO(3) in coarse mode aerosol during monsoon. Gas phase photochemical oxidation of SO(2) during premonsoon and aqueous phase oxidation during winter and postmonsoon were the major pathways for the formation of SO(4) (2 -) in the atmosphere. Long range transport of dust aerosol from arid regions of western India was observed during premonsoon. The acidity of fine mode aerosol was higher in dry seasons compared to monsoon whereas the coarse mode acidity was higher in monsoon compared to dry seasons. Biomass burning, vehicular emissions and dust particles were the major types of aerosol from local and continental regions whereas sea salt particles were the major types of aerosol from marine source regions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The year-long data presented in this paper provide substantial improvements to the heretofore poor knowledge regarding aerosol chemistry over northeastern Himalayas, and should be useful to policy makers in making control strategies...|$|E

Three suitable antibody combinations were selected for sandwich EIAs. beta-(1, 3) -Glucans in passive airborne dust collected with an electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) and floor dust from seven homes were measured with the three EIAs. Floor <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were additionally analyzed in the inhibition EIA. The sandwich EIAs were sensitive enough for airborne glucan measurement and showed different specificities for commercial glucans, while the beta-(1, 3) -glucan levels in house <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> correlated strongly. The feasibility of measuring glucans in airborne dust with the recently introduced EDC method was further investigated by selecting the most suitable of the three EIAs to measure and compare beta-(1, 3) -glucan levels in the EDC and in floor and actively collected airborne <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> of the previously performed EDC validation study. The EDC beta-(1, 3) -glucan levels correlated moderately with beta-(1, 3) -glucans in actively collected airborne dust and floor <b>dust</b> <b>samples,</b> while the glucan levels in the airborne dust and floor <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> did not correlate. The combination of the newly developed beta-(1, 3) -glucan sandwich EIA with EDC sampling now allows assessment in large-scale population studies of exposure to airborne beta-(1, 3) -glucans in homes or other low-exposure environments...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of indoor}} {{allergen}} exposures are often {{limited by the}} cost and logistics of sending technicians to homes to collect dust. In this study we evaluated the feasibility of having subjects collect their own <b>dust</b> <b>samples.</b> The objectives were to compare allergen concentrations between subject- and technician-collected samples and to examine the sample return rate. Using a dust collection device and written instructions provided to them by mail, 102 subjects collected a combined <b>dust</b> <b>sample</b> from a bed and bedroom floor. Later the same day, a technician collected a side-by-side <b>sample.</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>samples</b> were weighed and analyzed for the cat allergen Fel d 1 and the dust mite allergen Der p 1. Fifty additional subjects who were enrolled by telephone were mailed dust collection packages and asked to return a <b>dust</b> <b>sample</b> and questionnaire by mail. A technician did not visit their homes. Correlations between subject- and technician-collected samples were strong for concentrations of Fel d 1 (r = 0. 88) and Der p 1 (r = 0. 87). With allergen concentrations dichotomized at lower limits of detection and clinically relevant thresholds, agreements between methodologies ranged from 91 to 98 %. Although dust weights were correlated (r = 0. 48, p < 0. 001), subjects collected lighter samples. Among the group of 50 subjects, 46 returned a <b>dust</b> <b>sample</b> and completed questionnaire. The median number of days to receive a sample was 15. With some limitations...|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out by using the 60  W PV module mounted on a stand. <b>Dust</b> <b>sample</b> was being spread uniformly using a flour strainer with sieve size approximately 25 – 30  mm over the module surface, and module is set up under the artificial lightning source. The data for <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> of different weights with change in power loss of solar module at three radiations values of 650, 750 and 850  W/m 2 have been collected and summarized. A multilayer flour strainer is used to spread the <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> uniformly, and an extensive investigation of dust effect on the PV modules is carried out. The experimental setup design and the measurement of performance results in terms of current, voltage and power are taken in real experimental environment.|$|R
