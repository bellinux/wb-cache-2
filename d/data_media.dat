30|$|The review {{indicates}} that many applications exist, where social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> analysis has facilitated decision making within an enterprise [3, 19, 20]. While several methods and algorithms can be utilised for social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> analysis [23], typically supervised learning based {{methods have been}} used for evaluating quality aspects of social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> [6, 36, 38]. In order to understand quality aspects of social <b>media</b> <b>data,</b> different approaches have been proposed for management of quality in social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> [9 – 11, 17, 18]. However, only some the approaches [10, 11] focus on development of architecture for managing the quality of data in a big data system. The contribution of this paper is validation of RA design for management of quality in social <b>media</b> <b>data.</b> Particularly, a proof-of-concept implementation of the RA has been created, which has been validated in product development context focusing on sentiment analysis of tweets.|$|R

The first books to discuss mobile advertising were Ahonen's M-Profits and Haig's Mobile Marketing in 2002. Several major mobile operators around the world launched their own mobile advertising arms, like Aircross in South Korea, owned by the parents of SK Telecoms the biggest mobile operator, or like D2 Communications in Japan, the joint venture of Japan's largest mobile operator NTT DoCoMo and Dentsu, Japan's largest ad agency.|$|E

30|$|Social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> {{may need}} to be cleaned or {{filtered}} before analysing its quality (Serhani). We didn’t focus on the pre-processing phase of the big data pipeline (Fig.  12). When social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> is cleaned/filtered, quality of data may improve, which should be saved into the associated metadata. Social <b>media</b> <b>data</b> may also be processed with offline data processing tools (Sehrani). We aimed at automating the process of data quality evaluation instead of manual processing.

50|$|Media cloud's key {{functionality}} {{comes from}} using web crawling to periodically fetch articles {{from various sources}} and then break them down into words that are counted. These word counts are then analyzed to determine what sources are saying about certain news. This process {{is not unique to}} Media Cloud and in fact is an application of the recently popular stream algorithms. These are algorithms characterized by operating on a continuous and unending stream of data, rather than waiting for a complete batch of information to be assembled. These algorithms are very useful because they allow monitoring of trends without having to know which topics {{are going to be the}} most popular. This type of functionality first noticeably emerged with network managers trying to dynamically see which sites have the highest traffic volumes. From there, stream algorithms have been used to have programs dynamically act on financial information, and by researchers whose experiments generate more data than can be analyzed, so stream algorithms are used to dynamically filter the initial <b>data.</b> <b>Media</b> cloud has similarly taken advantage of the functionality of stream algorithms to dynamically associate words to news as it crawls through various sources, and then provide its signature service of generating sentences based on words that the users are interested in and related media reports.|$|E
