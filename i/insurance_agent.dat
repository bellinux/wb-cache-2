5|$|Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head {{of human}} resources, {{suggests}} to Vidya {{that her husband}} resembled former employee Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life <b>insurance</b> <b>agent.</b> Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Headley {{played for}} the Kensington Club until 1950, when he resumed league cricket in England; he {{returned}} for a final season with Kensington in 1955 before retiring from Senior Cup cricket. Meanwhile, he took a new job as an <b>insurance</b> <b>agent.</b> This affected his availability for cricket as {{he was no longer}} able to take leave when playing for a team; if he did not work, he received no wages. Consequently, he did not accept the captaincy of Jamaica during the Test trials for the 1950 tour of England and did not travel with the team. Press reaction was unfavourable towards Headley but the West Indies Board still wanted to select him for the tour. However, Headley accepted a contract with Bacup in the Lancashire League, to replace Everton Weekes who was in the touring party.|$|E

5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about Davies's date of birth. Most records say November 1886, though usually with the caveat {{that he might}} have been born several years earlier. His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an <b>insurance</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and <b>insurance</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although she appears {{to have had a}} strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an <b>insurance</b> <b>agent,</b> while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the lives of three close friends: Keong (Jack Neo), a spendthrift white-collar worker, Ong (Mark Lee), a general contractor, and Hui (Henry Thia), a kopi tiam waiter. After an argument with his boss (Chen Zhao Jin), Keong quits his job and is unable to get another due to his poor command of English, lack of academic qualifications and computer illiteracy. With bills (especially instalments) to pay and a family to support, he goes heavily into debt whereupon his wife leaves him, taking their daughter with her. Ong borrows S$40,000 from loan sharks, and plans to repay them after collecting a debt owed him by a friend who subsequently runs away. The loan sharks beat up Ong for not repaying the loan within the two-week deadline, so he flees to Johor Bahru. Hui, who is single and lives with his elderly mother, wastes his meagre salary on 4D and pursuing an <b>insurance</b> <b>agent</b> who he has a crush on.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was to develop an architecture to support the Dutch <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> by using ICT. In order to create this support {{an analysis of the}} insurance-market has been performed. Based on this analysis can be concluded that the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> are losing ground to the direct-writers. This is because the directwriters are using the customer for fulfilling parts of the insurance process, and are therefore saving in salary which keeps the insurance fees low. Because of this development, the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> are forced to cut their wages. During {{this research}} a architecture will be developed supporting the following criteria: - Supporting the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> by increasing efficiency - Supporting the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> to differentiate themselves from the directwriters. By analysing the current workflow of the Dutch <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> will be concluded that: - Work is often done multiple times by multiple persons or systems - The same data is stored on and inserted to multiple systems - For differentiating from the direct-writers the agents are depending on the knowledge and experience of the advisors To support these activities in the proposed architecture use will be made of: - Chain integration, sharing and re-use of data and processes between the partners in the insurance chain. - Process support, by using structured data and knowledge stored in ICT supporting the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents.</b> The Straight Through Processing framework is used to measure the current and proposed amount of chain integration by describing the relation between the stage of integration and the costs per transaction. This can be improved by sharing and reusing data supplied to the value chain. In the proposed situation this is done by using a data structure for the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> and sharing this stored data by using the GIMsystem, a standardized protocol for the insurance intermediary. By implementing the proposed data structure into an Application Service Providing model the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents</b> can (re-) use and provide these data without time or location barriers. An other advantage of using the ASP model is storing product and contribution logic on a central place and maintained by a suitable party. By using the knowledge and logic provided by this architecture the intermediary will be supported in his inventory, advise, compare and damage handling tasks. After the draw up of the current, ideal and proposed situation an overview is created with the diverge for the <b>insurance</b> <b>agents.</b> Here will be concluded that, besides training for all future users of the proposed architecture, {{it is important that the}} employees, and especially the advisers, are in advance convinced of the urgency to change and support the change provided by the implementation of the proposed architecture...|$|R
