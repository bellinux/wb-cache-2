5|$|Wills held no {{positions}} of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and only occasionally appeared in local team lists. He nonetheless convinced the club to open its ground to football in winter by arguing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> turf firm and durable. Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne's example and football adapted to an oval-shaped field. By now, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds yet seen.|$|E
5|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) {{originally}} {{announced a}} remake of the 1925 silent film Ben-Hur in December 1952, ostensibly {{as a way to}} spend its Italian assets. Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported to be in the running for the lead. Nine months later, MGM announced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film in CinemaScope, with shooting beginning in 1954. In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it. Sidney Franklin was scheduled to direct, with Marlon Brando intended for the lead. In September 1955, Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg's script was complete, announced that a $7 million, six-to-seven month production would begin in April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM's new 65mm widescreen process, MGM Camera 65. MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956, following Franklin's resignation.|$|E
5|$|Further {{discussion}} on altering the law {{took place in}} 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal: the batsman would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred Lyttelton formally proposed this amendment; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. Lyttelton's brother, Robert, supported the alteration and campaigned {{for the rest of}} his life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad-play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw: the proportion rose from 2% of dismissals in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the Minor Counties Championship, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers.|$|E

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{could be}} one possible way to resolve the paradoxes that {{one would expect to}} arise if time travel turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting closed timelike curves and thus violating causality).

In that sense, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Novikov self-consistency principle unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Request Stop: all {{passengers}} travelling {{alone on}} surface routes (9pm – 5am, excluding streetcar routes) {{can ask the}} driver to stop at points between bus stops. The program started in 1991, {{due in part to}} the activities of serial rapist and killer Paul Bernardo.

25|$|One {{of these}} {{companies}} was the Bendix Corporation, who found the Dashaveyor concept and decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> basis for a competitive AGT system. Its main advantages in this role were its high speed {{and its ability to}} switch among a network of tracks. Most competing AGT systems operated at a fixed speed that was much lower than the Dashaveyor, and normally followed fixed routes. They purchased the company {{and turned it into a}} subsidiary, developing the AGT versions in Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|A {{portrait}} of Harold Wilson, painted by the Scottish portrait artist Cowan Dobson, hangs today at University College, Oxford. Two statues of Harold Wilson stand in prominent places. The first, unveiled by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair in July 1999, stands outside Huddersfield railway station in St George's Square, Huddersfield. Costing £70,000, the statue, designed by sculptor Ian Walters, {{is based on}} photographs taken in 1964 and depicts Wilson in walking pose {{at the start of}} his first term as Prime Minister. His widow, Mary requested that the eight-foot tall monument did not show Wilson holding his famous pipe as she feared <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> representation a caricature.|$|E

25|$|Between 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots {{died during}} active {{military}} service. Of these, approximately 6,800 {{were killed in}} battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease. The majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the British, mostly in the prison ships in New York Harbor. If the upper limit of 70,000 is accepted as the total net loss for the Patriots, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> conflict proportionally deadlier than the American Civil War. Uncertainty arises due to the difficulties in accurately calculating {{the number of those}} who succumbed to disease, as it is estimated at least 10,000 died in 1776 alone. The number of Patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from 8,500 to 25,000.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{question for the}} NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers {{would be likely to}} accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.|$|E

This study was declared to include the possibility of landing a future tunnel underneath the Tank Farm, with a connecting tunnel to south of Victoria Park. Costs are estimated at NZ$3 billion. Some commentators like Brian Rudman have noted that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> most sense to keep the new crossing for public transport only, possibly to connect with a rail tunnel to Britomart Transport Centre. This statement was largely supported by North Shore City mayor George Wood, who noted that public transport provision on the new crossing (including the possibility for light rail or heavy rail to connect to Britomart) {{had been part of}} North Shore City Council's plans for many years.|$|E

25|$|Some EV1 enthusiasts {{believed}} that GM was demonstrating ambivalence towards {{promotion of the}} EV1 after its initial release. While {{one of the first}} EV1 TV spots was nominated for an Emmy Award, later advertising was limited to direct mail and print and TV ads in niche channels. While GM remained officially committed to the electric vehicle, enthusiasts were concerned that low public interest would result in the program being scrapped. One driver, Marvin Rush, a cinematographer for the TV series , became so concerned that he spent $20,000 of his own funds to produce and air four unofficial radio commercials for the car. While the automaker was initially opposed to the action, it later changed its position, announcing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> spots official and reimburse Rush. The company spent $10 million on EV1 advertising in 1997, and promised to increase that amount by $5 million the following year.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerous}} prehistoric creatures inhabiting Skull Island {{were brought}} to life {{through the use of}} stop-motion animation by Willis O’Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson. The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order {{to keep track of the}} stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus took seven weeks to be completed. O’Brien’s protegé, Ray Harryhausen, who would work with him on several films and become one of the most prominent stop-motion animators in Hollywood, stated that O’Brien’s second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.|$|E
