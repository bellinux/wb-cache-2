25|$|The {{concept of}} having rail lines which could bring people from {{door to door}} without {{requiring}} the use of road-based buses was much favoured by the government transport planners, especially with the increased emphasis on a rail-based public transport network. For intra town travel, LRTs were favoured over buses because trains run on dedicated elevated guideways, bypassing any traffic congestion and traffic lights on the roads, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> to road traffic. Train arrival and departure times are also almost guaranteed this way. It is also cleaner as the trains are electrically powered, and therefore lessens the effects of air pollution.|$|E

25|$|Words {{with a final}} r in {{the word}} stem, such as vetr, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> another -r, as the sounds are already the same. The effect of the {{dropping}} usually results in the lack of distinction between some forms of the noun. In the case of vetr the dropping renders the nominative and accusative singular and plural identical; the nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural {{would otherwise have been}} *vetrr (*vintrʀ), while the accusative singular would still have been vetr. This is because the 3rd strong masculine declension, to which it belongs, marks the nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural, but not the accusative singular, with inflectional ʀs.|$|E
25|$|The larva has 9 {{abdominal}} segments, but {{the number}} increases through moulting until the full adult number of 12 is reached. Further moults may occur, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> any more body segments, {{and it is not}} known whether the adults continue to moult through their lives. Eggs have only been observed in a few species. Five developmental stages follow: the prelarva hatches from the egg and has only weakly developed mouthparts and 9 abdominal segments; larva I follows and has fully developed mouthparts; larva II has ten abdominal segments; maturus junior has 12 abdominal segments and is followed by the adult. The family Acerentomidae differs in having an extra preimago stage, with partially developed genitalia, between the maturus junior and the adult.|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of}} the software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E

500|$|The {{final round}} is always played {{at least in}} part in a [...] "speed-up" [...] format, in which the host spins the wheel to {{determine}} the value of each consonant, with $1,000 being added to the value on which the wheel stops before the red contestant's arrow. Vowels <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> or deduct money from the contestants' scores in the speed-up round. The contestant in control calls one letter, and if it appears in the puzzle, the contestant is given three seconds to attempt to solve. Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the contestant who was in control {{at the time of the}} final spin, until the puzzle is solved. The three-second timer does not begin until the hostess has revealed all instances of a called letter and moved aside from the puzzle board, and the contestant may offer multiple guesses on his/her turn. After the speed-up round, the total winnings of the three contestants are compared. The contestant with the highest total winnings wins the game and advances to the bonus round. Contestants who fail to earn any cash or prizes in the game are awarded a consolation prize of $1,000 (or $2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams).|$|E
500|$|Portal: Still Alive was {{announced}} as an exclusive Xbox Live Arcade {{game at the}} 2008 E3 convention, and was released on October 22, 2008. It features the original game, 14 new challenges, and new achievements. The additional content was based on levels from the map pack Portal: The Flash Version created by We Create Stuff and contains no additional story-related levels. According to Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi, Microsoft had previously rejected Portal on the platform due to its large size. Portal: Still Alive was well received by reviewers. 1UP.com's Andrew Hayward stated that, with the easier access and lower cost than paying for The Orange Box, Portal is now [...] "stronger than ever". IGN editor Cam Shea ranked it fifth on his top 10 list of Xbox Live Arcade games. He stated that it was debatable whether an owner of The Orange Box should purchase this, as its added levels <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> to the plot. However, he praised {{the quality of the}} new maps included in the game. The game ranked 7th in a later list of top Xbox Box Live titles compiled by IGN's staff in September 2010.|$|E
500|$|Sheng nu (剩女; shèngnǚ; common translation: [...] "leftover women" [...] or [...] "leftover ladies") is a {{derogatory}} term made popular by the All-China Women's Federation that classifies {{women who}} remain unmarried {{in their late}} twenties and beyond. The term is most prominently used in China, including a state sponsored directive and program, but {{has been used to}} describe women across Asia, India, and North America. The term has gone on to become widely used in the mainstream media and {{has been the subject of}} several televisions series, magazine and newspaper articles, and book publications focusing on both the good and bad aspects of the term and surrounding culture. [...] Xu Xiaomin of The China Daily described the sheng nus as [...] "a social force to be reckoned with" [...] while others have argued the term should be taken as a positive to mean [...] "successful women". The slang term, 3S or 3S Women, meaning [...] "single, seventies (1970s), and stuck" [...] has also been used in place of sheng nu. The equivalent term for men, guang gun (光棍) meaning bare branches, is used to refer to men who do not marry and thus <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>add</b> 'branches' to the family tree.
