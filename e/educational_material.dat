This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces <b>educational</b> <b>material,</b> including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E

Finally, we present a set of properties {{that can be taken}} into account as design guidelines for <b>educational</b> gamified <b>materials.</b> This set of properties secure the engagement of <b>educational</b> <b>materials.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine two <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> from {{different}} decades, to see if they have a conscious gender and equality perspective, and to see if they have followed the development society made regarding gender and equality. Even the curricula have a part in my study as I will relate them to the <b>educational</b> <b>materials.</b> Equality as a concept means briefly that women and men should have the same conditions, and gender depicts our notions of femininity and masculinity. I have chosen to do textual analyses, focusing on multimodal discourse because I analyze both text and image. I also use both quantitative and qualitative methods. My questions are: In which way do the curricula and the <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> express equality?; In which way do the curricula and the <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> express gender?; Do the <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> express the fundamental values written about equality and gender in the curricula? And, if this is the case, does it mean that <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> have followed the development of the Swedish society? The conclusion of this work is that equality and gender are presented as goals in both curricula, but the new curricula have developed that section more. With external criteria, such as the characters' appearance and their qualities, the <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> express equality and gender. Both learning materials express fundamental values in the curricula​​ but none of the studied material are equal in the full sense. ...|$|R

This article concludes that there is significant alignment between the views of students and publishers as to what constitutes quality teaching and learning materials, and that students interpret the quality of materials by aligning materials to their own prior knowledge.

25|$|The revival {{focused on}} reconstructing and standardising the language, {{including}} coining new words for modern concepts, and creating <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> {{in order to}} teach Cornish to others. In 1929 Robert Morton Nance published his Unified Cornish system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish {{for most of the}} 20th century. However, as the revival grew in strength and focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language seemed less suitable for a spoken revival, and academic research into the traditional literature proved that the Unified system lacked some phonological distinctions.|$|E

The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} {{companies of}} S Global have history dating to 1888, when James H. McGraw purchased the American Journal of Railway Appliances. He continued to add further publications, eventually establishing The McGraw Publishing Company in 1899. John A.

In 1909 both men, having known each other's interests, agreed upon an alliance and combined the book departments of their publishing companies into The McGraw-Hill Book Company. John Hill served as President, with James McGraw as Vice-President. In 1917, the remaining parts of each business were merged into The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company In 1986, McGraw-Hill bought out competitor The Economy Company, then the United States' largest publisher of <b>educational</b> <b>material.</b> The buyout made McGraw-Hill the largest educational publisher in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Armistice of Mudros, the {{subsequent}} occupation of İstanbul, and the incompetence {{of the government}} in İstanbul had important effects on the school. As the school was given only 2 days to evacuate the building by the commander of the occupying forces, most of the valuable library and the <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> had to be left behind. The school was not able to find a suitable building for a long time, and some students continued their education in different buildings, sometimes in different schools. Nonetheless, the faculty was still very strong and many of the teachers, such as Hasan Ali Yücel, Mazhar Nedim, Memduh Şevket Esendal, would become the prominent figures and/or leaders that contributed to the shaping of the society, ideological basis, and the governance of the Republic of Turkey. Some of the students and many alumni would join Atatürk in his struggle for independence at very early stages, and some would lose their lives during the battles.|$|E

The government has produced <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> on how the disease is spread and since the 1980s Abdullah al-Hokail, a Saudi doctor who specializes in the pandemic, {{has been allowed to}} air public service announcements on television about the disease and how it is spread. Yet, ignorance, fear and prejudice are often directed at people living with the disease. While the government has designated several hospitals to treat those people infected with AIDS or HIV, other hospitals often refuse to care for such people or fail to treat them in a compassionate and humane manner. Hospitals and schools are often reluctant to distribute government information about the disease because of strong taboos and the stigma attached to how the virus can be spread. For example, condoms are legal, but until recently, they were rarely available anywhere other than certain hospitals or medical supply stores.|$|E

The series of books she {{produced}} between 1786 and 1798 were used in Britain and its colonies well into the 19th century. Trimmer was an able promoter of her materials; she knew that her books would not reach large numbers of poor children in charity schools unless they were funded and publicized by the SPCK. She wrote in her journal [...] "my scheme without its aid, will fall to the ground". Thus, she joined the society in 1787. In 1793, she sent 12 copies of her treatise Reflections upon the Education in Charity Schools with the Outlines of a Plan Appropriate Instruction for the Children of the Poor to the subcommittee that chose the books funded by the organization. In the treatise, she argued that the current charity school curriculum was outdated (it was over 100 years old) {{and needed to be}} replaced.
