However, in 919 Admiral Romanos Lekapenos married his daughter to Constantine VII and in 920 proclaimed himself senior emperor, ruining Simeon I's ambitions to ascend the throne by diplomatic means. Until his death, the Bulgarian monarch never recognized the legitimacy of Romanos' accession to the throne. Thus, {{in the beginning of}} 921 Simeon I did not reply to a proposal of the Ecumenical Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos to betroth one of his daughters or sons to a progeny of Romanos I and sent his army into Byzantine Thrace, reaching Katasyrtai in the outskirts of Constantinople. Romanos I retaliated with a campaign under Pothos Argyros, who reached the town of Aquae Calidae, near modern Burgas, but part of his army was ambushed and destroyed by the Bulgarians.|$|E

500|$|The Beach Boys's leader, Brian Wilson, was {{responsible}} for the musical composition and virtually all of the arrangement for [...] "Good Vibrations". His cousin and bandmate Mike Love contributed the song's lyrics and its bass vocalization in the chorus. During the recording sessions for the 1966 album Pet Sounds, Wilson began changing his writing process. Rather than going to the studio with a completed song, he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked, take an acetate disc home, and then compose the song's melody and write its lyrics. For [...] "Good Vibrations", Wilson said, [...] "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and <b>I</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> fit them together like a mosaic." [...] Most of the song's structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded. Engineer Chuck Britz is quoted saying that Wilson considered the song to be [...] "his whole life performance in one track". Wilson stated: [...] "I was an energetic 23-year-old. ... I said: 'This is going to be better than [...] "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."'" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{put him in}} a roomy box-car and bedded him {{knee-deep in}} clean yellow straw. I padded the {{hitching}} pole with his blanket, moistened his hay, and put some bran before him.

Not hurrying over the job, I had the fittings knocked together in contriving ways under my own inspection, and here was her bed in a berth with curtains, and there was her reading-table, and here was her writing-desk, and elsewhere was her books in rows upon rows, picters and no picters, bindings and no bindings, gilt-edged and plain, just as I could pick 'em up for her in lots up and down the country, North and South and West and East, Winds liked best and winds liked least, Here and there and gone astray, Over the hills and far away. And when I had got together pretty well as many books as the cart would neatly hold, a new scheme come into my head, which, as it turned out, kept my time and attention a good deal employed, and helped me over the two years' stile.|$|E
