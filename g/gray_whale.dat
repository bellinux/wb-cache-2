5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> {{has been}} placed {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is {{more closely related to}} certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly to the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to other rorquals such as the minke whales.|$|E
25|$|Humans and {{killer whales}} (orcas) are the adult <b>gray</b> <b>whale's</b> only predators. Aboriginal hunters, {{including}} those on Vancouver Island and the Makah in Washington, have hunted <b>gray</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A second, shorter, {{and less}} {{intensive}} hunt occurred for <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> {{in the eastern}} North Pacific. Only a few were caught from two whaling stations {{on the coast of}} California from 1919 to 1926, and a single station in Washington (1911–21) accounted for the capture of another. For the entire west coast of North America for the years 1919 to 1929, some 234 <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> were caught. Only a dozen or so were taken by British Columbian stations, nearly all of them in 1953 at Coal Harbour. A whaling station in Richmond, California, caught 311 <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> for [...] "scientific purposes" [...] between 1964 and 1969. From 1961 to 1972, the Soviet Union caught 138 <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> (they originally reported not having taken any). The only other significant catch was made in two seasons by the steam-schooner California off Malibu, California. In the winters of 1934–35 and 1935–36, the California anchored off Point Dume in Paradise Cove, processing <b>gray</b> <b>whales.</b> In 1936, <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> became protected in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The term Point Barrow <b>whales</b> {{refers to}} <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> that {{were trapped in}} the ice at Point Barrow in 1988, which {{attracted}} attention from the public worldwide. The Iñupiat do not hunt <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> and joined in rescue operations which also involved Soviet icebreakers.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the <b>gray</b> <b>whale).</b> There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, {{it will be necessary to}} reclassify the rorquals.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (<b>gray</b> <b>whale).</b> Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
25|$|Marine mammals include seals, sea lions, {{humpback}} <b>whales,</b> killer <b>whales,</b> <b>gray</b> <b>whales,</b> blue whales, sperm whales, pacific white-sided dolphin, and bottlenose dolphin.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, two {{conservation}} biologists {{proposed a}} plan to airlift 50 <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. They reasoned that, as Californian <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> had replenished to a suitable population, surplus whales could be transported to repopulate the extinct British population. [...] this plan has not been undertaken.|$|R

5|$|The tribes {{involved}} benefited {{greatly from}} the decision. Prior to Boldt's ruling, Indians collected {{less than five}} percent (5%) of the harvest, but by 1984, they were collecting forty-nine percent (49%). Tribal members became successful commercial fishermen, even expanding to marine fishing {{as far away as}} Alaska. The tribes became co-managers of the fisheries along with the state, hiring fish biologists and staff to carry out those duties. The Makah tribe, based on the terms of the Neah Bay Treaty and the Boldt decision, took their first California <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> in over seventy years in 1999. Following a lawsuit by various animal rights activists, the tribe was allocated the right to take up to five whales a year for the 2001 and 2002 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> {{was removed}} from the Endangered Species List, the Makah re-asserted their whaling rights. With the support and {{guidance}} of the United States government and the International Whaling Commission, the Makah successfully hunted a <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> on May 17, 1999. According to federal law, the Makah are entitled to hunt and kill one baleen whale, typically a <b>gray</b> <b>whale,</b> each year. Archaeological records and oral history indicate a significant number of humpback whales were historically hunted as well.|$|E
25|$|According to the Government of Canada's Management Plan for <b>gray</b> <b>whales,</b> {{threats to}} the eastern North Pacific {{population}} of <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> include: increased human activities in their breeding lagoons in Mexico, climate change, acute noise, toxic spills, aboriginal whaling, entanglement with fishing gear, boat collisions, and possible impacts from fossil fuel exploration and extraction.|$|R
50|$|Tourism, now closely controlled, was {{formerly}} {{a threat to}} the <b>gray</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} {{cetaceans}} are found near the Farallon Islands, most frequently <b>gray</b> <b>whales,</b> blue whales, and humpback whales. Blue whales and humpback whales {{are most frequently}} found near the islands {{in the summer and}} fall, when strong upwelling may support a rich pelagic food web. Killer whales are also found around the islands. <b>Gray</b> <b>whales</b> are reliably found near the Farallones during their spring migration north and the fall/winter migration south. Some <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> may also be found during the summer, when a few whales skip the trip north to Alaska and spend the summer months off the coast of Canada and the continental United States.|$|R
25|$|Currently, {{the annual}} quota for the <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> {{catch in the}} region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an {{agreement}} between the United States and Russia, the Makah tribe of Washington claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea.|$|E
25|$|The current western <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> {{population}} {{summers in}} the Sea of Okhotsk, mainly off Piltun Bay region at the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island (Russian Federation). There are also occasional sightings off the eastern coast of Kamchatka (Russian Federation) {{and in other}} coastal waters of the northern Okhotsk Sea. Its migration routes and wintering grounds are poorly known, the only recent information being from occasional records on both the eastern and western coasts of Japan and along the Chinese coast. <b>Gray</b> <b>whale</b> had not been observed on Commander Islands until 2016.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, the Californian <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> {{population}} {{had grown to}} about 26,000. As of 2011, the population of western Pacific (seas near Korea, Japan, and Kamchatka) gray whales was an estimated 130.|$|E

50|$|In Chinese EEZ, {{critically}} endangered North Pacific right <b>whales</b> {{and western}} <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> had been sighted in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea only on prior to 1970s especially for right whales while {{there had been}} records of <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> and the only record in 21st century was of a matured female accidentally being killed in local fisheries in Pingtan on Taiwan Strait in 2007.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>whales</b> can {{sometimes}} be seen migrating along the coast, and more rarely, humpback whales are spotted.|$|R
25|$|One key concern from {{environmental}} groups {{is that the}} Sakhalin-2 project will harm the western <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> population. The whales summer feeding grounds {{are close to the}} project's offshore platforms in the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other names}} have been {{ascribed}} to the <b>gray</b> <b>whale,</b> including desert whale, devilfish, gray back, mussel digger and rip sack. The name Eschrichtius gibbosus is sometimes seen; this {{is dependent on the}} acceptance of a 1777 description by Erxleben.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gray</b> <b>whale</b> became {{extinct in}} the North Atlantic in the 18th century. Other than speculations, large {{portions}} of historical characteristic of migration and distribution are unclear such as locations of calving grounds, existences of resident groups, and occurrences within Black and Azov Seas.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of satellite whale tags used to track <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> {{in the eastern}} north Pacific Ocean is summarized. Two <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> were radio-tagged in San Ignacio Lagoon (Mexico) and tracked on their northbound migration.

25|$|California {{waters are}} {{also home to}} eleven species of dolphins, {{including}} the short-beaked common dolphin and the Pacific white-sided dolphin. A dozen species of whales live in California, including the killer whale and the <b>gray</b> <b>whale.</b> At least 34 species of sharks have been recorded off the California Coast, including the great white shark and tiger shark.|$|E
25|$|A few Native American tribes hunted in the North Pacific. Their catches {{were much}} lower than the Japanese. The Inuit along the western and northwestern coasts of Alaska have hunted whales for centuries. They prefer the bowhead whale, and {{occasionally}} the <b>gray</b> <b>whale.</b> They hunted at or beyond the northern limits of the right whale's range.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{studies on}} {{historical}} catches and observations, some <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> could have occurred year-round off China, possibly summering in Bohai Sea. [...] There {{had been at}} least 24 records of <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> in Chinese waters since 1933 including sightings, strandings, and bycatch. DNA analysis of 2011 specimen indicate that this female might not originate in the western population. Whether or not humpback whales ever summered within Yellow and Bohai basins historically is unknown.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, presences of <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> were acoustically {{detected}} among pelagic {{waters in}} East China Sea between Chinese and Japanese waters.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>whales</b> are coastal migratory baleen whales {{that are}} benthic feeders. Most of their feeding {{takes place in}} the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean with opportunistic feeding taking place during their migrations and residence on the breeding grounds. The concentrations of organochlorines and trace elements were determined in tissues and stomach contents of juvenile <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> that were taken on their Arctic feeding grounds in the western Bering Sea during a Russian subsistence harvest. These concentrations were compared to previously published data for contaminants in <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> that stranded along the west coast of the US during their northbound migration. Feeding in coastal waters during their migrations may present a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals in some regions. The mean concentration (standard error of the mean, SEM) of Σ PCBs [1400 (130) ng/g, lipid weight] in the blubber of juvenile subsistence whales was significantly lower than the mean level [27 000 (11 000) ng/g, lipid weight] reported previously in juvenile <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> that stranded in waters off the west coast of the US. Aluminum in stomach contents of the subsistence whales was high compared to other marine mammal species, which is consistent with the ingestion of sediment during feeding. Furthermore, the concentrations of potentially toxic chemicals in tissues were relatively low when compared to the concentrations in tissues of other marine mammals feeding at higher trophic levels. These chemical contaminant data for the subsistence <b>gray</b> <b>whales</b> substantially increase the information available for presumably healthy animals...|$|R
