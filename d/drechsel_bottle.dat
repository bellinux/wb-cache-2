30|$|Measurements with acid traps {{were carried}} out in four {{intervals}} of 5  h during the first 4  days after slurry application. Measuring for 4  days was considered enough to reveal the possible differences in NH 3 emission, because according to earlier studies NH 3 emission is at its highest rate {{on the day of}} application and declines sharply in the following few days (Yang et al. 2003). The total amount of emitted NH 3 during the 4  days was derived by interpolation of the integral form of a power curve of the amount of NH 3 trapped in the <b>Drechsel</b> <b>bottle</b> during the four measurements.|$|E
40|$|THE {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbon content of air may {{be determined by}} analysis of smoke which is collected usually by filtration. When ambient atmospheres are sampled it is tacitly assumed that the sought hydrocarbons are present only in the solid phase and are not appreciably volatile at {{the temperature of the}} filter. In the course of recent work on air pollution by vehicle exhausts (Commins, Waller and Lawther, 1957), filters used to collect smoke in track and bench tests became hot and this observation indicated the urgent need to examine the validity of this method of sampling. In the investigation reported here 3, 4 -benzpyrene was the only hydrocarbon considered. EXPERIMENTAL The presence in town air of 3, 4 -benzpyrene in the vapour phase was sought by drawing filtered air through a <b>drechsel</b> <b>bottle</b> containing pure liquid paraffin. This solvent, in which 3, 4 -benzpyrene fluoresces very strongly, was used because the volatility of the more commonly used solvents made them unsuitable for use in a long experiment. The liquid paraffin was not fluorescent at the beginnin...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{measurements}} {{have been}} the basis for monitoring volcanic gas emissions for many years and—being complemented by remote sensing techniques—still {{play an important role}} to date. Con- cerning in situ techniques for sampling a dilute plume, an increase in accuracy and a reduction of detection limits are still necessary for most gases (e. g., CO 2, SO 2, HCl, HF, HBr, HI). In this work, the Raschig-Tube tech- nique (RT) is modified and utilized for application on volcanic plumes. The theoretical and experimental absorption properties of the RT and the <b>Drechsel</b> <b>bottle</b> (DB) setups are characterized and both are applied simultaneously to the well-established Filter packs technique (FP) in the field (on Stromboli Island and Mount Etna). The comparison points out that FPs are the most practical to apply but the results are error- prone compared to RT and DB, whereas the RT results in up to 13 times higher analyte concentrations than the DB in the same sampling time. An optimization of the analytical procedure, including sample pretreat- ment and analysis by titration, Ion Chromatography, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, led to a comprehensive data set covering a wide range of compounds. In particular, less abundant species were quantified more accurately and iodine was detected {{for the first time in}} Stromboli’s plume. Simultane- ously applying Multiaxis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) the chemical transforma- tion of emitted bromide into bromine monoxide (BrO) from Stromboli and Etna was determined to 3 – 6 % and 7 %, respectively, within less than 5 min after the gas release from the active vents...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{two major}} {{advantages}} of microalga Neochloris oleoabundans {{have been taken}} into account: purification of the syngas contaminant water (SCW) and providing biomass yield from microalgae growth by using syngas contaminant together with BG 11 microalgal growth medium [1] as a feedstock. 10 kW imbert type downdraft gasifier fueled with wood chips {{have been used to}} obtain syngas contaminant [2]. A certain amount of the wood-gas is derived after the biofiltering process and is sent to the Water Algae Photo-Bio-Scrubber System (WAPBS) : a series of <b>Drechsel</b> <b>bottles</b> are filled with syngas cleansing water (SCW). Tar and particulate are trapped in the water inside the WAPBS, while part of the syngas contaminant is available for the micro algae to be converted into biomass. At {{the end of the process}} char and tar content of the syngas contaminant used by microalgae have been observed and microalgal growth of N. oleoabundans have been monitored during the process of WAPBS...|$|R
50|$|Laboratory scale {{spargers}} (also {{known as}} gas diffusing stones or diffusors) {{as well as}} scrubbers, and gas-washing <b>bottles</b> (or <b>Drechsel</b> <b>bottles)</b> are similar glassware items which may use a fritted glass piece fused {{to the tip of}} a gas-inlet tube. This fritted glass tip is placed inside the vessel with liquid inside during use such that the fritted tip is submerged in the liquid. To maximize surface area contact of the gas to the liquid, a gas stream is slowly blown into the vessel through the fritted glass tip so that it breaks up the gas into many tiny bubbles. The purpose of sparging is to saturate the enclosed liquid with the gas, often to displace another gaseous component. The purpose of a scrubber or gas-washing bottle is to scrub the gas such that the liquid absorbs one (or more) of the gaseous components to remove it from the gas stream, effectively purifying the gas stream.|$|R
40|$|Weichardt {{claims to}} have {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of an}} organic body in the expired air. He allowed the exhaled breath to pass through hydrochloric acid solution, evaporated the resulting solution to dryness on a water bath, and obtained a weighable residue which charred on ignition. If he neutralized the acid solution and concentrated it under reduced pressure, he obtained a solution which inhibited the bluing of the guaiacum indicator by blood. By exposing calcium chloride in a room in which the air had been vitiated, he claimed also to have obtained a substance from the air which prevented the bluing of the guaiacum indicator by blood. The experiments here recorded show that a variable amount of matter is retained by weak hydrochloric solution when exhaled breath is passed through it, and that this matter is volatile on ignition. Contrary to the findings of Weichardt, there is no charring or blackening. Nesslerization shows the residue to consist mainly, if not wholly, of ammonium chloride. This ammonia is believed to have come from the decomposition of food particles about the teeth. In one case the person (S.) had smoked just before the experiment, so that a small amount of the ammonia from the tobacco smoke may have been held temporarily by the saliva and food particles in the mouth and been given off gradually during the experiment. Weichardt's experiments on the inhibition of the guaiacum test for blood by means of the substances retained when exhaled breath is passed through hydrochloric acid or over calcium chloride crystals are not corroborated. It is further shown that the guaiacum indicator is unreliable for these tests {{in view of the fact}} that a small amount of free acid or free alkali will inhibit the guaiacum test for blood. This fact is offered as a probable explanation of Weichardt's results. Calcium chloride alone gives a deep blue color with the guaiacin indicator. Weichardt used this salt to collect from the expired breath certain unknown substances which he claims inhibit the oxidation of guaiacum by blood. His results are therefore inconclusive. The phenolphthalin test for blood has been studied in this connection and further light has been thrown on this reaction. The sodium salt of phenolphthalin is colorless in alkaline solution, and is readily oxidized by minute quantities of blood to phenolphthalein which gives a characteristic deep purplish red color in alkaline solution. It has been found that the presence of calcium chloride and ammonium chloride in small amounts retards and, in large amounts, prevents this reaction. It is believed that any salt composed of a weak base combined with a strong acid will have the same effect. This is discussed in the text. It has also been shown that the presence of calcium chloride or ammonium chloride decreases the depth of color of phenolphthalein in sodium hydroxide solution. Carbon dioxide also prevents the oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood. Of course this does not mean that carbon dioxide prevents the action of the oxidizing ferments generally. In this particular case the substance to be oxidized, namely phenolphthalin, was not allowed by reason of the presence of the carbon dioxide to combine with the alkali and thereby assume a state in which it could be easily oxidized. The results of one experiment seem to indicate a relation between the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solutions and the percentage of oxidation. Sodium chloride either alone or with the aid of hydrogen peroxide is able to bring about the oxidation of phenolphthalin in alkali to a very slight extent (3. 5 to 5 per cent. in twenty-four hours). Therefore phenolphthalin as a test for oxidizing ferments should not be used in the presence of an appreciable amount of inorganic salts or carbon dioxide. Complete dialysis is recommended in these cases. It is also to be noted that the great delicacy of the test allows considerable dilution. Liquids were obtained from the expired breath by passing this through weak hydrochloric acid or by condensing the moisture in it by conducting it through cooled <b>Drechsel</b> <b>bottles.</b> Attempts were then made to prove the presence in these liquids of some substance which inhibits the oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood, but all were unsuccessful. Moreover attempts to concentrate these liquids by evaporation under reduced pressure or by the passage of a direct current (colloidal travel) were also unsuccessful. It is planned to improve upon the apparatus used to concentrate colloids by the passage of a direct current, and to test the effect of expired breath products on the rate of oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood...|$|R
