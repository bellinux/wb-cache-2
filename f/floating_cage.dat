Three methods of cage culture exist. The first farming method, is a <b>floating</b> <b>cage,</b> where a frame about 10 to 20 m2 in area {{is supported by}} buoys and holds the lobster cages, and is normally moored in waters 10-20m deep. Such cage method occurs most commonly on Nha Trang Bay. The second farming method is wooden fixed cages, made from 2.5m length by 10 cm width wood with salt resistance, placed about 2 m apart so to create a square shape and normally have an area of 20-40 m2 up to 100-200 m2 with varying cage size. They are usually on or off seabed in areas with little wave activity. Normally such cage methods are found in Van Phong Bay. The third cage farming method is the submerged cage method, made from iron mesh with meshing of 15-16 mm, with an overall size of the cage ranging from 1 - 16 m2 and with a height of 1 - 1.5 m. These submerged cages, are most common around the Nha Phu Lagoon.|$|E

The <b>floating</b> <b>cage</b> has been designed to sail short distances and to operate near the coast with good weather.

At the stern bottom it has two azimuth propellers, on per side, to propels the <b>floating</b> <b>cage.</b> It’s not necessary to install a rudder because this kind of propulsion can turn round by themselves, so the ship can maneuver easily too.

40|$|The New Caledonia {{blue shrimp}} Litopenaeus stylirostris is commercially {{produced}} under semi-intensive rearing conditions. The {{size of the}} farming earthen ponds (5 ? 10 ha) and the subsequent production constraints {{make it difficult to}} use them as experimental units for random experiments. Moreover, since every pond has its own characteristics, ponds' effects cannot be ruled out, thus making it hard to define true replicates. In order to design future experiments under conditions resembling those used in production, we evaluated the possible use of <b>floating</b> <b>cages</b> as experimental units with the aim of assessing treatment effects with a reasonable statistical power. To this end, two sets of <b>floating</b> <b>cages</b> were placed respectively in two different ponds in a commercial farm. In both cases the zootechnical conditions in the cages were similar in post-larvae origin, management, and diet and feeding regime. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate on a technical basis the possibility of rearing shrimps in <b>floating</b> <b>cages</b> set up in earthen ponds and to assess this method from a statistical standpoint. Shrimps reared in and outside the cages showed comparable growth and survival rates. The variability in the zootechnical parameters between cages, expressed as the estimated coefficient of variation (CV) for survival rate, total final biomass (g), final body weight (g), daily increment in body weight (g day− 1) and FCR were 11. 0, 13. 7, 4. 4, 5. 4, and 7. 0 %, respectively. On the basis of these figures, we calculated for a given statistical power (80 %) the number of replicates (cages) that would be required to reveal significant differences between two treatments, at a 5 % level of significance. We found that for expected differences of 20 % from the control mean, 3 and 6 <b>floating</b> <b>cages</b> per treatment would be reasonable to determine statistical differences for growth parameters and survival rate, respectively. Moreover, we showed a significant pond effect in regard to survival and growth between the two sets of cages.
