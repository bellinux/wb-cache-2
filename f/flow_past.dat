5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the <b>flow</b> <b>past</b> such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of glacial {{conditions}} returned between 12,650 and 11,550 years BP, known in Britain as the Loch Lomond Stadial (and elsewhere as the Younger Dryas stadial), when the Gulf Stream current ceased to <b>flow</b> <b>past</b> the British Isles. Small cirque and valley glaciers formed in north and east facing valleys, including Grisedale and the coves {{on the east side}} of Helvellyn. The results are seen in moraines of unsorted boulder gravel in the valleys, the spectacular coves with steep headwalls, and the sharp arêtes formed where the rock was eroded on both sides between adjacent glaciers.|$|E

A branch of a canal that also flows into the Terdoppio enters the Erbognone after it <b>flows</b> <b>past</b> Mortara. The stream flows mostly in a southward direction (now changes its name to Erbognone) and is roughly parallel to the Agogna until it bends and enters the Agogna.|$|R

5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define <b>flow</b> <b>past</b> singularities in plane curves.|$|E

25|$|The diving {{regulator}} is {{a mechanism}} which reduces {{the pressure of}} the supply of breathing gas and provides it to the diver at approximately ambient pressure.

25|$|A part of {{the upper}} Darling River system {{collapsed}} during this drought. By October 1994, the Condamine River was exhausted, reverting {{to a series of}} ponds. Across the state more than 13,000 properties, totaling 40% of Queensland was drought declared. The <b>flow</b> <b>past</b> Goondiwindi was the lowest since 1940. Cotton farms near Moree and Narrabri had been allocated no water for irrigation, which resulted in a major loss of production. The town of Warwick was particularly affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to <b>flow</b> <b>past</b> the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood <b>flow</b> <b>past</b> {{the point of}} injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), {{and can lead to}} a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E
