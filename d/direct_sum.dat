We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E

5|$|In {{category}} theory, disjoint {{union is}} seen as a particular case of the coproduct operation, and general coproducts are perhaps the most abstract of all the generalizations of addition.

5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the <b>direct</b> <b>sum</b> of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{arbitrary}} <b>direct</b> <b>sums</b> and <b>direct</b> {{limits of}} flat modules are flat, {{a consequence of}} the fact that the tensor product commutes with <b>direct</b> <b>sums</b> and <b>direct</b> limits (in fact with all colimits), and that both <b>direct</b> <b>sums</b> and <b>direct</b> limits are exact functors. Submodules and factor modules of flat modules need not be flat in general (e.g. Z/nZ is not a flat Z-module for n>1). However we have the following result: the homomorphic image of a flat module M is flat if and only if the kernel is a pure submodule of M.|$|R

25|$|Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. modules {{over the}} {{principal}} ideal domain Z) {{can often be}} generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of finitely generated abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a <b>direct</b> <b>sum</b> of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a <b>direct</b> <b>sum</b> of finitely many groups of the form Z/pkZ for p prime, and {{the latter is a}} <b>direct</b> <b>sum</b> of finitely many copies of Z.|$|E

40|$|In [5] and [6], we have {{introduced}} {{a couple of}} relative generalized epi-projectivities and given several properties of these projectivities.

Then we define a mono-ojectivity that {{plays an important role in}} the study of <b>direct</b> <b>sums</b> of extending modules. The structure of (mono-) ojectivity is complicated and hence it is difficult to determine whether these injectivities are inherited by finite <b>direct</b> <b>sums</b> and <b>direct</b> summands even in the case where each module is quasi-continuous.
