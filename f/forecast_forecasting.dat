BBQ takes pre-planning approach to forecast incoming traffic based on historic statistics and allocates link resources accordingly. Traffic forecast may not be perfectly accurate due to traffic fluctuation and imperfect <b>forecast.</b> <b>Forecasting</b> errors may lead to poor resource allocation.

40|$|To {{address the}} {{question}} of whether the sex differential in mortality will in the future rise, fall, or stay the same, this study uses the relative smoking prevalence among males and females to forecast future changes in relative smoking-attributed mortality. Data on 21 high income nations from 1975 to 2000 and a lag between smoking prevalence and mortality allow forecasts up to 2020. Averaged across nations, the results reveal narrowing of measures of the sex differential in smoking mortality. However, continued widening of the differential in non-smoking mortality would counter narrowing due to smoking and lead to future increases in the female advantage overall, particularly in nations at late stages of the cigarette epidemic (such as the United States and the United Kingdom) where narrowing of the smoking differential has already begun to slow. <b>forecast,</b> <b>forecasting,</b> mortality, sex differences, smoking...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{comparative}} study of the forecasting properties of the about 30 alternative leading indicators for Germany using the growth rates of German real GDP. In addition to them, we have constructed a diffusion index based on the principal component analysis and including 145 component series that reflect all the facets of German economy. We use the post-unification data which cover years from 1991 through 2004. Using a battery of statistical tests we detect a structural break in the growth rates that occurs {{in the first half}} of 2001. Our results suggest that the forecasting ability of the leading indicators has been rather good in the pre-break period with our diffusion index showing the superior forecasting accuracy but the forecasting performance of all alternative indicators has significantly deteriorated in the post-break period, i. e. in 2001 - 2004. None of the leading indicator models was able to predict and accommodate the structural break in the growth rates of the time series under scrutiny. This finding confirms the widespread impression among the practitioners that the state of German economy in the recent years became much more difficult to <b>forecast.</b> <b>Forecasting</b> real GDP, diffusion index, leading indicators, PcGets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of some issues related to market aluation, focusing on the developments on the New York equity markets. The 42. 4 p. c. fall in the S&P 500 price index between 24 March 2000 - when it reached its all-time high - and 31 December 2002 is situated {{in a very long}} term perspective. It then appears that some bear markets were more pronounced in the past but that the bull market preceding the 2000 - 2002 bear market had been particularly long and impressive in extent. Given this sharp correction, we will discuss whether the S&P 500 was correctly valued at the end of 2002. To this e d, we make use of valuation indicators defined as the ratio of the price to a fundamental. The fundamentals considered here are, according to the discount dividend model, annual earnings and, according to Q-theory, net worth. In December 2002, price-earnings (P/E) still showed a significant overvaluation of equity prices when compared to the historical average over the 1871 - 2002 period but, since July 2002, the overvaluation has not been significant in the case of Q. The evidence is even more mixed when the comparison is made, for each valuation indicator, with their average over the last 10 years. Simulations based on VAR models for P/E and Q were carried out to check whether, on two occasions, the S&P 500 in real terms climbed to a level perceived as irrational given past experience, implying that a correction had to be expected. These occasions were the so-called 1929 and 2000 bubbles. The models showed that, {{at some point in time}} before the peak in (real) stock prices was reached, the real S&P 500 exceeded the upper band of the 95 p. c. confidence intervals during both periods. For each of them, the Q model showed earlier and more persistent signals of significant overvaluation of stock prices than for the P/E model. Finally, in December 2002, both models indicated that the stock price had come back largely within the confidence interval. financial markets, stock prices, stock market, usa, united states, econometrics, time-series models, <b>forecast,</b> <b>forecasting...</b>|$|E
