500|$|Chatham's Post, a {{position}} {{named after a}} Light Horse officer, was Sing's first sniping post. Biographer Brian Tate wrote, [...] "It was here that Billy Sing began in earnest his lethal occupation." [...] He set about his task with a Lee–Enfield [...]303 rifle. An account by Private Frank Reed, a fellow Australian soldier, states that Sing {{was so close to}} the Turkish lines that enemy artillery rarely troubled him. His comrades left three particular enemy positions to his attention: a trench at 350 yards (320 m) from his post, a communication sap at 500 yards (457 m), and a track in a gully at 1,000 yards (914 m). According to Reed, [...] "Every time Billy Sing felt sorry for the poor Turks, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> their snipers picked off the Australian officers {{in the early days of}} the landing, and he hardened his heart. But he never fired at a stretcher-bearer or any of the soldiers who were trying to rescue wounded Turks." [...] In contrast, Hamilton said in a 2008 interview, [...] "We have an anecdote where, after spotting an injured Turk, he said 'I'll put that poor cuss out of his agony' and just shot him. He was a very tough man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sagan {{recalls that}} one of his most {{defining}} moments was when his parents took him to the 1939 New York World's Fair when he was four years old. The exhibits became a turning point in his life. He later recalled the moving map of the America of Tomorrow exhibit: [...] "It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses—and it looked great!" [...] At other exhibits, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> a flashlight that shone on a photoelectric cell created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope. He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television. Sagan wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and {{the rest}} of Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi {{convinced}} he would be executed when he arrived. At the border, there were two lines of soldiers, one Soviet and the other Chinese, and as Puyi walked past, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> the faces of the other prisoners were [...] "deathly pale". Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this {{was the beginning of a}} new life for him. In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life used ni (你), the informal word for you instead of nin (您), the formal word for you to address people. When the train stopped at Changchun to pick up food, Puyi was convinced that was he was going to be shot at his former capital, and he was much relieved when the train resumed its journey to Fushun. Except for a period during the Korean War, when he was moved to Harbin, Puyi spent ten years in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre in Liaoning province until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers. Puyi was the weakest and most hapless of the prisoners, and was often bullied by the other prisoners, who liked to humiliate an emperor, and he might not have survived his imprisonment except for the fact that the warden Jin Yuan went out of his way to protect him. Jin had grown up under Manchukuo and as a schoolboy in the 1930s had kowtowed to portraits of Puyi and waved the Manchukuo flag in the streets when Puyi made visits to Harbin. As Jin had grown up in Manchukuo, he was fluent in Japanese, which was why he was selected to be the warden of Fushun. Jin was assigned the job in 1950 and told Behr in a 1986 interview that: [...] "I didn't welcome the idea at all. I tried to get another posting. I wanted nothing to do with those who had been responsible for my older brother's death and my family's suffering during the Manchukuo years. I wondered how I could ever bear to be in their company". However, Jin further told Behr that he [...] "came to like Puyi quite a bit" [...] as he got to know him, and protected him from the other prisoners. In 1951, Puyi learned for the first time that Wanrong had died in 1946.|$|E
