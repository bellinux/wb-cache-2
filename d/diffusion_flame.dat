40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a {{research}} program considering interactions between flow and soot properties within laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> Laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> were considered because they provide model flame systems that are far more tractable for theoretical and experimental studies than more practical turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> In particular, understanding the transport and chemical reaction processes of laminar flames is a necessary precursor to understanding these processes in practical turbulent flames and many aspects of laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> have direct relevance to turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> through application of the widely recognized laminar flamelet concept of turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> The investigation was divided into three phases, considering the shapes of nonbuoyant round laminar jet <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> in still air, the shapes of nonbuoyant round laminar jet <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> in coflowing air, and the hydrodynamic suppression of soot formation in laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> can be laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and {{turbulent}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the flame shapes of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> and oxygen-deficient. Flame shapes also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the flame shapes. With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> tends to become turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> and in laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> are almost similar.|$|R

50|$|Combustion of {{gaseous fuels}} may occur {{through one of}} four {{distinctive}} types of burning: <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame,</b> premixed flame, autoignitive reaction front, or as a detonation. The type of burning that actually occurs depends on {{the degree to which}} the fuel and oxidizer are mixed prior to heating: for example, a <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame</b> is formed if the fuel and oxidizer are separated initially, whereas a premixed flame is formed otherwise. Similarly, the type of burning also depends on the pressure: a detonation, for example, is an autoignitive reaction front coupled to a strong shock wave giving it its characteristic high-pressure peak and high detonation velocity.|$|E

Flame height predictions using Roper’s analysis for circular port burners agreed with measured reaction zone heights when using values for the characteristic diffusion coefficient and/or diffusion temperature somewhat different from those recommended by Roper.

50|$|In combustion, a <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame</b> is a flame {{in which}} the {{oxidizer}} combines with the fuel by diffusion. As a result, the flame speed {{is limited by the}} rate of diffusion.

The soot typically produced in a <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame</b> becomes incandescent from the heat of the flame and lends the flame its readily identifiable orange-yellow color.

50|$|The flamelet concept {{considers}} the turbulent flame as an aggregate of thin, laminar(Re<2000), locally one-dimensional flamelet structures present within the turbulent flow field. Counterflow <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame</b> {{is a common}} laminar flame {{which is used to}} represent a flamelet in a turbulent flow. Its geometry consists of opposed and axi-symmetric fuel and oxidizer jets. As the distance between the jets is decreased and/or the velocity of the jets is increased, the flame is strained and departs from its chemical equilibrium until it eventually extinguishes. The mass fraction of species and temperature fields can be measured or calculated in laminar counterflow <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame</b> experiments. When calculated, a self-similar solution exists, and the governing equations can be simplified to only one dimension i.e. along the axis of the fuel and oxidizer jets. It is in this direction where complex chemistry calculations can be performed afford-ably.|$|E
40|$|The present {{experimental}} study of soot processes in hydrocarbon-fueled laminar nonbuoyant and nonpremixed (<b>diffusion)</b> <b>flames</b> at microgravity within a spacecraft was motivated by the relevance of soot {{to the performance of}} power and propulsion systems, to the hazards of unwanted fires, and to the emission of combustion-generated pollutants. Soot processes in turbulent flames are of greatest practical interest, however, direct study of turbulent flames is not tractable because the unsteadiness and distortion of turbulent flames limit available residence times and spatial resolution within regions where soot processes are important. Thus, laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> are generally used to provide more tractable model flame systems to study processes relevant to turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames,</b> justified by the known similarities of gas-phase processes in laminar and turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames,</b> based on the widely-accepted laminar flamelet concept of turbulent <b>flames.</b> Unfortunately, laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> at normal gravity are affected by buoyancy due to their relatively small flow velocities and, as discussed next, {{they do not have the}} same utility for simulating the soot processes as they do for simulating the gas phase processes of turbulent flames...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the steady and {{unsteady}} flamelet {{models have been}} applied to soot formation in laminar and turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> The aim was to study how different model parameters affect soot formation in <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> It was shown that certain assumptions are more crucial in laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> than in turbulent ones. The soot formation in turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> is {{more sensitive to the}} surface dependence of the particle and altering the active site parameter, than in laminar flames. This {{is due to the fact}} that the flame is laminar and the turbulent mixing, which supplies the particle with radicals, does not affect the process. The active site parameter decreases in the absence of radicals. The modelling of complex diffusivity of all species is more relevant in laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> than in turbulent <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames.</b> All transient effects investigated in this work were shown to affect soot formation, which is itself transient. It was shown that these effects are more relevant for laminar fames than for turbulent flames. The steady flamelet model allows the inclusion of many transient processes and thereby loses in accuracy compared with the unsteady model. Finally, the process of the formation of agglomerates was included in the unsteady model and it was shown that the soot volume fraction is affected when this process is considered...|$|R

The results show that the flame structure in microgravity is significantly different from that under normal gravity conditions, and more importantly, that conditions for flame stability are less stringent under microgravity. Experiments show that flames that cannot be stabilized under normal gravity are quite stable under microgravity conditions.

40|$|The {{structure}} and state relationships of laminar soot-free (permanently-blue) <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> at various strain rates were studied experimentally using an opposed-jet configuration, {{motivated by the}} importance of soot-free hydrocarbon-fueled <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> for many practical applications. Measurements of gas velocities, temperatures and compositions were carried out along the stagnation stream line. Flame conditions studied included propylene- and 1, 3 -butadiene-fueled opposed-jet <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> having a stoichiometric mixture fractions of 0. 7 and strain rates of 60 - 240 /s at normal temperature and pressure. It was found that oxygen leakage to fuel-rich conditions and carbon monoxide leakage to fuel-lean conditions both increased as strain rates increased. Furthermore, increased strain rates caused increased fuel concentrations near the flame sheet decreased peak gas temperatures, and decreased concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} water vapor throughout the flames. State relationships for major gas species and gas temperatures for these flames were found to exist over broad ranges of strain rates. In addition, current measurements, as well as previous measurements and predictions of ethylene-fueled permanently-blue <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames,</b> all having a stoichiometric mixture fraction of 0. 7, were combined to establish generalized state relationships for permanently-blue <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> for this stoichiometric mixture fraction. The combined measurements and predictions support relatively universal generalized state relationships for N 2, CO 2, H 2 O and fuel over a broad range of strain rates and fuel types. State relationships for O 2 in the fuel-rich region, and for CO in the fuel-lean region, however, are functions of strain rate and fuel type. State relationships for H 2 and temperature exhibit less universality, mainly due to the increased experimental uncertainties for these variables. The existence of state relationships for soot-free hydrocarbon-fueled <b>diffusion</b> <b>flames</b> provides potential for significant computational simplifications for modeling purposes in many instances, allowing for effects of finite-rate chemistry while avoiding time-consuming computations of Arrhenius expressions...|$|R
50|$|This model approximates the {{turbulent}} flame {{as a series}} of laminar flamelet regions concentrated just around the stoichiometric surfaces of the reacting mixture. This model exploits the use of experimental data for determining relations between the variables considered like mass fraction, temperature etc. The nature and type of dependence of the variables is predicted through experimental data obtained during laminar <b>diffusion</b> <b>flame</b> experiment and laminar flamelet relationship is deduced based on the same. These relationships are then used to solve the transport equations for species mass fraction and mixture composition. The model can very well be implemented for situations where concentration of minor species in the combustion is to be computed like quantifying the generation of pollutants. A simple enhancement to the model results in the flamelet time scale model which takes finite rate kinetics effect into consideration. The flamelet time scale model produces steady laminar flamelet solution when reaction proceeds very fast and captures the finite rate effects when reaction chemistry is dominant.|$|E
