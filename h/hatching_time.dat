5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short <b>hatching</b> <b>time</b> after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E

25|$|The {{green sea}} turtles exhibit sex {{differences}} by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females {{by having a}} larger tail and longer claws on the front flippers. The <b>hatching</b> <b>time</b> and sex of the turtles {{are determined by the}} incubation temperature of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex-determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a global}} data set on egg <b>hatch</b> <b>times</b> in zooplanktonic and nektonic ectotherms from marine waters, the {{combined}} effects of body size, temperature and life-history attributes on development times were examined. After correcting for mass and temperature the mean egg <b>hatch</b> <b>times</b> (from laying to <b>hatching)</b> were 20 <b>times</b> faster in some taxa than in others. Some of the divergence in <b>hatch</b> <b>times</b> can {{be accounted for}} by the disposition strategy of the eggs. Eggs that are protected after laying (e. g. carried by the female, or attached to a substrate or floating in clumped masses) take 3. 3 times longer on average to develop to hatching than those spawned individually and freely into the pelagic environment (i. e. ‘unprotected’), and this difference is independent of egg size. Given that unprotected eggs typically have higher mortality rates, it is proposed that evolution has acted to shorten this vulnerable period. Not only do <b>hatch</b> <b>times</b> appear to diverge on the basis of egg protection strategy, but also a similar degree of separation was apparent in cell cycle duration (i. e. time from 2 to 4 cell stage). These results reinforce the importance of egg disposition on development rate processes and their evolution...|$|R

2500|$|Rhea eggs measure about [...] {{and weigh}} [...] on average; they are thus {{less than half}} the size of an ostrich egg. Their shell is greenish-yellow when fresh but soon fades to dull cream when exposed to light. The nest is a simple shallow and wide scrape in a hidden location; males will drag sticks, grass, and leaves in the area {{surrounding}} the nest so it resembles a firebreak as wide as their neck can reach. The incubation period is 29–43 days. All the eggs hatch within 36 hours of each other even though the eggs in one nest were laid perhaps as much as two weeks apart. As it seems, when the first young are ready to hatch they start a call resembling a pop-bottle rocket or even fireworks, even while still inside the egg, thus the <b>hatching</b> <b>time</b> is coordinated. Greater rheas are half-grown about three months after hatching, and sexually mature by their 14th month.|$|E

Incubation temperatures of [...] or lower produce a clutch of females; those of [...] or higher produce entirely males.

Adult alligators regularly cannibalize younger individuals, though estimates of the rate of cannibalism vary widely.

40|$|The {{zootechnical}} {{performances of}} broilers {{at the end}} of the rearing period depend in part on the quality of day-old chicks at placement. The quality of day-old chicks is highly affected by the incubation conditions, by <b>hatch</b> <b>time</b> (which determines the time spent in the hatcher under high temperature and humidity), and by the handling of chicks after hatch. This article first presents an overview of the most relevant pre-incubation factors that affect chick quality: egg size, egg weight, quality of eggs, sex of embryos, age of breeders, and conditions and duration of egg storage. It then reviews the most important incubation factors that affect <b>hatch</b> <b>time,</b> hatchability and <b>hatch</b> window (temperature, humidity, turning, ventilation and concentration of gases). Finally, the effect of early post-hatch handling (including processing and especially transportation of chicks) as a possible source of stress influencing the quality of chicks at placement is discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has reported that}} incubation duration and <b>hatch</b> <b>time</b> are affected by pre-incubation and incubation conditions and by the sex of embryos. {{the aim of this}} experiment was: (1) to correlate embryo sex, egg weight and chick weight with hatch time; and (2) to study the effect of <b>hatch</b> <b>time</b> on the post-hatch body weight and pododermatitis up to slaughter age. A total of 19, 200 eggs from same ROSS 308 breeder flock (aged 40 weeks) were incubated in two standard incubators (Petersime n. v.) with a capacity of 9600 eggs each. Twenty eggs (focal eggs) were randomly selected per incubator. At transfer (Day 18 of incubation), focal eggs were separated by mesh dividers. The <b>hatch</b> <b>time</b> of the focal chicks was labelled using video records taken by two analogue cameras placed 30 cm above the baskets. Of 40 focal eggs, 36 hatched and these focal chicks were marked with a non-toxic coloured spray. At takeoff, each focal chick was weighed and sexed by a feather sexing expert. Focal chicks were divided into 4 pens (9 focal chicks per pen: 2 of males and 2 of females) with other chicks. The total number of chicks per pen was 241 males and 272 females {{in order to have a}} final density of 39 kg/m² at slaughter age. During the rearing period, the focal chicks were individually weighed at Day 21 and Day 28.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has reported that}} chicken embryos develop auditory functioning during incubation and that prenatal sound may {{play an important role}} in embryo development and alter the <b>hatch</b> <b>time.</b> to quantify the impact of sound on the development of embryo and organs and hatch window, we stimulated the incubation environment by exposing chick embryos to patterned species-specific sound by means of a speaker at 72 dB for 16 hours a day: maternal calls and embryo/chick calls from day 10 to day 19 and day 19 until hatching, respectively. the embryos exhibited a similar growth pattern between the sound-stimulated and control groups. the onset of hatch (internal piping) was delayed and the hatch window was narrowed by 1. 5 hours in the species-specific sound stimulated group. However, the sound-stimulated embryos had a lower hatchability than the control group. The results of this study indicate that maternal calls can delay <b>hatch</b> <b>time.</b> However, we are concerned an increase in late embryonic death in sound stimulated group, probably due to the induced stress which may be caused by sound exposure during incubation.
