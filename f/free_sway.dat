"The spires {{will point}} to the heaven, the unmuffled church bells will speak of God, as before; the ‘free Bible’ will have <b>free</b> <b>sway,</b> but in a free State, in free churches or {{religious}} schools, by theside of free secular schools. And I hope my friend will not regard it as a calamity if {{the son of a}} Presbyterian or Methodist, after his intercourse with the child of a Jew, Catholic, or unbeliever, should turn to the Scriptures with the feeling that the truth is broader than the leaves of any book…"(Brumberg,2003) ...|$|E
60|$|Nor deem {{he lived}} unto himself alone; His was the public spirit of his sire, And in those eyes, soft with {{domestic}} fire, A quenchless light of fiercer temper shone What time about, the world our shame was blown On every wind; his soul would not conspire With selfish men to soothe the mob's desire, Veiling with garlands Moloch's bloody stone; The high-bred instincts {{of a better}} day Ruled in his blood, when to be citizen Rang Roman yet, and a <b>Free</b> People's <b>sway</b> Was not the exchequer of impoverished men, Nor statesmanship with loaded votes to play, Nor public office a tramps' boosing-ken.|$|R
5000|$|Some time {{prior to}} 1150 Hugh de Witteville gave [...] "his whole land of Sway with its {{men and one}} mill" [...] to Quarr Abbey, and about the same date Ralph Fulcher donated land at Sway to the same abbey. In the 13th century Christchurch Priory also gained land in Sway, which {{increased}} in the 14th century by the grant of land in Sway from John, vicar of Christchurch. <b>Free</b> warren in <b>Sway</b> was granted to the priory in 1384. Romsey Abbey also held land in Sway, afterwards known as the manor of Sway Romsey or South Sway. The Abbess of Romsey was holding land in Sway together with the Abbot of Quarr and the Prior of Christchurch in 1316.|$|R
50|$|A Dawkins dunk and two Archibald <b>free</b> throws further <b>swayed</b> the lead. A Hollins miss gave Boston {{a chance}} to build the lead, but Parish left after being called for an {{offensive}} foul, his sixth. That brought in rookie Kevin McHale to guard Dawkins. The Sixers went right at him, but he played good defense and forced Dawkins to miss. Bird hit an 18-footer to give Boston a 98-95 lead with 1 minute left. Toney answered by hitting a 20-footer with 54 seconds and stealing the ball from Bird with 29 seconds left and the Sixers down 1. He went for the lead, but McHale blocked it and got the ball with 14 seconds left. He passed the ball ahead to Archibald and Boston played keep away. The Sixers didn't foul until 2 seconds left. Maxwell made both foul shots to give Boston a 100-97 lead. After a timeout, the Sixers inbounded at midcourt.|$|R
60|$|The {{consequence}} of this victory was, that Caesar's authority was established triumphantly over all that part of Gaul which he had thus <b>freed</b> from Ariovistus's <b>sway.</b> Other parts of the country, too, were pervaded by the fame of his exploits, and the people every where began to consider what action it would be incumbent on them to take, in respect to the new military power which had appeared so suddenly among them. Some nations determined to submit without resistance, and to seek the conqueror's alliance and protection. Others, more bold, or more confident of their strength, began to form combinations and to arrange plans for resisting him. But, whatever they did, the result in the end was the same. Caesar's ascendency was every where and always gaining ground. Of course, it is impossible in the compass of a single chapter, which is all that can be devoted to the subject in this volume, to give any regular narrative {{of the events of}} the eight years of Caesar's military career in Gaul. Marches, negotiations, battles, and victories mingled with and followed each other in a long succession, the particulars of which it would require a volume to detail, every thing resulting most successfully for the increase of Caesar's power and the extension of his fame.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} ship’s {{parametric}} roll. In particular, {{a series of}} controlled experiments have been performed {{in order to obtain}} repeatable results both for the inception and the roll amplitude in parametric roll condition for tumblehome geometry. The tests have been carried out in the INSEAN basin n. 2, that is 220 m long, 9 m wide and 3. 5 m deep and equipped with a flap-type wave maker at the basin end. The model was tested in regular head waves in 3 DoF condition, being roll, pitch and heave motions <b>free</b> and surge, <b>sway</b> and yaw restrained. For the restrained motions, forces and moment were measured, in order to complete the dataset. Tests were carried out for three different metacentric heights in a range of speeds. Parametric roll excitation has been observed for different metacentric heights, wave steepness and Froude number with high repeatability. This allows us to promote the collected dataset as a reliable benchmark for both CFD codes and theoretical models. The experimental work, which is the subject of the present paper, is part of cooperative research project between the IIHR (Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research), the University of Trieste and the Italian ship model basin (INSEAN) [1, 2], while the validation of the CFD (U-RANS) and theoretical models results will be the subject of a future work, which is at present in preparation and involves other international collaborations beyond the ones listed here...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on ship’s {{parametric}} roll. In particular, a series of controlled experiments have been performed {{in order to obtain}} repeatable results both for the inception and the roll amplitude in parametric roll condition. The experiments have been performed for an innovative ship design (a tumblehome shape) in a towing tank provided by a flap-type wave maker. The model was tested in 3 DoF conditions, being roll, pitch and heave motions <b>free</b> and surge, <b>sway</b> and yaw restrained. The experimental work, which is the subject of the present paper, is part of cooperative research project between the IIHR (Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research), the University of Trieste and the Italian ship model basin (INSEAN) (1, 2). All the experiments have been carried out in head waves at the INSEAN basin n. 2. The model motions were measured both by an optical motion tracker (Krypton) and a gyroscopic platform (MOTAN). Tests were carried out for three different metacentric heights in a range of speeds. Roll decay tests as a function of forward speed were before every experiment in waves {{in order to determine the}} natural roll frequency and the roll decay rate. The head waves experiments showed parametric roll excitation for different metacentric heights, wave steepness and Froude number. The repeatability of the obtained results, allows to use them as a benchmark for both CFD codes and theoretical models. This will be the subject of a future work, which is at present in preparation and involves other international collaborations beyond the ones listed here...|$|R
