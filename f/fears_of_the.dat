5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} {{in order to pay}} off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E

5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E

Communities including Lynchburg, San Jacinto, and Campbell's Bayou (founded by one of Lafitte's former officers) were gradually established around the bay. In addition to the Anglo-American and Mexican settlers in the area, a Cajun settlement was established along Armand Bayou. The Mexican Colonization Law of 1824, however, forbade the creation of settlements near the coast with the intention of protecting the native tribes in the area. The law was not enforced and settlers continued to encroach upon tribal lands. Native tribes remained in the area years afterward but were gradually driven out as European settlers moved into the region. The Akokisa were driven inland where they merged with the Bidai. The Karankwa were driven southward where they eventually established their current homelands in northeastern Mexico.|$|E

The study begins with a discussion regarding <b>the</b> shortcomings <b>of</b> studies done on “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” in both Old Testament theology and the Pentateuch research. These studies are often dated or deal insufficiently with the problem. The place and function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” in the Pentateuch has not yet been determined. In chapter two a discussion follows on “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” in relation to education and <b>the</b> retelling <b>of</b> “history”. <b>The</b> concept “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” is compared with historical developments in biblical interpretation. This section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study comes to the conclusion that “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” emphasises the meaning the Scripture has for the reader and does not necessarily present an objective/rational reading thereof. Chapter three discusses the developments in semantics. The different words that can be translated with “fear” are discussed according to their semantic domains. This chapter also discusses <b>the</b> possible development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” within the Old Testament. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods in Middle Eastern texts is also considered. Chapter four is a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pentateuch. <b>The</b> history <b>of</b> its research is discussed and conclusions are drawn with regard to the different sources in the Pentateuch. This chapter comes to the conclusion that “ <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” is present in the Elohist, J material, Deuteronomist source as well as the Holiness code, but is absent from the Priestly material. Chapter five is an exegetical study of texts that contain references to fear directed towards God. Words translated with “fear” are discussed according to their semantic domains. The exegetical study also involves a study of other terms or subjects in the Pentateuch which are used in close relation to “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord”. The study concludes that research based on <b>the</b> concept “the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord” and its function in the Pentateuch in its final form as well as its different sources, does indeed lead to a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pentateuch in different times and contexts.
