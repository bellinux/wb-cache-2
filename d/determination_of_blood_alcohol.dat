40|$|The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) {{test was}} conceived, {{developed}} and promulgated {{as a simple}} procedure for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration <b>of</b> drivers suspected of driving while intoxicated (DWI). Bypassing the usual scientific review process and touted through the good offices of the federal agency responsible for traffic safety, it was rushed into use as a law enforcement procedure, and was soon adopted and protected from scientific criticism by courts throughout the United States. In fact, research findings, training manuals and other relevant documents were often held as secrets by the state. Still, the protective certification of its practitioners and the immunity afforded by judicial notice failed to silence all the critics of this deeply flawed procedure.

40|$|Analysis <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{concentration}} is a routine analysis performed in many forensic laboratories. This analysis commonly utilizes static headspace sampling, followed by gas chromatography combined with {{flame ionization detection}} (GC-FID). Studies have shown several “optimal” methods for instrumental operating conditions, which are intended to yield accurate and precise data. Given that different instruments, sampling methods, application specific columns and parameters are often utilized, it is much less common to find information on the robustness of these reported conditions. A major problem can arise when these “optimal” conditions may not also be robust, thus producing data with higher than desired uncertainty or potentially inaccurate results. The goal {{of this research was}} to incorporate the principles of quality by design (QBD) in the adjustment and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> BAC (<b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration) instrumental headspace parameters, thereby ensuring that minor instrumental variations, which occur as a matter of normal work, do not appreciably affect the final results of this analysis. This study discusses both the QBD principles as well as the results of the experiments, which allow for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> more favorable instrumental headspace conditions. Additionally, method detection limits will also be reported in order to determine a reporting threshold and the degree of uncertainty at the common threshold value of 0. 08 g/dL. Furthermore, the comparison of two internal standards, n-propanol and t-butanol, will be investigated. The study showed that an altered parameter of 85 °C headspace oven temperature and 15 psi headspace vial pressurization produces the lowest percent relative standard deviation of 1. 3 % when t-butanol is implemented as an internal standard, at least for one very common platform. The study also showed that an altered parameter of 100 °C headspace oven temperature and 15 -psi headspace vial pressurization produces the lowest MDL of 0. 00002 g/dL when n-propanol is implemented as an internal standard. These altered headspace parameters have the potential to produce more precise and accurate BAC determination...|$|R

40|$|<b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{concentration}} (BAC) on ante mortem {{and post}} mortem samples is often performed in forensic laboratory. BAC determination has been common task in forensic laboratory due to rising accident cases due to driving {{under influence of}} alcohol. Earlier researchers have proven that factors such as preservative, storage temperature and storage period affect the blood alcohol stability and BAC determination. Apparently, no regulation governs these factors in BAC determination. Therefore, this study is performed to address the effect of preservative, temperature and storage days on BAC level. A blood specimen of ante and post mortem samples with preservative and non preservative in two different conditions (chilled temperature, 4 - 7 oC and room temperature, 24 - 26. 9 oC) has been examined. The analysis was carried out on 1 st day, 7 th day and 14 th day of blood sample received. The blood samples have been diluted with an aqueous internal standard solution of n-propanol and analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The analysis showed that the temperature and preservative {{have no effect on}} BAC of ante mortem and post mortem blood samples and blood alcohol analysis can be performed within 21 days...|$|E
40|$|A novel breath-alcohol {{analyzer}} {{based on}} the standardization of the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) to the alveolar-air water vapour concentration has been developed and evaluated. The present study compares results with this particular breath analyzer with arterial blood alcohol concentrations (ABAC), the most relevant quantitative measure of brain alcohol exposure. The precision of analysis of alcohol in arterial blood and breath were determined {{as well as the}} agreement between ABAC and BrAC over time post-dosing. Twelve healthy volunteers were administered 0. 6 galcohol/kg bodyweight via an orogastric tube. Duplicate breath and arterial blood samples were obtained simultaneously during the absorption, distribution and elimination phases of the alcohol metabolism with particular emphasis on the absorption phase. The precision of the breath analyzer was similar to the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration by headspace gas chromatography (CV 2. 40 vs. 2. 38 %, p= 0. 43). The ABAC/BrAC ratio stabilized 30 min post-dosing (2089 ± 99; mean±SD). Before this the BrAC tended to underestimate the coexisting ABAC. In conclusion, breath alcohol analysis utilizing standardization of alcohol to water vapour was as precise as blood alcohol analysis, the present "gold standard" method. The BrAC reliably predicted the coexisting ABAC from 30 min onwards after the intake of alcohol...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{there is}} a {{considerable}} amount of data in the literature regarding the association between alcohol consumption and injuries treated in emergency rooms, {{little is known about the}} relationship between such injury and the use of other substances. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance use in patients admitted to the emergency room for non-fatal injuries. METHOD: A prospective cross-sectional study assessing all patients admitted to the emergency room within 6 hours after a non-fatal injury was conducted over a three-month period. The following were used as measures of alcohol and drug use: a standardized World Health Organization questionnaire; a self-administered questionnaire related to drug consumption within the 24 hours preceding contact; the Drug Abuse Screening Test; urine screens for cannabis, cocaine and benzodiazepines; and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration. Descriptive analyses were performed and the confidence interval used was 95 %. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients were included. Cannabis and cocaine screens were conducted for 242 patients and benzodiazepine screens were conducted for 166. Blood alcohol concentrations reached the level of positivity in 11 % (n = 39), and 10 % (n = 33) presented some degree of intoxication. Among the 242 patients screened, 13. 6 % (n = 33) tested positive for cannabis, and 3. 3 % (n = 8) tested positive for cocaine, whereas 4. 2 % (n = 7) of the 166 patients screened tested positive for benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS: Substance use was highly prevalent among these individuals. In this sample, the frequency for the use of cannabis (an illicit drug) was comparable to that of alcohol. More studies are needed in order to characterize such use among Brazilians and to develop proper approaches to such cases, with the aim of reducing substance use and its consequences...|$|E
