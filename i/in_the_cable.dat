5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin cabled British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{to request}} that the 9th Division be {{returned}} to Australia. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage {{and the demands of}} the war in the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request {{on the grounds that the}} 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.|$|E
