According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E
5|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes asymptotic freedom: as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as color confinement: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of hadronization occurs before quarks, formed in a high energy collision, are able to interact in any other way. The only exception is the top quark, which may decay before it hadronizes.|$|E

This paper presents {{the efficacy of the}} closure of large surgical wounds using rubber <b>elastic</b> <b>bands.</b> One or two circular rubber <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> were sutured under mean tension at the opposite edges of 22 large wounds located in different body sites. These rubber strips were replaced when they were broken or re-fixed when they have lost their tension until the complete closure of the wounds. Complete closure was achieved without any other surgical procedure or device in 21 wounds and one wound reduced its dimensions. No major complication due to this treatment was verified. The synthesis of large wounds with rubber <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> kept under mean tension is a simple, efficacious and inexpensive surgical option that may be useful for treatment in several circumstances.

25|$|A demi-pointe shoe, {{which is}} also {{variously}} called a break-down, pre-pointe, or a soft-block shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe {{and it has a}} toe box, although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the toe box) are typically not as deep as those found on pointe shoes. Demi-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.|$|E
25|$|A pointe shoe employs two fabric {{ribbons and}} an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> to secure {{it to the}} foot. Most {{of the work of}} {{securing}} shoes to feet is done by the ribbons. The two ribbons wrap around the dancer's ankle in opposite directions, overlapping one another so as to form a cross at the front. The ends are then tied together in a knot, which is then tucked under the ribbon {{on the inside of the}} ankle to hide it from view. The elastic band—which traverses the front of the ankle below the ribbons—keeps the heel of the shoe in place against the foot when the dancer is en pointe.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} way {{of holding}} the violin is with {{the left side of}} the jaw resting on the chinrest of the violin, and supported by the left shoulder, often assisted by a shoulder rest (or a sponge and an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> for younger players who struggle with shoulder rests). The jaw and the shoulder must hold the violin firmly enough to allow it to remain stable when the left hand goes from a high position (a high pitched note far up on the fingerboard) to a low one (nearer to the pegbox). (In the Indian posture the stability of the violin is guaranteed by its scroll resting on the side of the foot).|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{technical}} note was to report {{significant differences in the}} tension forces of the different-sized Thera-band (R) <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> (Hygenic Corp.) determined by us versus the manufacturer. [Subjects] Two trained observers performed all measurements. [Methods] The tension force (kilogram-force units) of eight color-coded <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> (tan, yellow, red, green, blue, black, silver, and gold) with different resistance levels was measured at 10 different percentages of elongation (25 % to 250 % with 25 % increments) using an electronic elongation gauge tensiometer. [Results] There were significant differences in the tension force of the <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> of different colors when compared in pairs (excepting the tan/yellow pair) at 100 % and 200 % elongation, as determined via one-way analysis of variance. There were no differences in the slopes for the tan versus yellow and green versus blue bands, as determined via linear regression analysis and one-way analysis of variance. Comparison of the tension force values obtained in our study with the reference values of the manufacturer (the t-test applied to the slopes) showed significant differences for five colors (yellow, green, blue, silver, and gold). [Conclusion] Our results indicate that the tension force values for Thera-Band <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> provided by the manufacturer are overestimates...|$|R
25|$|The {{locations}} where {{the band and}} ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement {{can result in a}} poorly fitting shoe. Optimal placement depends on the physical attributes of the foot to which it will be mated, and consequently the ribbons and <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> cannot be attached during the shoe manufacturing process. After acquiring a new pair of pointe shoes, a dancer must determine the appropriate attachment locations for the ribbons and <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> and then sew them, or arrange for them to be sewn, onto the shoes.|$|R

The directors and corporations are listed arbitrarily to begin and the <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> placed as edges of the bipartite graph. Then a perusal of the elastics may suggest a re-ordering on {{one side or the other}} with the elastics slightly less tense. After some iteration this procedure reveals a cluster structure in the bipartite graph.|$|R

2500|$|The {{shortest}} path between two {{points in a}} curved space can be found by writing the equation {{for the length of}} a curve (a function f from an open interval of R to the manifold), and then minimizing this length using the calculus of variations. This has some minor technical problems, because there is an infinite dimensional space of different ways to parameterize the {{shortest path}}. It is simpler to demand not only that the [...] curve locally minimizes length but also that it is parameterized [...] "with constant velocity", meaning that [...] the distance from f(s) to f(t) along the geodesic is proportional to |s't|. Equivalently, a different quantity may be defined, termed the energy of the curve; minimizing the energy leads to the same equations for a geodesic (here [...] "constant velocity" [...] is a consequence of minimisation). Intuitively, one can understand this second formulation by noting that an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> stretched between two points will contract its length, and in so doing will minimize its energy. [...] The resulting shape of the band is a geodesic.|$|E
