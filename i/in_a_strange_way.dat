5|$|He {{was dressed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way.</b> A šajkača was {{pulled to the}} front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
25|$|Then there's the odd, of course, {{fact that}} he had a very long love affair with a woman who he owned, who he {{inherited}} from his father-in-law, who was his wife's half-sister, and produced several children by her, whose descendants have mainly been brought up on the white side of the color line. So <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way,</b> his own patrimony disproves his own belief that there couldn't be coexistence between black and white Americans.|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} {{to the character}} of Dexter. Entertainment Weeklys Josh Wolk called him [...] "the hippest-looking killer since American Psychos Patrick Bateman". The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman said [...] "What makes the series work so well is twofold. Hall is magnificent; it's another sterling performance from him. But instead of being pent up yet emotionally explosive, like his David Fisher on [...] "Six Feet Under," [...] he's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter. That makes him alluring, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way.</b> while Ryan found him to be [...] "among the more compelling characters on the small screen". Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality, but [...] "also a hero of sorts". InsidePulse.com reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that [...] "to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter’s noir-esque narration", although he finished the review by saying [...] "Dexter, despite [...] flaws is yet another reason why Sunday night {{is one of my favorite}} nights to watch TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty much writing as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>way</b> this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E

But the record was made with a sincerity and a true intention, no matter the results, and I thought it was like ruining it a bit because of the joke.. and that was too much!" ...|$|E

60|$|He {{looked at}} me for <b>a</b> little while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mightily <b>strange</b> <b>way,</b> and then {{suddenly}} burst into a great loud laugh. After that he lay still for a while, watching me, but presently he spoke again.|$|R

6000|$|He put {{his head}} {{on one side and}} tilted his brows, as if to say [...] "What are you to do?" [...] And the smile on his mouth was sad, fine, and charming.

60|$|The sleet fell {{all that}} day unceasingly, a thick mist came on early, {{and it never}} rose or {{lightened}} for a moment. Such roads I had never seen.

2500|$|The avant-garde {{music video}} for [...] "Take Me Out", {{directed}} by Jonas Odell, {{was inspired by}} Dadaism (especially Max Ernst's Une Semaine de Bonté), Busby Berkeley choreographies and Russian constructivist design. Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the 1930s-style promo for second single [...] "Take Me Out": [...] "It's kind of two dimensional <b>in</b> <b>a</b> three dimensional style if that makes any sense.
