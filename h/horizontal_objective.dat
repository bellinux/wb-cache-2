This is also the reason why the shot needs to be performed in a timely manner, usefully, and also quickly. The most commonly used kick in football is a inner-side instep kick, which is also the most accurate and the most used among the players (Cabri, De Prof, Dufour, & Clarys, 1998). Success in performing precise actions largely depends on the precision of locating targets in space, and therefore the role of our receptors is crucial for a successful precision (Szekeres, Santrač, Radosav, Toplak, Miljanić, 1994). The research problem was establishing the predictive impacts of morphological characteristics on the elevation accuracy of hitting the ball in young players. The subjects of the study were morphological characteristics and accuracy of the players. Aim of the paper was to determine the relation between morphological characteristics and precision of players aged 13 - 14 years from the Municipality of Loznica. Method: 50 players of the FK “Kabel” from Novi Sad, aged 13 - 14 years, were subjected to testing. Measurement of morphological characteristics was conducted. Specific (elevation) accuracy of hitting the ball towards the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>objective</b> was also tested. By using the statistical analysis firstly the basic descriptive statistics of variables were determine.

Results: Regression analysis showed that there was no statistically significant effect of the predictor system of morphological variables on the criterion variables tested: Precision of kicking the ball towards a horizontal target and Precision of kicking the ball towards a vertical target. The results pointed to the fact that some other characteristics and capabilities have greater influence on the manifestation of elevation precision of kicking the ball towards the horizontal and vertical target, in young players.

This paper presents a methodology for achieving such an alignment,which is based on four stages: Strategic Planning, Organization Structuring, Performance Control and Improvement Management. Strategic Planning is, in this context, the definition of two types of strategic objectives: the vertical ones, to meet the requirements of the company’s owners, and the horizontal ones, to satisfy customer or client needs. The Organization Structuring stage includes those agreements within the company that are established in order to achieve both the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>objectives.</b> The Performance Control stage detects errors in the alignment, using tools such as the Balanced Scorecard (vertical control) and the ABM-ABC (horizontal control).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper {{is to provide a}} {{quantitative}} and qualitative analy-sis of state aid policy and its role in ensuring economic development in the EU. Based on theoretical approaches and empirical evidence, it is assumed that an effi-cient state aid policy should support the macroeconomic stabilization and the eco-nomic development. Therefore an econometric model is proposed to evaluate and quantify the relation between the level of horizontal aid and the value of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity standard. According to the results of the analysis, important disparities can be identified in analyzing the correlation between the two indicators mentioned above, deficitary to several EU member states, suggesting the necessity of a better coordination in the economic policies. Thus, one of the most relevant conclusions is that while the gen-eral objective of reducing state aid level is mainly achieved since the early 1990 s, a redirection of state aid towards <b>horizontal</b> <b>objectives</b> can be observed beginning with 2000 and is still ongoing at present with important consequences for the general economic development of the EU member states. competition policy, state aid, horizontal aid, sectoral aid, economic growth and development...|$|R

Second, it investigates the question whether the winning policy is capable to achieve horizontal equity (i. e. the requirement that all agents who are in all relevant senses identical should be treated identically); it turns out that under endogenous fertility, any winning policy trivially satisfies horizontal equity, but if fertility is exogenous for some of (or all) the parents, horizontal equity is virtually impossible to satisfy.

For the purpose of this study, deductive, descriptive and criticalcognitive methods were applied in order to analyze the theoretical knowledge contained in the literature of the subject as well as in legal and normative acts. Empirical data were derived from studies, documents and reports of the DirectorateGeneral for Competition of the European Commission and the Offi ce of Competition and Consumer Protection. Based on the study, in the years 2004 – 2012 in the EU <b>horizontal</b> <b>objectives</b> mostly involved aid granted for the purposes of environmental protection (123 bln EUR, 24. 3 %). The total expenditure for environmental protection in the EU was strongly determined by decisions taken by Germany and Sweden. The most signifi - cant benefi ciaries who were granted such aid were entrepreneurs from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Austria and Spain. More than half of the decisions (54 %) issued by the European Commission were taken by fi ve countries: Italy, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain. Investments in renewable sources of energy were most often subsidized. Moreover, companies were granted aid in order to adjust to requirements stricter than the EU standards in the fi eld of environment. A smaller percentage of aid was allocated to fi nance environmental research and to improve energy effi ciency (cogeneration, including heating and cooling systems). Analysis of the structure of the preferred instruments indicates that 77 % of aid was granted as tax reductions and exemptions and the other 23 % in the form of direct subsidies.

A {{large number}} of movement structures and situations in a tennis game (technical and tactical variants) indicates {{that the success of}} players determined by the level and structure of a {{large number of}} motor abilities, knowledge and qualities, of which some can be measured and analyzed. The measurement of these abilities and traits allows better planning, programming and control of the training process and to improve the sports form. The aim of the research was directed to determining the differences in motor abilities, of different sexes. Methods: The sample of 51 subjects aged 7 years (± 6 months), of which 23 boys and 28 girls tennis school participants TC "Palic" from Palic, carried out the measurement of motor abilities. The sample tests consisted of 12 tests: backward polygon, polygon with skipping and swiping, bat quickness, shooting <b>horizontal</b> <b>objectives</b> handed, shooting in the frame, target stick, keeping the ball with his hand, refusing racquet balls, fans, precision small vertical specific objectives, specific precision large vertical target, the specific <b>objectives</b> of the <b>horizontal</b> accuracy. Differences in motor abilities tennis players of different sexes was determined by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results: On the basis of the research it can be concluded that there are no statistically significant differences between boys and girls in terms of treated motor abilities. Discussion: Tennis is characterized by a very large number of different techniques strokes and movements, which are mostly performed at maximum speed for a long time, and it is logical that the success in tennis affects a larger number of motor skills (Zmajić, 2003). Development of speed, agility and explosiveness is very important for success in a tennis game, because tennis game consists of a number of different explosive reaction to a variety of changes in the situation (McCarthy, 1998).

The analysis was done through the theoretical lens of Shepsle and Laver (1996) that a cabinet minister as the political head of a major government department have the formal discretion of any policy issues under his jurisdiction and uses his or her own power to influence the substance of any specific proposals that matters within his or her own jurisdiction. I empirically examined the restructuring of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company and the Green Fuel Project where the outcome of the projects required joint working between ministries controlled by different political parties. Green Fuel is a large scale ethanol producing factory constructed at a cost of US$ 600 million as a partnership between the Ministry of Agriculture and a private investor, but for the blended fuel to be consumed as an end product needed collaboration from the Ministry of Power and Energy Development to put out legislation enforcing mandatory blending. The Minister of Energy and Power Development ruled out mandatory blending of petrol and ethanol that left the US$ 600 million Green Fuels ethanol projector ground its operations and imperilled 5000 direct jobs the company had created arguing that the government does not make public policy for individuals and that the project was started without the consultation of the MDC. He also argued that the bio ethanol project affected communities in various ways including dispossession of their land, the slashing of their crops, killing of their cattle and the dispossession from their land. The restructuring of ZISCO entailed the partial sale of the government owned entity spearheaded by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It went through a bidding process and 54 % of shares were transferred from the state to EAHL and it was renamed New Zim Steel at a ceremony presided over by the head of state.

This paper examines the pursuit of an international manufacturing base by SPC Ardmona, one of Australia’s major fruit and vegetable processors, with a focus on strategic alliances formed with Siam Foods in Thailand and Rhodes Food Group in South Africa/Swaziland. Strategic horizontal alliances have become increasingly important for manufacturers seeking to counter retailer dominance, yet have received little attention in the agri-food literature.

In the second stage of the experiment, the cultivars BRS Safira, BRS 201 and BRS Verde were used to test the ruler. The analysis of regression between the leaf area measured in samples of leaves and the estimated areas showed a good adjustment with coefficient of determination equal to 0. 95. Comparing the means of both the methods, it was verified that the mean leaf area of the four cultivars of cotton, measured with the proposed ruler, did not differ statistically from the mean area measured with the planimeter. The ruler can be recommended to determine, directly in the field, the leaf area of cotton cultivars with cordiform and planofile leaf structure, in relation to the horizontal...|$|R
40|$|Soil and {{topographic}} {{properties are}} two important factors controlling soil water content (SWC) distribution in a <b>horizontal</b> dimension. The <b>objective</b> {{of this study}} was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to reveal the relative influence of soil and topographic properties on SWC distribution at the watershed scale. Experiments were conducted in two representative sites: St. Denis National Wildlife Area (SDNWA) in the Canadian prairie landscape with a humid continental climate, and LaoYeManQu (LYMQ) watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau with a cold semi-arid environment. Soil water contents were measured along a 576 m long transect at the SDNWA and over an area of 20 ha at the LYMQ. The influences of soil and topographic properties on SWC were determined at various soil layers and under various antecedent soil water conditions. Results showed that soil and topographic properties jointly controlled SWC distribution at the SDNWA, but soil properties contributed more to SWC variability than topographic properties. At the LYMQ only soil properties dominated SWC distribution. The influences of soil and topographic properties at the SDNWA were stronger under wetter conditions, whereas the influence of soil properties at the LYMQ presented slight differences between different antecedent soil water conditions. The influence of soil properties decreased and then increased with depth from 0 - 20 cm to 120 - 140 cm at the SDNWA, whereas the influence of topographic properties at the SDNWA and the influence of soil properties at the LYMQ decreased with depth. This study implied that SWC was a local and nonlocal control in the humid continental climate, whereas only a local control operated in the cold semi-arid environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|During three winter seasons (2009 - 2011), Pb {{concentrations}} were measured in precipitation at 10 high-elevation {{sites in the}} Czech Republic, close to the borders with Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. Soluble and insoluble Pb forms were quantified in snow (vertical deposition), and rime (<b>horizontal</b> deposition). The <b>objective</b> was to compare Pb input fluxes into ecosystems via vertical and horizontal deposition, and to identify the residual Pb polution sources {{in an era of}} rapidly decreasing industrial pollution. Lead soluble in diluted HNO 3 made up 96 % of total Pb deposition, with the remaining 4 % Pb bound mainly in silicates. Four times higher concentrations of soluble Pb in rime than in snow, and 1. 6 times higher concentrations of insoluble Pb in rime than in snow were associated with slightly different Pb isotope ratios. On average, the 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios in rime were higher than those in snow. Higher 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios of insoluble Pb than in insoluble Pb may indicate an increasing role of geogenic Pb in recent atmospheric deposition. A distinct reversal to more radiogenic 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios in snow and rime in 2010, compared to literature data from rain-fed Shagnum peatlands (1800 - 2000 A. D.), documented a recent decrease in anthropogenic Pb in the atmosphere of Central Europe. Since the early 1980 s, Pb concentrations in snow decreased 18 times in the rural south of the Czech Republic, but only twice in the industrial north of the Czech Republic. Isotope signatures indicated that Pb in today’s atmospheric deposition is mainly derived from Mesozoic ores mined/processed in southern Poland and coal combustion in the Czech Republic and Poland.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{studying}} integration synergies in a merger or acquisition situation with the interest in distribution channel integration. M&As seem to be forever popular and nowadays companies often use them as {{a certain kind of}} strategy to develop their business. M&As have attracted research for decades and also distribution in M&As has been found interesting. Moreover, research often concentrates to the horizontal M&A´s potential synergies that emerge in the integration process and so is the case also in this study as the core issue is to study the integration of the distribution channels and its potential synergies. This study concentrates on a single case, an acquisition which took place in 2011. The case consists of two Finnish companies operating in the same business field. Both of the companies are very export orientated, which gives this study its export view. As the companies operate in the same field this acquisition falls into the categorization of <b>horizontal</b> acquisition. The <b>objective</b> of the thesis is to study how the export channels could be integrated after an acquisition? This research question is divided again to three sub-questions asking how the distribution channels of the acquirer and acquired company are organized, what is pursued by the post-acquisition distribution channel integration and what are the integration challenges especially from the logistics point-of-view. The framework was built from the basis of the literature used in this thesis. The framework combines M&A process and distribution channels to a one united model which presents the progress of this thesis. The study was carried out as a qualitative research and as a holistic single case study. The data used in the research includes two interviews, other material from the case companies and also material of the companies collected by the author independently from different sources. There were many motives for the acquisition as usual. From the research results one can find that the integration process is still very ongoing and the synergies have not yet been fully discovered but also they are there to be found. The concentration of the research was in the export distribution which proved to be meaningful since the exports markets of the case companies were found to be quite complementary. The research results brought up also other issues concerning the post-acquisition integration process rather than the distribution channels and export. M&As are always a risky business. The final result can never be predicted. No matter how good the merging companies look on paper the practice is not the same. The acquisition process of this case has not ended yet and there lies potential synergy benefits to be discovered if enough effort is used to go through the process right...|$|R
40|$|With the {{continued}} growth of world population comes {{the need for}} more energy resources to quench the thirst of the energy insatiable world we live in. Geothermal energy is green and is a sustainable way of providing our energy needs. Formation water at depths greater than 3, 000 m in the Netherlands is a potential source of energy to generate electricity. Over the study area observed formations are buried deep enough to reach water temperatures in excess of 1000 C, and this could conceivably be used for the generation of electricity with very low CO 2 emissions. Four seismic surveys L 3 NAM 1985 P (146. 6 km 2), L 3 NAM 1991 A (414. 5 km 2), Z 3 NAM 1990 D (762. 2 km 2) and Z 3 AMC 1989 A (544. 6 km 2) were interpreted and integrated with well data including well tops to help in this evaluation. The Detfurth and Volpriehausen (Triassic) of the West Netherlands Basin in the Zuid Holland area are established to be potentially good reservoirs for geothermal development. This {{is due to the fact}} that stratigraphically, they are the deepest sandstones and consequently most likely to reach sufficient depths. These objectives are too deep to be visible and adequately interpretable on seismic due to the low impedance contrast and because it is overlain by the strong reflectors of the evaporates of the Upper Germanic Triassic. Therefore, surfaces for these objectives were generated based on formation markers in the wells that intersected the Triassic using 3 D gridding in Jewel Suite. Generally, the reservoir interval from the top of the Detfurth to the base of the Volpriehausen contains enough thick sequences of porous sands. The gross thickness ranges from 95 m in well VAL- 01 to 163 m in P 15 - 14. Two porosity/permeability relationships have been used for calculating N/G at various permeability cut-offs of 0. 1 mD, 1 mD, 10 mD and 100 mD. Net sand ranges from 0. 14 m to 58. 04 m for 10 mD and 0. 1 mD permeability cut-offs respectively. The zone in and around Wells MON- 03, P 18 -A- 02, P 15 - 01 and P 15 - 14 show the best reservoir intervals based on average porosity and N/G values. Based on different scenarios the average porosity ranges from 6. 5 % to 16. 2 % and N/G ranges from 0. 6 % to 30. 8 %. Primary porosity and permeability are generally low in the mapped area, but it is expected that permeability and connectivity are enhanced locally through fracturing. The objective is highly faulted, and hence this will serve as conduit for water leading to a higher level of connectivity and water production. Heterogeneity remains an issue of concern due the high level of Vcl is some of the intervals. But it is believed that they will generally not serve as a barrier or baffle to flow, i. e. it will reduce the vertical permeability but not the important <b>horizontal</b> permeability. The <b>objectives</b> in the mapped area suggest that aeolian and fluvial facies occupy more than 50 % of the rock unit. Aeolian sandstones are known for their excellent reservoir qualities. They are well sorted with good porosity and permeability. This means that a larger part of the rock unit within the mapped area is of good reservoir quality. The focus of the oil industry is on the structural highs. Prospective areas for geothermal exploitation occur in lows. The lows have no well penetrations and are usually considerably deeper than the much shallower oil fields. It is, however, suspected that structuration and formation of highs and lows is relatively late and that diagenesis predates structuration. This would imply that the shallow oil fields have porosities representative of much greater depths. This is borne out by the fact that there is hardly any relationship of porosity against depth. When this proves to be accurate it would have a very positive effect on the development of geothermal energy, since this reduces the uncertainties involved in a project like this.

40|$|Purpose Early {{detection}} of abnormal visual acuity (VA) {{is crucial in}} the identification and management of ocular and visual abnormalities in infants. Currently, the Teller Acuity Cards (TACs) are considered {{the gold standard for}} clinical testing and are effective in obtaining a quick estimate of an infant’s VA, but they have certain drawbacks. They rely on a subjective assessment of the baby’s looking behavior. Despite this, TACs have been found to have good validity and repeatability. The current study investigates a new method to objectively assess visual acuity in infants, which is uses a video gaze tracker (GT) and computer-generated stimuli, developed in the lab of M. Eizenman at the University of Toronto. The purpose was to validate this method in adults and infants against current clinical VA tests. Visual scanning patterns were measured by the GT system that requires minimal subject cooperation in adult and infant populations. The targets were judged as seen when the relative fixation time on the grating exceeded a pre-determined threshold, as compared to the fixation time on the luminance-matched background. Methods Experiment 1 : In 15 uncorrected myopic adults, binocular grating VA was measured. The targets were square-wave gratings of spatial frequency ranging from 2. 3 to 37 cpd presented randomly in one of four positions on the screen. There were 6 objective protocols (in which VA was judged by fixations). The subjects were naïve, as the only instruction given to the participants was to look towards the screen. The experimenter, who presented the gratings also acted as an observer by making judgments of seen/not seen responses using the objective information provided by the software. Objective GT VA was compared with VA measured with subjective responses using the same stimuli and with Teller Acuity Cards (TACs). Experiment 2 : Binocular grating VA for horizontal gratings was measured in 20 typically-developing infants aged 3 to 12 months. Spatial frequency ranged from 0. 32 to 42 cpd and VA was measured on two visits with both the GT and TACs. A staircase protocol was used to obtain the VA threshold in the GT. The experimenter controlled the staircase method and an observer used the objective information of visual fixations using the software to judge if the grating was seen or not. Video cartoons were shown between stimulus presentations to keep the infant’s attention towards the screen. VA was also measured with the TACs held in the vertical orientation, so that the gratings were horizontal, similar to the GT method. A TAC stage was specially designed with a vertical slot in which the cards could be presented. The observer was masked regarding the participant’s age and the starting spatial frequency. The study co-ordinator determined the choice of the start card which was randomized between participants so as to give an equal number of participants with each start card. The same start card was used for the second session of each infant. The threshold was defined as the highest spatial frequency for which the infant gave a clear, correct look and an unclear/inconsistent look for the next higher level. The observer, who was masked regarding the absolute spatial frequency, increased or decreased the spatial frequency until this threshold was determined. Results Experiment 1 : The mean age of participants in the adult study was 28. 47 ± 7. 93 yrs and their mean uncorrected logMAR acuity was 0. 9 ± 0. 2. There was no obvious difference among the mean acuities obtained by 6 objective GT protocols, the subjective GT protocol and the TACs. The GT showed agreement of 93 % and 100 % within half an octave compared with the subjective protocol and TACs (horizontal gratings) respectively. There was 100 % agreement within 1 octave of the objective GT with both the subjective protocol and the TACs (<b>horizontal</b> gratings). The <b>objective</b> gaze tracker VA showed significant correlation with uncorrected refractive error (r = 0. 87, p < 0. 001). Experiment 2 : The mean age of participants was 7. 9 ± 2. 5 months. In both visits, the testability of the TACs was 100 % across all infants. GT had 100 % testability on the first visit and 95 % testability on the second visit. The mean TAC acuity over two visits for all the infants was 0. 7 ± 0. 23 log cycles per degree, while the mean log GT acuity over two visits was 0. 86 ± 0. 30. Infant GT VA acuity estimates were within 1 octave of the TACs 90 % and 79 % of the time for the first and second visit respectively, while GT VA estimates were within half octave of the TACs 63. 2 % and 47 % of the time for the first and second visit respectively. Eighty-seven percent of the GT VAs and 72. 5 % of TACs were within one octave of the mean age norms, although on average the GT gave better acuities than the TACs. There was an increase in GT VA with increasing age (r= 0. 80, p< 0. 005 for the first visit and r= 0. 77, p< 0. 005 for the second visit). Both the TACs and the GT had repeatability of 89. 5 % within 1 octave between visits and 84. 2 % and 79 % within half octave between visits respectively. Conclusions In adults, the gaze tracker gave VA thresholds which were equivalent to the TACs and were not significantly different from subjectively determined grating VA. The agreement of the GT with TACs in infants and with norms in the infant literature established good validity for the GT. Finally, the significant correlation with age confirmed the validity of the measurements of the gaze tracker. The repeatability of the gaze tracker was {{similar to that of the}} TACs, demonstrating the quality usefulness of the test. These results demonstrate the potential for an automated test of infant visual acuity, which could be a powerful and useful tool for visual acuity assessment in infants and other population groups who cannot respond verbally. The staircase protocol established in the study could be fully automated in an objective version of the test. The raw data of eye movements obtained in this study such as the pattern of first fixations, time taken for first fixations, time spent fixing the stimulus, typical stimulus duration and time between presentations could be used to develop algorithms for fully automated testing of VA in infants...|$|R
