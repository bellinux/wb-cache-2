2500|$|Micro{{extrusion}} is a microforming extrusion process {{performed at}} the submillimeter range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990. Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later. Regardless of method, {{one of the greatest}} challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. [...] "The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes." [...] Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, <b>forming</b> <b>system</b> stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the crystallite (grain) structure and boundaries.|$|E

40|$|When {{applying}} the slip <b>form</b> <b>system,</b> the early setting time of concrete {{corresponds to the}} hardening time of early-age concrete indicating that cast-in-place concrete has developed sufficient strength to be safely stripped off the form. This hardening time is thus an important indicator for {{the determination of the}} slip-up velocity of the slip <b>form</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, need is for a technique enabling to evaluate the early hardening time of concrete in order to secure the safety of the slip <b>form</b> <b>system</b> {{and the quality of the}} constructed concrete. Among the methods using ultrasonic waves, this paper applies the surface wave velocity to evaluate the degree of hardening of concrete so as to estimate the early setting time and decide the slip-up time of the slip <b>form</b> <b>system.</b> To that goal, penetration resistance test, compressive strength test and surface wave velocity measurement test are performed concurrently with respect to the mix materials and curing temperature of concrete. The test results are used to derive the relationship between the compressive strength and surface wave velocity according to the early hardening time of concrete. Continuous wavelet transform is applied for the measurement of the surface wave velocity. The validity of the application of the continuous wavelet transform is verified through numerical analysis. Finally, the surface wave velocity required for the slip-up of the slip <b>form</b> <b>system</b> is proposed and the applicability of the proposed surface wave velocity for the determination of the climbing time of the slip <b>form</b> <b>system</b> is verified by means of tests on a reduced-scale slip <b>form</b> <b>system</b> prototype...|$|R

The world is rapidly changing and so are the environments in which these systems are situated. HTML <b>form</b> <b>systems</b> due to the tangling of code and logic tend to be out of date with the real world. Workflow, the explanation of how a task takes place helps separate the logic and the code. In order to change with the real world Workflow Management Systems provide management and specification of workflow. However, Workflow Management Systems still have their limitations. They tend to have verbose specifications of workflow that are difficult or time-consuming to change. They are a good solution to complex HTML <b>form</b> <b>systems</b> but not good enough. This project takes the HTML <b>form</b> <b>systems</b> as a model and builds a Workflow Management System that uses artificial intelligence planning methodologies and Event Calculus workflow specifications to try to overcome some of the problems of Workflow Management Systems. The development of the Workflow Management System with AI principles has uncovered interesting issues in modelling situations in the Event Calculus and the problems that need to be overcome to use AI with workflow. The problems and solutions developed in the project cover a wide spectrum of domains, looking at logic programming, server-side languages and getting the two to talk to each other.
