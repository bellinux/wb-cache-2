5|$|Ticks are parasitic, {{and some}} {{transmit}} micro-organisms and parasites {{that can cause}} diseases in humans, while the saliva of a few species can directly cause tick paralysis {{if they are not}} removed within a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E

5|$|The Raiders {{declined}} to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) John Madden {{was responsible for}} the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through Chicago so they would arrive a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.|$|E
5|$|Winters are mild with {{frequent}} frosts and cold spells. Temperatures are usually mild {{during the day}} and cold during the night. Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and sudestada, which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness and cooler temperatures, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. Dull, gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. Snowfall is extremely rare. When it does snow, it usually lasts for only a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case}} with Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E

5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E

5|$|On October21, a westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Caribbean. The wave quickly developed organized convection, indicating that a possible low-pressure area had developed along the wave. Continued development {{led to the}} formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-Five (which would later be named Alpha). The wave continued to move towards the west, producing minimal shower and thunderstorm activity. Once in the southwestern Caribbean, the wave slowed, and convection gradually redeveloped on October25. The next day, with continued organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that a tropical depression could develop in the following <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> At around 18:00UTC, the NHC determined that Tropical Depression Twenty-Six had developed about 105miles (170km) north of the central cost of Panama.|$|E
5|$|On September30, a {{well-developed}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the eastern coast of Africa {{and entered the}} Atlantic Ocean. Deep convection formed around a prominent mid-level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October2 before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at 0600UTC on October13 while located about 190miles (305kilometres) south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> As {{the structure of the}} storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name Omar.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} days, the low moved towards {{the west and}} started to regenerate with a circulation center becoming visible early on October 3. Based on this, the EPHC re-upgraded Madeline to a tropical depression. Continuing to intensify, Madeline was soon upgraded to a tropical storm for the second time. During the next <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> Madeline remained near stationary before turning towards the northeast on October 5. As the cyclone moved over an area of warm seas surface temperatures, the storm started to intensify. During the next day, Madeline slowly developed an eye before intensifying into a hurricane. In addition, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and a pressure of 984 millibars.|$|E

50|$|Contract Approval - COIN {{ordinances}} require, {{before the}} final proposed contract {{is placed on the}} Board agenda, the Memorandum of Understanding to be posted on the Agency's website, usually 30 <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> Board meetings prior to board ratification. This allows the public to review contracts and perform independent financial scrutiny and provide public comment prior board ratification.|$|R

5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily {{as a result of}} some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status. Philippe began to loop around the center of the non-tropical system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued to loop cyclonically and could be tracked for a further <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> within the circulation of the non-tropical system.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualties}} {{suffered by}} the two combatants are difficult to determine, due to several factors. In regard to the Germans, equipment losses were {{complicated by the fact}} that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks. For example, tanks disabled one day often appeared a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later repaired. German personnel losses are clouded by the lack of access to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war. Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made available until 1978, while others were taken by the Soviet Union, which declined to confirm their existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} based on an {{unpublished}} book by I. A. R. Wylie. RKO Pictures bought the book in outline form in April 1941, but encountered casting difficulties and sold the rights to MGM in December 1941 for $50,000. A <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> after they had obtained the rights, MGM Vice-President Eddie Mannix realized the source material was political in nature and tried to abandon the project. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mannix relented and the production went forward. Once the film went into production at MGM, the book was published by Random House in April 1942.|$|E

5|$|While {{the storm}} was passing near Dominica, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau warned about {{the threat of the}} {{hurricane}} which would strike the island within a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> The advisory was sent via telegraph to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours; this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio. Warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast, causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000people.|$|E
5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and for a <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity {{seems to be an}} important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
