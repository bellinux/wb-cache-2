40|$|Automatic {{programming}} of {{arc welding}} robots requires the geometric {{description of a}} part from a solid modeling system, expert weld process knowledge and the kinematic arrangement of the robot and positioner automatically. Current commercial solid modelers are incapable of storing explicitly product and process definitions of weld features. This work presents a paradigm to develop a computer-aided engineering environment that supports complete weld feature information in a solid model and create an automatic programming system for robotic arc welding;In the first part, welding features are treated as properties or attributes of an object, features which are portions of the object surface [...] the topological boundary. The structure for representing the features and attributes is a graph called the Welding Attribute Graph (WAGRAPH). The method associates appropriate weld features to geometric primitives, adds welding attributes, and checks the validity of welding specifications. A systematic structure is provided to incorporate welding attributes and coordinate system information in a CSG tree. The specific implementation of this structure using an <b>hybrid</b> <b>solid</b> <b>modeler</b> (IDEAS) and an object-oriented programming paradigm is described;The second part provides a comprehensive methodology to acquire and represent weld process knowledge required for the proper selection of welding schedules. A methodology of knowledge acquisition using statistical methods is proposed. It is shown that these procedures did little to capture the private knowledge of experts (heuristics), but helped in determining general dependencies, and trends. A need was established for building the knowledge-based system using handbook knowledge and to allow the experts further to build the system. A methodology to check the consistency and validity for such knowledge addition is proposed. A mapping shell designed to transform the design features to application specific weld process schedules is described;A new approach using fixed path modified continuation methods is proposed in the final section to plan continuously the trajectory of weld seams in an integrated welding robot and positioner environment. The joint displacement, velocity, and acceleration histories all along the path {{as a function of}} the path parameter for the best possible welding condition are provided for the robot and the positioner to track various paths normally encountered in arc welding...|$|E
40|$|Applying sweep {{operations}} on 2 -D closed contours {{is a well}} known method for modelling 3 -D solid objects. This paper deals {{with the implementation of}} a <b>solid</b> <b>modeler</b> with sweep as the basic representational scheme. In the <b>modeler,</b> a <b>solid</b> is defined by sweeping a planar polygon along a linear or curved trajectory. A sculptured solid may also be defined by using a beta-spline curve for the sweep polygon and a cubic B-spline curve for the sweep trajectory. By incorporating Boolean operations, a <b>hybrid</b> sweep-CSG <b>solid</b> <b>modeler</b> is implemented. The current implementation allows translational, rotational, and twisted sweep {{operations on}} a planar polygon composited of lines and arcs.

40|$|Abstract. Solid {{modeling}} {{theory and}} technology are maturing rapidly. We have seen explosive {{growth in the}} field based on scientific literature reviews, and {{by the number of}} <b>solid</b> <b>modelers</b> that are commercially available. Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a method used to represent solid objects in many contemporary solid modeling systems. A CSG representation is a binary tree whose nonterminal nodes represent Boolean operations and whose terminal nodes represent primitive solids. In this paper, the comparison between four <b>solid</b> <b>modelers</b> in term of their difficulties and friendliness in designing and representing a solid object are presented. The <b>solid</b> <b>modelers</b> are AutoCAD 2004, Solid Edge V 12, SolidWorks 2001 plus, and 3 D Studio Max 7. The research methodology is based on <b>Solid</b> <b>Modeler</b> Evaluation and Comparison Cycle (SMECC) methodology. This paper documents seven performance parameters in the design process namely, extrusion, setup time, ease of use, speed, flexibility, feature based design, and CSG tree.

The rise of advanced computer graphics leads to the replacement of drawing board by <b>solid</b> <b>modeler</b> software. The development of three-dimensional (3 D) <b>solid</b> <b>modeler</b> involves visualization technology for the viewing and manipulation of 3 D models, sources of images, techniques for 3 D representations and reconstruction, point set and operations. This paper focuses on the discussion of representation and 3 D reconstruction. Few techniques for representations and D reconstruction have been introduced by some researchers which are related to mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) approach. They are constructive solid geometry, boundary representation, spatial decomposition, simple affine transformation and others which are used for representation. Meanwhile line labeling, gradient space, linear system, interactive method, analytical heuristic, back propagation algorithm for function approximation, genetic algorithm approach and others are used for 3 D reconstruction.

40|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Computer Aided Design and solid modelling systems, designers had developed a set of techniques for designing solid objects by sketching their ideas on pencil and paper and refining them into workable designs. Unfortunately, these techniques {{are different from those}} for designing objects using a <b>solid</b> <b>modeler.</b> Not only does this waste avast reserve of talent and experience (people typically start drawing from the moment they can hold a crayon), but it also has a more fundamental problem: designers can use their intuition more effectively when sketching than they can when using a <b>solid</b> <b>modeler.</b> Viking is a solid modelling system whose user-interface is based on interactive sketch interpretation. Interactive sketch interpretation lets the designer create a line-drawing of a de- sired object while Viking generates a three-dimensional ob- ject description. This description is consistent with both the designer's line-drawing, and a set of geometric constraints either derived from the line-drawing or placed by the de- signer. Viking's object descriptions are fully compatible with the object descriptions used by traditional <b>solid</b> <b>modelers.</b> As a result, interactive sketch interpretation can be used with traditional solid modelling techniques, combining the advantages of both sketching and solid modelling...|$|R

Integrated product development is a process where both upstream (e. g., functional requirements, styling and cosmetic features, and packaging) and downstream (e. g., manufacturing considerations, testing, dunnage, and disposal) requirements of a product are handled concurrently with its geometry construction. In this research, the so-called ECHO (Engineering Constraint Handling and Optimization) system for integrated product development has been developed. A unique feature of this system is that it can explicitly represent and process both the upstream and downstream requirements. These requirements are represented in the form of constraint networks, rule networks, and assessment matrices. By solving for all of the feasible solutions, the ECHO system instructs the geometry construction, and thus ensures that both upstream and downstream requirements are reflected in the design. In its simplest form, the ECHO system consists of four tightly integrated components: a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) solver, an optimization solver, an expert system shell, and a <b>solid</b> <b>modeler.</b> The expert system shell and <b>solid</b> <b>modeler</b> are two well known commercial software, namely, Smart Element and Pro/ENGINEER.
