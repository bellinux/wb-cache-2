2500|$|Ford {{introduced}} the Sapphire shortly after Holden debuted the VT Commodore in 1997, {{in a bid}} to make the EL more competitive. The name was reused from the Ford Sierra Sapphire sedan sold in Europe and New Zealand. It was a limited edition model and had two variants based on either the GLi or the Futura, fitted with additional features, however the list differed depending on the base model chosen. All Sapphires had [...] alloy wheels and metallic paint as standard. Other responses to the VT Commodore were the Classic and <b>Falcon</b> <b>S</b> models. Similarly to the Sapphire, they too were limited edition variants based on either the GLi or Futura. Standard for the <b>Falcon</b> <b>S</b> included a six-stack CD player, air conditioning, and alloy wheels which were identical to those fitted to the XR6 and XR8 models of the earlier ED Falcon range. Later, in March 1998, just before the launch of the AU Falcon, a Sapphire II was introduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{education}} research community {{no longer has}} a means of being manifested on Space Shuttle flights, and small orbital payload carriers must be flown as secondary payloads on ELV flights, as their launch schedule, secondary payload volume and mass permits. This {{has resulted in a}} backlog of small payloads, schedule and cost problems, and an inability for the small payloads community to achieve routine, low-cost access to orbit. This paper will discuss Goddard's Wallops Flight Facility funded effort to leverage its core competencies in small payloads, sounding rockets, balloons and range services to develop a low cost, multiple payload ejector (MPE) carrier for orbital experiments. The goal of the MPE is to provide a low-cost carrier intended primarily for educational flight research experiments. MPE can also be used by academia and industry for science, technology development and Exploration experiments. The MPE carrier will take advantage of the DARPAI NASA partnership to perform flight testing of DARPA <b>s</b> <b>Falcon</b> small, demonstration launch vehicle. The Falcon is similar to MPE fiom the standpoint of focusing on a low-cost, responsive system. Therefore, MPE and Falcon complement each other for the desired long-term goal of providing the small payloads community with a low-cost ride to orbit. The readiness dates of Falcon and MPE are complementary, also. MPE is being developed and readied for flight within 18 months by a small design team. Currently, MPE is preparing for Critical Design Review in fall 2005, payloads are being manifested on the first mission, and the carrier will be ready for flight on the first Falcon demonstration flight in summer, 2006. The MPE and attached experiments can weigh up to 900 lb. to be compatible with Falcon demonstration vehicle lift capabilities fiom Wallops, and will be delivered to the Falcon demonstration orbit - 100 nautical mile circular altitude...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} Apollo program ended, the {{development}} of launch propulsion systems in the US has fallen drastically, with only two new booster engine developments, the SSME and the RS- 68, occurring {{in the past few}} decades. 1 In recent years, however, there has been an increased interest in pursuing more effective launch propulsion technologies in the U. S., exemplified by the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist s inclusion of Launch Propulsion Systems as the first technological area in the Space Technology Roadmaps 2. One area of particular interest to both government agencies and commercial entities has been {{the development of}} hydrocarbon engines; NASA and the Air Force Research Lab 3 have expressed interest in the use of hydrocarbon fuels for their respective SLS Booster and Reusable Booster System concepts, and two major commercially-developed launch vehicles SpaceX <b>s</b> <b>Falcon</b> 9 and Orbital Sciences Antares feature engines that use RP- 1 kerosene fuel. Compared to engines powered by liquid hydrogen, hydrocarbon-fueled engines have a greater propellant density (usually resulting in a lighter overall engine), produce greater propulsive force, possess easier fuel handling and loading, and for reusable vehicle concepts can provide a shorter turnaround time between launches. These benefits suggest that a hydrocarbon-fueled launch vehicle would allow for a cheap and frequent means of access to space. 1 However, the time and money required {{for the development of a}} new engine still presents a major challenge. Long and costly design, development, testing and evaluation (DDT&E) programs underscore the importance of identifying critical technologies and prioritizing investment efforts. Trade studies must be performed on engine concepts examining the affordability, operability, and reliability of each concept, and quantifying the impacts of proposed technologies. These studies can be performed through use of the Technology Impact Forecasting (TIF) method. The Technology Impact Forecasting method is a normative forecasting technique that allows the designer to quantify the effects of adding new technologies on a given design. This method can be used to assess and identify the necessary technological improvements needed to close the gap that exists between the current design and one that satisfies all constraints imposed on the design. The TIF methodology allows for more design knowledge to be brought to the earlier phases of the design process, making use of tools such as Quality Function Deployments, Morphological Matrices, Response Surface Methodology, and Monte Carlo Simulations. 2 This increased knowledge allows for more informed decisions to be made earlier in the design process, resulting in shortened design cycle time. This paper will investigate applying the TIF method, which has been widely used in aircraft applications, to the conceptual design of a hydrocarbon rocket engine. In order to reinstate a manned presence in space, the U. S. must develop an affordable and sustainable launch capability. Hydrocarbon-fueled rockets have drawn interest from numerous major government and commercial entities because they offer a low-cost heavy-lift option that would allow for frequent launches 1. However, the development of effective new hydrocarbon rockets would likely require new technologies in order to overcome certain design constraints. The use of advanced design methods, such as the TIF method, enables the designer to identify key areas in need of improvement, allowing one to dial in a proposed technology and assess its impact on the system. Through analyses such as this one, a conceptual design for a hydrocarbon-fueled vehicle that meets all imposed requirements can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{long-term}} survey data, determining whether Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s raptor numbers are stable, increasing, or decreasing is difficult. Unlike our relatively well-monitored gamebirds, no regular surveys have been performed, and raptors barely register on the state 2 ̆ 7 s Breeding Bird Surveys or Christmas Bird Counts, owing to their relative rarity. However, a few data-points of interest do exist, which might be worth summarizing. In one of the first multi-year surveys of Sandhills avifauna, H. Elliott McClure (1966) summarized raptor abundance data based on three years of study in the Nebraska Sandhills (1 941 - 1 944). During that period, he typically drove from a ranch near Ord to Valentine National Wildlife Refuge each Thursday, returning on Friday or Saturday, and driving 350 miles round trip. On these trips he tallied all the larger birds seen, including raptors. He summarized these data as birds seen per day, but they have here been converted to relative percentage abundance of species, to facilitate comparisons (Table 1). In 1959 John and Ann Mathisen published a population study of diurnal raptors in the Panhandle, based on one year (1957) of roadside surveys. They traveled 17, 807 miles over a year-long period, making surveys on 1 28 days that included counts made every month, from as few as 6 to as many as 15 days per month. Their findings provide an invaluable snapshot of the species composition and relative abundance of the Panhandle 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> hawks, <b>falcons,</b> and eagles as they existed in the 19502 ̆ 7 s. Their data are also summarized in Table 1. A somewhat similar but much more limited winter roadside survey was later made by Shupe and Collins (1983) in southeastern Nebraska...|$|R

40|$|Eurasian Golden Plovers Pluvialis apricaria staging in the Netherlands {{during the}} non-breeding season show strikingly {{constant}} seasonal changes in body mass with a first mass peak in late November and December {{and a second}} peak in late April and May. Despite huge sample sizes, variations in this pattern over successive years in the 1990 s and among age classes were minuscule. However, {{in contrast to the}} body mass levels at other times of the year, there was a marked decline in the winter peak mass of Golden Plovers from the 1970 s/early 1980 s to 1989 – 2000. The decrease, by an average of 29 g, was about half the extra mass previously stored in autumn. This additional mass is known to consist of fat and may be interpreted as an energy store − insurance − for sudden cold spells when a negative energy balance forces the birds to move south and stay in front of the frostline. As the rate of the mass increase in September–October showed no change from the 1980 s to the 1990 s, changes in food availability are unlikely to explain the long-term mass decline. Also, there were no differences in two factors known to influence energy expenditure and feeding rate, air temperature and rainfall. The one striking environmental change relevant to plovers was the steep increase in the occurrence of raptors in the northern Netherlands in the 1980 <b>s,</b> notably Peregrine <b>Falcons</b> Falco peregrinus and Goshawks Accipter gentilis. We argue that the halving of the winter mass peak over a decade is consistent with the hypothesis that under increased risk of predation, birds lower their body mass in order to reduce individual vulnerability, a reduction that may be traded off against an increased risk of starvation. ...|$|R
40|$|What is a Raptor? A raptor is a {{bird of prey}} that {{is known}} for its predatory habits of feeding on other animals. This group of birds {{possesses}} several unique anatomical characteristics that allow them to be superior hunters. These include excellent sensory abilities such as binocular vision and keen hearing in order to detect prey, large powerful grasping feet with razor-sharp talons for catching prey, and generally large, hooked bills that can tear prey. There are 30 species of hawks, falcons, and eagles, as well as 18 species of owls breeding in North America. In this large group of birds, there are diurnal, or daytime, species such as hawks, falcons, and eagles, and nocturnal, or nighttime, species, such as owls. The Barn Owl is the preeminent nighttime hunter. with its facial disk and asymmetric ears, it has a keen sense of hearing which allows it to detect and capture prey in complete darkness. Should We Be Concerned About the Conservation Status of Raptors? Yes. Throughout the 20 th century, raptors were impacted greatly by human disturbances such as habitat loss, shooting and environmental contaminants. Many raptor species such as the Bald Eagle and Peregrine Falcon sharply declined {{as a direct result of}} the use of the pesticide DDT. However, their numbers have rebounded since DDT use was restricted in the 1970 <b>s.</b> The Peregrine <b>Falcon</b> was recently removed from the list of Endangered and Threatened Species in the U. S. (25 Aug 1999), and the Bald Eagle was recently proposed for delisting (6 July 1999) due to its increase from 417 pairs in 1963 to 6, 334 pairs in 2000. Many long-distance migrants, such as Swainson’s and Broad-winged hawks, have experienced declines due to habitat destruction and hazards such as pesticide use in their wintering grounds. Swainson’s hawks breed in the western and Midwestern U. S. and Canada and migrate all the way to central Argentina for the winter. Conditions on the migratory route as well as in the wintering countries have had a major impact on their populations returning to the U. S. each year. Many grassland raptor species, including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson’s hawk, Northern Harrier, Golden Eagle, and Burrowing Owl, have sharply declined in many locations over the past few decades as their grassland habitats have been greatly altered. Not all raptor species are declining. Some raptor species have benefited from human disturbances, including woodland species such as Sharp-Shinned and Cooper’s Hawks. The increase in home bird feeding has directly resulted in increased numbers of these bird feeder predators...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} an integrative {{model of}} language documentation, curriculum development, and linguistics and teacher training, centered in an equitable partnership between academic institutions and Native American language communities. The model {{is responsive to}} speech communities and promotes relationships of reciprocity. We highlight a specific project based on wáq’amu ‘camas,’ a plant and root food of North America. The contributions of this paper are (i) to describe our methodology, particularly the overlap of documentation, curriculum development and language teaching, and discuss how it has been strengthened via collaborative partnerships, and (ii) to argue that this pedagogical and documentation approach incorporates human and linguistic rights, and contributes to healing relationships between tribes and the educational systems that perpetuated loss of language and culture. Through new models and approaches, these same systems then can assist in language and culture restoration. The specific project we discuss involves a number of components. Elders of two dialects of the Ichishkíin (Sahaptin) language contributed their knowledge. Also involved were two documentation projects, a reservation-based high school language course, and three university courses: a linguistics seminar focused on language revitalization through place-based learning, a two-year language course, and a summer institute language class for speech community members and non-tribal university students. A specific aim of the language revitalization course was to address requests of speech communities, which are increasingly looking for linguists who are trained in second language teaching, curriculum development, and collaboration. Students of the course worked together to document (in Ichishkíin) wáq’amu identification, life cycle, gathering, prepation and preservation. They developed lesson plans and materials with the input of tribal teachers. The curriculum was piloted and refined at a summer institute, which led to additional documentation. The materials generated are now used as tools to further document language and processes involving wáq’amu. In this model, a topic of importance to the speech community centers the efforts of documentation, curriculum development, and training. University and tribal institutions benefit as do their students and instructors. We argue that honoring and incorporating tribal values promotes the human and linguistic rights of Native teachers, students and communities (Roskos 2004, Falcón and Jacob 2011, Brayboy et al. 2012). Furthermore, through sharing linguistic and cultural knowledge, not only are products improved, but relationships between academic and tribal institutions move towards healing (Falcón and Jacob 2011, McCarty and Lee 2014).

40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 species that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). Grasslands or potential grasslands make up about 81 percent of the Great Plains 2 ̆ 7 vegetation, and probably represented about 96 percent of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s original vegetation. Only in the Sandhills region is that vegetation type still essentially intact; the tall-grass prairie of eastern Nebraska is Virtually gone. In my 1979 summary, I judged that 36 species of Great Plain 2 ̆ 7 s bird are grassland-adapted forms, with 15 of these endemic to the Great Plains, and the rest more broadly distributed. Nine of these endemics breed in Nebraska (Greater Prairie-Chicken, Mountain Plover, Long-billed Curlew, Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel, Lark Bunting, Clay-colored Sparrow, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur and Chestnut-collared Longspur), and the Chihuahuan Raven also once did. None of these ten species is considered endangered nationally, although the Greater Prairie-Chicken needs to be monitored closely. Birds of the tall-grass prairie that currently breed in eastern Nebraska include the Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel. Eastern Meadowlark, Field Sparrow and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. Both of the latter are not, strictly speaking, prairie species, but either represent a later successional stage containing some small trees (Field Sparrow), or the presence some brushy or weedy elements (Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow). In the west the short-grass plains support several declining or rare species, including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Hawk, Prairie <b>Falcon,</b> Mountain Plover, Burrowing Owl, Common Poor-will, Lark Bunting, and two longspurs. Some of these also have certain additional non-vegetative needs such as cliff-side nest sites (Prairie Falcon), burrows (Burrowing Owl), nearly bare ground (Mountain Plover), or rocky substrates (Poor-will). The geographically and ecologically intermediate Sandhills prairies support many typical grassland and wet meadow breeders, such as Sharp-tailed Grouse, Long-billed Curlew, Bobolink, Lark Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow and Horned Lark. Woodlands and forests comprise about 15 percent of the native vegetation of the Great Plains states, and support some 51 percent of the region 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna (Johnsgard, 1979). I {{estimate that}} in Nebraska this vegetation type occupies three percent of the state 2 ̆ 7 s surface area, and supports 48 percent of its avifauna. It is thus {{one of the most important}} vegetation types for generating species diversity of our avifauna. Bald Eagles are among the rare woodland-nesting species of Nebraska, although they are also strongly water-dependent for food. Several hawks (Broad-winged, Red-shouldered, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s, etc.) are other clear associates of mature woodlands. Several woodland nesting passerines that have generally large ranges elsewhere in the central or western states are limited to woodlands in extreme northwestern Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s Pine Ridge region, or in the lower Missouri woodlands of extreme southeastern Nebraska (see Table 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Space-based {{solar power}} (SSP) {{generation}} is being {{touted as a}} solution to our ever-increasing energy consumption and dependence on fossil fuels. Satellites in Earth's orbit can capture solar energy through photovoltaic cells and transmit that power to ground based stations. Solar cells in orbit are not hindered by weather, clouds, or night. The energy generated by this process is clean and pollution-free. Although the concept of space-based solar power was initially proposed nearly 40 years ago, the level of technology in photovoltaics, power transmission, materials, and efficient satellite design has finally reached a level of maturity that makes solar power from space a feasible prospect. Furthermore, new strategies in methods for solar energy acquisition and transmission can lead to simplifications in design, reductions in cost and reduced risk. This paper proposes using a distributed array of small satellites to collect power from the Sun, as compared to the more traditional SSP design that consists of one monolithic satellite. This concept mitigates some of SSP's most troublesome historic constraints, such as the requirement for heavy lift launch vehicles and the need for significant assembly in space. Instead, a larger number of smaller satellites designed to collect solar energy are launched independently. A high frequency beam will be used to aggregate collected power into a series of transmission antennas, which beam the energy to Earth's surface at a lower frequency. Due to the smaller power expectations of each satellite and the relatively short distance of travel from low earth orbit, such satellites can be designed with smaller arrays. The inter-satellite rectenna devices can also be smaller and lighter in weight. Our paper suggests how SSP satellites can be designed small enough to fit within ESPA standards and therefore use rideshare to achieve orbit. Alternatively, larger versions could be launched on <b>Falcon</b> 9 <b>s</b> or on <b>Falcon</b> 1 <b>s</b> with booster stages. The only satellites that are constrained to a significant mass are the beam-down satellites, which still require significant transmission arrays to sufficiently focus the beams targeting corresponding ground stations. With robust design and inherent redundancy built-in, power generation and transmission will not be interrupted in the event of mishaps like space debris collision. Furthermore, the "plug and play" nature of this system significantly reduces the cost, complexity, and risk of upgrading the system. The distributed nature of smallsat clusters maximizes the use of economies of scale. This approach retains some problems of older designs and introduces additional ones. Mitigations will be explored further. For example, the distributed nature of the system requires very precise coordination between and among satellites and a mature attitude control and determination system. Such a design incorporates multiple beaming stages, which has the potential to reduce overall system efficiency. Although this design eliminates the need for space assembly, it retains the challenge of significant on-orbit deployment of solar and transmission arrays. Space power "beaming" is a three step process that involves: 1) conversion of dc power generated by solar cells on the satellite into an electromagnetic wave of suitable frequency, 2) transmission of that wave to power stations on ground, and 3) conversion of the radio waves back into dc power. A great deal of research has been done on the use of microwaves for this purpose. Various factors that affect efficient power generation and transmission will be analyzed in this paper. Based on relevant theory and performance and optimization models, the paper proposes solutions that will help make space-based solar power generation a practical and viable option for addressing the world's growing energy needs...|$|R
