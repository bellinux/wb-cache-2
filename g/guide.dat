40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the impact of <b>guiding</b> anglers for compensation on a <b>guide’s</b> attitude toward fishing as a personally satisfying recreational activity. Additionally, we sought to develop and employ a specialization typology based on style of fishing participation to understand how current attitudes towards fishing as a personal leisure activity vary among different groups of fishing <b>guides.</b> Eighteen semi-structured in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} Texas inshore fishing <b>guides</b> and subsequent analysis yielded a typology representing four distinct styles of participation. These <b>guides</b> can be placed on a continuum from least specialized to most specialized: 1) Limit <b>Guides,</b> 2) All-purpose <b>Guides,</b> 3) Lure <b>Guides</b> and 4) Sight-casting <b>Guides.</b> <b>Guides</b> exhibiting less specialized styles of participation were more likely to view <b>guiding</b> as “work” or a “job”, less likely to participate in fishing as a personal leisure activity, and less likely to experience personal angling enjoyment vicariously through their clients’ fishing experience...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} mobile technologies used for <b>guiding</b> tourists. I will compare <b>guiding</b> applications with what is going in a live <b>guided</b> tour in order to understand what different experiences they produce and try to indicate what is needed in both types of <b>guided</b> tours if developed further.   <b>Guided</b> tours are important tools in the tourism and hospitality industry and we know that <b>guided</b> tours are appreciated by visitors and residents of places. By applying the empirical and theoretical knowledge from a live <b>guided</b> tour in this work and frame this knowledge in technological applications it might be better understood how learning, experiencing and influencing visitors through the <b>guided</b> tours of different modes.   The results from this study show that there are several aspects in live <b>guided</b> tours that can prospect from integrating elements from virtual <b>guided</b> tours. Also the opposite seems likely, that virtual <b>guided</b> tours can benefit from learning to integrate some of the elements from live <b>guided</b> tours...|$|R
