2500|$|The primary {{factor was}} the {{stalling}} {{of the jet}} stream just {{to the west of}} the Appalachian Mountains. [...] That, combined with the Bermuda High over the Atlantic Ocean, blocked any systems from moving inland or offshore. The influence of a tropical low (which nearly became a tropical storm but did not attain a <b>full</b> <b>surface</b> circulation) off the North Carolina coast allowed a constant stream of tropical moisture to enter the Mid-Atlantic region. [...] The resulting heavy and prolonged rains overflowed the banks of many rivers, lakes, and streams, leading to the flooding.|$|E
2500|$|Commander Earl Trosino (Guadalcanals chief engineer), {{joined the}} salvage party. He {{disconnected}} U-505s diesels from her electric driving motors, while leaving these motors clutched to the propeller shafts. With the U-boat moving under tow by Guadalcanal, the propellers [...] "windmilled" [...] {{as they passed}} through the water, turning the shafts and the drive motors. This caused the motors to act as electrical generators charging U-505s batteries. With power from the batteries, U-505s pumps cleared out the water let in by the attempted scuttling, and her air compressors blew out the ballast tanks, bringing her up to <b>full</b> <b>surface</b> trim.|$|E

2500|$|Analyses of {{oscillation}} {{data are}} aimed at separating these different frequency components. In {{the case of the}} Sun the oscillations can be observed directly as functions of position on the solar disc as well as time. Projection onto the spatial eigenfunctions goes some way towards isolating [...] and , although the outcome contains contributions from many other harmonics, partly because in practice only about one-third of the <b>full</b> <b>surface</b> area of the Sun can usefully be measured. [...] The average over the stellar surface implicit in observations of stellar oscillations {{can be thought of as}} an example of such spatial filtering, just as are the full-disc solar observations by BiSON and GOLF. [...] Each projection is followed by a Fourier transform in time, from which, with adequate resolution, the frequencies of the modes can be determined.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} life, abroad {{in the land}} and defiant. Down the frozen {{waterway}} toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze {{in the air as}} it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its <b>full</b> <b>surface</b> rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled--blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.|$|E
