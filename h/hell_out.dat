5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

500|$|The pessimism {{expressed}} by Phillips and Mecklin surprised Frederick Nolting, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account [...] "surprised the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of me. I couldn't believe my ears." [...] Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed {{because he had}} recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of The New York Times and UPI respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won Pulitzer Prizes and were strident critics of Diệm.|$|E

[...] "He presents them with a very pragmatic option: If you don't like it, get the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> and there are no takers.

500|$|Another {{scene in}} which Ottman meshed his editing and {{composing}} duties was when Dussander wakes {{up in the hospital}} with the television show The Jeffersons playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, it scares the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of you... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound."

500|$|At Sutter's July 2006 {{induction}} to the Hall, Smith {{talked with}} reporters about his chances for election. Like many others, he commented {{that he was}} puzzled {{that he had not}} yet been selected. [...] "This confuses the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of me. But I've always been baffled by it", he said. Smith's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot, and Gossage—who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith—has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008.|$|E
500|$|The Return of the King {{was criticized}} for its poor camera placement. [...] "What's {{the use of a}} new {{graphics}} engine and character models when the view is from so far away?"

On just about every mission the camera switching confuses the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of you." [...] The game's save function was also criticized. Ellis commented that [...] "You can only save after completing a level [...] which is not so good when you're forced to slog through the same sequences over and over again." [...] Critics also complained about the unskippable cut scenes, occasionally unclear objectives and relatively short length.|$|E

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great.

500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of me only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1930, salary {{negotiations}} between the Yankees and Ruth quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five—the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why {{he thought he was}} [...] "worth more than the President of the United States," [...] Ruth responded: [...] "Say, if I hadn't been sick last summer, I'd have broken <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three."

500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of the other kids, playing better baseball than they were.

500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane.

They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce their second album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd. In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Too Far" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics.

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song another [...] "syrupy-sweet" [...] ballad on the album and that it [...] "harbors over-the-top performances worthy of [...] "Star Search" [...] (more than fitting considering the film's '80s-era rags-to-riches storyline)".

500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, admitting that despite its faults, he [...] "enjoyed the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of" [...] it. He loved it for several reasons: he {{is a big}} fan of Anna Torv's Bellivia {{performance}} and its plotline, the drugs incorporated into the plot, its Inception-like qualities, the animation, and Bell's final goodbye. IGN Fringe reviewer Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, calling it [...] "one of the most memorable Fringe episodes to date." [...] Like Murray, Isler also noted the similarities to Inception {{as well as to the}} 1968 film Yellow Submarine and the 1977 science fiction novel A Scanner Darkly.

500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E
