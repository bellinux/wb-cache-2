5|$|Tristano {{first met}} saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947. They played {{together}} in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach {{later that year}} for radio broadcasts. The pianist reported that Parker enjoyed his playing, in part because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist's style. In 1948 Tristano played less often in clubs, and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band, making it into a quintet. This band recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label, which later became Prestige Records. Later that year Warne Marsh, another saxophonist student of Tristano's, {{was added to the}} group.|$|E
5|$|The American {{zoologist}} Austin Hobart Clark {{gave the}} Lesser Antillean macaw its scientific name, Ara guadeloupensis, in 1905, {{based on the}} contemporary accounts, and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species. He wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw (A. macao), {{as well as the}} green-winged macaw (A. chloropterus) and the Cuban macaw (A. tricolor). Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique, based on accounts of red macaws there, as well as on Guadeloupe. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species, and that the Lesser Antillean macaw was confined to Guadeloupe. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population, but this is difficult to prove. Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola. According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume, the similarity between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives, and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{of this model}} comes from a project by Giuseppe Busso. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from his ancestor: it still used several components of the 3-litre engine from the 6C 3000 prototype, but as its name implied engine capacity was increased to 3,495cc.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, the D.333 was designed, {{built and}} flown {{for the first}} time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from its {{predecessors}} {{in that it was}} constructed with a more spacious cabin, and could hold a maximum of 10 passengers. The primary buyer of this model was Air France; however, two of the three planes bought by the latter crashed while flying the distance between Toulouse and Dakar.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterward, in 1834, Friedrich Ferdinand Runge {{discovered}} {{carbolic acid}} in coal-tar, and Auguste Laurent obtained it from phenylhydrate, which was soon {{determined to be}} the same compound. There was no clear view on the relationship between carbolic acid and creosote; Runge described it as having similar caustic and antiseptic properties, but noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>different,</b> in that it was an acid and formed salts. Nonetheless, Reichenbach argued that creosote was also the active element, as it was in pyroligneous acid. Despite evidence to the contrary, his view held sway with most chemists, and it became commonly accepted wisdom that creosote, carbolic acid, and phenylhydrate were identical substances, with different degrees of purity.|$|E

25|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued {{because they were too}} expensive to manufacture. Internally <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound as nice as the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her work cut out for her, but this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E
25|$|The first {{spectrum}} of SN 2002cx was obtained with FLWO on 2002 May 17, 4 days before B-band max. At this point SN 2002cx {{is similar to}} SN 1997br as both have a blue continuum, with absorption lines from Fe III λ4404 and Fe III λ5129. Si II λ6355 though is not apparent in SN 2002cx at this point, and it has very weak Ca II H & K lines suggesting that SN 2002cx is similar to SN 1991T which also lacked such lines. This spectrum for SN 2002cx has a low expansion velocity measuring only ~6400km s−1. This marked {{one way in which}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> from SN 1997br, as SN 1997br's expansion velocity was ~10,400km s−1 at the same point relative to its own B-band maximum. At the time of measurement SN 2002cx's expansion velocity was the lowest measured for an early time type Ia, Another spectrum taken on 2002 May 20, 1 day before B-band maximum light, showed little evolution from the one taken on 2002 May 17.|$|E

25|$|The Coast {{as it was}} called, also invented its {{own kind}} of dance hall, called a Barbary Coast Dance Hall. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>different</b> than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female {{employees}} who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies. And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe. Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it {{was referred to as}} the Paris of America. Drug addicts of the district could even buy cocaine or morphine at an all night Grant Street drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer. And during the 1890s San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.|$|E

He joined {{up with a}} showband called the Monarchs, then another called Manhattan, and another called the Gamblers. The Gamblers became the group Them, and Morrison {{developed}} his stage presence. [...] "He was a wee runt. Offstage you wouldn't have looked sideways at him.
