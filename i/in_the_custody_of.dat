5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> national or local authorities as standards. Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E

5|$|Through {{the seventh}} and eighth centuries, the two abbeys {{followed}} their mission of evangelism, along with forest clearance. With {{the decline of the}} Carolingian Empire, however, the abbeys suffered the same decay as elsewhere, leaving the principality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> lay abbots—temporal guardians—from 844 to 938, including Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims, Adalard the Seneschal, and Reginar and Giselbert, dukes of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the archbishops.|$|E

5|$|Braose {{was the son}} of William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose and {{his first}} wife, Aline, {{daughter}} of Thomas de Multon. He was likely born around 1260, as his age was given as about 46 in 1307. Other events prove that he was born prior to 1264, as he was captured in that year. This came about during the Second Barons' War (1264–1267) during the reign of King Henry III of England, as the elder Braose had sided with the king during Simon de Montfort's rebellion. The younger Braose was a hostage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> Montfort's wife, Eleanor. Her household accounts include expenses related to the younger William's care.|$|E
5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, {{all on the same}} day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E
5|$|Upon his release, Morris {{returned}} to Peekskill where {{he discovered that}} he had been promoted to the rank of captain while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the British. Morris commanded a company back to White Plains until he received orders to head south to Virginia. Upon arrival, Morris's company, under the overall command of General George Washington, aided in Siege of Yorktown, the last major battle of the American Revolution. Specifically, Morris's company of light infantry provided support to the forlorn hope commanded by Colonel Alexander Hamilton.|$|E

50|$|After {{finding their}} way out of the gauntlet, the teams {{separate}} on amiable terms, and Amy and Dan stay behind with Fiske Cahill and Mr. McIntyre, who give them a letter from Grace. They then reveal that the entire Clue Hunt was just a preparation for the battle with another family. Amy and Dan are left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> both their Great-Uncle Fiske and Nellie, but the letter makes it clear that their adventures aren't over yet.|$|R
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
5|$|Brock's {{successor}} at Detroit, however, fared much worse. Colonel Henry Procter {{faced an}} attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison {{set out to}} retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> his First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, {{which led to the}} Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter's forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. Perhaps of more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.|$|E
5|$|Charles's only {{recourse}} was {{to return}} to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, and placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the army the following day. In Pride's Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively a military coup.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{examines the}} problem of people with disability in Chile. Firstly, this thesis presents the overall information about definitions which cover {{the problem of}} disability and its types. Attention is put on World Organizations and its conception of handicap and disability. Secondly, this thesis analyses concrete Chilean laws which are covering <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> people with some handicap. Attention is paid to government agencies, projects and institutions. Following chapter presents how this problem is handled in Denmark because it {{is considered to be}} very developed country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social and economic sphere. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last part, based on the information and facts I will try to provide possibilities of improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> disabled people in Chile...|$|R
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} for the bomb code-named the Fat Man arrived by air the same day. The bomb's plutonium core (encased in its insertion capsule) and the beryllium-polonium initiator were transported from Kirtland to Tinian by C-54 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> Project Alberta couriers. Three Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies designated F31, F32, and F33 {{were picked up}} at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s, two from the 509th and one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving 2 August. The B-29s were Luke the Spook and Laggin' Dragon of the 509th, and 42-65386, a phase 3 Silverplate of the 216th AAF Base Unit. F33 was expended during the final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would {{have been used for}} a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plutonium}} core, {{along with}} its polonium-beryllium urchin initiator, was transported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen {{because it does not}} act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.|$|E
