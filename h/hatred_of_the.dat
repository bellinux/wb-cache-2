5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him {{to support}} Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side.

Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a maid whose home is {{occupied}} by the Hessian officers when they enter Trenton. Despite her <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British red coats she accepts them and by her conduct dismisses their doubts about her loyalty. When they are resigned to a drunken sleep, for which the maid gladly offered, she takes a message from her wounded American sweetheart. She disguises herself and sets off to deliver the message to George Washington. The maid then leads Washington and his men in crossing the icy Delaware River.

5|$|When Ferdinand VII {{assumed the}} throne of Spain in 1813, Valero became {{critical}} of the new king's policies towards the Spanish colonies in Latin America. He developed a keen <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy, resigned his commission in the army, and headed for Mexico. There he joined the insurgent army headed by Agustín de Iturbide, in which Valero was named chief of staff. He fought for and helped achieve Mexico's independence from Spain. After the Mexican victory, Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico. Since Valero had developed anti-monarchist feelings following his experiences in Spain, he revolted against Iturbide. His revolt failed and he attempted to escape from Mexico by way of sea.|$|E

5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Katarn met Jan Ors (Julie Eccles), a Human Rebel working {{undercover}} as {{a double}} {{agent in the}} Empire. Ors uncovered the real information about Katarn's parents' death; that the Empire was behind it. The Empire eventually discovered that Ors {{was working for the}} Rebels and she was taken prisoner. Katarn helped her escape, thus ending his career with the Empire. He soon became a mercenary and, due to his <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire for killing his parents, he began to take on jobs from the Rebel Alliance. Dark Forces begins with Katarn being recruited by the Rebel Alliance to recover the plans to the Death Star, a heavily armed space station capable of destroying an entire planet.

5|$|The fifteenth stage saw {{the race}} enter the Dolomites and {{traverse}} three major climbs within the mountain chain.

Despite orders from his team management, Roche continued with the move. The Carrera Jeans-Vagabond pack chased after the Roche group to protect the advantage of Roche's teammate and race leader Visentini. Roche crossed the finish line in twelfth place, fifty-six seconds after the stage winner van der Velde, which allowed him to don again the pink jersey by five seconds over Tony Rominger. Roche's actions, taking the race lead away from Visentini and disobeying team commands, gained him the <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian cyclings fans.|$|E

5|$|The most {{influential}} retelling, {{which according to}} many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten, was {{a story in the}} January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, entitled J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship Marie Celeste, the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white race, has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the rest of the ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously, but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.|$|E
5|$|Fei {{discovers that}} he is a {{descendant}} of Abel, a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge, a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus, the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans, one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled. Deus, however, had become self-aware and took over the Eldridge. Amidst the confusion, Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar, Deus' power source. It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself. The Wave Existence also sensed Abel's longing for his mother and used the biological computer Kadomony to create a woman for a companion. When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge, the captain decided to initiate the self-destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it. Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel, under the protection of the Wave Existence. He was the sole survivor, but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created for him as a companion, Elly. Abel and Elly, at first, led a happy life, but Deus had also created Miang, Cain, and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet, one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength. When the now-adult Abel and Elly discovered this, they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry, but lost. However, through the power of the Wave Existence, they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus. One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim, where Abel's incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda. Ramsus, revealed to be a biologically engineered clone of Emperor Cain created by Solaris scientists as a means of controlling Deus who was rejected in favor of Fei, hence his <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter, attacks one more time and is finally defeated. He is later rescued during an attack and convinced to let go of his anger and aid the group.|$|E
