40|$|AbstractDevelopmental {{signaling}} cascades {{that can}} be perturbed by cocaine and other drugs of abuse {{have been difficult to}} study in humans and vertebrate models. Although numerous direct neural targets of cocaine have been elucidated at the molecular level, {{little is known about the}} specific cellular events that are impacted indirectly as a result of the drug's perturbation of neural circuits. We have developed oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster as a model in which to identify downstream biochemical and/or cellular processes that are disrupted by chronic cocaine exposure. In this model, cocaine feeding resulted not only in expected reductions in viability, but also in unanticipated developmental defects during oogenesis, including aberrant follicle morphogenesis and vitellogenic follicle degeneration. To identify mechanisms through which cocaine exerted its deleterious <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis,</b> we examined candidate components of neural and hormonal signaling pathways. Cocaine-induced disruptions in follicle formation were enhanced by juvenile hormone exposure and phenocopied by serotonin feeding, while cocaine-activated follicle apoptosis was enhanced by concomitant dopamine feeding. HPLC analysis of dopamine and serotonin in the ovary suggests that these neurotransmitters could variably mediate cocaine's <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis</b> indirectly in the brain and/or directly in the ovary itself. We confirmed the involvement of hormone signaling by measuring ecdysteroids, which increase following cocaine exposure, and by demonstrating suppression of cocaine-induced follicle loss by hormone receptor mutants. Cocaine-induced ovarian follicle apoptosis and adult lethality appear to be caused by modulation of dopamine levels, while morphological defects during follicle formation likely result from perturbing serotonin signaling during cocaine exposure. Our work suggests not only a new role for juvenile hormone and/or serotonin in Drosophila ovarian follicle formation, but also a cocaine-sensitive role for dopamine in modulating hormone levels in the female fly...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{assisted}} reproductive technologies (ART) {{has been}} increasing {{over the past three}} decades and in developed countries, ART accounts for 1 - 3 % of annual births. In an attempt to compensate for inefficiencies in in vitro fertilisation procedures, patients undergo ovarian stimulation using high doses of exogenous gonadotropins to allow retrieval of multiple oocytes in a single cycle. Although ovarian stimulation has an important role in ART, it may also have detrimental <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis,</b> embryo quality, endometrial receptivity, and perinatal outcomes. In this review we consider the evidence for these effects and address possible underlying mechanisms. We conclude that such mechanisms are still poorly understood and further knowledge is needed in order to increase the safety of ovarian stimulation and to reduce potential effects on embryo development and implantation, which will ultimately be translated into increased pregnancy rates and healthy offspring...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila melanogaster histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT) Eggless (Egg/dSETDB 1) catalyzes {{methylation}} of Histone H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9), {{a signature}} of repressive heterochromatin. Our previous {{studies showed that}} H 3 K 9 methylation by Egg is required for oogenesis. Here we analyze a set of EMS-induced mutations in the egg gene, identify the molecular lesions of these mutations, and compare the <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis</b> of both strong loss-of-function and weak hypomorphic alleles. These studies show that H 3 K 9 methylation by Egg is required for multiple stages of oogenesis. Mosaic expression experiments show that the egg gene is not required intrinsically in the germ cells for their early differentiation, but is required in the germ cells for their survival past stage 5 of oogenesis. egg is also required in germ stem cells for their maintenance, since egg− germ stem cells initially survive but are not maintained as females age. Mosaic analysis also reveals that the early egg chamber budding defects in egg− ovaries are due to an intrinsic requirement for egg in follicle stem cells and their descendents, and that egg plays a non-autonomous role in somatic cells in the germarium to influence the differentiation of early germ cells...|$|E

40|$|Wolbachia are {{bacteria}} {{that live in}} the cells of various invertebrate species to which they cause a wide range of <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> physiology and reproduction. We investigated the effect of Wolbachia infection in the parasitic wasp, Asobara tabida Nees (Hymenoptera, Braconidae). In the 13 populations tested, all individuals proved to be infected by Wolbachia. The removal of Wolbachia by antibiotic treatment had a totally unexpected effect—aposymbiotic female wasps were completely incapable of producing mature oocytes and therefore could not reproduce. In contrast, oogenesis was not affected in treated Asobara citri, a closely related species that does not harbor Wolbachia. No difference between natural symbiotic and cured individuals was found for other adult traits including male fertility, locomotor activity, and size, indicating that the <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis</b> is highly specific. We argue that indirect effects of the treatments used in our study (antibiotic toxicity or production of toxic agents) are very unlikely to explain the sterility of females, and we present results showing a direct relationship between oocyte production and Wolbachia density in females. We conclude that Wolbachia is necessary for oogenesis in these A. tabida strains, and this association would seem to be the first example of a transition from facultative to obligatory symbiosis in arthropod–Wolbachia associations...|$|R

40|$|Background & objective: Diazinon (DZN) as an {{environmental}} pollutant adversely effects reproductive system. This study was done to investigate the effect of DZN on sex hormone serum levels and ovarian histological changes in rats. Material & Methods: In this study, 40 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups including experimental groups 1 and 2 that received 5 and 10 mg/kg diazinon intraperitoneally for 4 weeks respectively. The sham group received olive oil, and the control group received no injection. The animals were anesthetized while proestrus phase and blood samples were collected from {{the heart and the}} blood serum sex hormones were measured. by Radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. In addition, ovaries were removed and sections were prepared for histological studies. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Duncan test. Results: The results showed that the levels of estrogen and progesterone, number of corpus luteum, primordial, primary, growing, Graafian follicles and diameter of oocyte, corpus luteum, theca and granulosa thickness significantly decreased in the experimental groups compared to control group (p< 0. 001). Also, the number of atretic follicles in the experimental groups significantly increased com­pared to that of the control (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Diethylhexyl {{phthalate}} (DEHP) is an estrogen-like compound {{widely used}} as a commercial plasticizer and present in medical devices, tubing, food containers and packaging. It is considered an endocrine disruptor and studies on experimental animals showed that exposure to DEHP can alter the function of several organs including liver, kidneys, lungs and reproductive system, particularly the developing testes of prenatal and neonatal males. Exposure to DEHP has been proposed as a potential human health hazard. This study assessed the effects of DEHP on folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation using the mouse as the experimental model. Newborn female mice were hypodermically injected with DEHP at doses of 20 and 40 μg/kg per body weight following different exposure regimens during the weaning period. We found that DEHP altered both folliculogenesis and oocyte development. In particular, DEHP exposure significantly decreased {{the number of the}} primordial follicles at pubertal and adult age by possibly accelerating the rate of follicle recruitment dynamics, reduced and/or delayed the level of imprinted gene methylation in the oocytes and increased metaphase II spindle abnormalities in oocytes matured in vitro. Furthermore, the weight of pups and litter size of mothers exposed to DEHP were significantly lower than controls. Finally, the number of primordial follicles appeared significantly reduced also in the F 1 offspring at the adult age. These results show that DEHP may have a number of adverse <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis,</b> especially when exposure occurs during early postnatal age, arising concerns about the exposure of human female infants and children to this compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of soya as a dietary protein {{source in the}} formulated feed, Abfeed® S 34 (Marifeed Pty (Ltd), Hermanus) for farmed abalone, Haliotis midae has resulted in larger gonads during reproductive seasons compared to the gonads of abalone fed kelp or diets that included fishmeal as the only main protein source. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if the isoflavones present in the soya were responsible for this increase in gonad size and the subsequent <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> farmed abalone growth. Animals weighing between 40 - 50 g were fed one of seven isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets containing either 0, 25, 50 or 100 percent of the soya component of the commercial feed (Abfeed® S 34, Marifeed Pty (Ltd), Hermanus) from September 2013 to March 2014. An additional three diets were formulated to include crystalline isoflavone (ISO). These diets were identical to the 0 percent soya diet (i. e. the fishmeal only diet - FM), only ISO was included at the same rate that ISO occurred in the three soya diets. Data were analysed using a multiple forward stepwise regression analysis (MSR) to test the effects of ISO concentration, soya concentration, time, sex, time by concentration interaction and sex by concentration interaction on growth and gonad development and to identify those variables that most contributed to the model. The {{inclusion of}} crystalline ISO failed to promote larger gonads and had no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> abalone growth, while growth and gonad development was dose dependent on soya inclusion rates with sex and time contributing to the models. Mean monthly weight gain in males correlated with increasing soya concentrations (c) (MSR, y = 3. 24 + 0. 002 c, r 2 = 0. 23, p = 0. 03), ranging from 3. 11 ± 0. 55 g abalone- 1 month- 1 to 4. 43 ± 0. 46 g abalone- 1 month- 1, while both male and female monthly length gain was not influenced by soya concentration with an overall mean of 1. 62 ± 0. 05 mm abalone- 1 month- 1 (MSR, p = 0. 05 and p = 0. 81, respectively). By December, the whole body mass, meat mass and visceral mass in both males and females decreased with increasing soya levels. However, by February, female whole body mass, meat mass and visceral mass positively correlated with soya levels. At the end of the study, male abalone fed FM with soya equivalent to the commercial feed had the highest whole body mass (69. 00 ± 2. 48 g abalone- 1), meat mass (41. 80 ± 1. 12 g abalone- 1), visceral mass (9. 00 ± 2. 47 g abalone- 1) and gonad bulk index (42. 70 ± 9. 82 g abalone- 1), while females were not influenced by soya concentrations with an overall whole body mass of 63. 46 ± 0. 79 g abalone- 1. Weight loss was observed in all treatments between February and March, probably due to a spawning event. The moisture content in the meat was not influenced by treatment, however, visceral water loss was effected by both ISO and soya concentration with time and sex contributing to the model. The visceral water loss of females fed graded levels of soya decreased as a function of soya from December to March, and from December to February for males, whereas females fed ISO-enriched diets decreased as a function of ISO concentration (c) at the end of the study from 74. 98 ± 0. 88 to 73. 10 ± 0. 75 percent (MSR, y = 74. 97 – 0. 0025 c, r 2 = 0. 20, p = 0. 048). The inclusion of crystalline ISO had no significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis</b> in female farmed Haliotis midae, while the distribution of the predominant oocyte stage, stage 7 (second last stage prior to spawning) was dose-dependent in abalone fed increasing soya concentration (c) (MSR, y = 33. 38 + 0. 03 c, r 2 = 0. 32, F(1, 18) = 8. 52, p = 0. 01). The increase in stage 7 oocytes in abalone fed FM with soya did not reduce the number of oocytes (44. 96 ± 3. 01 oocytes mm- 2) present within the lumen, while the number of oocytes (o) in abalone fed the FM-only based diets decreased with increasing abundance of stage 7 oocytes (MSR, y = 58. 28 – 0. 48 c, r 2 = 0. 38, F(1, 18) = 12. 51, p = 0. 002), possibly due to the increase in size of the oocytes with thicker jelly coats. This study provided evidence that crystalline isoflavone had no influence on abalone gonad development over five months, while soya had a dose-dependent <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> growth, gonad mass and oogenesis in farmed Haliotis midae. Formulated abalone feed could be manipulated at certain times of the year to obtain maximum growth. These implications and further studies were discussed...|$|R

40|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{breed in}} water, including the terrestrial species, and may therefore {{be exposed to}} water-borne pharmaceuticals during critical phases of the reproductive cycle, i. e. sex differentiation and gamete maturation. The objectives of this paper were to (i) review available literature regarding adverse effects of hormonally active pharmaceuticals on amphibians, with special reference to environmentally relevant exposure levels and (ii) expand the knowledge on toxicity of progestagens in amphibians by determining effects of norethindrone (NET) and progesterone (P) exposure to 0, 1, 10 or 100 ng l(- 1) (nominal) <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis</b> in the test species Xenopus tropicalis. Very little information was found on toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of pharmaceuticals on amphibians. Research has shown that environmental concentrations (1. 8 ng l(- 1)) of the pharmaceutical oestrogen ethinylestradiol (EE 2) cause developmental reproductive toxicity involving impaired spermatogenesis in frogs. Recently, {{it was found that}} the progestagen levonorgestrel (LNG) inhibited oogenesis in frogs by interrupting the formation of vitellogenic oocytes at an environmentally relevant concentration (1. 3 ng l(- 1)). Results from the present study revealed that 1 ng NET l(- 1) and 10 ng P l(- 1) caused reduced proportions of vitellogenic oocytes and increased proportions of previtellogenic oocytes compared with the controls, thereby indicating inhibited vitellogenesis. Hence, the available literature shows that the oestrogen EE 2 and the progestagens LNG, NET and P impair reproductive functions in amphibians at environmentally relevant exposure concentrations. The progestagens are of particular concern given their prevalence, the range of compounds and that several of them (LNG, NET and P) share the same target (oogenesis) at environmental exposure concentrations, indicating a risk for adverse <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> fertility in exposed wild amphibians...|$|R

[Results] Dicer- 1 (Dcr 1), a key enzyme in miRNA biogenesis, was depleted using RNAi. Females treated with double-stranded RNA targeting Dicer- 1, exhibited deep alterations in oocyte development; among them, the follicular epithelia of the basal oocytes did not develop, thus resulting in sterile females.

Studies in Drosophila {{have been particularly}} useful for discovering key genes involved in muscle specification, myoblast fusion, and sarcomere organization. The muscles of the Drosophila female reproductive system have received little attention despite extensive work <b>on</b> <b>oogenesis.</b> We have used newly available GFP protein trap lines to characterize of ovarian muscle morphology and sarcomere organization. The muscle cells surrounding the oviducts are multinuclear with highly organized sarcomeres typical of somatic muscles. In contrast, the two muscle layers of the ovary, which are derived from gonadal mesoderm, have a mesh-like morphology similar to gut visceral muscle. Protein traps in the Fasciclin 3 gene produced Fas 3 ::GFP that localized in dots around the periphery of epithelial sheath cells, the muscle surrounding ovarioles. Surprisingly, the epithelial sheath cells each contain a single nucleus, indicating these cells do not undergo myoblast fusion during development.

40|$|In general, {{mammalian}} males produce only spermatozoa {{in their}} testes and females produce only oocytes in their ovaries. However, newborn MRL/MpJ male mice produce oocytes within their testes.

Germ cells with positive reactions to oogenesis markers such as NOBOX oogenesis homeobox and synaptonemal complex protein 3 were observed in the MRL/MpJ fetal testes on embryonic day 18. 5. These fetal testicular oocytes possessed maternal-specific methylation patterns of histone and DNA. The level of DNA methylation was still low in postnatal testicular oocytes at day 14 after birth. Additionally, the postnatal testicular oocytes contained both X and Y chromosomes and {{had the ability to}} fuse with sperm. These results suggest that some XY germ cells in fetal testes of MRL/MpJ mice enter meiosis prematurely, undergo oogenesis, and differentiate into oocytes.

Five germ cell development stages (oogonium, perinucleolar, cortical alveoli, vitellogenic, ripe) and two other structures (postovulatory follicles and atretic oocytes) were observed in females caught in the river. Captive animals lacked the ripe oocytes and postovulatory follicles and had a relatively higher number of atretic oocytes. Females in captivity are known to produce larger oocytes, and they release fewer eggs in each spawn (absolute fecundity) when compared with animals that are able to migrate. Our results suggest that the TietA(a) River is undergoing alterations which are being reflected in the reproductive performance of S. hilarii, mainly due to the presence of atretic oocytes in females caught in the river. The lack of postovulatory follicles and ripe oocytes in captive animals reveals that migratory impediment negatively impacts final oocyte maturation. However, the stage of maturation reached is adequate for ovulation induction with hormone manipulation.
