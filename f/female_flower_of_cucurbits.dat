30|$|In certain {{species of}} Schismatoglottis, inter-pistillar staminodes are found at {{irregular}} intervals between <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> (Barabé et al. 2004 b). However, {{the absence of}} data related to the very early stages of development <b>of</b> the <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> and staminodes in this genus prevents us from making detailed comparisons of floral development between Schismatoglottis and Dieffenbachia. In Dieffenbachia there is no discoid basal portion on female floral primordia. This is different from what was reported in <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Culcasia (Barabé and Bertrand, 1996) and Schismatoglottis (Barabé et al., 2004 b). On the other hand, the development <b>of</b> the <b>female</b> <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Dieffenbachia presents some similarities with atypical bisexual <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Cercestis. This is not surprising considering that in the tribe Spathicarpeae only the genus Bognera does not have staminodes surrounding the ovary. In the short intermediate zone of the spadix of Cercestis, one can find atypical bisexual <b>flowers</b> consisting <b>of</b> a rudimentary gynoecium surrounded by a whorl of five rudimentary staminodes (Barabé, 2013; Barabé and Bertrand, 1996). The organisation and morphology of these atypical bisexual flowers {{are similar to those}} depicted during early stages of development <b>of</b> the <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Dieffenbachia. Bisexual <b>flowers</b> constitute a plesiomorphic character in the Aroid family and <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> associated with staminodes appear in many clades. A few species of the genus Zantesdeschia which makes up the sister group to Spathicarpeae (Cusimano et al., 2011) have a gynoecium surrounded by a whorl of three staminodes (Mayo et al., 1997). Also, in the genus Synadrospadix, Mayo et al. (1997) reported the presence <b>of</b> functional bisexual <b>flowers</b> in the intermediate zone of the spadix (Table  1). Therefore, from a developmental point of view, we believe that the presence of staminodes in the female zone constitutes a plesiomorphy instead of a synapomorphy as suggested by Gonçalves et al. (2007). Whether this is the case or not would need to be investigated at the molecular level.|$|R

40|$|New Phytologist (2010) Summary *Obligate mutualisms {{involving}} actively pollinating seed predators {{are among}} the most remarkable insect-plant relationships known, yet almost nothing is known about the chemistry of pollinator attraction in these systems. The extreme species specificity observed in these mutualisms may be maintained by specific chemical compounds through 'private channels'. Here, we tested this hypothesis using the monoecious Breynia vitis-idaea and its host-specific Epicephala pollinator as a model. *Headspace samples were collected from both male and <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> the host. Gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and olfactometer bioassays were used to identify the floral compounds acting as the pollinator attractant. *Male and <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> B. vitis-idaea produced similar sets of general floral compounds, but in different ratios, and male flowers emitted significantly more scent than <b>female</b> <b>flowers.</b> A mixture <b>of</b> 2 -phenylethyl alcohol and 2 -phenylacetonitrile, the two most abundant compounds in male flowers, was as attractive to female moths as the male flower sample, although the individual compounds were slightly less attractive when tested separately. *Data on the floral scent signals mediating obligate mutualisms involving active pollination are still very limited.

40|$|Abstract — Male Eastern Olive Sunbirds (Cyanomitra olivacea) and Xylocopa nigrita {{carpenter}} bees in Tanzania both utilise the <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> male {{plants of}} Lagenaria sphaerica (Cucurbitaceae) {{as a source}} of nectar. The sunbirds set up territories defending this nectar resource. Observations of interactions between the sunbirds and the carpenter bees show that the bees are aggressively displaced from flowers when spotted by the birds. Only the bees can be considered as legitimate pollinators as the birds do not contact the anthers <b>of</b> the male <b>flowers</b> and were never seen visiting nectarless <b>female</b> <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Lagenaria sphaerica.
