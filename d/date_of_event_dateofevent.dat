5000|$|Thompson et al. {{used the}} {{conveyor}} belt model of memory to explain forward telescoping. It assumes that events are stored in the order that they occur. When individuals try to remember the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> an <b>event,</b> they scan serially backward through memory. Since events are only remembered by order or time between events in this model, if an event is forgotten, previous events are recalled as if they occurred more recently and forward telescoping occurs. Another way of interpreting this theory is that people estimate the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{based on the number}} <b>of</b> personal <b>events</b> that have occurred since the target event. Since people underestimate memory loss over long periods <b>of</b> time, target <b>events</b> are moved closer to the present. Although this model explains forward telescoping, it does not explain backward telescoping.|$|R
