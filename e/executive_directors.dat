25|$|Monitoring by {{the board}} of directors: The board of directors, with its legal {{authority}} to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance. Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. <b>Executive</b> <b>directors</b> possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management {{on the basis of the}} quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ex ante. It could be argued, therefore, that <b>executive</b> <b>directors</b> look beyond the financial criteria.|$|E
