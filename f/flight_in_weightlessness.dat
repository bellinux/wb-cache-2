40|$|The {{dynamics}} of root growth was studied <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness.</b> <b>In</b> {{the absence of}} the gravitropic reference direction during weightlessness, root movements could be controlled by spontaneous growth processes, without any corrective growth induced by the gravitropic system. If truly random of nature, the bending behavior should follow so-called 'random walk' mathematics during weightlessness. Predictions from this hypothesis were critically tested. In a Spacelab ESA-experiment, denoted RANDOM and carried out during the IML- 2 Shuttle <b>flight</b> <b>in</b> July 1994, the growth of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) roots was followed by time lapse photography at 1 -h intervals. The growth pattern was recorded for about 20 h. Root growth was significantly smaller <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> as compared to gravity (control) conditions. It was found that the roots performed spontaneous movements <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness.</b> The average direction of deviation of the plants consistently stayed equal to zero, despite these spontaneous movements. The average squared deviation increased linearly with time as predicted theoretically (but only for 8 - 10 h). Autocorrelation calculations showed that bendings of the roots, as determined from the 1 -h photographs, were uncorrelated after about a 2 -h interval. It is concluded that random processes {{play an important role in}} root growth. Predictions from a random walk hypothesis as to the growth dynamics could explain parts of the growth patterns recorded.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{experience}} gained <b>in</b> human space <b>flight</b> since Yuri Gagarin’s historical <b>flight</b> <b>in</b> 1961, there {{has yet to be}} identified a completely effective countermeasure for mitigating the effects of weightlessness on humans. Were astronauts to embark upon a journey to Mars today, the six-month exposure to weightlessness en route would leave them considerably debilitated, even with the implementation of the suite of piece-meal countermeasures currently employed. Continuous or intermittent exposure to simulated gravitational states on board the spacecraft while traveling to and from Mars, also known as artificial gravity, has the potential for enhancing adaptation to Mars gravity and re-adaptation to Earth gravity. Many physiological functions are adversely affected by the weightless environment of spaceflight because they are calibrated for normal, Earth’s gravity. Hence, the concept of artificial gravity is to provide a broad-spectrum replacement for the gravitational forces that naturally occur on the Earth’s surface, thereby avoiding the physiological deconditioning that takes place <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness.</b> Because researchers have long been concerned by the adverse sensorimotor effects that occur <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> as well as in rotating environments, additional study of the complex interactions among sensorimotor and other physiological systems in rotating environments must be undertaken both on Earth and in space before artificial gravity can be implemented...|$|R

To date, {{little is known about}} the biomechanics of running <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> on such a treadmill-SLS system. We have designed an instrumented treadmill/force-plate to compare the biomechanics of running <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> to running on Earth. Gravity was simulated by two pneumatic pistons pulling downwards on a subject’s harness, with a force approximately equal to body weight on Earth. Four transducers, mounted under the treadmill, measured the three components of the reaction force exerted by the tread-belt under the foot. A high-speed video camera recorded the movements of limb segments while electromyography of four lower limb muscles was registered. Experiments <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> where conducted during European Space Agency parabolic flight campaigns. Control experiments were performed on the same subjects on Earth. When running on the treadmill with a SLS, the bouncing mechanism of running is preserved. Depending on the speed of progression, the ground reaction forces, contact and aerial times, muscular work and bone stress differed by a maximum of ± 5 - 15 % during running on the treadmill with a SLS, as compared to on Earth. The movements of the lower limb segments and the EMG patterns of the lower limb muscles were also comparable. Thus the biomechanics of running on Earth can reasonably be duplicated <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> using a treadmill with a SLS that generates a pull-down force close to body weight on Earth.

40|$|Human brain {{adaptation}} <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> {{follows the}} necessity to reshape the dynamic integration of the neural information acquired in the new environment. This basic aspect was here studied by the electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics where oscillatory modulations were measured during a visuo-attentional state preceding a visuo-motor docking task. Astronauts in microgravity conducted the experiment in free-floating aboard the International Space Station, before the space flight and afterwards. We observed stronger power decrease (∼ERD: event related desynchronization) of the ∼ 10 Hz oscillation from the occipital-parietal (alpha ERD) to the central areas (mu ERD). Inverse source modelling of the stronger alpha ERD revealed a shift from the posterior cingulate cortex (BA 31, from the default mode network) on Earth to the precentral cortex (BA 4, primary motor cortex) <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness.</b> We also observed significant contribution of the vestibular network (BA 40, BA 32, and BA 39) and cerebellum (lobule V, VI). We suggest that due to the high demands for the continuous readjustment of an appropriate body posture in free-floating, this visuo-attentional state required more contribution from the motor cortex. The cerebellum and the vestibular network involvement <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> might support the correction signals processing necessary for postural stabilization, and the increased demand to integrate incongruent vestibular information.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>weightlessness,</b> astronauts {{must rely}} on vision to remain {{spatially}} oriented. Although gravitational down cues are missing, most astronauts maintain a subjective vertical -a subjective sense of which way is up. This is evidenced by anecdotal reports of crewmembers feeling upside down (inversion illusions) or feeling that a floor has become a ceiling and vice versa (visual reorientation illusions). Instability in the subjective vertical direction can trigger disorientation and space motion sickness. On Neurolab, a virtual environment display system was used to conduct five interrelated experiments, which quantified: (a) how the direction of each person's subjective vertical depends on {{the orientation of the}} surrounding visual environment, (b) whether rolling the virtual visual environment produces stronger illusions of circular self-motion (circular vection) and more visual reorientation illusions than on Earth, (c) whether a virtual scene moving past the subject produces a stronger linear self-motion illusion (linear vection), and (d) whether deliberate manipulation of the subjective vertical changes a crewmember's interpretation of shading or the ability to recognize objects. None of the crew's subjective vertical indications became more independent of environmental cues <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness.</b> Three who were either strongly dependent on or independent of stationary visual cues in preflight tests remained so inflight. One other became more visually dependent inflight, but recovered postflight. Susceptibility to illusions of circular self-motion increased <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> The time to the onset of linear self-motion illusions decreased and the illusion magnitude significantly increased for most subjects while free floating <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness.</b> These decreased toward one-G levels when the subject 'stood up' <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> by wearing constant force springs. For several subjects, changing the relative direction of the subjective vertical in weightlessness-either by body rotation or by simply cognitively initiating a visual reorientation-altered the illusion of convexity produced when viewing a flat, shaded disc. It changed at least one person's ability to recognize previously presented two-dimensional shapes. Overall, results show that most astronauts become more dependent on dynamic visual motion cues and some become responsive to stationary orientation cues. The direction of the subjective vertical is labile in the absence of gravity. This can interfere with the ability to properly interpret shading, or to recognize complex objects in different orientations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Performing a {{surgical}} procedure <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness</b> {{has been shown}} not to be any more difficult than in a 1 g environment if the requirements for the restraint of the patient, operator, and surgical hardware are observed. The feasibility of performing a laparoscopic surgical procedure <b>in</b> <b>weightlessness,</b> however, has been questionable. Concerns have included the impaired visualization {{from the lack of}} gravitational retraction of the bowel and from floating debris such as blood. METHODS: In this project, laparoscopic surgery was performed on a porcine animal model <b>in</b> the <b>weightlessness</b> of parabolic flight. RESULTS: Visualization was unaffected due to the tethering of the bowel by the elastic mesentery and the strong tendency for debris and blood to adhere to the abdominal wall due to surface tension forces. CONCLUSIONS: There are advantages to performing a laparoscopic instead of an open surgical procedure in a weightless environment. These will become important as the laparoscopic support hardware is miniaturized from its present form, as laparoscopic technology becomes more advanced, and as more surgically capable crew medical officers are present in future long-duration space-exploration missions...|$|R
