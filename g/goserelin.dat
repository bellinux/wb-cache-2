25|$|In both sexes, the {{hypothalamus}} produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{to stimulate}} the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This in turn cause the gonads to produce sex steroids such as androgens and estrogens. In adolescents of either sex with relevant indicators, GnRH analogues such as <b>goserelin</b> acetate {{can be used to}} stop undesired pubertal changes for a period without inducing any changes toward the sex with which the patient currently identifies. GnRH agonists work by initially overstimulating the pituitary gland, then rapidly desensitizing it to the effects of GnRH. After an initial surge, over a period of weeks, gonadal androgen production is greatly reduced. Conversely, GnRH antagonists act by blocking the action of GnRH in the pituitary gland.|$|E
2500|$|GnRH {{action can}} be {{interrupted}} {{in one of}} two ways. GnRH antagonists such as abarelix and degarelix suppress the production of LH directly by acting on the anterior pituitary. GnRH agonists such as leuprolide and <b>goserelin</b> acetate suppress LH through the process of downregulation after an initial stimulation effect which can cause initial tumor flare. In order to prevent stimulation of tumor growth during the initial LH surge, an antiandrogen such as cyproterone acetate is prescribed a week before and three weeks after GnRH agonists are given. [...] Abarelix and degarelix are examples of GnRH antagonists, whereas the GnRH agonists include leuprolide, <b>goserelin,</b> triptorelin, and buserelin. Initially, GnRH agonists increase the production of LH. However, because the constant supply of the medication does not match the body's natural production rhythm, production of both LH and GnRH decreases after a few weeks.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, Charles B. Huggins {{published}} {{studies in which}} he used estrogen to oppose testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer. This discovery of [...] "chemical castration" [...] won Huggins the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The role of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in reproduction was determined by Andrzej W. Schally and Roger Guillemin, who both won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. GnRH receptor agonists, such as leuprolide and <b>goserelin,</b> were subsequently developed and used to treat prostate cancer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{combined}} {{formulation of}} bicalutamide and the [...] agonist <b>goserelin</b> in which <b>goserelin</b> is provided as a subcutaneous implant for injection and bicalutamide is included as 50 mg tablets for oral ingestion is marketed in Australia and New Zealand under {{the brand name}} ZolaCos CP (Zoladex-Cosudex Combination Pack).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Goserelin</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Zoladex, by AstraZeneca), or <b>goserelin</b> acetate, {{is a drug}} used to {{suppress}} production of the sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen), particularly {{in the treatment of}} breast and prostate cancer. It is an injectable gonadotropin releasing hormone superagonist (GnRH agonist), also known as a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goserelin</b> is {{administered}} by subcutaneous injection as an implant of 3.6mg or 10.8mg every 28 days {{for the duration of}} treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goserelin</b> acetate is used {{to treat}} hormone-sensitive cancers of the breast (in pre- and peri-menopausal women) and prostate, and some benign gynaecological {{disorders}} (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning). In addition, <b>goserelin</b> is used in assisted reproduction and {{in the treatment of}} precocious puberty. It may also be used in the treatment of male-to-female transgender people and is favoured above other anti-androgens in some countries, such as the UK. It is available as a 1-month depot and a long-acting 3-month depot.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Goserelin</b> acetate {{may cause}} a {{temporary}} increase in bone pain {{and symptoms of}} prostatic cancer {{during the first few}} weeks of treatment. This is known as the tumour flare effect, and is the result of an initial increase in luteinizing hormone production, before the receptors are desensitised and hormonal production is inhibited. The symptoms will disappear, with hormonal inhibition. It is therefore advisable to co-treat with an antiandrogen during the first 2-3 weeks of <b>goserelin</b> treatment, particularly in patients with pre-existing bone symptoms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goserelin</b> acetate {{stimulates the}} {{production}} of the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in a non-pulsatile (non-physiological) manner. This causes the disruption of the endogenous hormonal feedback systems, resulting in the down-regulation of testosterone and estrogen production.|$|E
50|$|Hormonal {{approaches}} to treatment {{have never been}} tested in proper trials. In the absence of proven benefit, therapy with progesterone, GnRh agonists (e.g., Lupron, <b>goserelin)</b> and tamoxifen are not routinely recommended. Doxycycline {{had no effect on}} the rate of lung function decline in a double blind trial.|$|E
50|$|Leuprorelin, {{along with}} {{triptorelin}} and <b>goserelin,</b> {{are often used}} to delay puberty in transgender youth until they {{are old enough to}} begin hormone replacement therapy. They are also sometimes used as superior alternatives to anti-androgens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate for suppressing testosterone production in trans women.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of pharmacology, a superagonist {{is a type of}} agonist that is capable of {{producing}} a maximal response greater than the endogenous agonist for the target receptor, and thus has an efficacy of more than 100%. For example, <b>goserelin</b> is a superagonist of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor.|$|E
50|$|GnRH {{action can}} be {{interrupted}} {{in one of}} two ways. GnRH antagonists such as abarelix and degarelix suppress the production of LH directly by acting on the anterior pituitary.

50|$|<b>Goserelin</b> {{may cause}} bone pain, hot flushes, headache, stomach upset, depression, {{difficulty}} urinating (isolated cases), weight gain, swelling and tenderness of breasts (infrequent), decreased erections and reduced sexual desire. Bone pain {{can be managed}} symptomatically, and erectile dysfunction can be treated by Levitra (Vardenafil) or other similar oral therapies, although they will not treat the reduced sexual desire.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goserelin</b> is a {{synthetic}} analogue of a naturally occurring luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). Bioavailability is almost complete. <b>Goserelin</b> is poorly protein bound {{and has a}} serum elimination half-life of two to four hours in patients with normal renal function. The half-life increases with patients with impaired renal function. There is no significant change in pharmacokinetics in subjects with liver failure. After administration, peak serum concentrations are reached in about two hours. It rapidly binds to the LHRH receptor cells in the pituitary gland thus leading to an initial increase in production of luteinizing hormone and thus leading to an initial increase {{in the production of}} corresponding sex hormones. This initial flare may be treated by co-prescribing/co-administering an androgen receptor antagonist such as bicalutamide (Casodex). Eventually, after a period of about 14-21 days, production of LH is greatly reduced due to receptor downregulation, and sex hormones are generally reduced to castrate levels.|$|E
50|$|GnRH {{agonists}} are synthetically {{modeled after}} the natural GnRH decapeptide with specific modifications, typically in position 6 (amino acid substitution), 9 (alkylation) and 10 (deletion). These substitutions inhibit rapid degradation. Agonists with two substitutions include: leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard), buserelin (Suprefact, Suprecor), histrelin (Supprelin LA, Vantas), <b>goserelin</b> (Zoladex), and deslorelin (Suprelorin, Ovuplant). The agents nafarelin (Synarel) and triptorelin are agonists with single substitutions at position 6.|$|E
5000|$|Castration {{consists}} of either medical castration with a [...] analogue or surgical castration via orchiectomy. [...] analogues include [...] agonists like leuprorelin or <b>goserelin</b> and [...] antagonists like cetrorelix. They are powerful antigonadotropins and work by abolishing the -induced secretion of gonadotropins, in turn ceasing gonadal production of sex hormones. Medical and surgical castration achieve {{essentially the same}} effect, decreasing circulating testosterone levels by approximately 95%.|$|E
50|$|Examples of GnRH {{agonists}} include leuprorelin (leuprolide) and <b>goserelin,</b> {{while an}} example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and bifluranol. Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and oxendolone.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{different}} medicines, LHRH agonists and antagonists, which both lower the amount of testosterone made by the testicles. They work inhibiting the formation of LH in the pituitary gland. The LHRH agonists produce a sudden increase on levels of testosterone followed by a huge falling, process called flare, whereas LHRH antagonists decrease directly the amount of testosterone. Some {{of the most common}} LHRH agonist and antagonist active substances are leuprolide, <b>goserelin,</b> triptorelin, histrelin and degarelix.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subcutaneous}} injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, {{the layer of}} skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively {{referred to as the}} cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering vaccines and medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and <b>goserelin.</b> Subcutaneous, as opposed to intravenous, injection of recreational drugs is referred to as [...] "skin popping". Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ, or subcut. Subcut is the preferred abbreviation for patient safety.|$|E

A {{combination}} formulation of bicalutamide and <b>goserelin</b> is marketed by AstraZeneca in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos-CP.|$|E
50|$|The most {{accepted}} way {{to treat}} PG is {{with the use of}} corticosteroids, i.e. prednisone; and/or topical steroids, i.e. clobetasol and betamethasone. Suppressing the immune system with corticosteroids helps by decreasing the number of antibodies attacking the skin. Treating PG can be difficult and can take several months. Some cases of PG persist for many years. In the post partum period, if necessary, the full range of immunosuppressive treatment may be administered for cases unresponsive to corticosteroid treatments, such as tetracyclines, nicotinamide, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, <b>goserelin,</b> azathioprine, dapsone, rituximumab, or plasmaphoresis, or intravenous immunoglobulin may sometimes be considered when the symptoms are severe.|$|E
50|$|Analogs of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{can be used}} {{to induce}} a {{chemical}} castration, that is, complete suppression of the production of estrogen and progesterone from the female ovaries, or complete suppression of testosterone production from the male testes. This is due to a negative feedback effect of continuous stimulation of the pituitary gland by these hormones. Leuprorelin and <b>goserelin</b> are GnRH analogs which are used primarily for the treatment of hormone-responsive prostate cancer. Because the initial endocrine response to GnRH analogs is actually hypersecretion of gonadal steroids, hormone receptor antagonists such as flutamide are typically used to prevent a transient boost in tumor growth.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of drugs}} {{commonly}} associated with depressogenic effects include some anticonvulsants such as the barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), vigabatrin, and topiramate, corticosteroids like dexamethasone and prednisone, cytokines like interferon-Î± and interleukin-2, certain antihypertensives such as amiodarone, clonidine, methyldopa, reserpine, and tetrabenazine (used as an antipsychotic/antihyperkinetic), and agents with antiandrogen, antiestrogen, and/or anti-neurosteroid activities such as GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide, <b>goserelin),</b> anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor), finasteride (a 5Î±-reductase inhibitor), and clomiphene (a SERM), {{as well as others}} including flunarizine, mefloquine, and efavirenz. Another notable agent is rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist marketed as an anti-obesity agent which was withdrawn shortly after its introduction due to the incidence of severe psychiatric side effects associated with its use including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.|$|E

50|$|Biologically active {{peptides}} {{have been}} {{integrated into a}} growing number of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIâ€™s) as well as standalone products such as vasopressin, gonadorelin, leuprolide, and <b>goserelin.</b> Completion of the human genome project resulted in the identification of approximately 30,000 proteins encoded in the human genome and provided many more new target molecules for biomedical researchers to explore. To investigate the possibility of increasing the native potency of a given peptide or protein using a rational design approach, small and large amounts of peptides are needed, Some in the milligram scale. Once a desired activity or potency is identified, larger scale synthesis is need. For this, gram to multi-gram scale may be needed in order to initiate small animal studies. Often, after successful validation, an even larger scale of synthesis may be desired. These can range in scale from hundreds of grams to multi-kilo amounts.|$|E
50|$|Antiandrogens and {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be prescribed to lower sex drive. Cyproterone acetate {{is the most}} commonly used antiandrogen, except in the United States, where it may not be available. A large body of literature has shown that it reduces general sexual fantasies. Side effects may include osteoporosis, liver dysfunction, and feminization. Case studies have found that the antiandrogen medroxyprogesterone acetate is successful in reducing sexual interest, but can have side effects including osteoporosis, diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, feminization, and weight gain. Some hospitals use leuprolide acetate and <b>goserelin</b> acetate to reduce libido, and while there is presently little evidence for their efficacy, they have fewer side effects than other antiandrogens. A number of studies support the use of SSRIs, which may be preferable over antiandrogens because of their relatively benign side effects. None of these drugs cure sexual fetishism, but they can make it easier to manage.|$|E
40|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the ongoing {{meta-analysis}} of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group will be updated to include additional data from over 4000 patients treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues, principally <b>goserelin.</b> Four major international trials {{are currently in}} progress to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <b>goserelin</b> {{in comparison with the}} current standard treatments in early breast cancer, which are chemotherapy or tamoxifen. This paper provides an outline of the protocols and main objectives of the Zoladex Early Breast Cancer Research Association (ZEBRA) trial (<b>goserelin</b> versus cyclophosphamide-methotrexate- 5 -fluorouracil [CMF]), the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC) trial (<b>goserelin</b> versus tamoxifen versus the combination of <b>goserelin</b> and tamoxifen versus no further treatment), the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) VIII trial (<b>goserelin</b> versus CMF versus CMF followed by <b>goserelin)</b> and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) /South Western Oncology Group (SWOG) trial (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin- 5 -fluorouracil [CAF] versus CAF followed by <b>goserelin</b> versus CAF followed by <b>goserelin</b> plus tamoxifen). Preliminary results are expected from the CRC trial in 1998 and from the ZEBRA and ECOG/SWOG trials in 1999. Results from the wide range of comparator regimens, treatment durations and patient subgroups investigated in these trials will greatly increase the clinical database and should help to define the optimum role for <b>goserelin</b> in the treatment of early breast cancer in premenopausal women...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Oncological {{results of}} {{radiotherapy}} for locally advanced prostate cancer (PC) are significantly improved by simultaneous application of LHRH analoga (e. g. <b>goserelin).</b> As 85 % of PC express LHRH receptors, we investigated {{the interaction of}} <b>goserelin</b> incubation with radiotherapy under androgen-deprived conditions in vitro. Methods LNCaP and PC- 3 cells were stained for LHRH receptors. Downstream the LHRH receptor, changes in protein expression of c-fos, phosphorylated p 38 and phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 were analyzed by means of Western blotting after incubation with <b>goserelin</b> and irradiation with 4 Gy. Both cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of <b>goserelin</b> in hormone-free medium. 12 h later cells were irradiated (0 â€“ 4 Gy) and after 12 h <b>goserelin</b> was withdrawn. Endpoints were clonogenic survival and cell viability (12 h, 36 h and 60 h after irradiation). Results Both tested cell lines expressed LHRH-receptors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{confirm the}} {{advantages}} of <b>goserelin</b> prior to endometrial ablation {{for the treatment of}} dysfunctional uterine bleeding. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study. PATIENT(S) : Cycling premenopausal women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. TREATMENT: Patients were randomized to <b>goserelin</b> or placebo (sham depot) once monthly for 2 months prior to endometrial ablation. Treatment was timed to allow surgery 6 weeks later on day 7 of the menstrual cycle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Amenorrhea rates, endometrial histology and thickness, pain and blood loss scores, and surgical parameters. RESULT(S) : At 24 weeks after surgery, significantly more <b>goserelin</b> than placebo patients experienced amenorrhea (40 % versus 26 %). Blood loss was reduced from baseline, but not different between the groups. At surgery, mean endometrial thickness was 1. 6 mm and 3. 4 mm for the <b>goserelin</b> and placebo groups, respectively, with significantly more atrophic glands and stroma in the <b>goserelin</b> group. Surgery was significantly shorter (by 22 %) and easier in the <b>goserelin</b> than in the placebo group, with a significantly lower median fluid absorption in the <b>goserelin</b> groups.
