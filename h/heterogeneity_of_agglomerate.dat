40|$|International audienceThis work {{describes}} the compaction <b>of</b> <b>agglomerated</b> and aggregated ceramic powders with {{special emphasis on}} the role of primary particle size. Discrete element simulations are used to model weakly bonded agglomerates as well as strongly bonded aggregates. Crushing tests are carried out to obtain the characteristic strength <b>of</b> single <b>agglomerate</b> and aggregate. Microstructure evolution and stress-strain curves indicate that aggregates undergo a brittle to plastic-like transition as particle size decreases below 50 nm. It is shown that <b>agglomerates</b> made <b>of</b> nanoparticles exhibit much greater strength than those made of micron-sized particles, with an approximately inverse linear relationship with primary particle size.

40|$|Problems {{related to}} the {{blending}} of a cohesive powder with a free flowing bulk powder are frequently encountered in the pharmaceutical industry. The cohesive powder often forms lumps or agglomerates which are not dispersed during the mixing process and are therefore detrimental to blend uniformity. Achieving sufficient blend uniformity requires that the blending conditions are able to break up agglomerates, which is often an abrasion process. This study {{was based on the}} assumption that the abrasion rate <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> determines the required blending time. It is shown that the kinetic energy density of the moving powder bed is a relevant parameter which correlates with the abrasion rate <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates.</b> However, aspects {{related to the}} strength <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> should also be considered. For this reason the Stokes abrasion number (St Abr) has been defined. This parameter describes the ratio between the kinetic energy density of the moving powder bed and the work of fracture <b>of</b> the <b>agglomerate.</b> The StAbr number is shown to predict the abrasion potential <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> in the dry-mixing process. It appeared possible to include effects of filler particle size and impeller rotational rate into this concept. A clear relationship between abrasion rate <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> and the value of StAbr was demonstrated. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Fluidization {{behavior}} of iron powder in N- 2 {{was investigated in}} detail under the fluidization gas velocity of 2 - 10 u(mfo) at 600 - 800 degrees C. Four types of fluidization behaviors, i. e., stable fluidization, agglomerating fluidization, gradual defluidization and fast defluidization, were expressly described and distinguished, instead of only two types (i. e., fluidization and defluidization) reported in the literature. Further investigation revealed that the occurrence {{of different types of}} fluidization behaviors was caused by the differences in the formation and growth <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> under different fluidization conditions.

Presence <b>of</b> drug <b>agglomerates</b> in a blend poses a potential safety risk in e. g. pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, agglomerates {{need to be}} removed. DESIGN AND METHODS This study assessed the critical process parameters and rules that must be observed when scaling up a mixing process. RESULTS Experiments using so-called brittle calibrated test particles provided evidence that agglomerates reduce in size via an abrasion mechanism. The abrasion rate is not only influenced by the (mechanical) properties <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> and process conditions, {{but also by the}} particle size distribution of the filler. A novel method to measure powder velocities enabled the development of a quantitative model that describes the relationships between powder motion during blending and agglomerate abrasion.

This paper studies nanoparticle fluidization by using adhesive CFD-DEM (Discrete Element Model) simulation, which includes an adhesive contact model having the ability to model the contact and bounce/stick between elastic-plastic and cohesive particles. The discrete elements represent the simple <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> nanoparticles. The effects of particle density, fluidizing gas velocity, and van der Waals force on gas-solid flow and agglomerate behaviors are investigated.

It has been shown that the mechanism of growth is poisoned by species adsorbed such as ions. Nevertheless, this new process proves very promising because it leads to a narrow size distribution of spheres by colloidal way, which can be subsequently consolidated by sintering, with a smooth surface...|$|R

The electrode <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> Pt nanoparticles was prepared by dispersing the agglomerates onto glassy carbon surface and is denoted as Pt-a(ag) /GC. The average size <b>of</b> the <b>agglomerates</b> in colloid {{and on the}} surface of electrode were characterized to be around 400 nm using TEM and SEM, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry and in situ FTIR spectroscopy were employed to study electrocatalytic properties of the Pt-a(ag) /GC electrode towards methanol oxidation. It has been revealed that the <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> Pt nanoparticles exhibit significant electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of CH 3 OH. In comparison with CH 3 OH oxidation on an electrode of Pt thin film supported on Au, the oxidation potential has been shifted negatively about 300 mV on the Pt-a(ag) /GC. The results demonstrated also that the oxidation of CH 3 OH is a complex process, which may be influenced by the diffusion of CH 3 OH and controlled by the oxidation-reduction <b>of</b> the <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> Pt nanoparticles on electrode surface. Linearly adsorbed CO species (COL) is the only intermediate that has been determined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The IR features Of COL illustrated that the <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> Pt nanoparticles exhibit abnormal infrared effects as other kind low-dimensional nanomaterial does...|$|R

Under accepted prerequisites, these extended free-volume defects can {{be associated with}} pseudogap holes at the interface between the outer surface layer <b>of</b> <b>agglomerated</b> nanoparticles and innermost layer of surrounding host matrix (as it was well outlined in [8, 9]). The bulk positron lifetime recalculated respectively to these components in full agreement to Equation  3 can be attributed to bulk positron lifetime <b>of</b> <b>agglomerated</b> nanoparticles. In case of highly monolith particles, this value tends towards bulk positron lifetime of corresponding substance, while in more loose media, it remains higher.

Physical mechanisms of interaction of nanoparticles with tumor cells will help to develop new methods for cancer disease treatment. Based on aluminum oxide phases, positively charged low-dimensional structures have different shape: <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> nanosheets, nameplates, cone-shaped nanoaggregates were synthesized with the help of aluminum nanoparticles. The cytotoxicity effect of these low-dimensional structures on A 549, HeLa, MDA, PyMT tumor cells was studied. It was shown that <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> nanosheets were more toxic for investigating cell lines. <b>Agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> nanosheets had a medium toxic effect at a concentration of 10 ?mg/ml while nameplates and cone-shaped nanoaggregates were nontoxic. The toxic effect <b>of</b> <b>agglomerates</b> <b>of</b> nanosheets correlates with their shape, mainly the presence of multiple edges...|$|R
