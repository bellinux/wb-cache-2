50|$|It {{has been}} seen in the Drosophila Melanogaster species that loss of microRNA-279 results in the {{formation}} of a CO2-sensory pathway. Regulation of miR-279 expression is partly by the pleiotropic transcription factor Prospero, and this appears to <b>indirectly</b> <b>restrict</b> CO2 neuron formation via miR-279. Further, there is direct inhibition through repression of the shared target genes nerfin-1 and escargot during olfactory development. In this way microRNA regulation of pleiotropic neural genes is likely {{to play a role in}} divergence of sensory systems, with nervous system divergence occurring with failed miR-regulation of genetic pathways.|$|R

40|$|The HOPS {{tethering}} complex facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by binding to Syntaxin 17, the autophagosomal SNARE. Here we {{show that}} loss of the core HOPS complex subunit Vps 16 A enhances autophagosome formation and slows down Drosophila development. Mechanistically, Tor kinase is less active in Vps 16 A mutants likely due to impaired endocytic and biosynthetic transport to the lysosome, a site of its activation. Tor reactivation by overexpression of Rheb suppresses autophagosome formation and restores growth and developmental timing in these animals. Thus, Vps 16 A reduces autophagosome numbers both by <b>indirectly</b> <b>restricting</b> their formation rate and by directly promoting their clearance.

This is true especially for low-skilled TFWs who {{are attached to}} a specific employer because of a <b>restricted</b> <b>work</b> permit. Highly skilled TFWs, some of whom may also hold a <b>restricted</b> <b>work</b> permit, likely operate in a different economic environment. As a result of globalization, multinational firms in many developed countries have lobbied governments to admit more of these high-skilled TFWs into the host country, arguing that these TFWs are necessary inputs to keep them competitive in the global market. Drawing on previous research, this study outlined three hypotheses regarding the labour market performance of five groups of TFWs during the years surrounding their transition to permanent residence. These hypotheses were tested using fixed-effects models and a large Canadian administrative dataset.|$|R

This study critiques the 'petroleum patriarchy' thesis, presented in Michael Ross's "Oil, Islam and Women" (2008), which claims that the structure of oil-rich economies directly limit the role of women in the paid workforce and thus also (<b>indirectly)</b> <b>restrict</b> women's representation in parliament. In particular, Part I raises questions about the empirical evidence used by Ross, especially the selection of case-studies, the specification of the econometric models, and the lack of direct evidence for cultural values. Part II develops multilevel models demonstrating that religious traditions have a greater influence on attitudes towards gender equality and sexual liberalization than either labor force participation or oil rents. Part III then shows the impact of these cultural attitudes on the proportion of women in legislative and ministerial office. The conclusion summarizes the main findings and considers their implications. ...|$|R

Five stages of information assessment and strategy development are used in this research which consists of verification for vibration limit on railway track structure, identification of limitation and strategy availability, strategies assessment and distinguish vibration related strategies, validation of the vibration related strategies and design of the vibration minimization strategies. The research was conducted in collaboration with Malaysia Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD) for the strategies assessment and strategy development. From the assessment and strategy development, the selected regulations have been assessed and selected according to type of <b>restricted</b> <b>work</b> and type of railway track structure. Based from the assessment, the selected vibration limit on railway track structure is 15 mm/s ppv for both continuous and intermittent vibration while only 10 mm/s is allowed on signalling and telecommunication infrastructure of the track.

40|$|AbstractLiver, {{pancreas}} and lung originate from the presumptive foregut in {{temporal and spatial}} proximity. This requires precisely orchestrated transcriptional activation and repression of organ-specific gene expression within the same cell. Here, we show distinct roles for the chromatin remodelling factor and transcriptional repressor Histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac 1) in endodermal organogenesis in zebrafish. Loss of Hdac 1 causes defects in timely liver specification and in subsequent differentiation. Mosaic analyses reveal a cell-autonomous requirement for hdac 1 within the hepatic endoderm. Our studies further reveal specific functions for Hdac 1 in pancreas development. Loss of hdac 1 causes the formation of ectopic endocrine clusters anteriorly to the main islet, as well as defects in exocrine pancreas specification and differentiation. In addition, we observe defects in extrahepatopancreatic duct formation and morphogenesis. Finally, loss of hdac 1 results in {{an expansion of the}} foregut endoderm in the domain from which the liver and pancreas originate. Our genetic studies demonstrate that Hdac 1 is crucial for regulating distinct steps in endodermal organogenesis. This suggests a model in which Hdac 1 may directly or <b>indirectly</b> <b>restrict</b> foregut fates while promoting hepatic and exocrine pancreatic specification and differentiation, as well as pancreatic endocrine islet morphogenesis. These findings establish zebrafish as a tractable system to investigate chromatin remodelling factor functions in controlling gene expression programmes in vertebrate endodermal organogenesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCardiomelic or heart–hand syndromes include {{congenital}} defects affecting {{both the}} forelimb and heart, suggesting a hypothesis where similar signals may coordinate their development. In {{support of this}} hypothesis, we have recently defined a mechanism by which retinoic acid (RA) signaling acts on the forelimb progenitors to <b>indirectly</b> <b>restrict</b> cardiac cell number. However, {{we still do not}} have a complete understanding of the mechanisms downstream of RA signaling that allow for the coordinated development of these structures. Here, we test the hypothesis that appropriate Fgf signaling in the cardiac progenitor field downstream of RA signaling is required for the coordinated development of the heart and forelimb. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that increasing Fgf signaling can autonomously increase cardiac cell number and non-autonomously inhibit forelimb formation over the same time period that embryos are sensitive to loss of RA signaling. Furthermore, we find that Fgf 8 a, which is expressed in the cardiac progenitors, is expanded into the posterior in RA signaling-deficient zebrafish embryos. Reducing Fgf 8 a function in RA signaling-deficient embryos is able to rescue both heart and forelimb development. Together, these results are the first to directly support the hypothesis that RA signaling is required shortly after gastrulation in the forelimb field to temper Fgf 8 a signaling in the cardiac field, thus coordinating the development of the heart and forelimb...|$|R
40|$|Finland, {{in spite}} of her small size, has {{developed}} rather diversified trade relationships with the industrialized countries. The main trade flows are to the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and to the Socialist countries in East Europe. Finland became an associate member of EFTA in July 1961 and in October 1973, after the expansion of EEC with England, Denmark and Ireland, negotiated specials trade arrangements with the EEC to secure her future trade relations. This arrangement is mainly for forest-based industries and agricultural exports and to avoid the tariff increases on exports from England and West Germany. With the Socialist countries, the trade is based on bilateral agreements which define the composition and volume of the trade for two to five years and therefore is relatively free from year to year fluctuations. Finland, unlike many of the industrialized countries, does not have any historical or colonial relationships with the Less Developed Countries (LDC). Neither has Finland any industries which are entirely based on imported raw materials from LDC's. Consequently, the volume of trade with LDC's has not developed as fast as in some developed countries. This study deals with the import restriction in Finland which originate in or are closely related to the protection of domestic agriculture and therefore directly or <b>indirectly</b> <b>restrict</b> imports from LDC's.

Apart from a detailed statistical description by gender, skills and branches, theoretical considerations explaining the development are also examined and tested in a preliminary way. Finally, the most important results and their challenges to the future labour market policy are emphasised again and discussed. The central outcome is neither the complaint of the eroding 'standard employment relationship' nor of its potential 'precariousness'; it is rather the requirement of increasing variability in employment relations due to rising employment participation of women (work-life-balance), mature aged workers, and persons with <b>restricted</b> <b>work</b> capacities. However, parallel to this development social risks are also spreading over the life course, especially the risk of great income volatility through multiple or long periods of unemployment, changing working times, obsolete skills or <b>restricted</b> <b>work</b> capacities due to ill health.
