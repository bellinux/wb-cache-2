I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell.|$|E

500|$|Author Karina Longworth {{notes that}} despite her [...] "high level of stardom" [...] for decades, Streep {{has managed to}} {{maintain}} a relatively normal personal life. Streep lived with actor John Cazale for three years until his death from lung cancer in March 1978. Streep said of his death, [...] "I didn't get over it. I don't want to get over it. No matter what you do, the pain is always there in some recess of your mind, and it affects everything that happens afterwards. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> assimilate the pain and go on without making an obsession of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Billington {{observes that}} [...] "The {{break-up}} with Vivien {{and the new}} life with Antonia {{was to have a}} profound effect on Pinter's personality and his work," [...] though he adds that Fraser herself did not claim to have influence over Pinter or his writing. In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's [...] literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that [...] "other people [...] had a shaping influence on [...] politics" [...] and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from [...] "an unhappy, complicated personal life... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life", so that [...] "a side of Harold which had always been there was somehow released. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see that in his work after No Man's Land , which was a very bleak play." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2016, Marvel {{confirmed}} that main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson / Quake, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Alphonso [...] "Mack" [...] MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe would be {{starring in the}} episode. Following the airing of the previous episode, executive producer Jed Whedon teased that [...] "Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire" [...] would explore the dynamic between Luna's Ghost Rider, Robbie Reyes, and Elias Morrow, his uncle, but would be [...] "pivoting from the storyline in the comics. We’re pulling the characters, the character names and the relationships, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> already feel that we’ve changed it. Those dynamics will be entirely different. We’re using them as inspiration." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con it was {{revealed}} that the series would be adapting the character of Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider during its fourth season, with the first eight episodes making up the opening [...] "pod" [...] of episodes for the season, subtitled Ghost Rider. That October, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the series' use of Reyes and his supporting characters and mythology was [...] "definitely pivoting from the storyline in the comics. We’re pulling the characters, the character names and the relationships, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> already feel that we’ve changed it. Those dynamics will be entirely different. We’re using them as inspiration." [...] Marvel soon revealed that the sixth episode of the season would be titled [...] "The Good Samaritan", and would tell the series' version of Reyes' origin story. It is written by executive producer Jeffrey Bell, with Billy Gierhart directing.|$|E

500|$|How {{the demonstrations}} became violent is unclear.Interviewer: 您认为事件的过程已经非常清楚了吗？ (Do {{you think the}} process of the riots has become clear?)Bovingdon: 不清楚，而且我觉得可以说很不清楚。 (No, it's not clear, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say it's much unclear.)}} Some say the police used {{excessive}} force against the protesters; the World Uyghur Congress quickly issued press releases saying that the police had used deadly force and killed [...] "scores" [...] of protesters. Kadeer has alleged that there were agents provocateurs among the crowds. Others claim that the protesters initiated the violence; for example, an Uyghur eyewitness cited by The New York Times said protesters began throwing rocks at the police. The government's official line was that the violence was not only initiated by the protesters, but also had been premeditated and coordinated by Uyghur separatists abroad. The local public security bureau said it found evidence that many Uyghurs had travelled from other cities to gather for the riot, and that they had begun preparing weapons two or three days before the riot.|$|E
500|$|... "Drunk in Love" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Detail and Jay-Z, who appears as the {{featured}} artist on the track. Production of the song was handled by Boots and Beyoncé as well as Detail. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] was recorded at Jungle City Studios and at Oven Studios in New York City. Detail approached Beyoncé with a beat he had created called [...] "Drunk" [...] inspired by different situations from being affected by alcohol. Beyoncé further helped {{in the production of}} the song, adding elements that Detail had missed. She and Jay-Z later free-styled their verses for the song and Timbaland contributed keyboards. J-Roc, Dre Moon, Brian Soko and Rasool Ricardo Diaz contributed to the production of the song. Elaborating on the conception of the song, Beyoncé said: [...] "We just kinda had a party. It was so great, because it wasn't about any ego, we weren't trying to make a hit record [...] we were just having fun...and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear that in the record." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, {{not the least of}} which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor". McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by The Daily Caller did not comment on the film.|$|E

500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, I said that because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E

2500|$|In her 2007 {{book tour}} Rowling further {{discussed}} the topic, stating [...] "It wasn't really exclusively that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{see in the}} Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love."

Goldsmith thought highly of Cameron, expressing {{the view that}} while he was generally [...] "cynical about politicians", he felt that Cameron was different.
