Using analysis of a well-preserved Early Bronze Age wooden container from Switzerland, we propose novel criteria for the identification of cereal residues.

On the other hand, S. oryzae was effectively controlled only at the two higher concentrations for the same exposure interval while progeny production was reduced only at 5 ppm. T. confusum was the least susceptible of the species tested. Additionally, for all species, mortality levels remained stable for the whole 8 -month testing period.

Multi-residue methods with selective sample treatment methodologies {{have been developed for}} this purpose. However, this review focuses not only on these common multi-residue methods but also on specific methodologies for the analysis of pesticides in grapes and by-products. Finally the limitations of multi-residue methods and future perspectives and trends <b>for</b> pesticide <b>residue</b> <b>analysis</b> in grapes are reviewed. JRC.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{usefulness}} of cryotrapping gas chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (GC-FTIR) <b>for</b> the <b>residue</b> <b>analysis</b> of the beta-agonists clenbuterol, mabuterol and salbutamol in bovine urine and tissues has been evaluated. It is {{demonstrated that the}} technique is able to detect and identify the trimethylsilyl derivatives of these compounds in urine and liver extracts of veal calves and cattle. The obtained limit of identification is approximately 1 nanogram per microliter extract injected on column which is equivalent to 2. 5 microgram per liter or kilogram of the original sample. It is anticipated that the technique may develop as a valuable method for univocal confirmation {{of the presence of}} residues, particularly in addition to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{each of the}} {{selected}} cocoa farms, two quadrats of 80  ×  80  m were marked. In each quadrat, five (5) core soil samples were collected randomly at depth 0 – 20  cm with a soil auger and put {{together to form a}} composite sample. The composite soil samples were well mixed and sub-samples taken. Two soil replicates were collected from each cocoa farm. These gave a total of 32 soil samples from the study area. All soil samples were kept in well-labelled sampling bags and transported to the laboratory for analysis. At the laboratory, the soil samples were oven–dried at 105  °C to constant weight and sieved using 2  mm nylon mesh. Sub-samples of the sieved soils were then taken <b>for</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|R
