5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker went {{to visit}} Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in <b>Gray,</b> <b>as</b> they both had an empirical approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful {{for the development of}} Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Born in Glasgow, Lamont {{attended}} the city's Woodside Secondary School and obtained {{a degree from}} the University of Glasgow.

5|$|While the {{delegations}} {{from the}} various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, Reginald, as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de <b>Gray</b> <b>as</b> archbishop. Some stories have Reginald's election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the papal curia. Another source, Gervase of Canterbury, has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray's election. A further story, from Roger of Wendover, states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and {{that only a few}} members of the cathedral chapter– the younger ones– participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.|$|E

25|$|Agaricus section Lepiota was {{originally}} published in 1797 by South African-born mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon.

In 1822, however, the influential Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries restricted Lepiota to white-spored, ringed agarics.|$|E
