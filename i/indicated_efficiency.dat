40|$|Engine {{efficiency}} is often controlled {{in an indirect way}} through combustion timing control. This requires a priori knowledge {{of where to}} phase the combustion jiff different operating points and conditions. With cylinder individual efficiency estimation, control strategies aiming directly at fuel consumption optimization can be developed. This paper presents a method to estimate <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> using the cylinder pressure trace as input. The proposed method is based on a heat release calculation that takes heat losses into account implicitly using an estimated, CAD resolved polytropic exponent. Experimental results from a multi-cylinder engine show that with this approach, the estimated efficiency error is within 5 % for all operating points tested. The final part of the paper is a discussion of how to use the efficiency estimation for feedback control. Different control concepts are presented as well as suggestions on how to handle the non-linear connection between combustion timing and <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} the {{alternative}} fuels which are being investigated at Ghent University. NOx emissions will occur at high engine loads and they are a constraint for power and efficiency optimization. The formation of NOx emissions is temperature dependent. Consequently, the heat transfer from the burning gases to the cylinder walls has to be accurately modelled if precise computer calculations of the emissions are wanted. Several engine heat transfer models exist but they have been cited to be inaccurate for hydrogen. We have measured the heat flux in a spark ignited engine with a commercially available heat flux sensor. This paper investigates the difference between the heat transfer of hydrogen and a fossil fuel, in this case methane. Measurements with the same indicated power output are compared and the effect of the heat loss on the <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> is investigated. The power output of hydrogen combustion is lowered by burning lean in contrast to using a throttle in the case of methane. Although the peak in the heat flux of hydrogen is 3 times higher compared to methane for a high engine power output, the <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> is only 3 % lower. The heat loss for hydrogen at a low engine load is smaller than that of methane which results in a higher <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The richness of the hydrogen-air mixture has a great influence on the heat transfer process in contrast to the in-cylinder mass in the case of methane...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{considered}} {{as the ideal}} power source for future vehicles, due to their high efficiency and low emissions. However, extensive use of fuel cells in light-duty vehicles {{is likely to be}} years away, due to their high manufacturing cost. Hydrogen-fueled, spark-ignited, homogeneous-charge engines offer a near-term alternative to fuel cells. Hydrogen in a spark-ignited engine can be burned at very low equivalence ratios, so that NO[sub x] emissions can be reduced to less than 10 ppm without catalyst. HC and CO emissions may result from oxidation of engine oil, but by proper design are negligible (a few ppm). Lean operation also results in increased <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> due to the thermodynamic properties of the gaseous mixture contained in the cylinder. The high effective octane number of hydrogen allows the use of a high compression ratio, further increasing engine efficiency. In this paper, a simplified engine model is used for predicting hydrogen engine efficiency and emissions. The model uses basic thermodynamic equations for the compression and expansion processes, along with an empirical correlation for heat transfer, to predict engine <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A friction correlation and a supercharger/turbocharger model are then used to calculate brake thermal efficiency. The model is validated with many 1345 experimental points obtained in a recent evaluation of a hydrogen research engine. The experimental data are used to adjust the empirical constants in the heat release rate and heat transfer correlation. The adjusted engine model predicts pressure traces, <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> and NO,, emissions with good accuracy over the range of speed, equivalence ratio and manifold pressure experimentally covered...|$|E

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engine (ICE) fuel efficiency is {{a balance between}} good <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> and mechanical efficiency. High <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> is reached with a very diluted air/fuel-mixture and high load resulting in high peak cylinder pressure (PCP). On the other hand, high mechanical efficiency is obtained with very low peak cylinder pressure as the piston rings and bearings {{can be made with}} less friction. This paper presents studies of a {{combustion engine}} which consists of a two stage compression and expansion cycle. By splitting the engine into two different cycles, high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) cycles respectively, it is possible to reach high levels of both indicated and mechanical efficiency simultaneously. The HP cycle is designed similar to today's turbo-charged diesel engine but with an even higher boost pressure, resulting in high PCP. To cope with high PCP, the engine needs to be rigid. The usage of higher piston ring tension and larger bearings are examples of measures to cope with higher PCP. These measures will cost in terms of friction. Hence, mechanical efficiency is not as good as other engine concepts with lower PCP. The low-pressure cycle on the other hand, uses a design more similar to current naturally aspirated (NA) spark ignited (SI) engines, but designed for even lower PCP. Because of this, the engine {{does not need to be}} as rigidly designed and the overall friction levels will be much lower. By combining these two engine philosophies, a total engine concept with both high indicated and mechanical efficiencies can be achieved.

40|$|A set of {{experiments}} and a simulation study are completed {{to quantify the}} effect of the piston crevice on engine efficiency. The simulation study breaks down the loss mechanisms on brake efficiency at different displacement volumes (300 - 500 cc) and compression ratios (8 - 20). Experiments focus on indicated efficiencies for a narrow range of compression ratios (9. 24 - 12. 57) with different piston crevice volumes. Piston crevice volume is increased in two steps by machining a groove into the piston top land, and is decreased by raising the top ring. <b>Indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> is measured at various loads (0. 4 - 1. 0 bar MAP), speeds (1500, 2000, 2500 rpm), and coolant temperatures (50 °C and 80 °C). All data points compared in this study are recorded at MBT timing with a relative air-fuel ratio ([gamma]) of 1. For the baseline case (CR = 9. 24, speed = 2000 rpm, coolant = 80 °C), increased crevice volume results in an <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> degradation of 0. 3 - 0. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3. This absolute decrease corresponds to a 1. 2 - 1. 5 % relative decrease for a 100 % increase in crevice volume; referenced to the control piston crevice modification. Decreasing crevice volume leads to a gain in <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 2. 3 - 3. 5 %-points per 1000 mm 3, which corresponds to a 6. 9 - 11. 8 % relative increase for a 100 % decrease in crevice volume; referenced to the control piston crevice modification. Results of the experimental investigation, when compared across compression ratio, engine speed, and coolant temperature, show that the crevice effect on efficiency is largely independent of these three parameters. Large gains from decreased piston crevice volume prompt renewed discussions on piston top land, top ring, and crown design. by Patrick M. Smith. Thesis: S.

40|$|Methanol is an {{alternative}} fuel offering a lower well-to-wheel CO 2 emission {{as well as a}} higher efficiency, given that the fuel is derived from biomass. In addition to reduced CO 2, methanol does not emit soot particles when combusted which is a great advantage when attempting to reduce NOX levels due to the effectively non-existing NOX-soot trade-off. The engine setup used was a Scania D 13 engine modified to run on one cylinder, utilizing a high compression piston with a rc of 27 : 1. This study analyzes the effects of four control parameters on gross <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the indicated specific emissions; CO, THC and NOX. The control parameters chosen in this work was common rail pressure (PRAIL), EGR, λ and CA 50, running at 6 bar IMEPG and 1200 rpm. The effects of the control parameters on performance and emissions was analyzed using a surface response method of the Box-Behnken type. Predictive mathematical models were obtained from regression analysis performed on the responses from the experiments. The highest gross <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> achieved was ∼ 53 %, when a high level of EGR was applied together with the combustion phasing set to its low level at CA 50 = 6 CAD ATDC. The control parameters influencing the CO emissions are λ and the interaction between PRAIL and λ, while THC is only controlled by PRAIL and EGR. NOX emissions was, as expected, influenced mainly by EGR and λ, although PRAIL and CA 50 also had minor effects. The effect of increased PRAIL, increased THC emissions which in its turn reduced the gross <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Throughout the experiment, THC concentration never decreased below ∼ 150 ppm due to utilization of high rc in combination with the volatility of methanol. It was also concluded that a rc = 27 is rather high if operation flexibility is required, especially at the higher load range...|$|E

These include {{the potential for}} extremely low NO{sub x} and particulate emissions while maintaining high thermal efficiency and not requiring the expensive high pressure injection system of the typical modem diesel engine. Using the HCT chemical kinetics code to simulate autoignition of methane-air mixtures, we have explored the ignition timing, burn duration, NO{sub x} production, <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> and power output of an engine with a compression ratio of 15 : 1 at 1200 and 2400 rpm. HCT was modified to include the effects of heat transfer. This study used a single control volume reaction zone that varies {{as a function of}} crank angle. The ignition process is controlled by varying the intake equivalence ratio and varying the residual gas trapping (RGT). RGT is internal exhaust gas recirculation which recycles both heat and combustion product species. It is accomplished by varying the timing of the exhaust valve closure. Inlet manifold temperature was held constant at 330 Kelvins.

40|$|A novel {{free piston}} expander-linear {{generator}} (FPE-LG) integrated unit was proposed to recover waste heat efficiently from vehicle engine. This integrated unit {{can be used}} in a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system and can directly convert the thermodynamic energy of working fluid into electric energy. The conceptual design of the free piston expander (FPE) was introduced and discussed. A cam plate and the corresponding valve train were used to control the inlet and outlet valve timing of the FPE. The working principle of the FPE-LG was proven to be feasible using an air test rig. The <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the FPE was obtained from the p–V indicator diagram. The dynamic characteristics of the in-cylinder flow field during the intake and exhaust processes of the FPE were analyzed based on Fluent software and 3 D numerical simulation models using a computation fluid dynamics method.

40|$|We {{have used}} the HCT (Hydrodynamics, Chemistry and Transport) {{chemical}} kinetics code to simulate HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition) combustion of methane-air mixtures. HCT is applied to explore the ignition timing, bum duration, NO x production, gross <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> and gross IMEP of a supercharged engine (3 atm. Intake pressure) with 14 : 1, 16 :l and 18 : 1 compression ratios at 1200 rpm. HCT has been modified to incorporate the effect of heat transfer and to calculate the temperature that results from mixing the recycled exhaust with the fresh mixture. This study uses a single control volume reaction zone that varies {{as a function of}} crank angle. The ignition process is controlled by adjusting the intake equivalence ratio and the residual gas trapping (RGT). RGT is internal exhaust gas recirculation which recycles both thermal energy and combustion product species.

40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) is a {{promising}} combustion concept with high thermodynamic efficiency and low emission level, {{and also with}} minimal modification of standard engine hardware. To use PPC in a production oriented engine, the optimal intake charge conditions for PPC {{should be included in}} the analysis. The experiments in this paper investigated and confirmed that the optimal intake conditions of net <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> for PPC are EGR between 50 % and 55 % as possible and the lambda close to 1. 4. Heat-transfer energy and exhaust gas waste-energy contribute to the majority of the energy loss in the engine.

The optimal EGR condition is around 50 % where the smallest energy loss is found as a trade-off between heat transfer and exhaust-gas enthalpy-waste. Lambda close to 1. 4 results from the trade-off of high gas-exchange efficiency with low lambda and high thermodynamic efficiency with high lambda. The optimal inlet charge condition was also applied to a multi-cylinder engine from low load to high load.

Several research groups have shown that a load range from idle to full load is possible, when using low-octane-number refinery streams, in the gasoline boiling range. As such refinery streams {{are not expected to}} be commercially available on the short term, the use of naphtha blends that are commercially available could provide a practical solution. The three blends used in this investigation have been tested in a single-cylinder engine for their emission and efficiency performance.

40|$|Gasoline {{partially}} premixed combustion (PPC) has {{the potential}} of high efficiency and simultaneous low soot and NOx emissions. Running the engine in PPC mode with high octane number fuels has the advantage of a longer premix period of fuel and air which reduces soot emissions. The problem is the ignitability at low load and idle operating conditions. In a previous study it was shown {{that it is possible to}} use NVO to improve combustion stability and combustion efficiency at operating conditions where available boosted air is assumed to be limited. NVO has the disadvantage of low net <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> due to heat losses from recompressions of the hot residual gases. An alternative to NVO is the rebreathing valve strategy where the exhaust valves are reopened during the intake stroke. The net <b>indicated</b> <b>efficiency</b> is expected to be higher with the rebreathing strategy but the question is if similar improvements in combustion stability can be achieved with rebreathing as with NVO. The results show that the rebreathing valve strategy has similar improvements on combustion stability as NVO when the same fuel injection strategy is used.
