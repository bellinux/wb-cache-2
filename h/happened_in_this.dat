25|$|However, by the 1930s, the {{neighborhood}} was hit hard by job losses in the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 1950. Several riots <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, including in 1935 and 1943.|$|E
25|$|In Middle and Eastern Finland, great {{amounts of}} tar were {{produced}} for export. European nations needed this {{material for the}} maintenance of their fleets. According to some theories, the spirit of early capitalism in the tar-producing province of Ostrobothnia may have been the reason for the witch-hunt wave that <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region during the late 17th century. The people were developing more expectations and plans for the future, and when these were not realized, they were quick to blame witches—according to a belief system the Lutheran church had imported from Germany.|$|E

25|$|As Maurice's {{forces were}} tied {{down in a}} war against the Persians caused by Justin II, (see Roman-Persian Wars for details), he could muster only a small army against the Avars and Slavs marauding in the Balkans. His efforts were {{hampered}} {{by the fact that}} operations in the Balkans were a completely defensive matter. As opposed to the Persian war theatre, the Balkan theatre provided little possibility for a soldier to bolster his pay by pillaging, thus making fighting rather unattractive. Maurice's badly motivated troops found it difficult to achieve even minor and local success. Rather an exception, a victory won by Comentiolus at Adrianople 584/585 deflected Slavic incursions to Greece. The evident destruction of vast parts of old Athens probably <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period.|$|E
500|$|Alice McKenzie was {{possibly}} a prostitute, and was murdered at about 12:40am on Wednesday 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. Like {{most of the}} previous murders, her left carotid artery was severed {{from left to right}} and there were wounds on her abdomen. However, her wounds were not as deep as in previous murders, and a shorter blade was used. Commissioner Monro and one of the pathologists examining the body, Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another of the pathologists, Phillips, and Robert Anderson disagreed, as did Inspector Abberline. Later writers are also divided, and either suggest that McKenzie was a Ripper victim, or that the unknown murderer tried {{to make it look like}} a Ripper killing to deflect suspicion from himself. At the inquest, Coroner Baxter acknowledged both possibilities, and concluded: [...] "There is great similarity between this and the other class of cases, which have <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> neighbourhood, and if the same person has not committed this crime, it is clearly an imitation of the other cases." ...|$|E

But thanks to the incomparable Jane Lynch, I can’t {{wait to see what}} trouble the character stirs up next." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV also enjoyed the boys' performance more than the girls', and gave the episode a mostly positive review, writing that it moved the series' storylines to [...] "a whole new level". She felt, however, that the episode [...] "didn't have nearly enough singing". Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that: [...] "So much <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> hour that the musical numbers, though enjoyable, were almost an afterthought." [...] Bierly favoured the girls' performance, and praised Morrison's acting, commenting: [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes.

In this case, it was even more strained. The crime charged in this case was actually an agreement to agree to do something in the future.

2500|$|The ovoid {{profile of}} the dome {{has been the subject}} of much {{speculation}} and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each [...] across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola with Giorgio Vasari appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed Giacomo della Porta who was to be assisted by Domenico Fontana. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.|$|E

As often <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> age before modern communications, numerous physicists, scientists, and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale; among them were Pehr Elvius, the secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (which had an instrument workshop) and with whom Linnaeus had been corresponding; [...] Daniel Ekström, the instrument maker; and Mårten Strömer (1707–1770) who had studied astronomy under Anders Celsius.|$|E

People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down." [...] As a result, the grounds crew piled snow on his reserved seat the following game, and topped it with a sign that said [...] "This seat reserved for non-wusses".|$|E
2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. [...] Rothenberg said he {{would have done the same}} had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work.|$|E

The lawyer refused to give these documents, calling the demand [...] "ironic" [...] since Razack's report on systemic racism was the only report whose validity was being questioned, and for which supporting evidence was requested, which Anand claimed was a result of systemic racism. The Department of Justice lawyer who made the request, Barnand Brukney, expressed his impression that racism had {{very little to do with}} how the Canadian government handled the Air India Flight 182, telling Razack in court that she [...] "really [...] know what <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case."
