40|$|The {{so-called}} Common Principal Components (CPC) Model, {{in which}} the covariance matrices Σi of m populations are assumed to have identical eigenvectors, was introduced by Flury (1984), who develops Gaussian parametric inference methods for this model (Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation and Gaussian likelihood ratio testing). A key result in that context is the joint asymptotic normality of the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimators of the common eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues. Flury’s derivation of that result {{is based on a}} soft argument and is valid under Gaussian (hence, also <b>homokurtic)</b> con-ditions only. In this paper, we provide a formal proof of the same result under more general assumptions of elliptical, possibly heterokurtic, densities with finite fourth-order moments. This allows for a pseudo-Gaussian solution to all inference problems about eigenvectors and eigenvalues in CPC models. As an application, we consider inference about the proportion of total variance explained by a given subset of common principal components. More pre-cisely, we test the null hypothesis H 0 that this proportion is smaller than some fixed value p 0 ∈ (0, 1) in each population. Based on our result, we provide a pseudo-Gaussian tes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} optimal {{testing procedures}} for the mm-sample null hypothesis of Common Principal Components (CPC) under possibly non-Gaussian and heterogeneous elliptical densities. We first establish, under very mild assumptions {{that do not require}} finite moments of order four, the local asymptotic normality (LAN) of the model. Based on that result, we show that the pseudo-Gaussian test proposed in Hallin et al. (J. Nonparametr. Stat. 22 (2010) 879 – 895) is locally and asymptotically optimal under Gaussian densities, and show how to compute its local powers. A numerical evaluation of those powers, however, reveals that, while remaining valid, this test is poorly efficient away from the Gaussian. Moreover, it still requires finite moments of order four. We therefore propose rank-based procedures that remain valid under any possibly heterogeneous m-tuple of elliptical densities, irrespective of the existence of any moments. In elliptical families, indeed, principal components naturally can be based on the scatter matrices characterizing the density contours, hence do not require finite variances. Those rank-based tests, as usual, involve score functions, {{which may or may not}} be associated with a reference density at which they achieve optimality. A major advantage of our rank tests is that they are not only validity-robust, in the sense of surviving arbitrary elliptical population densities: unlike their pseudo-Gaussian counterparts, they also are efficiency-robust, in the sense that their local powers do not deteriorate away from the reference density at which they are optimal. We show, in particular, that in the <b>homokurtic</b> case, their normal-score version uniformly dominates, in the Pitman sense, the aforementioned pseudo-Gaussian generalization of Flury’s test. Theoretical results are obtained via a nonstandard application of Le Cam’s methodology in the context of curved LAN experiments. The finite-sample properties of the proposed tests are investigated via simulations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{assumption}} of homogeneity of covariance matrices {{is the fundamental}} prerequisite {{of a number of}} classical procedures in multivariate analysis. Despite its importance and long history, however, this problem so far has not been completely settled beyond the traditional and highly unrealistic context of multivariate Gaussian models. And the modified likelihood ratio tests (MLRT) that are used in everyday practice are known to be highly sensitive to violations of Gaussian assumptions. In this paper, we provide a complete and systematic study of the problem, and propose test statistics which, while preserving the optimality features of the MLRT under multinormal assumptions, remain valid under unspecified elliptical densities with finite fourth-order moments. As a first step, the Le Cam LAN approach is used for deriving locally and asymptotically optimal testing procedures ϕf(n) for any specified m-tuple of radial densities f=(f 1,…,fm). Combined with an estimation of the m densities f 1,…,fm, these procedures can be used to construct adaptive tests for the problem. Adaptive tests however typically require very large samples, and pseudo-Gaussian tests–namely, tests that are locally and asymptotically optimal at Gaussian densities while remaining valid under a much broader class of distributions–in general are preferable. We therefore construct two pseudo-Gaussian modifications of the Gaussian version ϕN(n) of the optimal test ϕf(n). The first one, ϕN∗(n), is valid under the class of <b>homokurtic</b> m-tuples f, while the validity of the second, ϕN†(n), extends to the heterokurtic ones, that is, to arbitrary m-tuples of elliptical distributions with finite fourth-order moments. We moreover show that these tests are asymptotically equivalent to modified Wald tests recently proposed by Schott [J. R. Schott, Some tests for the equality of covariance matrices, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 94 (2001) 25 – 36]. This settles the optimality properties of the latter. Our results however are much more informative than Schott’s. They also allow for computing local powers, and for an ANOVA-type decomposition of the test statistics into two mutually independent parts providing tests against subalternatives of scale and shape heterogeneity, respectively, thus supplying additional insight into the reasons why rejection occurs. Reinforcing a result of Yanagihara et al.  [H. Yanagihara, T. Tonda, C. Matsumoto, The effects of nonnormality on asymptotic distributions of some likelihood ratio criteria for testing covariance structures under normal assumption, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 96 (2005) 237 – 264], we further show why another approach, based on bootstrapped critical values of the Gaussian MLRT statistic, although producing asymptotically valid pseudo-Gaussian tests, is highly unsatisfactory in this context. We also develop optimal pseudo-Gaussian tests for scale homogeneity and for shape homogeneity, based on the same methodology. Finally, the small-sample properties of the proposed procedures are investigated via a Monte-Carlo study...|$|E
