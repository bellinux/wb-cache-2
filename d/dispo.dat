40|$|ML {{supports}} {{references to}} objects through mutable ref cells: A program {{can create a}} ref cell from an object, and subsequently replace the object accessible through the cell by another. Unfortunately, ref cells, when compared to mechanisms for handling mutable data in other programming languages, impose awkward restrictions on programming style. Moreover, introducing ref cells into a program after the fact requires pervasive changes. This paper proposes a language extension to ML with pointers, a safe mechanism for dealing with mutable objects. The extension avoids the style and maintenance problems inherent in the ref cell mechanism. Modern programming languages such as Java, Scheme, and ML, use "safety" as an advertisement: A program cannot crash the system by dereferencing an invalid address.

40|$|Many of the {{earliest}} business and administrative letters written in English fol lowed {{a set of rules}} called the ars dictaminis, a formal and complex model that prescribed a certain writing style and organization. The necessary pattern of organization was the following: address, salutation, notification, exposition, <b>dispo</b> sition, valediction, and attestation and date. The dictamen almost completely dis appears in the sixteenth century. Did the dictamen disappear suddenly? If so, why? In this paper, I argue that the dictamen disappeared slowly by attrition over the hundred years previous, and further, that it was never universal, as previous scholars have argued. The evidence for the claim that the dictamen was widely used and suddenly disappeared consists mostly of Chancery and government docu ments. When we take into account the mass of business documents involving ordi nary business people, including the largest surviving collection of business docu ments in English before 1500, the Cely papers, we see that by the late fifteenth century, ordinary business people were not following the dictamen's conventions...|$|E

40|$|One must {{consider}} both trait and state affect to predict {{individual differences in}} emotional processing. The present results document a novel trait–state interaction {{that is consistent with}} proposals concerning the epistemic functions of affect (A. R. Damasio, 1994). Four studies tested the effects of extraversion and mood on motivation-relevant processing. Study 1 measured naturally occurring mood, whereas Studies 2 – 4 manipulated mood. Extraverts were faster to link events to their personal motivations when in a positive mood state, whereas introverts were faster to do so in a neutral or negative mood state. Further findings indicate that this interaction affects attitude accessibility rather than event elaboration. Overall, the authors suggest that there are pragmatic benefits to trait-consistent moods, particularly for processing motivation-relevant stimuli. Psychologists know a good deal about the effects of personality traits (Derryberry, 1987) and mood states (Niedenthal & Setterlund, 1994) on emotional processing but comparably little about how traits and states interact. In the present article, we provide support for a new cognitive model of Trait State interactions, one that is based on the information provided to individuals from both their enduring <b>dispo...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of the {{observable}} impacts of rapidly growing urbanization {{and economic development}} in emerging cities of developing nations is witnessed in drainage problems connected to poor sanitation. The objectives of this research are to examine the causes and extent of damage on drainage and poor sanitation systems in urban areas, highlight measures to improve health and living conditions of the residents, and propose measures to improve the economic functioning of the cities. Six (6) Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Lagos State, Southwest Nigeria were selected. The descriptive cross-sectional study identified 50 respondents from each LGA through careful selection. Data were collected through validated questionnaire, thorough observations and interviews with residents. The result of the investigation shows that ineffective drainage systems are basically associated with poor maintenance, indiscriminate dumping of refuse in drains, erection of building on drainage channels and alignments that inhibit {{the flow of water}} which leads to critical environmental hazards. The study suggests new approach {{that could be used to}} achieve sustainable and effective sanitation which would support government’s effort in upgrading urban services by preparing plans and feasibility studies, improving drainage maintenance procedures and effectively manage human waste <b>dispo...</b>|$|E
40|$|Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important switching technologies for future optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks and the Internet. The model of differentiated services has been proposed to support quality of service (QoS) in the IP-based Internet. It is also very important to have differentiated service support in OBS networks. When the burst scheduling in an OBS network is set up appropriately, network can support differentiated services. In this paper, we proposed a new burst scheduling scheme, called differentiated scheduling with identical priority offset time (DSIPO). In DSIPO, the same priority offset time is used for all the bursts destined to the same edge node regardless of their priorities. Differentiated services in terms of burst loss probability are achieved by processing the control packets of higher priority class bursts, thus reserving resources for their data bursts, more promptly upon their arrival than those of lower priority class bursts. Each intermediate (core) node can adjust the burst loss probabilities of various burst classes by choosing its own differentiated processing delay value for each priority class or its own differentiated processing delay difference value between any pair of adjacent priority classes. We model and analyse DSIPO in terms of the burst loss probability for each priority class with simulation validation. The performance of <b>DISPO</b> is evaluated by simulation...|$|E

This {{old adage}} {{illustrates}} {{the importance of}} scientific communication; essential to research, it also represents a strategic sector for each country’s competitiveness. An often-neglected topic, scientific communication is of vital importance, with new information technologies accelerating and profoundly changing how knowledge is disseminated. The necessity of optimally disseminating experts’ findings has also become crucial to researchers, institutes and universities alike, which has prompted the recent advent of Impact Factors for the evaluation and financing of research, the goal being for scientific knowledge to be equally distributed to a very broad audience, especially to the media, entrepreneurs and sociopolitical players. This handbook presents the “golden rules” for publishing scientific articles. In order {{to do away with}} major recurring errors, the author explains how to easily structure an article and offers support for the typical mistakes made by most scientists, tips on how to make the style more academic of more general to fit your intended readership and, in the book’s closing section, suggests new publishing techniques of the Internet age such as the micro-article, which allows researchers to focus their findings into a single innovative point.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{continuously}} regenerating absorbent recovering solvent from an effluent air stream, {{in which the}} solvent-containing absorbent is supplied to a desorber, and contacted by stripping gas to remove the solvent. The solvent-saturated stripping gas {{is fed to a}} vapour permeation module forming solvent-enriched permeate and a retentate stream with solvent-depleted stripping gas, the latter being re-supplied to the desorption unit via a closed circuit. In the permeate stream from the permeation module, a reduced pressure source follows and is transferred, via the vapour permeation module, into the feed stream. A condensation stage occurs in the permeate stream followed by a portion of solvent-depleted stripping gas being locked-out. The remaining solvent-depleted stripping gas is introduced into the retentate stream. Preferably the locked out fraction of solvent-depleted stripping gas from the condensation stage is supplied to the solvent-saturated effluent air stream, or is <b>dispo</b> sed of via an adsorption unit. A separator, partly in fluid form, follows the source of low pressure leading back to an intermediate condensate vessel. The gas stream leaving this stage is sent to the stripping gas-stream and saturated with solvent before entering the vapour permeation module. The gas stream leaving the condensate stage is at least partially sent to the retentate stream after the vapour permeation module. The vapour permeation module has a membrane exhibiting a selectivity between solvent and stripping gas not more than 10; preferably exceeding 30. Stripping gas is heated before or in the desorption unit and before arriving at the vapour permeation module, is cooled. The stripping gas being steam, air or inert gas. USE - To regenerate a solvent absorbent. ADVANTAGE - The process regenerates continuously and efficiently, increasing the absorption and/or the achievable throughput for given recovery. The quantity of stripping gas needing to be sent to the condensing unit is reduced, with reduced process cost implications.
