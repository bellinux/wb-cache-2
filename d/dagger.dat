5|$|A long, straight-bladed <b>dagger</b> (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a <b>dagger</b> with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed <b>dagger.</b> This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the <b>Dagger,</b> ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the <b>Dagger,</b> leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} <b>Dagger.</b> The Prince refuses and stabs the hourglass with the <b>Dagger.</b> Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the <b>Dagger</b> and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the <b>Dagger</b> to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E

5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun <b>Dagger</b> of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a <b>dagger</b> of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a <b>dagger</b> can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun <b>Dagger</b> site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun <b>Dagger</b> site.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating <b>dagger</b> illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the <b>dagger,</b> the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{concentration of}} bronze <b>daggers</b> {{is found in}} the Geum River valley of South Chungcheong province. Away from this area, the <b>daggers</b> become progressively fewer. This appears to indicate that most <b>daggers</b> were produced in the Geum valley, and the other cultures of the peninsula acquired them primarily by trade. Trade also took place by sea, with artifacts from the Later Phase found in Japanese archeological sites as well.|$|R

When Brodie and Zakk try to steal the album, <b>Daggers</b> wakes up and attacks. When he hears a noise in his house, he hands them the record and tells them to run away.

5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the <b>Dagger</b> of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the <b>Dagger</b> to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set in Persia during the 9th century AD, and begins with the Prince narrating to an unseen {{listener}} about his adventures. The Prince and the army of his father Shahraman are passing through India to visit the Sultan of Azad. The Vizier of a local Maharaja, wanting to prevent his death using a substance known as the Sands of Time, entices them into attacking the Maharaja's palace, where the Sands are stored. During the fight, the Prince loots an artefact called the <b>Dagger</b> of Time, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah is taken {{as a gift for}} the Sultan of Azad. Visiting Azad, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, turning everyone but the Prince, the Vizier and Farah (protected by the <b>Dagger,</b> a staff and an amulet respectively) into sand creatures. The Vizier attempts to seize the <b>Dagger</b> from the Prince, but he escapes and eventually allies with Farah to undo the damage he has caused and prevent the Sands from covering the world, even though he has doubts about her loyalties and motives.|$|E
