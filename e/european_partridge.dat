40|$|Perdix perdix (Linnaeus) 1758 Other vernacular names: Bohemian partridge, English partridge, <b>European</b> <b>partridge,</b> Hungarian partridge, Hun, Hunkie Range: Native to Europe and Asia but {{introduced}} into North America and now widely established in southern Canada {{and the northern}} United States (see distribution map). The North American population was probably derived from stock representing several different geographic races...|$|E
50|$|In 1936 the Tasmanian Game Protection and Acclimatisation Society, {{assisted}} by the Animals and Birds Protection Board, imported 110 <b>European</b> grey <b>partridges</b> to Tasmania from England, {{at a cost}} of £150. These were liberated with Tasmania at Smooth Island, Marrawah, Whiteford and Colebrook. By 1950, these birds had disappeared. The <b>European</b> grey <b>partridge</b> is not established anywhere in Australia, at present.|$|R
25|$|For {{aboriginal}} {{peoples and}} later <b>European</b> settlers, <b>Partridge</b> Island {{was an important}} sea link {{to other parts of}} Nova Scotia because of its location at one of the narrowest points on the Minas Basin. The Mi'kmaq name for the settlement at Partridge Island was Awokum, which means crossing-over point or short cut. In the 1730s, two French settlers, John Bourg and Francis Arseneau, operated a ferry service that crossed the basin from Partridge Island.|$|R
50|$|Victoria {{allows the}} hunting of many game species. These include stubble quail, pheasants, <b>partridges,</b> <b>European</b> quail, California quail, Pacific black duck, grey teal, hardhead, Australian shelduck, pink-eared duck, Australian wood duck, {{chestnut}} teal, Australasian shoveller, hog deer, red deer, sambar deer and fallow deer.|$|R
50|$|Flora of the Ortobene include mostly holm oaks, while {{wildlife}} include Sardinian wild boar, weasel, marten, garden dormouse, Sardinian fox, <b>European</b> hare, Barbary <b>partridge,</b> {{great and}} lesser spotted woodpecker, Eurasian jay, blue rock-thrush, wood pigeon, Dartford warbler, goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, peregrine falcon and golden eagle.|$|R
50|$|The grey {{francolin}} (formerly {{also called}} the grey partridge, but {{not to be confused}} with the <b>European</b> grey <b>partridge)</b> Francolinus pondicerianus is a species of francolin found in the plains and drier parts of South Asia. They are found in open cultivated lands as well as scrub forest and their local name of teetar is based on their calls, a loud and repeated Ka-tee-tar...tee-tar which is produced by one or more birds. The term teetar can also refer to other partridges and quails. During the breeding season calling males attract challengers and decoys were used to trap these birds especially for fighting.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is known}} for a diverse forging and prey species, {{including}} rabbit, wolf, wild boar, fox and badger; migratory and endemic birds, such as bee-eaters, tit, owl, cuckoo, lark, Eurasian jay, common blackbird, lesser kestrel, red-legged <b>partridge,</b> <b>European</b> goldfinch, stock doves, hoopoe, dove (Streptopelia), typical warbler and nightingale; while the rivers are stocked with eel, carp and trout.|$|R
5000|$|Flora of {{the canyon}} {{consists}} of centuries-old olive (Olea europaea), wallnut (Juglans [...] ), common fig (Ficus carica), plane tree (Platanus), laurel (Laurus), red pine (Pinus resinosa) and diverse shrub species. Fauna observed in the canyon area are Indian crested porcupine, hare, jackal, fox, wild boar and the bird species <b>partridge,</b> <b>European</b> turtle dove, common blackbird and quail.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the haplotype diversity represented by the sequences of the control region in the mitochondria in Danish partridges identified signals of population expansion {{as was the case}} in other <b>European</b> grey <b>partridges.</b> Based on this genetic {{analysis of}} the Danish recent and historical grey partridges together with previously analysed grey partridges from Germany, Poland, Hungary, France and Italy, it is hypothesized that the timing of the Grey partridge population expansions up through western Europe and the following dispersal of the grey partridge from the last LGM refugium in the French Pyrenees might be explained by the origin and spread of agriculture through Europe i. e. “following the plough”...|$|R
5000|$|The Europeans v Indians matches {{were the}} idea of Buchi Babu Naidu of the Madras United Club (MUC) and Percival Partridge of the Madras Cricket Club (MCC). The MCC, at the time, was an {{exclusively}} white organisation and the MUC was founded by Buchi Babu as a similar cricket club for the Indians. Shortly before the first match Buchi Babu, who was to captain the Indian side, {{died of a heart}} attack. The match still went ahead, mainly because of the efforts of B.Subramaniam, an assistant of Buchi Babu. The Indian side was captained by BS Ramulu Naidu and the <b>Europeans</b> by <b>Partridge.</b> This [...] "Presidency Hindus" [...] and [...] "Presidency Europeans" [...] match was played between 29 December 1908 and 1 January 1909. It was abandoned because of rain without the first innings being completed.|$|R
40|$|Count {{data were}} {{collected}} from available studies on the <b>European</b> grey <b>partridge</b> (Perdix perdix) populations with at least 3 years of consecutive data. According to habitat characteristics, the period of study and the management practice the data were combined in two main subsets: the British populations from 1930 {{to the end of the}} 1960 ’s and the “declining ” continental populations from 1970 to the present. The latter populations are located in areas where the traditional landscape has been severely modified by important changes in agricultural practices. The goal of this work is: (a) to compare demographies of the two sets of populations; (b) to design and calibrate a stochastic demographic model on the basis of available data; (c) to use it to assess the risk of extinction under different management alternatives; (d) to test some of the most credited hypotheses on the grey partridge decline. Population dynamics are investigated via regression analyses of different factors on demographic rates. Spring-to-summer rate of increase and autumn to winter survival are shown to be density dependent in both UK and continental populations. Over-winter losses in UK prior to 1970 are positively correlated with the young-to-adult ratio, suggesting an important role of dispersal. Reproduction and survival rates were systematically larger in the traditional UK populations. Based on the regressions, stochastic demographic models were then built to assess the probability of extinction under various harvesting and management conditions, and the possibility of developing conservative hunting strategies. The stochastic modelling confirms that the UK populations prior to 1970 were intrinsically much more resilient than the continental populations in recent decades...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} game birds {{introduced}} to the North American continent only two, the <b>European</b> or Hungarian <b>partridge,</b> Perdix perdix, and the ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, have been successful thus far. Recent introductions of the chukar partridge, Alectoris graeca, also show promise of being successful. The {{pros and cons of}} animal introductions have been discussed in a number of papers. It is definitely true that rabbits in Australia, starlings in America and the mongoose in Hawaii have become pests. But the garre birds introduced in North America cannot fairly be classed as pests; they have been welcomed {{in a number of states}} and provinces; actually partridges and pheasants have completely altered the hunting picture in many areas, and it is difficult to realize the amount of hunting left if these birds were removed. King (1942), although generally opposed to the introduction of the partridge and the pheasant in America, mentions that probably 90 percent of the upland bird shooting in Oregon is produced by the partridge and pheasant; and the importance of the pheasant as a game bird in the cornbelt needs no elaboration...|$|R
