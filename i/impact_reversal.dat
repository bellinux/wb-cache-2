Cocaine-targeted prefrontal {{systems have}} been consistently associated with reinforcement learning and reversal deficits, but more recent interspecies research has raised awareness about {{the contribution of the}} cerebellum to cocaine addiction and reversal. We aimed at investigating the link between cocaine use, reversal learning and prefrontal, insula and cerebellar gray matter in cocaine-dependent individuals (CDIs) varying on levels of cocaine exposure in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). Twenty CDIs and 21 HCs performed a probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT) and were subsequently scanned in a 3 -Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. In the PRLT, subjects progressively learn to respond to one predominantly reinforced stimulus, and then must learn to respond according to the opposite, previously irrelevant, stimulus-reward pairing. Performance measures were errors after reversal (reversal cost), and probability of maintaining response after errors. Voxel-based morphometry was conducted to investigate the association between gray matter volume in the regions of interest and cocaine use and PRLT performance. Severity of cocaine use correlated with gray matter volume reduction in the left cerebellum (lobule VIII), while greater reversal cost was correlated with gray matter volume reduction in a partially overlapping cluster (lobules VIIb and VIII). Right insula/inferior frontal gyrus correlated with probability of maintaining response after errors.

Analysis of cortical activity patterns revealed that auditory cortex implements a map of spatially clustered neuronal ensembles, detecting specific combinations of spectral and intensity modulation features. Comparing different models, we show that cortical responses result from multi-layered nonlinearities, which, contrary to standard receptive field models of auditory cortex function, build divergent representations of sounds with similar spectral content, but different temporal structure...|$|R

If this is the case, the tradables sector and the current account surplus will continue to grow even when the US deficit closes.

The thesis focuses on four different HF injection sensorless methods, which utilize resistance and inductance based saliencies for position estimation: the measurement axis method, the eddy current resistance based saliency tracking method, the eddy current inductance based saliency tracking method, and the PWM switching frequency injection method. The emphasis is in the comparison of the four HF saliency tracking methods under various conditions such as steady state, load <b>impact,</b> speed <b>reversal,</b> and zero and low speed operation. The amplitude and frequency of the injection signals are also compared to choose the best HF injection signal for the four saliency tracking methods. The best sensorless control method using eddy current resistance based saliency is introduced and the experimental results confirm the expected advantages for this sensorless application. This thesis also describes the development and enhancement of current derivative measurement for saliency tracking methods, which uses the stator current transient response to the voltage vectors contained in the fundamental PWM sequence. Due to the HF switching oscillations caused by the switching of the IGBT and parasitic capacitance, {{the accuracy of the}} current measurement is reduced and requires a minimum vector time of approximately 6 µs.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the contribution of VTA and Nacc cells in reversal learning performance by using two approaches. First, inhibition of VTA and Nacc cells using a Gaba-a agonist (Muscimol). Second, inhibition of VTA and Nacc cells using light-sensitive opsins (halorhodopsin). The prediction from this investigation was that neuronal suppression of Nacc neurons would have a greater <b>impact</b> on <b>reversal</b> learning performance than suppression of VTA cells, as task complexity increased. Methods: Rats (Muscimol group) (n = 15) were implanted with bilateral guide cannulae above the VTA and Nacc. Another group of rats (n = 15) received injections of lentivirus (halorhodopsin) in the VTA and Nacc, and were implanted with a fiber guide system that would deliver a yellow light to target neurons via an optical fiber. After surgery, rats were trained to complete an FR 1 discrimination, and then tested in a between reversal and a within session reversal task. Results: VTA (n = 5) and Nacc (n = 5) implanted rats that received muscimol injections made significantly fewer errors during the between reversal session than the control group (saline, n = 5) : F(1, 14) = 42. 885, p < 0. 001. VTA rats also took significantly longer than the control group to reach criterion: F(1, 14) = 4. 933, p < 0. 05. However, Nacc rats made significantly more errors than the control group during the more complex within session reversal F(1, 14) = 7. 031, p < 0. 05. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that NAcc neurons play an instrumental role in reversal learning performance, especially when task complexity increases. The high temporal resolution provided by the optical inhibition of NAcc and VTA neurons (via halorhodopsin) will provide us with answers about the importance of feedback information when an error is made...|$|R

They {{also play a}} fundamental role in innate host defense and may act as a tissue-privileged viral reservoir during all stages of infection. In the current ART-era of the HIV pandemic, HIV-seropositive patients can maintain undetectable viral loads for years. Nevertheless, this population faces central nervous system, cardiovascular, and other HIV-related co-morbidities, many of which are characterized by underlying monocyte/macrophage contributions. To investigate the regulation of the survival and activation profiles of monocytes/macrophages during HIV- 1 infection in vivo, we performed the following sets of experiments: (1) we determined monocyte apoptosis profiles in previously uncharacterized highly viremic HIV (+) donors and assessed monocyte gene expression associated with monocyte apoptosis outcome; (2) we tested the impact of ART and CCR 5 antagonism during advanced HIV- 1 infection on the reversal of monocyte/macrophage activation; (3) we tested the impact of the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFI 6 and IFI 27 as an underlying mechanism regulating monocyte apoptosis in the context of HIV- 1 infection. Our results indicate both constitutive and oxidative stress-induced monocyte apoptosis are elevated in HIV (+) individuals with viral loads above 40, 000 HIV- 1 copies/mL and are associated with decreasing CD 4 count. Furthermore, elevated apoptosis is associated with a shift in interferon stimulated gene and Bcl- 2 family gene expression. Longitudinal analysis of ART treatment during advanced HIV- 1 infection (nadir CD 4 count 3 ̆c 100 cells/mm 3) demonstrated differential reversal of cell-associated and soluble biomarkers of monocyte/macrophage activation.

Augmenting the Asymmetric Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (AGARCH) model of Glosten et al.

This finding is consistent with the learning hypothesis in the financial economics literature. Furthermore, examining the robustness of our finding within the AGARCH model to endogenous effects, we find that the variance responses of the GCC markets to public news on the dates of bills are not solely driven by market specific effects. 1 bound copy: ix, 35 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
40|$|We study {{self-propelled}} particles with velocity reversal interacting by uniaxial (nematic) alignment {{within a}} coarse-grained hydrodynamic theory. Combining analytical and numerical continuation techniques, {{we show that}} the physics of this active system is essentially controlled by the reversal frequency. In particular, we find that elongated, high-density, ordered patterns, called bands, emerge via subcritical bifurcations from spatially homogeneous states. Our analysis reveals further that the interaction of bands is weakly attractive and, consequently, bands fuse upon collision in analogy with nonequilibrium nucleation processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that a renormalized positive line tension can be assigned to stable bands below a critical reversal rate, beyond which they are transversally unstable. In addition, we discuss the kinetic roughening of bands {{as well as their}} nonlinear dynamics close to the threshold of transversal instability. Altogether, the reduction of the multi-particle system onto the dynamics of bands provides a framework to understand the <b>impact</b> of the <b>reversal</b> frequency on the emerging nonequilibrium patterns in self-propelled particle systems.

40|$|The paper investigates sharp {{reductions}} seen {{in current}} account deficits in selected transition {{countries in the}} 1992 - 2003 period. The analysis focuses on three important aspects of these current account reversals: a) to examine those factors that might have triggered the reversals and to provide some insights into the current account adjustment process; b) to reveal some characteristics of persistent current account deficits; and c) to investigate the direct <b>impact</b> of these <b>reversals</b> on {{economic growth in the}} region. Results suggest that restrictively defined reversals seem to be closely related to factors such as domestic savings, real export growth, international reserves and external indebtedness {{as well as with the}} budget and trade balances. While the role of exchange rate depreciation seems ambiguous, we found that the sharp current account reversals are systematically associated with a gradual GDP growth slowdown in the pre-reversal period and with robust GDP growth impetus afterwards. Indeed, less restrictively defined reversals show that reversals are associated with an increase of output by around 1. 20 percentage points in the second year of recovery. Finally, the results suggest the significant possibility that persistent current account deficits, which on average last more than five years, are consumption-driven in the transition countries. ...|$|R

Avoiding these unstable MHD modes motivated an experiment to test if the stable current profile shape of a higher current non-inductive discharge could be achieved in a lower current discharge. Starting from a discharge at 0. 8 MA, the plasma current was ramped down to 0. 5 MA over 200 ms. The surface voltage of the plasma swings negative during the ramp, with the loop voltage <b>reversal</b> <b>impacting</b> the edge fast electron measurements immediately. Little change can be seen during the Ip ramp in the core fast electron measurements, indicating that the loop voltage reversal does not penetrate fully to the magnetic axis on the timescale of the current ramp. The resulting discharge did not exhibit deleterious MHD instabilities, however the existence of this one discharge does not necessarily represent a robust solution to the problem...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{had been}} recently proposed {{to show how}} an impact event can trigger a geomagnetic polarity reversal by means of rapid climate cooling. We test the proposed mechanism by examining the record from two high sedimentation rate (8 - 11 cm/kyr) deep-sea sediment cores (ODP Sites 767 and 769) from marginal seas of the Indonesian archipelago, which record the Australasian impact with well-defined microtektite layers, the Brunhes-Matuyama polarity reversal with strong and stable remanent magnetizations, and global climate with oxygen isotope variations in planktonic foraminifera. Both ODP cores show the impact to have preceded the reversal of magnetic field directions by about 12 kyr. Both records indicate that the field intensity was increasing near the time of impact and that it continued to increase for about 4 kyr afterwards. Furthermore, the oxygen isotope record available from sediments at ODP Site 769 shows no indication of discernible climate cooling following the impact: the microtektite event occurred in the later part of glacial Stage 20 and {{was followed by a}} smooth warming trend to interglacial Stage 19. Thus the detailed chronology does not support the previously proposed model which would predict that a decrease in geomagnetic field intensity resulted from a minor glaciation following the impact event. We conclude that the evidence for a causal link between <b>impacts</b> and geomagnetic <b>reversals</b> remains insufficient to demonstrate a physical connection...|$|R
