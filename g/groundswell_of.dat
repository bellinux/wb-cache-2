5|$|From March to April 1999, there arose a huge <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> public {{dissent in}} the media over the National Library building's fate, {{as well as the}} drastic {{physical}} alterations of its environs.

5|$|The Old National Library Building was a {{historical}} building at Stamford Road in the Museum Planning Area of Singapore. Originally completed in 1960, it housed the National Library {{and was a}} national icon for many Singaporeans. Despite a huge <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> public dissent, the library was closed on 31 March 2004, and was demolished {{to make way for}} the construction of the Fort Canning Tunnel to ease road traffic to the city. The controversy surrounding the building's demise has been credited for sparking greater awareness of local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs {{for a better life}} in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to the}} city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E
5|$|Most {{party members}} were teachers, {{employees}} of the French colonial government or non-commissioned officers in the colonial army. The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of societythere were few workers or peasants in its ranks. The party's popularity {{was based on a}} <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> anti-French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China, Champa, Siam and Cambodia, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the timePhan Bội Châuto the French in return for a financial reward. Ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals. The VNQDD would later be {{on the receiving end of}} another of Ho's manoeuvres.|$|E

25|$|Carter and {{her mother}} founded the {{organization}} Citizens Against a Radioactive Environment (C.A.R.E.) to oppose the use of Department of Energy stores of radioactive caesium-137 in a demonstration food irradiation facility.

25|$|This {{all changed}} with the fateful—and unsuccessful—raid by radical {{abolitionist}} John Brown on the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry.

For the first time, the picture had been painted in starkly differing terms. Northerners appeared willing—even eager—to overturn the established order throughout the South, with clear and grave injury to those who lived there, it seemed to Southerners.|$|E

25|$|The 1990s was {{a decade}} of {{substantial}} change for Hobart. Although a nationwide recession brought high levels of unemployment and a lowering rate of home ownership, a profound shift in the political landscape followed on from the 1989 state government election.

The Columbus Symphony Orchestra badly needed a permanent home and began performing at the Ohio in the fall of 1969, enjoying an increase in ticket sales thanks to excitement about the new venue.|$|E

25|$|Four {{months after}} the library was demolished, Jill Nerheny, the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Coordinator, claimed there was a <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> support for leaving the land as green space.

25|$|Republicans {{strongly}} opposed Obama's 2009 {{economic stimulus package}} and 2010 health care reform bill. The Tea Party movement, formed in early 2009, provided a <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the Obama administration. With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to make big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. However, establishment Republicans began to see themselves at odds with Tea Party activists, who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as Bob Bennett in Utah and Lisa Murkowski in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale urban development, not {{to mention}} {{synthetic}} urbanization, will not remain sustainable absent structural changes to the normative and decision making framework that include rolling technology assessment and systems analysis. Technology policies need {{to be based on}} outcomes as well as on significant improvements in complexity management at critical stages of planning and implementation. This conclusion endures even if it requires limiting options of political decision making in open democratic societies through normative structural automatisms. Independent of political trends, social consensus almost everywhere favors a prioritization of energy efficiency, alternative energies, resource recycling, urban farming, cost- and time-effective public transportation, water economy, and extended product life. But public interest-driven decision making processes, legislation, and dispute resolution do not adequately take into account the acceleration of technological innovation on the one hand, and of environmental deterioration on the other hand. This paper exposes fundamental weaknesses and future needs for technology assessment drawing on European, American and global experiences. It highlights challenges to avoid possible crises of legitimacy and anti-technology <b>groundswells</b> <b>of</b> Luddite proportions as well as forgoing groundbreaking opportunities for an open knowledge society based on informed consent rather than state mandate...|$|R

25|$|With Kennedy {{out of the}} way, the {{question}} of Johnson's choice of running mate provided some suspense for an otherwise uneventful convention. However, Johnson also became concerned that Kennedy might use a scheduled speech at the 1964 Democratic Convention to create a <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> emotion among the delegates to nominate him as Johnson's running mate; Johnson prevented this by scheduling Kennedy's speech {{on the last day}} of the convention, by which time the vice-presidential nomination would have been made. Shortly after the convention, Kennedy decided to leave Johnson's cabinet and run for the U.S. Senate in New York, where he won the general election in November. Johnson chose Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, a liberal and civil rights activist, as his running mate.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{a public}} <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> opinion {{in favour of}} legal {{equality}} had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP Willie Hamilton's select committee report, his equal pay for equal work bill, {{the creation of a}} Sex Discrimination Board, Lady Sear's draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government Green Paper of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an Equal Opportunities Commission came into force. With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the EEC soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.|$|E
25|$|In doing so, {{the company}} faced several {{simultaneous}} challenges: creating {{a lot of}} intricate user-facing software from scratch or from existing code which must target all the disparate Linux environment versions; integrating a corporate personality into the existing and outspoken volunteer community of the GNOME desktop environment; building upon a very small nascent market of Linux desktop users amongst an already widely served and monopolized desktop computing market; and monetizing free software for individual consumers by creating essential business services. In other words, Eazel sought to switch a <b>groundswell</b> <b>of</b> users from Macintosh and Windows to a new and immature system that free software users would want to pay for. Of the two predominant free desktop environments for Linux, the choice to target GNOME instead of KDE was made {{largely because of the}} questionable legality of the Qt license upon which KDE was based.|$|E
