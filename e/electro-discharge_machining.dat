A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a gun-drill is typically used due to the smooth and straight hole profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an air probe. This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the air probe is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated transducer to convert the pressure change into a voltage. A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using <b>electro-discharge</b> <b>machining</b> (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior to the trepanning.|$|E

40|$|For {{combining}} {{high performance}} and security during <b>Electro-discharge</b> <b>machining</b> (ED-ma-chining) {{the presence of}} an effective facility for detecting short-circuits and so called „arcs “ is of big importance. Especially ignitions with a tendency towards arcing are dangerous for the ongoing of the ED-process. Without an efficient module of arc detection and a strategy of arc prevention a destruction of the work piece surface due to overheating can be the result. Finally the ED-process can come to a stillstand and no further removal will happen. Strategies for arc detection have been studied already for a long time. The ignitions in ED-machining have various characteristics, depending on the material used for electrode and work piece, the current and the voltage. This fact makes it hard to develop a universal criterion for arcs. Modern generators working as a current source limit the applicability of conventional arcing criteria and create the necessity of new developments in this field. Therefore a new strategy for catching arcs was de-veloped which easily may be applied and which causes a strong indication.
