5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Enquiries about <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> led in 1861 to novel {{studies of}} wild orchids, showing {{adaptation}} of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers {{also tend to be}} more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to <b>insect</b> <b>pollination.</b> The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to the}} direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E

50|$|The {{flowers are}} visited {{by a wide}} variety of <b>insects</b> (the {{generalised}} <b>pollination</b> syndrome).|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} area of symbiosis between carnivorous plants and <b>insects</b> is <b>pollination.</b> While {{many species of}} carnivorous plant can reproduce asexually via self-pollination or vegetative propagation, many carnivorous plants are insect-pollinated. Outcross pollination is beneficial as it increases genetic diversity. This means that carnivorous plants undergo an evolutionary and ecological conflict often called the pollinator-prey conflict. There are several ways by which carnivorous plants reduce the strain of the pollinator-prey conflict. For long-lived plants, the short-term loss of reproduction may be offset by the future growth made possible by resources obtained from prey. Other plants might [...] "target" [...] different species of <b>insect</b> for <b>pollination</b> and prey using different olfactory and visual cues.|$|R
40|$|Pollinators provide key {{services}} to {{both natural and}} agricultural ecosystems. Agricultural productivity depends, in part, on pollinator populations from adjacent seminatural habitats. Here we analysed the diversity of pollinator insects and its effect to seed set of mustard (Brassica rapa) planted in agricultural ecosystem near the Gunung Halimun-Salak National Park, West Java. At least 19 species of insects pollinated the mustard, and three species, i. e. Apis cerana, Ceratina sp., and Apis dorsata showed a high abundance. The higher abundance and species richness of pollinators occurred at 08. 30 - 10. 30 am and the diversity {{was related to the}} number of flowering plants. <b>Insect</b> <b>pollinations</b> increased the number of pods, seeds per pod, seed weights per plant, and seed germination...|$|R

25|$|Entomophily, {{pollination}} by insects, often {{occurs on}} plants {{that have developed}} colored petals and a strong scent to attract insects such as, bees, wasps and occasionally ants (Hymenoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), and flies (Diptera). The existence of <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> {{dates back to the}} dinosaur era.|$|E
25|$|The {{large size}} of the monolete pollen of Macroneuropteris and other seed ferns {{suggests}} {{that they may not}} have been well adapted to wind dispersal. This raises speculation about the possibility of <b>insect</b> <b>pollination.</b> One of those possibilities is Arthropleura, a very large millipede of the carboniferous. Scott and Taylor (1983) studied seed-fern pollen on the plates of Arthropleura and thought they might have a role in pollination. W. A. Shear and others have noted that this is very unlikely due to the size of Arthropleura. Other insects of the carboniferous however may have been pollinators. The cycads, a modern seed plant with some similar affinities to seed ferns, were previously thought to only be pollinated by wind. New studies have confirmed the role of Thrips and other beetles in their pollination. This form of pollination is now known to be present {{as far back as the}} Cretaceous. A similar relationship may have occurred between these seed ferns and some carboniferous insects.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} April 1860, Darwin {{discussed}} <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> {{with his}} friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the bee orchid. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to The Gardeners' Chronicle asking for readers' observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from Orchis morio and Orchis mascula plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray {{that he had been}} [...] "so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle", and made similar enquiries of other experts.|$|E
50|$|In his {{experiments}} involving plant movement, {{he demonstrated}} {{the influence that}} climatic factors had upon plant organs. Also, his views on the role that <b>insects</b> play in <b>pollination</b> of plants {{was considered to be}} ahead of its time.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} effects of plant and <b>insect</b> diversity on <b>pollination</b> of wild plant species. As biodiversity is decreasing due to human activities, {{it is important to}} know {{the effects of}} lower species richness on ecosystem functioning. One such ecosystem function is <b>pollination</b> by <b>insects.</b> The main question of the thesis therefore is: Is a high biodiversity important for the pollination of entomophilous wild plant species in agricultural, fragmented landscapes? Both field surveys (descriptive analyses) and experiments (garden and field) were used. In the field surveys, the diversity of flowering plants and their flower visitors were measured with transects of road verges and ditch banks, situated in landscapes differing in agricultural land use. Furthermore, experiments with potted plants of a number of selected species were performed. The effects of land use on plant and insect diversity were analysed, and subsequently the effects of these diversities on flower visitation, <b>insect</b> behaviour, <b>pollination</b> and seed set. ...|$|R
50|$|About two {{to three}} months after {{planting}} a gac vine, flowering typically occurs, with pollination carried out by <b>insects</b> or hand <b>pollination</b> which produces a higher fruit yield. One plant can produce 30 to 60 fruits in one season although environmental factors can affect that.|$|R
500|$|In 1854, Darwin {{began to}} work {{full-time}} {{on the origin of}} species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both pollinia (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as Fabaceae, they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to empirical research on orchids. Despite delays caused by recurring illness, he made progress on writing his planned [...] "Big Book" [...] on evolution, but when Alfred Russel Wallace's letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of natural selection in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of [...] "intercrossing", and noted: [...] "Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them". He introduced his new concept, the process of coevolution, describing the co-adaptation of bumblebees and red clover, and speculating [...] "how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.|$|E
2500|$|Ornithophily or bird {{pollination}} is the pollination {{of flowering}} plants by birds. This coevolutionary association {{is derived from}} <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> (entomophily) and is particularly well developed {{in some parts of}} the world, especially in the tropics and on some island chains. The association involves several distinctive plant adaptations forming a [...] "pollination syndrome". The plants typically have colourful, often red, flowers with long tubular structures holding ample nectar and orientations of the stamen and stigma that ensure contact with the pollinator. Birds involved in ornithophily tend to be specialist nectarivores with brushy tongues, long bills, capable of hovering flight or are light enough to perch on the flower structures.|$|E
2500|$|Entomophily or <b>insect</b> <b>{{pollination}}</b> {{is a form}} of pollination whereby pollen of plants, especially but {{not only}} of [...] flowering plants, is distributed by insects. Flowers pollinated by insects typically advertise themselves with bright colours, sometimes with conspicuous patterns (honey guides) leading to rewards of pollen and nectar; they may also have an attractive scent which in some cases mimics insect pheromones. Insect pollinators such as bees have adaptations for their role, such as lapping or sucking mouthparts to take in nectar, and in some species also pollen baskets on their hind legs. This required the coevolution of insects and flowering plants in the development of pollination behaviour by the insects and pollination mechanisms by the flowers, benefiting both groups.|$|E
50|$|Cross-pollination is a {{necessity}} because the anther is absent in most functionally female flowers. Although apomixis may occur in some cultivars, rambutan, like lychee, is dependent upon <b>insects</b> for <b>pollination.</b> In Malaysia, where only about 1% of the female flowers set fruit, no fruit is set on bagged flowers while hand pollination resulted in 13% fruit set. Pollinators may maintain a fidelity to either male or hermaphroditic flowers (trees), thus limiting pollination and fruit set under natural conditions where crossing {{between male and female}} flowers is required.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the female}} has {{finished}} the nest, she plugs the entrance with a mud wall, thicker than the partitions that precede it. She then seeks another location {{for a new}} nest. She works tirelessly until she dies. An O. lignaria female lives for about four to eight weeks, and can fill an average of four six-inch tubes in her lifetime, with about eight eggs per tube. Her work includes nearly 60,000 blossom visits, and has attracted growers to propagate the <b>insect</b> for <b>pollination</b> purposes in fruit orchards.|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>insects</b> in <b>pollination</b> and {{consequently}} in fruit set and quality was assessed in two commercial orchards of the cactus pear, Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill., in Agrigento Province, Sicily. In 1997, insects visiting flowers were sampled during MayeJune (the first bloom) and July (the second bloom, {{induced by the}} “scozzolatura” practise). More than 50 insect species belonging to 10 orders were collected in MayeJune, while only five species of Hymenoptera Apoidea were collected in July. The quality of fruits arising from the second bloom showed that Hymenoptera alone were able to guarantee effective pollination. To verify the role of <b>insects</b> in <b>pollination</b> in 1996 (during only the second bloom), and in 1997 and 2009 (during both blooms), 60 single flowers were marked during each bloom; 30 of them covered with paper sleeves (which prevented natural pollination), while the others were not covered. After withering, fruits produced by marked flowers were analyzed in laboratory: in all years and blooms, {{the total number of}} seeds, the number of developed seeds, and the weight and the percentage of pulp were significantly lower for covered flowers than for non-covered flowers. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that native insects effectively carry out the pollination of cactus pear flowers...|$|R
2500|$|The early spermatophytes (seed plants) {{were largely}} {{dependent}} on the wind to carry their pollen from one plant to another, and it was around 125 to 115 million years ago that a new pollination strategy developed and angiosperms (flowering plants) first appeared. Before that, insect involvement in pollination was limited to [...] "pollination assistants", insects which inadvertently carried the pollen between plants merely by their movements. The real relationship between plants and insects began in the Early Cretaceous, with beetle-pollinated gymnosperms. The morphology of the first fossil basal angiosperms is similar to modern-day plants that are also fertilised by beetles. It seems likely that beetles {{led the way in}} <b>insect</b> <b>pollination,</b> followed by flies. Among the twelve living families of basal angiosperms, six are predominantly pollinated by flies, five by beetles and only one by bees. Nevertheless, traits such as sapromyophily (emitting the odour of carrion to attract flies) have evolved independently in several unrelated angiosperm families.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{species can}} see light with {{frequencies}} outside the human [...] "visible spectrum". Bees {{and many other}} insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find nectar in flowers. Plant species that depend on <b>insect</b> <b>pollination</b> may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet [...] "colors" [...] and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range. Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range, however, cannot see red light or any other reddish wavelengths. [...] For example, bees' visible spectrum ends at about 590nm, just before the orange wavelengths start. Birds, however, can see some red wavelengths, although not as far into the light spectrum as humans. It is an incorrect popular belief that the common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light, their color vision extends into the ultraviolet but not the infrared.|$|E
