5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Hajime Tabata, with Tetsuya Nomura serving as character designer. Before development, the Square Enix staff initially planned to make a PlayStation Portable port of the mobile phone game , but after discussion, they decided {{to create a new}} game. The plot is based on a scenario Kazushige Nojima had <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> working on Final Fantasy VII. Crisis Core enjoyed strong sales, selling over three million units worldwide. Critical reception was generally positive.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E

5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> trying {{to determine if a}} file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> he {{saw him in the}} Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E

25|$|In practice, it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to keep performance goals <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> first designing software, but the programmer balances the goals of design and optimization.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{one should}} keep <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> {{assessing}} {{a computer system}} that other aspects of performance (errors, learning, functionality, recall, concentration, fatigue, and acceptability), types of users (novice, casual) and non-routine tasks {{have to be considered}} as well.|$|E

25|$|Many {{theories}} have an intended interpretation, a certain model that is kept <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of Peano arithmetic {{consists of the}} usual natural numbers with their usual operations. However, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, nonstandard models.|$|E
25|$|On {{a related}} note, this fixed {{standard}} deviation {{means that the}} proportion of the population who have IQs in a particular range is theoretically fixed, and current Wechsler tests only give Full Scale IQs between 40 and 160. This should be borne <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> considering reports of people with much higher IQs.|$|E
25|$|The Privy Council {{held that}} a State {{government}} could tax Commonwealth officials and criticised {{the decisions of the}} High Court in D'Emden v Pedder and Deakin v Webb.

25|$|The {{benefits}} {{of nature and}} feeling connected to nature may be beneficial to keep <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> creating settings for patients at a hospital, or in therapy sessions. Also, because virtual nature can provide benefits to people (but in a less dramatic way), this may be one way for people who cannot get out in nature to reap some of its benefits.|$|E
25|$|Burr's {{occasional}} roles on {{the right}} side of the law include the aggressive prosecutor in A Place in the Sun (1951). His courtroom performance in that film made an impression on Gail Patrick and her husband Cornwell Jackson, who had Burr <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> they began casting the role of Los Angeles district attorney Hamilton Burger in the CBS-TV series Perry Mason.|$|E
25|$|One {{should also}} keep {{the purpose of}} the {{analysis}} <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> choosing the prior distribution. In principle, uninformative and flat priors, that exaggerate our subjective ignorance about the parameters, may still yield reasonable parameter estimates. However, Bayes factors are highly sensitive to the prior distribution of parameters. Conclusions on model choice based on Bayes factor can be misleading unless the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of priors is carefully considered.|$|E

25|$|Lesions rarely are {{localized}} and {{can affect}} {{large areas of}} the brain. Processing in the brain is generally not localized and requires many areas of the brain to process. Furthermore, lesioning may interfere with pathways that span the lesion site. Thus, lesions are not always a good way to determine what specific brain areas do. Therefore, a degree of skepticism should be kept <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> viewing lateralization data from lesion studies.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey's {{composite}} Merlin {{is based}} primarily on Myrddin Wyllt, also called Merlinus Caledonensis, and Aurelius Ambrosius, a mostly fictionalised version of the historical war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus. The former {{had nothing to do}} with King Arthur: in British poetry he was a bard driven mad after witnessing the horrors of war, who fled civilization to become a wild man of the wood in the 6th century. Geoffrey had this individual <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> he wrote his earliest surviving work, the Prophetiae Merlini (Prophecies of Merlin), which he claimed were the actual words of the legendary madman.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days, the band cited Radiohead, Massive Attack, and Portishead, {{because of the}} {{combination}} of electronic sequencers with live instrumentation, sample manipulation, and female lead vocals. Lark is often compared to Diamanda Galas, Beth Orton, Portishead, Pram, and Bjork. Recently, the band prefers not compare themselves. As Inge Beckmann has expressed {{that she does not}} have a single artist <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>when</b> creating a Lark track. Although she has spoken about being by inspired by Ella Fitzgerald, Freddie Mercury, Diana Ross, David Bowie, and Stevie Wonder. Paul Ressel has mentioned influences like The Books, Aphex Twin, Square Pusher, and, being heavily inspired by, Amon Tobin.|$|E
