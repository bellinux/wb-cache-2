Sites with low influence of relative humidity had higher impact on wind speed. Mean relative humidity below 50 % and mean wind speed above 4 [*]m/s were predicted as critical levels for dust episodes incidence at sites that recorded “heavy” and “very heavy” dust fall.

40|$|In {{classifying}} {{the ensemble}} of powerful extragalactic radio sources, considerable evidence has accumulated that radio galaxies and quasars are orientation-dependent {{manifestations of the}} same parent population: massive spheroidal galaxies containing correspondingly massive black holes. [ [...] . ] In this study, we exploit the opportunity to eliminate the quasar glare by performing sensitive spectropolarimetry with the Keck II telescope of a sample of radio galaxies with redshifts around 2. 5. [ [...] . ] We show that dust-reflected quasar light generally dominates the restframe ultraviolet continuum of these sources and that a highly clumped scattering medium results in almost grey scattering of the active galactic nucleus photons. The observations, however, do not exclude a substantial star formation rate averaged over a Gyr of evolution. The sub-mm reradiation from the scattering dust is likely to represent {{only a small fraction}} (~ 10 %) of the total far infrared luminosity. An analysis of the emission lines excited in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy by the hard quasar radiation field reveals evidence of a dramatic chemical evolution within the spheroid during this epoch. Secondary nitrogen production in intermediate mass stars produces a characteristic signature in the NV/CIV and NV/HeII line ratios which has been seen previously in the broad line region of quasars at similar redshifts. We find intriguing correlations between the strengths of the Ly alpha and NV emission lines and the degree of ultraviolet continuum polarization which may represent the <b>dispersal</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> associated with the chemical enrichment of the spheroid.

These layers represent the oldest tephra-bearing events so far detected in deep polar ice cores and extend the regional tephrostratigraphic framework back to the fourth climatic cycle.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] distribution of sample units in multivariate species space typically departs strongly from the multivariate normal distribution. Instead of forming a hyperellipse in species space, the sample points tend to lie along high-dimensional edges of the space. This dust bunny distribution is seen in most ecological community data sets. The practical consequences of the distribution to the analysis of community data are well known and severe, but no one has demonstrated how population processes generate these problems. We evaluate potential causes <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> bunny distributions by simulating a large number of non-equilibrial communities under varying conditions, verifying that they resemble real data, then analyzing the relationship between the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>dust</b> bunny distribution in these data sets and the population and environmental parameters that gave rise to them.

40|$|Abandoned tailing basins {{and waste}} heaps of orphan mining sites are {{of great concern}} since extreme metal {{contamination}} makes soil improper for any human activity and is a permanent threat for nearby surroundings. Although spontaneous revegetation can occur, the process is slow or unsuccessful and rhizostabilisation strategies to reduce <b>dispersal</b> <b>of</b> contaminated <b>dust</b> represent an option to rehabilitate such sites. This requires selection of plants tolerant to such conditions, and optimization of their fitness and growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can enhance metal tolerance in moderately polluted soils, but their ability to survive extreme levels of metal contamination has not been reported. This question was addressed in the tailing basin and nearby waste heaps of an orphan mining site in southern France, reaching in the tailing basin exceptionally high contents of zinc (ppm: 97, 333 total) and lead (ppm: 31, 333 total). In order {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of AMF ecology under severe abiotic stress and to identify AMF associated with plants growing under such conditions, that may be considered in future revegetation and rhizostabilisation of highly polluted areas, nine plant species were sampled at different growing seasons and AMF root colonization was determined. Glomeromycota diversity was monitored in mycorrhizal roots by sequencing of the ribosomal LSU. This first survey of AMF in such highly contaminated soils revealed the presence of several AMF ribotypes, belonging mainly to the Glomerales, with some examples from the Paraglomerales and Diversisporales. AMF diversity and root colonization in the tailing basin were lower than in the less-contaminated waste heaps. A Paraglomus species previously identified in a polish mining site was common in roots of different plants. Presence of active AMF in such an environment is an outstanding finding, which should be clearly considered for the design of efficient rhizostabilisation processes...|$|R
40|$|In this study, some {{important}} aspects of the relationship between honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and pesticides have been investigated. In {{the first part of the}} research, the effects of the exposure of honey bees to neonicotinoids and fipronil contaminated dusts were analyzed. In fact, considerable amounts of these pesticides, employed for maize seed dressing treatments, may be dispersed during the sowing operations, thus representing a way of intoxication for honey bees. In particular, a specific way of exposure to this pesticides formulation, the indirect contact, was taken into account. To this aim, we conducted different experimentations, in laboratory, in semi-field and in open field conditions in order to assess the effects on mortality, foraging behaviour, colony development and capacity of orientation. The real <b>dispersal</b> <b>of</b> contaminated <b>dusts</b> was previously assessed in specific filed trials. In the second part, the impact of various pesticides (chemical and biological) on honey bee biochemical-physiological changes, was evaluated. Different ways and durations of exposure to the tested products were also employed. Three experimentations were performed, combining Bt spores and deltamethrin, Bt spores and fipronil, difenoconazole and deltamethrin. Several important enzymes (GST, ALP, SOD, CAT, G 6 PDH, GAPDH) were selected in order to test the pesticides induced variations in their activity. In particular, these enzymes are involved in different pathways of detoxification, oxidative stress defence and energetic metabolism. The results showed a significant effect on mortality of neonicotinoids and fipronil contaminated dusts, both in laboratory and in semi-field trials. However, no effects were evidenced in honey bees orientation capacity. The analysis of different biochemical indicators highlighted some interesting physiological variations that can be linked to the pesticide exposure. We therefore stress the attention on the possibility of using such a methodology as a novel toxicity endpoint in environmental risk assessment. ...|$|R

This star forming complex contains numerous compact and ultra-compact (UC) H II regions, extending over an area of ≈ 15 pc. It emits about 10 51 Lyman continuum photons per second, equivalent to the presence of about 100 O stars, but it is completely obscured in optical wavelengths by intervening interstellar dust. The center holds a “cluster ” of about 30 O stars, each within an individual UCHII region emitting free–free emission at cm wavelengths. Our deep K−band (2. 2 µm) image toward the W 49 A cluster reveals just two of the individual exciting stars, each associated with a point–like radio source, but the rest are invisible. These O stars are so recently born as to not yet have emerged from their natal dust cocoons, in contrast to other Galactic clusters embedded in GH II regions in which many of the individual massive stars are already revealed. Plausibility arguments are made which suggest that a stellar disc might be common during the entire UCH II phase of massive star birth, as it persists after accretion ceases in some stars. Nebular emission (e. g., from Brγ) is visible around the periphery of the central region of W 49 A, along with candidate exciting stars.
