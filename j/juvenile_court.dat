5|$|Thanks to his father's influence, Wetherby became {{interested}} in local politics at an early age. School board races fascinated him, and he allied himself with a faction of the Jefferson County Democratic Party headed by Leland Taylor and Ben Ewing. When Ewing was elected county judge in 1933, he appointed Wetherby as a part-time attorney for the Jefferson County <b>juvenile</b> <b>court.</b> He held this position through 1937, then returned to it in 1942 and 1943. In March 1943, he was appointed the first trial commissioner of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} parens patriae orientation, {{which is often}} {{considered}} to beat {{the core of the}} operation of <b>juvenile</b> <b>courts,</b> and discovers that existing ideas concerning its role must be revised. In opposition to common theory it appears that parens patriae at best shares influence with a number of other orientations in <b>juvenile</b> <b>courts,</b> and may even no longer exist as a distinct, unified dimension. Further, neither parens patriae nor any of the other orientations bears a direct, simple relation to dispositions, although statistically significant correlations emerge when interaction effects are analyzed and when sub-samples are developed. These results are explained in relation to previous studies, the possibility of social change, and the community context of <b>juvenile</b> <b>courts.</b> Parens Patriae and Dispositions in <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Courts</b> Parens patriae is both a set of suggestions for organizing juvenil...|$|R

5|$|Outside her {{political}} duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary {{presidency of the}} Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a <b>juvenile</b> <b>court</b> magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague Edith Summerskill, a physician who wrote the anti-boxing tract The Ignoble Art, and campaigned for the sport's abolition.|$|E
5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} the orphanage in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Court</b> of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E

5|$|Wetherby {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the 34th Legislative District Democratic Committee in 1943 and held the position through 1956. In March 1947, he resigned as trial commissioner of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>court</b> in order to run for lieutenant governor. The strongest of his four opponents in the Democratic primary was Bill May, the nephew of U.S. Representative Andrew J. May. May had sought the support of gubernatorial candidate Earle C. Clements, but Clements refused, possibly because Congressman May was an ally of Clements' political opponent John Y. Brown. Wetherby was also unable to secure Clements' public endorsement, but he won the primary {{and went on to}} defeat Republican Orville M. Howard by over 95,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley {{laid out}} an agenda {{to reduce the}} county's debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite the Republican {{majority}} on the Court, most of the measures he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned. When he named his father as the county's <b>juvenile</b> <b>court</b> probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.|$|E
5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from <b>juvenile</b> <b>court</b> to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E
50|$|Section 4 of the JJSO authorizes the Provincial Government to {{establish}} {{one or more}} <b>juvenile</b> <b>courts</b> for any local area within its jurisdiction, {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice of the high court.

The High Courts cannot be doing this on their own, and must be instructed by the provincial governments to do so. In this era of independent judiciary, the High Courts should standup against the governments on this issue and refuse to confer powers on the already over-burdened courts and instead should insist upon establishing exclusive <b>juvenile</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|R

Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she had been before <b>juvenile</b> <b>court</b> 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a psychologist who {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E
