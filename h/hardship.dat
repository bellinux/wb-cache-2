5|$|The largest {{source of}} wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The {{disruption}} of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great <b>hardship</b> for the colonists {{for many years to}} come, and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to be excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic <b>hardship.</b> The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between <b>hardships</b> and protest in the world-system. Despite the history of discussion of anti-systemic protest, {{there has been little}} work that differentiates world-systems contributions to social movement research from others who examine social movements. We contribute to a theory of anti-systemic protest by re-introducing <b>hardships</b> as a crucial element that defines inequalities in the world-system; one consistent source of those <b>hardships</b> are austerity policies imposed in response to debt negotiations. In addition to our path analyses which demonstrate the clear link of <b>hardships</b> and protest, our case studies provide further historical analysis on when globalization, political openings, and long-term <b>hardships</b> also help explain the occasion of protest. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, {{this study}} {{examines}} the experiences of material <b>hardships</b> among Australian families with children {{and the role of}} social support in their experiences. The study sample includes 3939 children in the B-cohort (6 years old) and 4030 children in the K-cohort (10 years old). Cohort differences were observed in all analyses. The odds of experiencing material <b>hardships</b> were predicted by various factors apart from income. For both cohorts, material <b>hardships</b> had significant negative effects on maternal depression, which {{was a significant predictor of}} child outcomes. Even after controlling for income and other covariates, material <b>hardships</b> had significant negative effects on all outcomes of K-cohort children, but only on emotional functioning of B-cohort children. Social support was associated with the reduced odds of experiencing material <b>hardships.</b> Social support was also a significant predictor of all parental and child outcomes. However, the interaction effects showed that positive effects of such informal support were limited for families who already experienced material <b>hardships.</b> These findings suggest the importance of preventing material <b>hardships</b> in the first place. There is a significant role for public assistance in fulfilling the unmet needs of these families...|$|R
40|$|The Great Recession of 2007 – 2009 is {{regarded}} as the most severe economic downturn since World War II. This study examined relationships between reported recession <b>hardships</b> and physical health in a national survey of American adults (N [*]=[*] 1275). Furthermore, education and psychological resources (perceived control, purpose in life, and conscientiousness) were tested as moderators of the health impacts of the recession. A greater number of <b>hardships</b> predicted poorer health, especially among the less educated. Psychological resources interacted with education and <b>hardships</b> to predict health outcomes. Although typically viewed as protective factors, such resources became vulnerabilities among educationally disadvantaged adults experiencing greater recession <b>hardships...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach {{is the fact that}} humans are causally responsible for the <b>hardship</b> faced by some animals, but not the <b>hardship</b> faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E
5|$|Membership dropped {{during the}} Great Depression, and the synagogue {{suffered}} financial <b>hardship,</b> but it recovered, and by 1941 had 1,100 member families. In 1950 the congregation built an adjoining school; {{at its peak}} its enrollment was almost 1,000. As neighborhood demographics changed in the late 20th century, and Brooklyn's Jewish population became more Orthodox, the East Midwood Jewish Center absorbed three other Conservative Brooklyn congregations.|$|E

Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic <b>hardship</b> for the merchants.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Minas Geraes {{arrival in}} Brazil, the country's {{prosperity}} began to wane, and a severe depression hit the Brazilian economy. The economic <b>hardship,</b> the racism prevalent in all {{branches of the}} Brazilian armed forces, and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships spawned a mutiny known as the Revolt of the Lash, or Revolta da Chibata, among sailors on the most powerful ships.|$|E
5|$|Team {{cohesion}} {{is viewed}} as ‘‘a general indicator of synergistic group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, cohesion {{has been linked to}} greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions.

This construct is thought {{to create a sense of}} confidence within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with <b>hardship.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} never meant to be a true biographical film to Ip Man's life, but to broadly touch on the {{elements}} from his life.

He decided to evict the tenants, and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.|$|E

5|$|An {{automobile}} {{bridge across}} Ebey Slough and the Snohomish River estuary to Everett {{was completed in}} 1927, with funding {{from the state department}} of highways to complete the Pacific Highway (later part of U.S. Route 99, and present-day State Route 529). The city remained relatively unchanged through the Great Depression, with the diversity of industries credited for Marysville avoiding the worst of economic <b>hardship</b> experienced by other nearby communities. During World War II, an ammunition depot was built on the Tulalip Reservation near present-day Quil Ceda, later being re-used as a Boeing test site after the aerospace company expanded in Everett.|$|E

In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a <b>hardship</b> than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as intense as at many front-line fort.|$|E
