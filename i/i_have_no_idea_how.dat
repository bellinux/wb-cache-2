Novak, who also acts in the show as Ryan Howard, and the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Jason Reitman, who directed the films Juno and Thank You for Smoking. When speaking about his directorial experience with The Office, Reitman stated that [...] "Anyhow, the whole experience was awesome. They’re all geniuses over there. I didn’t have to contribute much {{at the end of}} the day because they’re all so on their game." [...] He also stated that [...] "Weird moment of production design surprise – There's a three ring binder on Creed's desk with the logo from the Academy of Tobacco Studies that we created for [...] Smoking. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> it got there and neither does he." [...] B.J. Novak's brother Jesse, a musician, contributed in writing the song that some of the characters sing in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E

2500|$|Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan cast Bryan Cranston for {{the role}} of Walter White based on having worked with him in a sixth season episode of the science fiction {{television}} series The X-Files, where Gilligan worked as a writer. Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that [...] "Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> he does it." [...] AMC officials were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character Hal on the comedy series Malcolm in the Middle and approached actors John Cusack and Matthew Broderick about the role. When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing the X-Files episode.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93.

Now, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he}} was doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show premiered on 6 May 2012 and was {{telecast}} on Sundays at 11 am IST thereafter. While {{the channel}} authorities were high on showcasing {{it in the}} prime time at 9 pm, Khan wanted to telecast it on Sunday mornings since the slot was commonly considered as [...] "family TV viewing" [...] time in Indian television after popular shows Mahabharata and Ramayana were aired on Sunday mornings and were highly successful. He was reported saying, [...] "I wanted to telecast my show on Sunday morning. I want each family to watch the show and connect with it. We have watched Ramayana and Mahabarata and it used to come on Sunday morning. The shows created a different atmosphere." [...] He further added that, [...] "I don't understand TRPs and GRPs. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to calculate it! I don't care about it.

2500|$|Regarding [...] "Black Hole Sun", Cornell stated, [...] "It's {{just sort}} of a surreal dreamscape, a weird, play-with-the-title kind of song." [...] He also said that [...] "lyrically it's {{probably}} the closest to me just playing with words for words' sake, of anything I've written. I guess it worked {{for a lot of}} people who heard it, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> you'd begin to take that one literally." [...] In another interview he elaborated further, stating, [...] "It's funny because hits are usually sort of congruent, sort of an identifiable lyric idea, and that song pretty much had none. The chorus lyric is kind of beautiful and easy to remember. Other than that, I sure didn't have an understanding of it after I wrote it. I was just sucked in by the music and I was painting a picture with the lyrics. There was no real idea to get across." [...] Commenting upon how the song was misinterpreted as being positive, Cornell said, [...] "No one seems to get this, but 'Black Hole Sun' is sad. But because the melody is really pretty, everyone thinks it's almost chipper, which is ridiculous." [...] When asked about the line, [...] "Times are gone for honest men", Cornell said: ...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster {{could be a great}} way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
