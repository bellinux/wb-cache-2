5|$|After Maryland's last regular-season game, {{defensive}} coordinator Chris Cosh and tight ends coach and special teams assistant Danny Pearman announced their resignations. Cosh returned to Kansas State, {{where he had}} coached before Maryland, to assume defensive play-calling duties under recently re-hired head coach Bill Snyder. Danny Pearman returned to his alma mater, Clemson, to work for Dabo Swinney, who had been promoted from offensive coordinator to <b>interim</b> head coach and, finally, head coach for the Tigers. For the bowl game, Maryland's defensive line coach, Al Seamonson, was named as the <b>interim</b> {{defensive coordinator}}. Third-year intern Brian White filled in for Pearman as the <b>interim</b> tight ends coach and would assist head coach Friedgen in running the special teams.|$|E
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an <b>interim</b> National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as <b>interim</b> president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future. An <b>interim</b> government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Division champions are {{the primary}} {{separation}} criteria due to being non-closed competition. It includes title holders and <b>interim</b> title holders. <b>Interim</b> champions who become undisputed champions are listed only once. People with multiple title reigns will have each of them counted. Tournament wins are secondary due to many tournaments being country specific and thus not generally a national achievement to win. Runners-up and The Ultimate Fighter runners-up are not included.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Northrop Grumman {{proposed}} a YF-23-based bomber {{to meet a}} USAF need for an <b>interim</b> bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing. Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 {{to serve as a}} display model for its proposed <b>interim</b> bomber. The possibility of a YF-23-based <b>interim</b> bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber program.|$|E
5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an <b>interim,</b> {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an <b>interim</b> aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the <b>interim</b> approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945 an <b>Interim</b> Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The <b>Interim</b> Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the <b>Interim</b> Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E

Jack Requa became the <b>Interim</b> General Manager upon Sarles' retirement January 16, 2015.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for <b>interim</b> appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint <b>interim</b> U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight <b>interim</b> attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E
5|$|Six {{times in}} Colts history there were <b>interim</b> head coaches. In 1972, Don McCafferty was fired five games into the season. John Sandusky was named as the <b>interim</b> head {{coach for the}} rest of the season, during which he led the Colts to a 4–5 record, but he was not made the {{permanent}} coach the next year. In 1974, head coach Howard Schnellenberger started off the season 0–3 and was fired. Joe Thomas assumed the duties of head coach and finished the season at 2–12. In 1991, the Colts started off 0–5 and Ron Meyer was fired as head coach. Rick Venturi was named as the <b>interim</b> for the final 11 games. In 2005 Tony Dungy was forced to miss one game due to personal issues. Jim Caldwell was named as the one game <b>interim.</b> In 2012 offensive coordinator Bruce Arians was named as the <b>interim</b> head coach indefinitely after Chuck Pagano was diagnosed with leukemia four weeks into the 2012 NFL season. Arians led the Colts to a 9–3 record – the record being credited to Pagano – and made the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Interim</b> Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls {{and the release of}} information, and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. The <b>Interim</b> Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military use of nuclear weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of nuclear weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the <b>Interim</b> Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|The Rams named John Fassel as <b>interim</b> {{head coach}} on December 12, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg <b>Interim,</b> which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the <b>Interim,</b> and forced him to leave.|$|E

5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an <b>interim</b> measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the <b>interim</b> arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Harry Warner managed as an <b>interim</b> for Roy Hartsfield for 12 {{games in}} the middle of the season, while Hartsfield spent 10 days in Atlanta with his ailing wife.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 Serevi {{was offered}} a {{coaching}} position with the Falcons, a South African side. The offer was several times more than he received from the Fiji Rugby Union.

In the end he decided to instead renew his contract with the Fiji Rugby Union. In early 2007 the <b>interim</b> Sports Minister Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi appointed Serevi to the board of the <b>interim</b> Fiji Sports Council.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, {{before the}} <b>Interim</b> Committee was formed, Bush, Conant and Irvin Stewart had {{produced}} {{a proposal for}} legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted the proposals to the <b>Interim</b> Committee at its meeting on July 9, 1945. Harrison brought in two experienced lawyers, Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up the}} job of drafting the legislation. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, to operate facilities, to conduct research and to regulate all forms of nuclear energy. The Royall-Marbury bill was reviewed by the <b>Interim</b> Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. The bill was forwarded to the President in August. The <b>Interim</b> Committee met again on September 28 to discuss legislative strategy. The Royall-Marbury bill was introduced into the United States Congress by the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Andrew J. May, and the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, Senator Edwin C. Johnson on October 3. It then became known as the May-Johnson bill.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, the <b>Interim</b> Committee {{was created}} to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The {{committee}} was chaired by Stimson, with James F. Byrnes, a former US Senator soon to be Secretary of State, as President Harry S. Truman's personal representative; Ralph A. Bard, the Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of New York Life Insurance Company. The <b>Interim</b> Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the <b>Interim</b> Committee, the scientific panel offered its opinion {{not just on the}} likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} of an absence, disability, or other cause {{preventing}} the mayor from performing his duties, the mayor may designate the business administrator or any other department head as acting mayor for up to 60 days. In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and the council has 30 days to name an <b>interim</b> mayor. If no <b>interim</b> mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and selects a new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic succession law. The office was left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach a decision on appointing an <b>interim</b> mayor.|$|E
