25|$|It was {{not long}} before {{flavoring}} was combined with carbonated water. The earliest reference to carbonated <b>ginger</b> <b>beer</b> is in a Practical Treatise on Brewing. published in 1809. The drinking of either natural or artificial mineral water was considered at the time to be a healthy practice, and was promoted by advocates of temperance. Pharmacists selling mineral waters began to add herbs and chemicals to unflavored mineral water. They used birch bark (see birch beer), dandelion, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts, and other substances. Flavorings were also added to improve the taste.|$|E

50|$|Vernors is a {{flavoured}} golden {{ginger ale}} aged {{for three years}} in oak barrels before bottling. It was the first U.S. soft drink, originating in 1866, although it was modelled on imported Irish <b>ginger</b> <b>beers.</b> In Detroit, Michigan, a drink made with vanilla ice cream and Vernors ginger ale is called a Boston cooler.|$|R
25|$|Soft drinks soon outgrew {{their origins}} in the medical world and became a widely {{consumed}} beverage, available cheaply for the masses. By the 1840s {{there were more than}} fifty soft drink manufacturers – an increase from just ten in the previous decade. Carbonated lemonade was widely available in British refreshment stalls in 1833, and in 1845 R. White's Lemonade went on sale in the UK. For the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, Schweppes was designated the official drink supplier and sold over a million bottles of lemonade, <b>ginger</b> <b>beer,</b> Seltzer water and soda-water. There was a Schweppes soda water fountain, situated directly {{at the entrance to the}} exhibition.|$|E
25|$|Just off Henderson Street is {{the street}} known as Yardheads, on {{which is a}} large group of {{warehouses}} formerly known as Crabbies Warehouse. These warehouses formed a distillery which produced a well known Scottish drink, Crabbies Green Ginger Wine. Crabbies Wine was first created and distilled in Leith in 1801. John Crabbie & Co. moved to the Yardheads premises in the 1850s where they would continue to produce their Green Ginger Wine for more than a Century. Crabbies Ginger Wine (and <b>ginger</b> <b>beer)</b> are still made in Scotland today, though the distilling and bottling process ceased at Yardheads in the 1990s and manufacturing has now been relocated from Leith.|$|E
25|$|For {{hundreds}} of years the English ancestors of the colonists had consumed beer and ale. Both in England and in the New World, people of both sexes and all ages typically drank beer with their meals. Because importing a continuing supply of beer was expensive, the early settlers brewed their own. However, {{it was difficult to}} make the beer they were accustomed to because wild yeasts caused problems in fermentation and resulted in a bitter, unappetizing brew. Although wild hops grew in New England, hop seeds were ordered from England in order to cultivate an adequate supply for traditional beer. In the meantime, the colonists improvised a beer made from red and black spruce twigs boiled in water, as well as a <b>ginger</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E

Fleming combined the backdrop of the Seychelles with his experience he and Blanche Blackwell had undergone when they had visited Pedro Keys, two islands off Jamaica, and watched two scientists do something similar with poison to obtain samples. For the villain of the story, an abusive American millionaire, Fleming used the name Milton Krest: Milton was the code name of a Greek sea captain who ferried British soldiers and agents through German patrols and who received the Distinguished Service Order and an MBE, whilst Krest was the name of tonic and <b>ginger</b> <b>beer</b> Fleming drank in Seychelles.

2500|$|Sometime in the 1800s {{railroad}} engineers from Britain and America {{began to}} lay down track in the Andes nations including Bolivia. [...] A 19th Century favorite back home in England was “gin on gin” or gin with alcoholic <b>ginger</b> <b>beer.</b> [...] Unable to get either one in-country, British expatriates improvised with singani and whatever bubbly came to hand. [...] The railroad term “shoofly” (perhaps from “short fly”) refers to a short length of track built as a temporary expedient to the main line and is slang for “workaround”. [...] Singani and bubbly beverage was thus dubbed a “shoofly”. [...] Being unpronounceable to locals it emerged as “chuflay”, which is still today the favorite cocktail based on singani. [...] Other traditional mixes are the “yungueño”, tumbo (banana passionfruit) cocktail, and “té con té”.|$|E
2500|$|Glaswegian is a dialect, {{more than}} an {{alternative}} pronunciation; words also change their meaning depending on context, e.g. [...] "away" [...] can mean [...] "leaving" [...] as in A'm away, an instruction to stop being a nuisance as in away wi ye, or [...] "drunk" [...] or [...] "demented" [...] as in he's away wi it. Ginger is a term for any carbonated soft drink, historically referring to <b>ginger</b> <b>beer</b> (A bottle o ginger, [...] ). Then there are words whose meaning has no obvious relationship to that in standard English: coupon means [...] "face", via [...] "to punch a ticket coupon". A headbutt is known {{in many parts of}} the British Isles as a [...] "Glasgow kiss", although this term is rarely used by Glaswegians, who say [...] "Malkie", e.g., [...] "ah'll Malkie ye" [...] or [...] "stick the heid/nut on ye".|$|E

2500|$|Other foods {{associated}} with the county include: Yorkshire curd tart, a curd tart recipe with rosewater; Parkin, a sweet ginger cake which is different from standard ginger cakes in that it includes oatmeal and treacle; and Wensleydale cheese, a cheese made with milk from Wensleydale and often eaten as an accompaniment to sweet foods. The beverage <b>ginger</b> <b>beer,</b> flavoured with ginger, came from Yorkshire and has existed since the mid 18th century. Liquorice sweet was first created by George Dunhill from Pontefract, who in the 1760s thought to mix the liquorice plant with sugar. Yorkshire {{and in particular the}} city of York played a prominent role in the confectionery industry, with chocolate factories owned by companies such as Rowntree's, Terry's and Thorntons inventing many of Britain's most popular sweets. Another traditional Yorkshire food is pikelets which are similar to crumpets but much thinner. [...] The Rhubarb Triangle is a location within Yorkshire which supplies most of the rhubarb to locals.|$|E
2500|$|Torts, {{sometimes}} called delicts, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached {{a duty to}} another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball. Under the law of negligence, {{the most common form}} of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by Donoghue v Stevenson. A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of <b>ginger</b> <b>beer</b> (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in Paisley. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The House of Lords decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. Lord Atkin took a distinctly moral approach, and said, ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Time Lords {{resemble}} humans, their physiology differs in key respects. Like {{other members}} of his race, the Doctor has two hearts (binary vascular system), a [...] "respiratory bypass system" [...] that allows him to go without air, an internal body temperature of 15–16°C (60°F) and occasionally exhibits a super-human level of stamina and the ability to absorb, withstand and expel large amounts of certain types of radiation. [...] (The Tenth Doctor stated they used to play with Röntgen bricks in the nursery, after absorbing the radiation from an x-ray of significantly magnified power.) This ability would seem to have limitations which have yet to be fully explained, as the Doctor is harmed by radiation in The Daleks, Planet of the Spiders and The End of Time. The Doctor has withstood, with minimal damage, exposure to electricity deadly enough to kill a human (Terror of the Zygons, Genesis of the Daleks, [...] "Aliens of London", [...] "The Christmas Invasion", [...] "The Idiot's Lantern", [...] "Evolution of the Daleks" [...] and spin-off audio Spare Parts). Certain stories imply that he is resistant to cold temperatures ("42"). To counter extreme trauma, such as exposure to the poisonous fungus in The Seeds of Death and after being shot in Spearhead from Space, he can go into a self-induced coma until he recovers. His hypersensitive body and senses enable him to detect anomalies humans cannot, such as identifying alien species, blood type or chemical composition by taste and determining location or time period by sniffing the air. In [...] "The Unicorn and the Wasp" [...] (2008) he was able to sense the changes in his body's enzymes (i.e. cyanide poisoning) and expel the cyanide from his body by ingesting a concoction of <b>ginger</b> <b>beer,</b> protein foods and salts.|$|E
50|$|Jacksonville Brewing Company was a {{regional}} brewery distributing through Florida and the Southeastern U.S. It distributed its first beers in May 1914. Its flagship product, Jax Beer, was a German-style pilsner. By 1917, {{the company had}} paid off its debts and was turning a profit. However, on May 14, 1918, Jacksonville voted to adopt prohibition, followed by nationwide prohibition in 1920. This made Jacksonville Brewing Company the last brewery {{to open in the}} U.S. before prohibition. The brewery pivoted to other products and services. The main operation became the Jax Ice and Cold Storage Company, which also produced ice cream, root <b>beer,</b> <b>ginger</b> ale, and near beer. The near beer operation featured an unusual brewing process in which beer was made normally and then boiled to remove alcohol, meaning that illegally strong beer existed at the plant for clandestine visits by locals. A significant percentage of the legal near beer was sold to speakeasys, which spiked it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was Donoghue v Stevenson. Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness, after she consumed a <b>ginger</b> <b>beer</b> containing a decomposed snail, in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so Mrs Donoghue, nor the shopkeeper, could see a snail, {{and at the time}} she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords, by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was [...] "based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay" [...] and people [...] "must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour." [...] By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed, and understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. Firstly, the concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm; secondly, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; and thirdly, and more loosely, it being fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test) [...] however, did not crystallise until the case of Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman. A company called Caparo took over another company, by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued the accountants for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo, and established the current threefold test. Although it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable" [...] that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of [...] "proximity". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word), to say that it should not be the case that absolutely anyone hearing something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] was an extra hurdle added, as a catch all discretionary measure for the judiciary to block further claims.|$|E
