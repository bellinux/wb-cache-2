Today, the common precise process for KDP is single-point diamond turning (SPDT) [4 – 6]. Though highly successful of this technique, it would introduce turning grooves and subsurface defects via pure mechanical force which may lower the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) in strong laser application. Furthermore, the waviness errors that induced by vibration, straightness, and some other ambient factors are extremely difficult to be eliminated at present [7, 8].

40|$|The {{target of}} the project was to {{investigate}} high bitrate (#>=# 1 Gbit/s) optical interconnection networks for future high performance signal processor systems. The programme covered board-to-board interconnections and interconnections between several boards via an optical star network or an optical matrix switch. Environmental tests and system investigations should be performed using the realised demonstrators. At the beginning planar as well as fiber-optical backplane networks were considered. The realised fiberoptical demonstrators fulfilled all system demands. The constructions, however, were bulky and expensive. A planar backplane avoids these drawbacks, however, suitable low loss waveguides were lacking. In the course of the project we succeeded in reducing the attenuation of multimode polymeric stripe waveguides to the required value of 1 to 3 dB/m. With the new technology large (19 '') and complex waveguide structures can be manufactured as necessary for backplane networks. For the transition from the board to the backplane we have developed a compact and connector-free solution with free space transmission and 90 beam deflection within the backplane. The free space coupling provides easy to control positioning tolerances of #+-# 500 #mu#m in lateral and > 20. 000 #mu#m in axial direction. For board-to-board demonstrators we used at first plastic optical fibers integrated into the backplane and later on polymeric stripe waveguides, too. We have successfully demonstrated the board-to-board concept as a snap-on front-plane and as a rear-plane using standard backplane connectors. The system marigin was as high as 10 dB. Investigations concerning the feasibility of switched networks showed that only <b>electro-optical</b> <b>switch</b> matrices are useful. Using developed components and demonstrators first aging and environmental tests (temperature, humidity, dust, vibrations) have been successfully performed. In summary we have reached all relevant project goals. Decisive breakthroughs have been achieved for board-to-board coupling and in the reduction of the attenuation of polymeric stripe waveguides. Thus the feasibility of planar optical backplane networks could be demonstrated. (orig.)

40|$|The {{potential}} advantages and applications of Silicon Photonics (SiP) has initiated substantial research efforts. Silicon photonics has been favourably nominated {{to replace the}} current copper interconnects due to their high bandwidth, small footprint, and potentially low power consumption. However, {{the majority of the}} research into silicon photonics has been based on the silicon-on insulator (SOI) platform. The focus on the SOI platform has limited the design of silicon photonic devices to two-dimensional (2 D) structures. Moreover, the fabrication of optical active devices based on silicon photonics has relied on high temperature processing that is not compatible with CMOS back-end integration. New materials that are depositable at low temperatures can offer new possibilities for multi-layered, CMOS back-end compatible, and low optical loss silicon photonic devices. In this project, zinc oxide (ZnO) was investigated as a potential low temperature material whose fabrication is compatible with CMOS technology. Specifically, the naturally n-type doped ZnO can potentially form a heterojunction with p-type silicon without the need for high temperature processing. Poly-silicon is also a depositable and CMOS compatible material that can potentially form future multi-layered silicon photonic structures. However, low optical loss in poly-silicon has been based on high-temperature processing to improve the crystallinity and roughness of the deposited material. The deposition of poly-silicon in the SiP technology have been mainly carried out using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and other deposition techniques remain under investigated. In this project, ZnO was, for the first time, deposited at low-temperature (150 ?C) using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on a silicon waveguide to form a heterojunction diode capable of producing optical switching in the silicon core. Optical switching in the n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction was caused by the plasma dispersion effect. The design of the optical switch comprised a straight silicon waveguide (width = 1000 nm, height = 220 nm, slabheight = 60 nm) partially covered with a thin ZnO film (thickness = 10 nm). The commonly used highly doped p+ region {{were not included in the}} devices because of the high thermal budget (T ' 900 ?C) needed to activate the dopant. Moreover, the aluminium (Al) metal contacts were not annealed because the annealing temperature (Ts = 425 ?C) exceeds the high-temperature threshold (Ts = 400 ?C). An extinction ratio of ~ 10 dB was achieved for a 1 mm long device at 20 V forward-bias. This result can be expressed as a figure of merit of 5 dB/cm. V. The insertion loss of the device was estimated to be ~ 1 : 2 dB. The maximum switching speed of the devices was found to be ~ 1 MHz. Al-though this performance is inferior to the state-of-the-art silicon optical switches, it offers the first silicon-based <b>electro-optical</b> <b>switch</b> fabricated at low-temperatures with low insertion loss. Detailed analysis of the I-V and switching characteristics of the device revealed large series resistance and capacitance. It was also found that the switching speed is primarily governed by the RC time constant of the device rather than the minority carrier lifetime. This fact has led us to believe that the device functions as both injection and accumulation electro-absorption switch. A thin SiO 2 layer is suspected to form at the ZnO/Si interface that facilitates the accumulation operation of the device and increases the RC time constant. The first low loss and low-temperature poly-silicon waveguides are demonstrated in this project. Hot-wire chemical vapour deposition (HWCVD) was used to deposit poly-silicon films at 240 ?C. The propagation loss of the TE mode for a 600 by 220 nm waveguide was 13 : 5 dB/cm. Detailed simulation analysis revealed that at least 60 % of the loss was caused by the roughness of the top surface of the waveguides. The RMS roughness was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and was found to be 8 : 9 nm. Optimisation of the design, the deposition process, and the reduction of the top surface roughness, through surface planarisation, led to a reduction in the propagation loss of the TE mode to ~ 8 : 5 dB/cm while still maintaining low deposition temperature of 360 ?C. The crystal volume fraction of the optimised poly-silicon film was found to be ~ 96 %. An <b>electro-optical</b> <b>switch</b> based on ZnO and poly-silicon heterojunction was fabricated on a multi-layered poly silicon structure. However, there were problems with the metal contact pads as well as the thickness of the first poly-silicon layer. Future work will focus on improving the n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction electro-optical performance by adapting an accumulation type structure as well as optimising the multi-layered poly-silicon platform. <br/...|$|E
30|$|It {{is known}} that the {{absorption}} and the dispersion properties of a weak probe field can be modified effectively by atomic coherence and quantum interference [1 – 5]. Atomic coherence {{can be achieved by}} the strong coupling fields, the spontaneous emission and incoherent pumping fields. It {{is known that}} atomic coherence due to the coherent laser field has essential roles for modifying the optical properties of atomic systems such as spontaneously generated coherence (SGC) [1], lasing without inversion [2], modifying spontaneous emission [3], coherent population trapping (CPT) [5], optical bistability [6 – 10] and so on [11 – 16]. furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} quantum interference arising from SGC [8] and incoherent pumping field [17] can be used for analyse of some interesting phenomena such as lasing without population inversion [4], optical bistability [17], and superluminal/subluminal light propagation [18]. Similar phenomena involving quantum coherence in solid state systems such as semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) and quantum dots (QDs) [19], can also be occurred [20, 21]. In the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in optical properties of quantum dot molecules (QDMs) and quantum wells (QWs), due to important role in optoelectronic devices. Recently, investigators have examined the effects of an external field and inter-dot tunnel coupling on the optical properties of QDs and QWs [22 – 28]. Quantum well semiconductors were chosen because of their advantage in flexible design, controllable interference strength, long dephasing times [29, 30], large dephasing rates [~ 10  ps- 1] [31] and large electric dipole moment which make them suitable for application in the optoelectronic devices. Quantum coherence in a QW structure can be induced by electron tunnelling or applying a laser field [32, 33]. Coherence induced by incoherent field and tunnel coupling in the QW system plays an important role in light–matter interaction and has found numerous implementations in semiconductor optics. On the other hand, coherent control [34 – 37] over the dispersive and absorptive properties of solid-state media such as photonic crystals and semiconductors has recently attracted a lot of attention [38 – 42]. Several proposals for quantum coherence and interference in QWs have been performed and analysed. To utilize the tunnelling effect, an electron is excited by a laser field, then tunnels to the second QW by controlling the external voltage between the wells [43]. An interesting application of QWs is modification of light pulse to make a fast <b>electro-optical</b> <b>switch</b> by controlling the propagation of a weak light pulse in a semiconductor system, which depends on the dispersive properties of the medium.|$|E

40|$|Industrial laser {{precision}} machining is predominately based on pulsed Nd:YAG lasers operated at a wavelength of 1. 06 µm {{in a free}} running pulse regime. The objective of this thesis work has been to investigate second and third harmonic generation for such "long pulse" Nd:YAG lasers. Visible and UV radiation can be better focused. The absorption coefficient at these wavelengths is higher in most materials. Processing at the doubled or tripled frequency increases machining precision and allows processing of new classes of materials such as, e. g., high reflective metals or ceramics. Frequency doubling and tripling of Q-switched, modelocked, or CW operated Nd:YAG lasers {{has been the subject}} of numerous publications. However, the particular problems associated with the free running pulse regime have not yet been addressed. The generation of harmonics requires a laser source that can deliver radiation with high brightness. A system based on a slab crystal with a beam quality factor of M 2 ≈ 1. 6 and a power of up to 1. 5 kW has been used in the experiments. An external <b>electro-optical</b> <b>switch</b> has been implemented in order to precisely control the laser pulse shape and duration. The non-linear coefficient and the angular acceptance have been the main criteria for selecting LBO (LiB 3 O 5), KTP (KTiOPO 4), and MgO:LiNbO 3 for the frequency conversion experiments. The conversion efficiency has been measured for these crystals as a function of the intensity at the fundamental wavelength. In contrast to simple model predictions, the efficiency does not increase linearly with intensity under long pulse conditions. An intensity dependant phase mismatch is at the origin of the deviations. A heuristic model for the efficiency prediction has been developed. It is based on a linear increase of phase mismatch with intensity and it allows describing the experimental findings with sufficient accuracy. The conversion efficiency for frequency doubling is limited to about 20 % at pulse durations of 100 µsec. It decreases with increasing pulse duration. Catastrophic thermal damage is at the origin of the limitation in this pulse regime. Our experiments indicate that the damage is initiated by the frequency doubled light. Temporary color centers are created in the presence of the second harmonic light. The dynamic of the creation and annihilation of these centers has been investigated. It could be shown that finally the absorption of the fundamental harmonic (infrared) radiation at these centers results in irreversible thermal damages. A power of 140 W in the second harmonic (178 MW/cm 2 on a waist of 5 µm) and 12 W in the third harmonic (61 MW/cm 2 in a waist of 2. 5 µm) was obtained with pulses of 200 µs.

40|$|<b>Electro-optical</b> <b>switching</b> can be {{achieved}} by changing the optical absorption of metal nanoparticles by adding or removing electrical charge, corresponding to increased, respectively, decreased electron density.

Increase and decrease in photoluminescence was observed at positive and negative applied potentials, respectively. The relation between changes of optical absorption and photoluminescence for the 5 nm particles by electrical charging provides information on the influence of the charge state on the electronic properties and therefore the optical transition probability.

40|$|Potassium dihydrogen {{phosphate}} (KDP) crystals are {{the materials}} {{of choice for}} frequency conversion and <b>electro-optical</b> <b>switching</b> incorporated in the high-power laser systems under development aiming to achieve fu-sion in the laboratory[1 – 3]. The partially deuterated KDP (DKDP) crystal was used as tripler frequency converter to minimize an otherwise strong transverse stimulated Raman scattering[4, 5]. However, a key factor limiting the energy produced by the high-power lasers is the weak resistance of the crystal to laser damage. It is therefore necessary to improve laser damage resistance through optimizing crystal growth conditions. Laser-induced damage is observed in {{the bulk of the}} best current KDP material at laser fluences estimat-ed to be more than one order of magnitude below th...|$|R
