The examples include raising <b>false</b> accusations, <b>barring</b> access to journals, suppressing papers and data, and ostracizing and persecuting scientists interested in the topic. The intensity of fear and vituperation caused by parapsychology research is disproportionate even to the possibility that the psi hypothesis could be completely wrong, so I speculate on the psychological reasons that may give rise to it. There are very few circumstances in which censorship might be appropriate, and the actions by parapsychology censors put them at odds not only with the history of science but with the history of modern liberal societies.

This method is rarely used due to its complexity and the result loss of time (Dammeier et al. 2011; Colombero et al. 2016; Chen and Holland, 2016), especially when traces are affected by ambient noise. On the other hand, where {{a large number of}} data are not involved, the manual procedure can be a good compromise since it <b>bars</b> <b>false</b> misrepresents and allow some considerations concerning seismic noise and signal amplitude. Once the manual picking procedure has been carried out, the proposed method results to be very quick and practical, allowing localization without the need to study waveform, frequency content or amplitude, that can be required in other methods (e.g. the polarization analysis).|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{courts have}} {{divided on the}} {{constitutionality}} of laws regulating false campaign speech, with some courts upholding some false campaign speech laws and other courts striking them down. This past June, however, the Supreme Court issued an opinion in U. S. v. Alvarez, a case which no doubt will cause courts to reconsider the constitutionality of such laws. Although Alvarez did not involve campaign speech, the Supreme Court discussed the general question whether the Constitution protects knowing lies {{in the context of}} a federal law <b>barring</b> <b>false</b> statements about military honors. The Court issued no majority opinion, but all of the opinions had something to say about laws regulating false speech generally, and Justice Breyer’s opinion (for himself and Justice Kagan) cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of many laws regulating false campaign (and possibly false election) speech. The upshot of Alvarez is that laws regulating false campaign speech are in even more constitutional trouble than they were before, and that any attempts to regulate such speech will have to be narrow, targeted, and careful in its choice of remedies. Part I of this article briefly describes the pre-Alvarez split in the lower courts on the regulation of false campaign and election speech, and the arguments which had been advanced for and against the constitutionality of regulating false campaign speech. Part II describes the Supreme Court’s fractured opinion in U. S. v. Alvarez. Part III discusses how Alvarez may affect the constitutional calculus in the false campaign speech arena and argues that, in light of Alvarez courts should hold unconstitutional most broad state laws <b>barring</b> <b>false</b> speech in campaigns. But courts should reject challenges to narrower laws which, under an actual malice/clear and convincing evidence standard, (1) <b>bar</b> <b>false</b> (though not misleading) election speech about the mechanics of voting, such as false statements about the date and time of voting; (2) give a government election authority the power to reject false campaign speech submitted for official ballot materials; and (3) allow a jury to punish defamatory speech about candidates made with actual malice. Each of these proposed laws is consistent with the plurality’s and Justice Breyer’s opinions in Alvarez, although the defamation issue is somewhat in question. The hardest case is whether the government has authority to enjoin or punish non-defamatory false campaign speech made with knowledge of falsity (actual malice) which has the potential to trick or defraud voters into changing their votes. Consider, for example, the false statement of a judicial candidate on a campaign poster that she is an incumbent judge, or a statement that the president has endorsed her for office. While the case is close, I argue that following Alvarez, courts are likely to conclude that the risks of allowing the government to punish or enjoin false campaign speech process outweigh the benefits of providing voters with truthful information. Further, the narrower solution to the problem of this type of false campaign speech is counterspeech from opposing candidates and the media, as well as the use of a government “truth commission” with the power to declare, before the election but subject to judicial review, that campaign speech is false...|$|R
40|$|On February 29, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Cause of Action v. Chicago Transit Authority {{held that}} {{information}} disclosed {{to a government}} official and acted upon by that official has been publicly disclosed, barring a qui tam action from being brought under the False Claims Act. Several other circuits, including the First, Fourth, and Sixth, in contrast, have all interpreted the public disclosure <b>bar</b> within the <b>False</b> Claims Act to require a disclosure of information beyond the government. This Comment argues {{that the majority of}} circuit courts have correctly interpreted the <b>False</b> Claims Act. <b>Barring</b> qui tam actions when the government is in possession of information is in line with the now abolished government knowledge bar.

60|$|Thus I {{came out}} of the contest a loser, but as a {{compensation}} had the knowledge that my physicians were <b>false</b> prophets; that, <b>barring</b> accidents, I could count on thirty, forty, even fifty years with their summers and autumns and winters. And that was the life I desired-- the life the heart can conceive--the earth life. When I hear people say they have not found the world and life so agreeable or interesting as to be in love with it, or that they look with equanimity to its end, I am apt to think they have never been properly alive nor seen with clear vision the world they think so meanly of, or anything in it--not a blade of grass. Only I know that mine is an exceptional case, that the visible world is to me more beautiful and interesting than to most persons, that the delight I experienced in my communing with Nature did not pass away, leaving nothing but a recollection of vanished happiness to intensify a present pain. The happiness was never lost, but owing to that faculty I have spoken of, had a cumulative effect on the mind and was mine again, so that in my worst times, when I was compelled to exist shut out from Nature in London for long periods, sick and poor and friendless, I could yet always feel that it was infinitely better to be than not to be.|$|R
5000|$|As a firm {{they handled}} cases for clients {{who could not}} qualify for {{government}} grants despite moderate incomes. Bates and O’steen decided that, rather than charge expensive fees for their services, they would focus on a large volume of cases in order to generate their income; as such, the firm focused its practice on low-fee cases such as uncontested divorces, adoptions, simple bankruptcy cases, and name changes. They realized {{that in order to}} obtain the necessary volume they needed to advertise their name and their services to the public. Bates and O’steen placed an advertisement in the Arizona Republic on February 22, 1976. The State Bar acted reviewed the case. Both Bates and O'steen were suspended from practicing law for six months in accordance with the regulations of the State Bar of Arizona. Bates and O'steen petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court to review their case on the grounds that a total ban on advertisement violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state supreme court rejected both of their claims, but did reduce their suspensions, in part, because the court believed that Bates and O’steen advertised as a way to test the constitutionality of the ban on advertising within the legal industry. The Supreme Court of the United States recognized that they had the power to review judicial decisions of lower courts and set the case for argument. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger threw out the claim that a total ban on advertising by lawyers and law firms was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. He based his position on the precedent set in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. This case set the precedent that [...] "lawyers engage in trade or commerce," [...] and lawyers and the practice of law were therefore NOT exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act. On the claim of the violation of free speech, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bates and O'steen, stating that Arizona's ban of advertising [...] "inhibited the free flow of information and kept the public in ignorance". The Supreme Court therefore removed the ban on advertising. However, they still allowed the State Bar to [...] "regulate" [...] advertising in order to make certain that the information presented was true and did not mislead others or make <b>false</b> claims. State <b>bar</b> associations across the country quickly began to lift their bans on advertising.|$|R
40|$|The mass {{distribution}} of disk galaxies is usually determined {{through the use}} of rotation curves. This determination relies on two key assumptions; that the gas moves on circular orbits and that this motion traces the underlying gravitational potential. In the case of barred spiral galaxies the first assumption is <b>false</b> as the <b>bar</b> induces non-circular streaming motions in the gas. Therefore, the rotation curves of barred galaxies need to be corrected for the non-circular motions before being used for mass model analysis. In this dissertation, we use numerical simulations to quantify and correct for the non-circular flows induced by a bar. The aim is to investigate and quantify the effect of the bar properties on the amplitude of the non-circular motions. This is done by comparing the observational data such as rotation curves and bar properties with the kinematics and bar properties obtained from mocked galaxies. In chapter III, we examine the performance of ROTCUR and DISKFIT for deriving rotation curves from velocity maps of barred spiral galaxies using mock observations. Our results confirm that ROTCUR under-/overestimates measured rotation curves if the bar is aligned with one of the symmetry axes. The DISKFIT algorithm, which is specifically designed for barred galaxies only works for galaxies of intermediate bar orientations. In chapter IV, we quantify the magnitude of the non-circular flows and constraint the range of bar orientation angles where DiskFit fails by using Tree-SPH simulations from the GalMer database by Chilingarian et al. (2010). We found that the rotation curve obtained from ROTCUR was 40 % smaller/larger than the expected velocities calculated from the gravitational potential when the bar is aligned with the major/minor axis. For the DISKFIT analysis, we found that DiskFit produces unrealistic values for all the models when the bar is within ten degrees of the symmetry axes. New hydrodynamic simulations of three disc galaxies (NGC 1300, NGC 1530 and NGC 3621) are presented in chapter IV. Our objective is to create more realistic simulated galaxies that replicate the bar properties and velocity elds of the galaxies of our sample. The initial conditions for our simulations are determined through a Bayesian analysis of the azimuthally averaged rotation curve, the stellar surface brightness, and the gas surface density. The parameters posterior distribution functions (PDFs) combine with the disc stability parameters PDFs are used as criterion to select the model parameters. The velocities of the gas particles are transformed into velocity maps and compared with the observed galaxies. We are able to reproduce the bar properties and kinematics of the three galaxies in our sample. These findings imply that a tailored simulation is an effective way of investigating non-circular flows in disc galaxies especially when the bar orientation is close to the minor or major kinematical axis of the galaxy...|$|R
