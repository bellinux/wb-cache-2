Heisman didn't say anything, I guess {{he thought a}} great deal. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{afterwards}} {{that he had never}} felt so sorry for a man on a football field as he had for Suter at that moment.|$|E
5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, I told him I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that nothing could be worse than his fear of an elevator.|$|E
25|$|But once I {{caught him}} when he was open like Silenus' statues, and I had a glimpse of the figures he keeps hidden within: they were so godlike – so bright and beautiful, so utterly amazing – that I no longer had a choice. I just had to do {{whatever}} <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the entire}} period of our marriage, he showed no {{interest}} in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he didn't want the responsibility. Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.|$|E

25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that, in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could {{be done on the}} three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train {{with some of the}} best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E
500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not to say anything.

According to The Daily Telegraph, before her marriage, Susan was [...] "a beauty queen turned lingerie model" [...] who [...] "launched a fashion business". The couple met in Spain, where Susan had a bridal wear company, when Gunn was there on holiday.

500|$|Although {{everyone}} {{active in}} the movement was aware of it, [...] he was never explicitly out of the closet. He took his sexual orientation as an affliction, a source of pain and embarrassment. In part, perhaps, {{because he was so}} unreconciled to his longings, he limited himself {{for a long time to}} brief encounters. But then he became involved with one of the YPSL's and was compelled to seek the counsel of a psychiatrist to explain his unfamiliar feelings. The diagnosis, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> was [...] "you’re in love." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E

The chairman told me that Costa has proved he's not fit {{to be part of}} the Scolari family, that he would contaminate the family because he's not committed to Brazil, but to Spain. He rejected his Brazilian citizenship.
