5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>night</b> and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

2500|$|Faced with {{deadlock}} {{and persuaded}} by Bernetti to keep Lambruschini from being elected pope, liberals and moderates decided {{to cast their}} votes for Mastai-Ferretti {{in a move that}} contradicted the general mood throughout Europe. By {{the second day of the}} conclave, on 16 June 1846, during an evening ballot, Mastai-Ferretti was elected pope. [...] "He was a glamorous candidate, ardent, emotional with a gift for friendship and a track-record of generosity even towards anti-Clericals and Carbonari. He was a patriot, known to be critical of Gregory XVI." [...] Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>night,</b> no formal announcement was given, just the signal of white smoke. Many Catholics had assumed that Gizzi had been elected pope. In fact, celebrations began to take place in his hometown, and his personal staff, following a long-standing tradition, burned his cardinalitial vestments.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 January French troops {{pushed back}} the British {{outposts}} on the higher range and gradually took up position there. A counterattack by British 5th Foot was repulsed with heavy loss. [...] Soult sited his 11 heavy guns upon the rocky outcrop {{from where they}} would be able to fire upon the British right. [...] The task was very difficult and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>night</b> before the guns had been dragged into position. Delaborde's division was posted on the right and Merle's in the centre with Mermet on the left. The light field guns of the French were distributed across the front of their position, however the broken ground, sunken roads and walls limited them to long range support. The French cavalry was deployed to the east of the line. For the British, Baird's division formed on the right and Hope's the left, each deploying a brigade en potence with Paget as the reserve at the village Airis.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 September, U-607 {{departed}} St Nazaire {{on active}} patrol, returning on 23 October. During the patrol she sank one ship. On 23 September, U-607 was rammed by a destroyer and slightly damaged. U-607 suffered heavy damage when she attacked Convoy SC 104 On 11 October. Fourteen depth charges were fired by , firstly at a [...] {{and again at}} [...] The boat descended {{to a depth of}} [...] before she could be brought under control. The badly damaged boat was brought to the surface, evading detection as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>night.</b> U-607 had suffered damage to her communication systems, depth gauges, depth rudder, engines and rudder. It took some time to make temporary repairs. Leutnant (Ing.) (Engineering Lieutenant) Russ openly quarrelled with Mengersen over the incident, which was witnessed by some of the ship's crew and a propaganda photographer who was on board. On returning to St Nazaire, Russ was court-Martialled and found guilty of insubordination. He was dismissed from the Kriegsmarine and sentenced to eight months fortress confinement and four months imprisonment. U-607 took six weeks to repair at St Nazaire.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "A light ( [...] , tzohar) shall you {{make to the}} Ark," [...] in [...] to teach that God instructed Noah to set therein luminous precious stones and jewels, {{so that they might}} give light as bright as noon ( [...] , tzaharayim). Similarly, Rav Achava bar Zeira taught that when Noah entered the Ark, he brought precious stones and jewels with him to keep track of day and night. When the jewels shone dimly, he knew that it was daytime, and when they shone brightly, he knew that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>night.</b> The Gemara noted that it was important for Noah {{to be able to tell}} day from night, for some animals eat only during the day, and others east only during the night, and thus Noah could determine the proper feeding times for the animals under his care. The Gemara noted that if in [...] God told Noah, [...] "A window shall you make to the ark," [...] then Noah should have been able to tell day from night. The Gemara explained that Noah needed the jewels because the account of Noah bringing jewels into the Ark followed the view that the celestial bodies — including the sun — did not serve during the year of the Flood. (Thus, no sunlight entered the Ark, and [...] must refer to jewels rather than a window.). Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2011[...]|$|E
