Even as late as 15 September 2014, the web site of the Central Water Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India, <b>Flood</b> <b>Forecast</b> Bulletins, showed a blank. The Disaster Management Division which is responsible for compiling inputs from all the agencies in a 'Situation report', in its situation report for 2 September 2014, made no mention of the threat of rain or floods in Jammu and Kashmir. As a result, two days later as the water levels rose and the rivers were in spate, and overflowing, there were no National Disaster Response Force assets at hand in Jammu and Kashmir. They started to move days after the floods had hit the state, and only began to arrive in the affected area on 7 and 8 September. The first Situation report of the Disaster Management Division that mentions the floods is dated 7 September. The web site of the DM Division as late as 15 September was a blank. In 2010, Jammu and Kashmir Flood Control Department had forecast major floods which would ravage Srinagar. But the government dismissed the report as alarmist.

To quantify the rainfall forecast uncertainty itself {{and its impact on the}} total <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> uncertainty, a Monte-Carlo based statistical method has been developed. This method takes into account the dependency of the rainfall forecast error with the lead time and the rainfall amount. The forecasted rainfall errors are described by truncated normal distributions, allowing to quantify the full uncertainty distribution of the deterministic rainfall forecast. By means of Monte-Carlo sampling and taking the forecast error autocorrelation into account, the impact of the rainfall forecast uncertainty on a <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> was quantified. This was done for the Rivierbeek river in Belgium. In addition, comparison was made between the total <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> uncertainty and the uncertainty due to the forecasted rainfall.

However, meteorological and hydrological station networks in such river basins were usually poor. Some of them were newly-built only several years ago so that long-series observations are unavailable; and therefore, {{it is impossible to}} gain the most suitable parameters for <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> from the historical data directly. This paper developed a rolling <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> method for such regions, taking the Leli River basin in Guangxi Province, China, as the study area. The Digital Yellow River Integrated Model (DYRIM) was adopted to simulate the streamflows of the Tianlin hydrological station for each flood during the study period, and the model parameters were rolling optimized in real time as follows. First, the parameters were calibrated with the observed rainfall and streamflow data of the first flood, and they were used to forecast the flood caused by the next rain. Second, when the rain came true, the parameters were modified with the newly-observed rainfall and streamflow data if the simulation result obtained with the parameters of the last flood was not satisfied; and the new parameters would be used to forecast the next flood. Through repeating the above two steps for each flood, the parameters may be optimized constantly; and finally, the value ranges of the parameters could be obtained. From a sample demonstration, it can be concluded that this <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> method was feasible; it would be valuable for the <b>flood</b> <b>forecast</b> of river basins with newly-built meteorological and hydrological station network...|$|E

40|$|Physically based {{distributed}} hydrological models (hereafter {{referred to}} as PBDHMs) divide the terrain of the whole catchment {{into a number of}} grid cells at fine resolution and assimilate different terrain data and precipitation to different cells. They are regarded to have the potential to improve the catchment hydrological process simulation and prediction capability. In the early stage, physically based distributed hydrological models are assumed to derive model parameters from the terrain properties directly, so {{there is no need to}} calibrate model parameters. However, unfortunately the uncertainties associated with this model derivation are very high, which impacted their application in <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting,</b> so parameter optimization may also be necessary. There are two main purposes for this study: the first is to propose a parameter optimization method for physically based distributed hydrological models in catchment <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting</b> by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and to test its competence and to improve its performances; the second is to explore the possibility of improving physically based distributed hydrological model capability in catchment <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting</b> by parameter optimization. In this paper, based on the scalar concept, a general framework for parameter optimization of the PBDHMs for catchment <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting</b> is first proposed that could be used for all PBDHMs. Then, with the Liuxihe model as the study model, which is a physically based distributed hydrological model proposed for catchment <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting,</b> the improved PSO algorithm is developed for the parameter optimization of the Liuxihe model in catchment <b>flood</b> <b>forecasting.</b> The improvements include adoption of the linearly decreasing inertia weight strategy to change the inertia weight and the arccosine function strategy to adjust the acceleration coefficients.
