40|$|Abstract—In most {{countries}} today, handwritten, paper-based medical prescriptions are the norm. While {{efforts have been}} made in the past and are being made at present to migrate toward <b>electronic</b> <b>dispensation</b> of prescriptions, these have generally omitted to incorporate ubiquitous computing technology in their proposed solutions. In this paper, we focus on this issue and describe a Jini-based prototypical solution for electronic prescriptions, which allows for their wireless transmission to in-range pharmacies and the augmentation of the service levels rendered to the user, with, for instance, information about queue lengths and estimated waiting times being provided to the patients. Clinical and user evaluation revealed that there were high levels of agreement as regards the prototype’s effectiveness, ease of use, and usefulness.

30|$|Data on {{analgesic}} and anticholinergic medication usage {{while in}} the hospital was collected via the aid of an <b>electronic</b> medication <b>dispensation</b> and recording system. Medications that were recorded included all opiate analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (in the form of intravenous ketorolac) and anticholinergic medication (in the form of oral oxybutynin 5  mg).|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Chronic use of imatinib confers an {{important}} survival benefit {{for individuals with}} chronic myeloid leukemia. In Saskatchewan, the provincial cancer agency addresses important barriers to adherence by providing imatinib at no cost through specialized cancer centers. Objective: To describe adherence to imatinib dispensed through the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. Study design and methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of <b>electronic</b> pharmacy <b>dispensation</b> records from the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. All dispensations for imatinib classified for hematologic malignancies were electron-ically abstracted by cancer center personnel and securely forwarded to investigators with all meaningful patient iden-tifiers removed. All subjects receiving a new dispensation (i. e. using a 6 -month washout period) for imatinib betwee...|$|R
