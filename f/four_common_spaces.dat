A political and economic union of former Soviet states named the Eurasian Economic Union was established in 2015, similar in concept to the EU.|$|E
50|$|The Moscow Summit in May 2005 {{adopted a}} single package of Road Maps for the {{creation}} of the <b>four</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces.</b> These expand on the ongoing cooperation as described above, set out further specific objectives, and determine the actions necessary to make the common spaces a reality. They thereby determine the agenda for co-operation between the EU and Russia for the medium-term.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{preparation}} {{stages of the}} ENP, Russia insisted {{on the creation of}} the <b>four</b> EU-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> instead of ENP participation, as it saw the ENP as [...] "unequal" [...] arrangement with a dominant role of the EU. In the framework of the EU-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> in May 2005, a roadmap was adopted with similar content to the ENP Action Plans. Both the ENP and the EU-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> are implemented by the EU through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.|$|R
5000|$|In recent history, such {{agreements}} {{have been}} signed {{as part of}} two EU policies: Stabilisation and Association Process (SAp) and European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The countries of the western Balkans (official candidates Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, and potential candidates Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) are covered by SAp and the EU signs [...] "Stabilisation and Association Agreements" [...] (SAA) with them. The countries of the Mediterranean (Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia) and Eastern Europe neighbours (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, but excluding Russia that insists on creating <b>four</b> EU-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces)</b> are covered by ENP. Seven of the Mediterranean states have a [...] "Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association" [...] (EMAA) in force, while another has an interim EMAA in force. Several of the Eastern Partnership states are ratifying or negotiating AAs.|$|R
50|$|Russian-European {{relations}} are the international {{relations between the}} European Union (EU) and its largest bordering state, the Russian Federation, to the east. The relations of individual member states of the European Union and Russia vary, though a 1990s common foreign policy outline towards Russia was the first such EU foreign policy agreed. Furthermore, <b>four</b> European Union-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> are agreed {{as a framework for}} establishing better relations. The latest EU-Russia strategic partnership was signed in 2011, but it was later challenged by the European Parliament in 2015 following the annexation of Crimea and war in Donbass.|$|R
50|$|At the St. Petersburg Summit in May 2003, the EU and Russia {{agreed to}} {{reinforce}} their co-operation by creating, {{in the long}} term, <b>four</b> <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> {{in the framework of}} the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1997: a common economic space; a common space of freedom, security and justice; a space of co-operation in the field of external security; and a space of research, education, and cultural exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Russian {{permanent}} {{representative to the}} EU [...] commented on this by saying that Russia has no plans of joining the EU. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia joining the EU {{would not be in}} the interests of either Russia or the EU, although he advocated close integration in various dimensions including establishment of <b>four</b> <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> between Russia and the EU, including united economic, educational and scientific spaces as it was declared in the agreement in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Russia {{has chosen}} not to {{participate}} in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), as it aspires to be an [...] "equal partner" [...] of the EU (as opposed to the [...] "junior partnership" [...] that Russia sees in the ENP). Consequently, Russia and the European Union agreed to create <b>four</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> for cooperation in different spheres. In practice there are no substantial differences (besides naming) between the sum of these agreements and the ENP Action Plans (adopted jointly by the EU and its ENP partner states). In both cases the final agreement is based on provisions from the EU acquis communautaire and is jointly discussed and adopted. For this reason, the Common Spaces receive funding from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which also funds the ENP.|$|E
50|$|According to the European Union's {{official}} site, {{the objective}} of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is to share the benefits of the EU's 2004 enlargement with neighbouring countries. It is also designed to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours. The vision is that of a ring of countries, drawn into further integration, but without necessarily becoming full members of the European Union. The policy was first outlined by the European Commission on March 2003. The countries covered include all of the Mediterranean shores of Africa and Asia, as well as the European CIS states (with the exception of Russia and Kazakhstan) in the Caucasus and eastern Europe. Russia insisted on the creation of the <b>four</b> EU-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> instead of ENP participation. Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry has expressed interest in the ENP http://www.eu.int/comm/external_relations/kazakhstan/intro/index.htm. Some MEPs also discussed Kazakhstan's inclusion in the ENP.|$|R
50|$|In recent history, such {{agreements}} are signed {{as part of}} two EU policies: Stabilisation and Association process (SAp) and European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The countries of the Mediterranean and the East European EU neighbours (including South Caucasus, but excluding Russia that insists on creating <b>four</b> EU-Russia <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces)</b> are covered by ENP through the External Relations directorate-general. In the ENP Association Agreements (as in similar AAs signed with Mexico and other states) {{there is no mention}} of EU membershipâ€”this is a concern only to the European ENP states, because for the Mediterranean it is obvious that they cannot join the union in its current form because they are not located in Europe. The ENP AAs are similar to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements signed with CIS states in the 1990s and to the multiple other AAs governing the relations between the EU and other third countries. The ENP stipulates that after signing of AA with a particular country the EU will make a Country Report and then the two sides will agree on an Action Plan drafted by the EU (including particular reforms, actions and also aid by the EU) for the next three to five years.|$|R

40|$|The 10 th {{anniversary of}} the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and Russia, which falls on 1 December 2007, is already {{prompting}} thoughts on whether and how to replace it. This raises basic issues about the form, purpose and content of bilateral treaties {{in the context of}} an integrating Europe. This Policy Brief looks at the relative merits of 6 possible scenarios: 1. Retire the PCA without replacement 2. Extend the status quo 3. Extend the status quo, adding a Political Declaration on Strategic Partnership 4. Replace the PCA with a short Treaty on Strategic Partnership 5. Replace the PCA with a comprehensive Treaty on Strategic Partnership 6. Negotiate a Treaty of Strategic Union We argue that the model of the comprehensive multi-sectoral treaty, well known to the EU and its neighbours that aspire to membership, is not suited to the case of Russia, which is not an applicant for membership. Attempts to produce weaker derivatives of this model result in long-winded and pretentious texts that are thin or devoid of legally-binding substance. The treaty form also involves extremely long and risky ratification procedures on the side of the EU and its member states, and is extremely inflexible, even possibly becoming outdated before entry into force. For the foreseeable future, it would be best to focus efforts on concrete, sector-specific agreements. We advocate a three-stage concept, starting with an extended status quo in the short-run (scenario 2), trying to give useful effect to the <b>four</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> agreed in May 2005 and various sector-specific agreements. This could lead on in the medium-term to a Political Declaration on Strategic Partnership (scenario 3) to revise and update priorities after Russiaâ€™s WTO accession and more experience with the <b>four</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces.</b> In the long term, we would like to see a Treaty of Strategic Union (scenario 6), as and when there is a greater convergence and mutual trust on matters of political values...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the development of}} the Strategic thinking of the European Union towards Russia {{from the beginning of the}} 1990 s till 2004. The paper recognized the existence of the three main strategies: bilateral one, multilateral and special one. The first strategy is characterized by giving the priority directly to the relationship between Russia and the member states of the EU. The Russian Federation neglected the existence of the European Union as an independent actor on the international scene during the 90 s. The specific example of such a behavior could be the relationship between Russia and Germany. This fact makes it more difficult for the EU to promote the coherent strategy of the European Union as a whole towards Russia. Due to the disgruntlement and frequent clashes between Russia and the EU, the two entities decided to use the so called special strategy in their relations. This strategy is based namely on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and on the Concept of the <b>Four</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> which began to be developed in 2000. The Union's eastern enlargement paved the way for the qualitative change in the strategic thinking of the European Union. Polish government proposed new concept, so called "Eastern dimension" of the European Union. This initiative gave the impulses for the evolution [...] ...|$|E
40|$|EU Enlargement is a {{consequence}} of the success story of the creation of the European Communities, as many applicant countries were attracted to the new legal order based on the rule of law, rather than to an order or disorder based on the rule of politics. As from May 1 st 2004, the EU enlargement, unprecedented in its size, marks a historic milestone for the European Union and its Member States, and also for the whole continent. Given this new context, the EU has to find and define new cooperation partnerships with its neighbours. A major partner, not to be neglected in this new policy is by all means Russia. The first Summit between the enlarged EU and Russia held in Moscow on 21 May 2004 was the first high-level meeting of the 25 EU and Russia following the successful conclusion of negotiations between the European Commission and Russia on the extension of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) to the ten new EU Member States. The Summit calls for the reinforcement of EU-Russia relations via the creation of Four Common Spaces: a common economic space (with specific reference to environment and energy); a common space of Freedom, Security and Justice; a field of external security; as well as a space of research and education including culture. The next step will be to define shared priorities and concrete measures for each of the <b>Four</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Spaces</b> in a mutually agreed Action Plan...|$|E
40|$|This {{second issue}} of the EU-Russia Centre Review {{is devoted to the}} future of EU-Russia relations. There is hardly a more {{important}} subject for the EU than the relationship with its large neighbour and the important policy areas that include political and security cooperation, trade and economic affairs, energy, justice and home affairs, education, culture, science and technology. It is no secret that both the EU and Russia have been disappointed with progress under previous agreements. Both the 1997 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) and the 1999 strategic partnership have {{failed to live up to}} expectations. In the negotiations which the EU hopes to start with Russia early next year, there is an opportunity both for stocktaking and to move forward into a broader framework for a deeper partnership. But what type of agreement should replace the PCA and what are the implications? This is the theme of the article by Sami Andoura and Marius Vahl who consider a number of options including abandoning the PCA, extending it or replacing it with a new type of agreement. In discussing the alternatives the authors examine the legal basis for any accord and their analysis quickly reveals the complexity of the {{issue of the}} treaty article on which the EU should base the new agreement. They conclude that the perennial question of the competence of the EU and its member states inevitably arises as the EU is likely to seek a comprehensive, mixed, multi-pillar agreement that will require ratification by all 25, (soon 27) member states and the European Parliament. Katinka Barysch touches on the prospects for the common economic space. She also argues that progress in EU-Russia relations has been frustratingly slow and outlines the thinking behind the move towards establishing the common economic space. Initially, a working group report led to the adoption of the <b>four</b> <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> at the 2003 St Petersburg EU-Russia summit. Then further road maps were developed and endorsed by the 2005 Moscow summit The author notes the limited achievements in the field of regulatory convergence, but insists that this is a key point for future cooperation. She also argues that a common economic space could help Russia diversify away from its current over-dependence on oil and gas in its economic structure. She reaches the conclusion that the problem is that the EU has limited means to influence Moscow to move in this direction and Moscow has no say in the formulation of EU rules and regulations. Russian perspectives on the future of EU-Russia relations are reviewed by Nadia Arbatova. She argues that the relationship is at a crossroads, and there are two possibilities - each going their own way or coming together to seek a partnership of equals. Russia is still searching for its true identity, while the EU itself is suffering an identity crisis as a result of difficulties with the constitutional treaty. Nevertheless, the author is confident that there will be a new extended treaty, as this possibility is supported by the Kremlin, leading ministries and business. The birth of a new strategic partnership between the EU and Russia could help lead towards a more open and transparent Russia. Arkady Moshes takes stock of the cooperation between the EU and Russia in foreign and security policy. He argues that, while it may look good on paper, the reality is different, with very little practical cooperation between the two sides. The author attributes this to a number of reasons including the lack of consensus within the foreign policy elite in Moscow, the impact of EU enlargement, differences over the shared neighbourhood and doubts about the EU as a cohesive actor. Moshes argues that the list of shared foreign and security policy interests between the EU and Russia is very long and if the internal problems on both sides could be overcome then cooperation could grow quickly. However, based on present trends this area is unlikely to be at the forefront of the relationship. Andrew Monaghan covers a rapidly growing priority area in the relationship, namely energy. He details the concern in the EU after Russiaâ€™s behaviour towards Ukraine in January 2006 and the veiled threats that Russia could easily divert its oil and gas supplies to Asia. The author argues that Russia is unlikely to try and blackmail the EU as it needs Europe for finance and technology to renew its outdated infrastructure. Asia is not, he believes an alternative to Europe, given the lack of pipelines to Asia and concerns about China. Prospects for closer EU-Russia energy cooperation are fairly good but several problems must be tackled, including Russian accession to, or observance of, the Energy Charter, more transparency in both cases and measures to ensure the sustainability of Russian gas supplies. Above all, he states, the EU needs to establish an internal energy policy if it wants to pursue a coherent external energy policy. Mark Entin reviews the rather limited cooperation between the EU and Russia in the fields of education, culture, science, research and technology. Both appear to be aware of existing problems and several working groups and commissions have been established to consider ways to expand cooperation. One of the main problem areas is the non-recognition of Russian degrees in the EU. Another issue hindering contact and progress, is the dismal lack of EU students studying Russia. But the author concludes on an optimistic note, believing that the potential in these areas is very high. Olga Potemkina assesses cooperation in the sensitive areas of justice and home affairs. She notes that this is a rapidly growing area of interaction even though this is not a priority in the current PCA. She discusses the prospects for visa-free travel between the EU and Russia and notes that both sides have a vital interest in tackling issues such as terrorism, drugs, human trafficking, etc., together. The author also notes the inherent problems of the Russian judicial system, still struggling to reform itself into a genuine independent structure. Finally, Marie Mendras argues that President Putin's Russia is authoritarian and clannish, controlled by powerful elite groups with little real interest in promoting a more open relationship with neighbouring Europe. She believes that the EU's inability to forge a common foreign policy towards Russia hinders progress still further and is a result of its lack of commitment, energy and invention. Older member states are criticised as reluctant to provoke the Putin administration, and this lack of any real engagement makes it easier for Russia to hide behind a curtain of isolationist rhetoric, designed mainly for home consumption. Any fresh impetus will have to come from the new, more outspoken and critical, EU members who are not afraid to bring issues to the table. The collection of articles in this Review provides a comprehensive overview of the state of EU-Russia relations on the eve of momentous negotiations to replace the PCA. They are all tinged with a healthy dose of reality, pointing to the opportunities to develop a new and genuine strategic partnership â€“ if the necessary political will is there on both sides. It is to be hoped that our political leaders seize the opportunity...|$|E

With parallel to such development available lands become invaluable physical resource. This matter pushes to minimize allocation of spaces in designing. With growing land value, maximum use of space becomes essential feature in designing. It minimizes circulation spaces in a building. As a result the concept of "interesting place making" has to be purposely neglected by architects to overcome functional aims. Above reasons cause to create failure building products.
