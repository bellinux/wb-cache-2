60|$|The skipper never {{interfered}} with {{the affairs of the}} engine-room, and Mr. Wardrop--an artist in his profession--turned to and composed a work terrible and forbidding. His background was the dark-grained sides of the engine-room; his material the metals of power and strength, helped out with spars, baulks, and ropes. The man-of-war towed sullenly and viciously. The Haliotis behind her hummed like a hive before swarming. With extra and totally unneeded spars her crew blocked up the space round the forward engine till it resembled a statue in its scaffolding, and the butts of the shores {{interfered with}} every view that a dispassionate eye might wish to take. And that the dispassionate mind might be swiftly shaken out of its calm, the well-sunk bolts of the shores were wrapped round untidily with loose ends of ropes, giving a studied effect of most dangerous insecurity. Next, Mr. Wardrop took up a collection from the after-engine, which, as you will remember, had not been affected in the general wreck. The cylinder escape-valve he abolished with a flogging-hammer. It is difficult in far-off ports to come by such valves, unless, like Mr. Wardrop, you keep duplicates in store. At the same time men took off the nuts of two of the great holding-down bolts that serve to keep the engines in place on their solid bed. An engine violently arrested in mid-career may easily jerk off the nut of a <b>holding-down</b> <b>bolt,</b> and this accident looked very natural.|$|E
5000|$|Both Pole and Law had {{calculated}} the wind loading needed {{to overturn the}} bridge to be over 30 psf (taking no credit for <b>holding-down</b> <b>bolts</b> fastening the windward columns to the pier masonry) [...] and concluded that a high wind should have overturned the bridge, rather than cause it to break up (Pole {{calculated the}} tension in the ties at 20 psf windloading to be more than the 'usual margin of safety' value of 5 tons per square inch but still only half the failure tension.) Pole calculated the wind loading required to overturn the lightest carriage in the train (the second-class carriage) to be less than that needed to overturn the bridge; whereas Law - taking credit for more passengers in the carriage than Pole and for the high girders partially shielding carriages from the wind - had reached the opposite conclusion.|$|R
60|$|The engine-room {{stores were}} unearthed, and Mr. Wardrop's face, red with the filth of the bilges and the {{exertion}} of travelling on his stomach, lit with joy. The spare gear of the Haliotis had been unusually complete, and two-and-twenty men, armed with screw-jacks, differential blocks, tackle, vices, and a forge or so, can look Kismet {{between the eyes}} without winking. The crew were ordered to replace the <b>holding-down</b> and shaft-bearing <b>bolts,</b> and return the collars of the thrust-block. When they had finished, Mr. Wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound engines {{without the aid of}} the shops, and the men sat about on the cold machinery. The cross-head jammed in the guides leered at them drunkenly, but offered no help. They ran their fingers hopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supporting-column, and picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores, while Mr. Wardrop's voice rose and fell echoing, till the quick tropic night closed down over the engine-room skylight.|$|R
