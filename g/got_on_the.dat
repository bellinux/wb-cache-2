5|$|After leaving Barrow, McEvilly began {{training}} with Sligo Rovers of the League of Ireland Premier Division in June 2010. He made only one league appearance for the side, coming on {{as a substitute}} in the 2–1 defeat to Shamrock Rovers on 2 July 2010. In November 2010, {{he returned to his}} first senior club Burscough, signing a permanent contract with the Northern Premier League outfit. He made his debut on 11 December 2010 as a second-half substitute in the 3–2 loss against Bradford Park Avenue. Three weeks later, he <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoresheet for the first time during his second spell at the club, scoring both Burscough goals in the 4–2 defeat to Kendal Town. McEvilly went on to stay at Victoria Park for three months before transferring to Conference North side Droylsden along with goalkeeper Sean Lake in March 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{a rematch}} of the {{previous}} two SEC Championship Games, Alabama defeated the Florida Gators 31–6. Alabama opened the scoring with a 28-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal in the first, and then scored a trio of second-quarter touchdowns. Mark Ingram scored on runs of six and one—yard with the third coming on a 19-yard Marquis Maze touchdown pass to Michael Williams on a wide receiver pass. Florida <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board late in the second with a 39-yard Chas Henry field goal to bring the halftime score to 24–3. After a second Henry field goal, C. J. Mosley returned an interception 35-yards for a touchdown to make the final score 31–6.|$|E

5|$|To {{open the}} season, the All-Americans {{defeated}} the local, semi-pro team West Buffalo. Running back John Weldon scored a rushing touchdown {{early in the}} first quarter. Quarterback Tommy Hughitt and Weldon added touchdowns {{in the second quarter}} to make the score 19–0 going into halftime. Hughitt scored from a yard out in the third quarter to make the score 25–0. West Buffalo <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard when Bob Langdon intercepted a Buffalo pass and ran it back 75yards for a touchdown.

5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against Vitesse, Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind Vitesse. The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two scores from Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick. Feyenoord played their last February match on the 23rd away against FC Twente. They created a two-goal lead halfway in the second half from goals by Pellè and Boëtius before Twente scored twice to lead to a 2–2 draw. The last goal came after 5 minutes of stoppage time and was controversial as it was even considered to be offside by Twente player Castaignos. The club ended February fourth in the league table.|$|E
5|$|A trip to The Dell on 3 October {{was taken}} with caution given United's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground. The team lost to Southampton {{in each of}} their last three visits, {{including}} a 6–3 mauling in 1996. Despite dominating possession and clear-cut chances in the previous season’s fixture, United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when, not if he would eventually break the jinx. Andy Cole was paired with Yorke {{for only the second}} time this season, a tactic that paid off as both <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> score sheet. Substitute Jordi Cruyff added a third in the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table, four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break. Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon, a match that Manchester United won 5–1, the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, Beckham, Yorke and Cole (twice) all scored; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19-year-old defender Wes Brown. United earned a point away at Derby County on 24 October, and deservedly beat Everton 4–1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top to just a point.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} {{suffering}} their second defeat of November, Nelson remained {{top of the}} league going into December. Their first fixture of the month was a home match against mid-table Darlington on 9 December. Nelson won a close match 3–2 thanks to another Braidwood strike, followed by Eddleston's 10th and 11th goals of the campaign. A hat-trick from inside-forward Wolstenholme gave Nelson a 3–0 victory against the same team on 23 December {{in front of a}} season-low attendance of 3,000 at Seedhill. Nelson started the Christmas period with an away game against Halifax Town. Braidwood and Wolstenholme both <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoresheet to help the team to a 2–2 draw in front of 18,000 supporters at The Shay. On 26 December, Nelson faced Hartlepools United, to whom they had conceded 10 goals in two matches in the previous season. Wolstenholme netted for the third game in succession as Nelson claimed their first ever win against the club. However, in the first match of 1923, Hartlepools United won the return fixture 5–1. Nelson achieved their first win of the new year on 13 January, a 3–0 triumph against Rochdale courtesy of an Eddleston hat-trick. Nelson lost 0–1 to Lincoln City the following week, the first time they had failed to score in a league fixture for over two months. January came to a conclusion with a 2–1 win over the same team, goals from Eddleston and McCulloch giving Nelson the victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{victim of}} poor field position, Ball State {{executed}} only three plays, {{the last of}} which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1-yard line. Nevertheless, Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards, but a 10-yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State's territory. They <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> score board on that drive via a 41-yard field goal kick by Brian Davis, making the score 7–3 Ball State. On their ensuing drive, Ball State executed another extended drive, this one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards (highlighted by another 20+ yard rush by Edwards); it failed to reach the end zone, but all was not lost, as Scott Secor made a 26-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points. The drive encompassed 6:09. Arkansas State responded, embarking on a 9-play, 63-yard drive that was highlighted by a 27-yard rush by R.J. Fleming, and climaxed when Sirgregory Thornton rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half. The half time score was 10–10.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord opened December with a {{home game}} against PSV. The {{visitors}} took an early lead but Boëtius scored an equalizer {{in the first half}} stoppage time. Pellè added a penalty goal in the second half; several minutes later he got another attempt which he missed. Pellè later added another goal to the tally for a 3–1 Feyenoord win. The team moved back into fourth place in the league table after the first 15 games of the season. On 8 December Feyenoord played SC Heerenveen on the road. Feyenoord scored twice within the first quarter of an hour; Boëtius opened the score and Immers doubled the lead. The game ended as a 2–1 win after Heerenveen <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board at the stroke of half-time. The win kept Feyenoord in fourth place in the Eredivisie standings. On 15 December, Feyenoord played FC Groningen at home. Pellè scored the lone goal of the game in the seventh minute of play. This third consecutive win kept Feyenoord in fourth place at the halfway mark of the season with 30 points from 17 matches. Feyenoord played their fourth round KNVB cup match in Almelo against Heracles Almelo on 18 December. Pellè scored after 11 minutes, Heracles equalized midway through the first half. Three minutes into extra time De Vrij received a second yellow card; Feyenoord kept the 1–1 score throughout extra time with ten men. In the penalty shootout all initial ten shooters scored. Clasie scored the sixth Feyenoord penalty before Heracles' Rienstra missed, sending Feyenoord to the quarter-finals of the KNVB Cup. Feyenoord's last game of 2013, at home against PEC Zwolle, marked their 2000th professional league game. They won the game 3–0 due to two first half goals in a seven-minute span by Immers and an early second half goal by Boëtius. This marked the last game before the winter break. Their five-game winning streak led them to fourth place in the league and the quarter-finals of the cup heading into the new year.|$|E

5|$|The Irvine–Lochhead {{partnership}} {{continued into}} the 1965–66 campaign. Irvine scored a goal in a 2–1 win against Lausanne Sports on a pre-season tour of Switzerland, and his first competitive goal of the season came on 24 August 1965 in the 3–1 home victory against Blackpool. He scored two in the return match at Bloomfield Road the following week, and two matches later he netted a hat-trick in the 4–1 defeat of Northampton Town. Between the 1–1 draw away at Leeds United on 30 October 1965 and the 5–2 win against Fulham on 11 December 1965, Irvine scored in seven consecutive league matches. In the 3–1 win against West Ham United, Irvine and Lochhead both scored in the same match for the first time, despite having played together for almost three seasons. Irvine took his goalscoring form into the cup competitions, netting five times in three FA Cup ties, and scoring the winning goals against Southampton and Stoke City as the team reached the fifth round of the Football League Cup before being knocked out by Peterborough United. During {{the second half of}} the season, he went through a somewhat barren spell, failing to score in the league between 8 January 1966 and 26 March 1966. He ended his poor run of form with a hat-trick in the 4–1 win over Nottingham Forest at Turf Moor. He subsequently <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoresheet in the next six league games, including two goals against Sheffield Wednesday which took him to 27 league goals, the joint-highest total since George Beel's 30 in the 1928–29 season. Irvine's 29th and final goal of the season came on 23 April 1966 in the 2–0 home victory against Liverpool. He was the highest scorer in the Football League First Division that season, the first, and to date only, time a Burnley player had achieved the feat.|$|E

After Levant drew off for repairs, he concentrated fire on Cyane. During this time, out of her crew of 145 men and 26 boys, Cyane had six killed and 13 wounded. She also took on five feet of water in her hold and had so much damage to her masts and rigging that she became unmanageable and had to soon strike her colors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Bears <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board with QB Brian Griese {{completing}} a 20-yard TD pass to rookie TE Greg Olsen {{for the only}} score of the period.
