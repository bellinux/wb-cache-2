Many fresh <b>extra-virgin</b> Sicilian <b>olive</b> oils, analyzed by this technique, show two main resonances in the aldehydic spectral region (9 – 10 ppm), at 9. 18 and 9. 58 ppm.

Thermal treatment at 220 °C of {{extra virgin olive oil}} samples lead to the complete transformation of the resonances at 9. 18 and 9. 58 ppm into those at 9. 45 and 9. 70 ppm in 50 minutes. Analogous transformation takes place place in CDCl 3 at rt in several weeks. These results suggest the transformation of relatively unstable compounds into thermodynamically more stable products whose resonances are commonly reported in the literature.

The agricultural {{production and the}} transformation of the destination of use of the territory are between the human activities that contribute to the global climatic change sensitively. In consideration of this, it results evident the importance to apply in this sector instruments for improvement of safety and the environmental performances of the products. Between these tools, in Italy it finds wide application of the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) methodology in the agri-food sector. It appraises the environmental impacts produced by the whole cycle of life of the products/process, in particular in the optics of the definition of the PCRs (Product Category Rules) for the editing of the EPD (Environmental Declaration of Product). Through LCA’s study implement on the product, it is possible to individualize the consumptions of resources and energy and the environmental impacts produced in the whole cycle of life, beginning from the extraction of the first subjects, through the process of production, distribution, use and end-life, foreshadow LCA as a complementary tool of environmental management systems. The present study effected on <b>extra-virgin</b> oil of <b>olive</b> gotten by olives produced in the region of Lazio take place with a broadly mechanized cultivation system, the objective it is set to individualize the principal impacts produced by the cycle of life and to define the bases for the realization of the PCRs for this category of product...|$|R
40|$|Capitale sociale e {{performance}} economica: un’applicazione al sistema di produzione dell’olio extra-vergine di oliva biologico della provincia di Bari - Social {{capital and}} economic firm performances: an {{application to the}} organic extravirgin olive oil net-chain {{in the province of}} Bari The supply chains of niche market goods like organic products are rapidly evolving. Compared to the conventional supply chains, these are more risky andmarket oriented. Therefore, to build stable networks along and among the chains is becoming an increasingly valuable as a competitive factor. The firms use these networks to exchange tangible and intangible assets. Structural social capital embedded in business networks could influence the firms’ competitiveness. In this perspective it can be worthwhile for the possible normative suggestion for policy makers to consider the control over strategic resources spread in the environment out of the firm, as a competitive advantage source, together with the firm’s internal resources. The external environment is characterized by a net of inter-firms relationships, which pertain to trade exchange, information exchange, shared norms and resources’ association. The strategic resources inside the network, especially information, constitute an asset that companies need to improve their competitive advantage. The structure of relationships enabling the access to those resources, constitute the social capital (sc) which is revealed in the modalities with which firms place themselves in the net: higher the sc, the higher the economic performance. This study aims to show the significance of structural sc in influencing the firms’ economic performances in agribusiness. We will try to test this hypothesis by analyzing the organic olive oil production system in the Province of Bari. In this study we refer to the form of sc linked to the firm’s position inside the net-chain and to the idea of structural holes. Specifically, we decided to measure sc in terms of network constraints - a more constrained entrepreneurial activity implies less structural holes and therefore less sc. As for the firm performance measures, there are several indexes that could be appropriate: from the well known roi (Return on Investment) and ros (Return on Sale), to revenue. Actually, we selected the last one (revenue). It in fact the results are easier to find, and the productive structure of the firms involved in the organic olive oil processing can be considered quite homogeneous. To measure the structure of the relational web we adopt the Social Network Analysis (sna), a method based on the analysis of the actors (individuals, firms, and institutions) involved in a particular context and on the relationships between them. The subject of the analysis is the <b>extra-virgin</b> organic <b>olive</b> oil net-chain in the province of Bari. A set of economic institutions and organizations both located in this province and out of this territory but involved in processing and in trading the extravirgin organic olive oil. The results obtained, show that also in agribusiness netchains, as the organic olive oil, firms gain a higher competitive advantage if the are able to be central in the network of relationships, both horizontal and vertical, assuming an intermediary role in the transactional and informational flows. Further studies are still necessary, since the analysis completely disregards some key factors of competitiveness (although recognizing their relevance), which are not directly connected to the structure of relationships of the netchain as the relational social capital (e. g. trust, norms and expectations) and cognitive social capital (e. g. shared view, common language).
