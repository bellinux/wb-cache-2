40|$|Abstract. We have {{employed}} pulsed reactive crossed-beam laser ablation (PRCLA) to deposit a (101) oriented ZnO film. In this method, a supersonic <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> pulse {{is made to}} cross the laser plume from a zinc metal target while being carried to the Si(111) substrate. The obtained deposit was nanocrystalline ZnO as con-firmed {{by a host of}} characterization techniques. When the substrate was held at varying temperatures, from room temperature to 900 °C, the crystallinity of the obtained films increased as expected, but importantly, the crystallographic orientation of the films was varied. High substrate temperatures produced the usual (001) oriented films, while lower substrate temperatures gave rise to increasingly (101) oriented films. The substrate held at room temperature contained only the (101) orientation. The film morphology also varied with the sub-strate temperature, from being nanoparticulate to rod-like deposits for higher deposition temperatures. Sur-prisingly, the (101) orientation showed reactivity with acetone forming carbonaceous nanostructures on the surface...|$|E

From the present state of techniques used in laboratories, it is clear that there exists a variety of problems of interest to chemical engineers. There are issues involved in multi-component solid [...] solid reactions, mixing of powders, precipitation and co-precipitation from solutions containing many components, nucleation, emulsion and microemulsion formation, flow of cohesive powders alone or with binders or in the form of paste, flows in thin films over partially-wetted particles, grain-boundary growth and composition, evaporation of compounds through the use of quick heating methods like lasers, mixing of molecules while on their flight paths and the influence on them <b>of</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen,</b> deposition <b>of</b> particles on the substrate, many problems associated with sputtering and, finally, the issue involved in control strategies to be followed, particularly for maintaining stoichiometry of thin films...|$|R

Currently, such rocket belts can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{original}} numerical approach developed to evaluate injection performances {{of a new}} injection system (More s. r. 1. (R)) designed for siderurgic applications. The system exploits a supersonic <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> to inject carbon particles into the slag. A precise characterization of the injection process by experimental analysis is extremely difficult and costly because of the complex chemico-physical mechanisms controlling transport, burn-out and devolatilization of carbon particles inside the oxidizing, high temperature environment of the electric arc furnace. In this work, we use numerical simulations to test and characterize injector performances for conditions corresponding to a 120 ton capacity electric furnace. We exploit the best available, {{state of the art}} numerical techniques to characterize the fluid-dynamics and chemico-thermal environment seen by carbon particles, which we couple to ad hoc research tools (Lagrangian tracking routines and complex chemistry schemes) to reproduce carbon consumption due to thermally and chemically controlled kinetics. These data are used to analyse the factors controlling injector performances, to identify a most critical configuration of the injector in the furnace and to obtain a conservative estimate of the injection yield of carbon particles. The performances of the injection device are evaluated in two different geometries and for three different types of carbon particles. Numerical results confirm that the supersonic injection promotes high injection yields: (i) by decreasing drastically the residence time of carbon particles inside the furnace and (ii) by modifying the hot reacting environment seen by carbon particle...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for ventilating patients through a catheter with nitrous oxide and oxygen utilizing the venturi principle is described for patients undergoing laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy. Arterial blood-gas measurements in 34 patients reveal that ventilation was adequate. The {{margin of safety}} for patients undergoing laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy has been greatly enhanced by recent advances in anaesthetic tech-niques. Safar (1958) described the ventilating bronchoscope which had a sidearm through which the patient could be ventilated during the broncho-scopy. However, the open end of the bronchoscope had to be occluded with an eyepiece {{in order to provide}} sufficient closure to obtain adequate pres-sures for ventilation. This eyepiece had to be removed during manipulations through the bronchoscope and ventilation was therefore inter-rupted during this time. Sanders (1967), utilizing the venturi principle and a high pressure <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> through a needle attached {{to the end of the}} bronchoscope, avoided this problem and also achieved continuous ventilation during all parts of the bronchoscopy procedure. A similar system has been made available for use with a suspension laryngoscope during microlaryngeal surgery (Barr et al., 1971). Smith, Babinski and Petruscak (1974) recently described a ventilation {{technique for}} laryngoscopy using a small bore catheter (3. 5 mm internal dia-meter) inserted through the vocal cords. The catheter was connected to a source of oxygen under high pressure. Ventilation was produced by the oxygen plus air entrained through holes at the proximal end of the catheter. Carden and Schwesinger (1973) reported on the addition of nitrous oxide in a system utilizing high gas flows for bronchoscopy. Because air entrain-ment did not occur, it was possible to supplement thiopentone anaesthesia with nitrous oxide while achieving higher blood oxygen tensions than wit...|$|E
25|$|This is now done {{by forcing}} a <b>jet</b> <b>of</b> {{high-pressure}} <b>oxygen</b> into a special rotating container containing the pig iron. Some {{of the carbon}} is oxidised into carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2. This also oxidizes impurities in the pig iron. The container is rotated and the processed pig iron can {{be separated from the}} oxidised impurities. Before the mid 19th century, pig iron from the blast furnace was made into wrought iron, which is commercially pure iron. At that period, if steel was needed, particularly pure varieties of iron were heated with charcoal in a cementation furnace to produce blister steel (with about 1-2% carbon). This might be further purified using the crucible technique, but steel was too expensive to use on a large scale. However, with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the late 1850s and then other processes, the production of steel was dramatically increased. By the late 19th century most iron was being converted to steel before use.|$|R

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{production of}} oxygen-carrier particles using six different manganese ores. The ores {{were made to}} react with Ca(OH) 2 at elevated temperature, forming calcium manganite. The method utilized to manufacture particles was extrusion. Methane and syngas conversion and <b>oxygen</b> release <b>of</b> the samples in inert atmosphere were investigated. The oxygen carrier based on South African (B) manganese ore, showed good methane conversion {{and was able to}} transfer oxygen corresponding to 1. 5 % of its mass during reduction with gaseous fuel. All examined oxygen carriers were capable of converting syngas completely. The ability to release gaseous oxygen was examined by adding wood char in a stream of nitrogen for four selected samples sintered at 1300 °C/ 6 h. These samples released an amount <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> corresponding to 0. 37 – 0. 68 % of their mass. The reactivity of all the ores was improved after the proposed treatments. Reactivity results <b>of</b> the <b>oxygen</b> carrier made from South African (B) ore and Ca(OH) 2, sintered at 1300 °C for 6 h were the most promising. Attrition measurements with a <b>jet</b> cup <b>of</b> the <b>oxygen</b> carriers sintered at 1300 °C/ 6 h showed that all the samples made from ores were at least three times more resistant to mechanical attrition compared to particles made from synthetic Mn 2 O 3.

2500|$|Lavoisier's {{chemical}} research between 1772 and 1778 {{was largely}} concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he {{read to the}} academy his famous paper entitled Réflexions sur le phlogistique (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current phlogiston theory of combustion. That year Lavoisier also {{began a series of}} experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish's inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed hydrogen (Greek for [...] "water-former"), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways {{within the framework of the}} phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and <b>oxygen.</b> The interpretation <b>of</b> water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).|$|R
40|$|Observational {{estimates}} and numerical models both indicate a significant overall decline in marine oxygen levels {{over the past}} few decades. Spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> change, however, differ considerably between observed and modelled estimates. Particularly in the tropical thermocline that hosts open-ocean oxygen minimum zones, observations indicate a general oxygen decline, whereas most of the state-of-the-art models simulate increasing oxygen levels. Possible reasons for the apparent model-data discrepancies are examined. In order to attribute observed historical variations in oxygen levels, we here study mechanisms <b>of</b> changes in <b>oxygen</b> supply and consumption with sensitivity model simulations. Specifically, the role <b>of</b> equatorial <b>jets,</b> <b>of</b> lateral and diapycnal mixing processes, of changes in the wind-driven circulation and atmospheric nutrient supply, and of some poorly constrained biogeochemical processes are investigated. Predominantly wind-driven changes in the low-latitude oceanic ventilation are identified as a possible factor contributing to observed oxygen changes in the low-latitude thermocline during the past decades, while the potential role of biogeochemical processes remains difficult to constrain. We discuss implications for the attribution <b>of</b> observed <b>oxygen</b> changes to anthropogenic impacts and research priorities that may help to improve our mechanistic understanding <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> changes and the quality of projections into a changing future...|$|R
