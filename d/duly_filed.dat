25|$|The Germans were {{helped in}} their escape {{by the failure}} of the British Admiralty in London to pass on seven {{critical}} radio intercepts obtained by naval intelligence indicating the true position, course and intentions of the High Seas Fleet during the night. One message was transmitted to Jellicoe at 23:15 that accurately reported the German fleet's course and speed as of 21:14. However, the erroneous signal from earlier in the day that reported the German fleet still in port, and an intelligence signal received at 22:45 giving another unlikely position for the German fleet, had reduced his confidence in intelligence reports. Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef. The unsent intercepted messages had been <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> by the junior officer left on duty that night, who failed to appreciate their significance. By the time Jellicoe finally learned of Scheer's whereabouts at 04:15, the German fleet was too far away to catch and {{it was clear that the}} battle could no longer be resumed.|$|E
500|$|The parties <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> their briefs. [...] The university's {{legal team}} was now headed by former U.S. Solicitor General and Watergate special {{prosecutor}} Archibald Cox, who had argued many cases before the Supreme Court. [...] Cox wrote {{much of the}} brief, and contended in it that [...] "the outcome of this controversy will decide for future generations whether blacks, Chicanos and other insular minorities are to have meaningful {{access to higher education}} and real opportunities to enter the learned professions". The university also took the position that Bakke had been rejected because he was unqualified. Reynold Colvin, for Bakke, argued that his client's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws had been violated by the special admission program. Fifty-eight amicus curiae briefs were filed, establishing a record for the Supreme Court that would stand until broken in the 1989 abortion case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. Future justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg signed the ACLU's brief; Marco deFunis, the petitioner in the 1974 case dismissed for mootness, wrote the brief for Young Americans for Freedom.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} Baltimore, Carter {{received the}} devastating news {{that his son}} Robert Bladen had died in London, nine days after being assaulted by a city sheriff trying to collect gambling debts. Nonetheless, Carter joined the congregation of James Jones Wilmer, an Episcopalian minister receptive to Swedenborg's views, bought a small house on Green Street, and began attending many religious meetings. Before leaving Nomony Hall, Carter locked his books and papers in the library, and gave the only key not to his son J.T., but to a wandering Baptist preacher named Benjamin Dawson. Dawson proved a corrupt debt collector, but diligent abolitionist, duly securing legal papers from Carter in Baltimore and filing them in Westmoreland [...] and other counties to free slaves. Carter made provision for his relatives, allocating them land, but not the slaves who were {{the subject of the}} Deed of Gift. On July 26, 1797, upon learning from Dawson that attorney John Wickham doubted the legal validity of the power of attorney which allowed Dawson to file further manumission papers, Carter executed an agreement selling Dawson his remaining slaves for the nominal sum of a dollar, which Dawson <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> with the Westmoreland clerk, despite a beating by Carter's son-in-law Spencer Ball.|$|E
50|$|However, most Yearly Meetings and Monthly Meetings {{encourage}} Friends marrying {{under their}} care to obtain marriage licenses {{and have them}} signed by {{a representative of the}} Meeting and <b>duly</b> <b>file</b> the licenses with the state. This is a special concern since common law marriages, under which Quaker marriages were formerly valid in many states, no longer is legally recognized in the USA. There is some discomfort with the obtaining and filing of marriage licenses for heterosexual couples in Meetings in which the joining of homosexual or lesbian couples is recognized, because of the Quaker concern for equality. Various means of dealing with issue have been worked out in Monthly Meetings and Yearly Meetings.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of exceptions, which differ {{according}} to the law of each state, to the principle of limited liability. First, at the very least, as is recognized in public international law, courts will [...] "pierce the corporate veil" [...] if a corporation is being used evade obligations in a dishonest manner. Defective organization, such as a failure to <b>duly</b> <b>file</b> the articles of incorporation with a state official, is another universally acknowledged ground. However, there is considerable diversity in state law, and controversy, over how much further the law ought to go. In Kinney Shoe Corp v Polan the Fourth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals held that it would also pierce the veil if (1) the corporation had been inadequately capitalized to meet its future obligations (2) if no corporate formalities (e.g. meetings and minutes) had been observed, or (3) the corporation was deliberately used to benefit an associated corporation. However, a subsequent opinion of the same court emphasized that piercing could not take place merely to prevent an abstract notion of [...] "unfairness" [...] or [...] "injustice". A further, though technically different, equitable remedy is that according to the US Supreme Court in Taylor v Standard Gas Co corporate insiders (e.g. directors or major shareholders) who are also creditors of a company are subordinated to other creditors when the company goes bankrupt if the company is inadequately capitalized for the operations it was undertaking.|$|R

50|$|According to {{decision}} G 1/86 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office, {{other parties}} such as opponents are not {{barred from the}} restitutio in integrum by principle.

50|$|The City <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> {{a report}} {{detailing}} its programmes and plans {{in regard to}} accommodation and land in general. The report was not prepared specifically for the present case and so did not deal specifically with the occupiers of Saratoga Avenue. At the hearing of the matter, the occupiers objected in limine that the City had been improperly joined to the proceedings. The City consented to the joinder {{on the basis that}} it would argue the question of joinder as part of the application against it.|$|E
6000|$|Here the {{affidavit}} {{was signed by}} both my lord chief-justice and myself, and it was <b>duly</b> put on <b>file.</b> I afterwards learned that the paper used by my brother Downright on this memorable occasion was no other than the notes which the chief-justice himself had taken {{on one of the}} arguments in the case in question, and that, seeing the names and title of the cause, besides finding it no easy matter to read his own writing, that high officer of the crown had, very naturally, supposed that all was right. As {{to the rest of the}} bench, they were in too great a hurry to go to dinner, to stop and read affidavits, and the case was instantly disposed of, by the following decision: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, Libertad founded {{what was}} {{probably}} the most important individualist anarchist journal, L’Anarchie, which included among its collaborators André Lorulot, Emile Armand, and Victor Serge and his companion Rirette Maitrejean. The French theorist of the Situationist International Raoul Vaneigem reports that Libertad gained notoriety for a call to action in which he [...] "invited citizens to burn their ID papers and to become humans again, refusing to let themselves be reduced to a number, <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> in the statistic state inventories of slaves." [...] He also worked as corrector with Aristide Briand, editing the review, La Lanterne, and then with Sébastien Faure. An activist of the free love, Libertad wrote in EnDehors, a famous newspaper founded by Zo d'Axa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reality of}} the matter is {{somewhat}} different. Although these articles usually do not mention it, only one of the two disclosure forms Bush was required to file with the SEC was delayed in its filing. The [...] "Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities" [...] Form 144, was filed {{on the day of the}} sale, June 22, 1990, thereby clearing Bush of the intent to hide or not disclose. Bush filed the second form, Form 4, the following year, in 1991, due to [...] "a mix up with the attorneys". Because the stock sale information had indeed been disclosed, and <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> in a timely manner via Form 144, the tardy filing of Form 4 was not viewed as a serious or punishable offense. It appears that the late filing of Form 4 was not considered serious by the SEC at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Raj's {{acquittal}} generated {{criticism from}} a number of quarters. Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry said that he still believed that Raj had abused state funds. [...] "Using State funds is a case of abuse. He should not have used it and nothing will change that fact. Abuse is abuse," [...] Chaudhry said on 12 September. The same day, National Alliance Party Secretary Filipe Bole said the court's decision was improper. He endorsed the judgement of Auditor-General Eroni Vatuloka that state entitlements were for the purpose of fulfilling civil service duties, and were not transferable to others. He also shared Vatuloka's concerns that the judgement would adversely impact other court cases involving misappropriation of funds. Also on 12 September, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that the ruling would be appealed, as Opposition Leader Chaudhry had urged. The appeal was <b>duly</b> <b>filed</b> with the Court of Appeal on 12 April 2006. Lawyer Hemendra Nagin announced that he would represent Raj at the appeal, expected to be held in July.|$|E
