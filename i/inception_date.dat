500|$|The Ancient Olympic Games were {{religious}} and athletic festivals held {{every four years}} at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities {{was known as the}} Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; {{one of the most popular}} myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games [...] "Olympic" [...] and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a [...] "stadion" [...] ( [...] , Latin: stadium, [...] "stage"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted <b>inception</b> <b>date</b> for the Ancient Olympics is 776BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776BC. The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events. Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion.|$|E
