40|$|Cost-profit {{analysis}} and market testing of some value-added products from silver carp such as fish mince block, fish sausage, fish ball, <b>fish</b> <b>stick</b> and fish burger were analyzed during April 2001 to March 2002. The study also explored {{the possibility to}} involve rural low-income people in the production and marketing of such products. The production of silver carp was higher in greater Jessore and Mymensingh districts but the price remained low during the peak-harvesting season in October to November. The price varied with size of the fish, season, market characteristics and effective demand of the buyers. Price of about 500 g size fish {{was found to be}} Tk. 20 - 25 /kg in the rural markets. The average size of fish in the rural markets was 3 S 0 - 550 g while that in the urban markets it was 700 - 1, 200 g. The cost of production of the value added products and profit margin were assessed on the basis of market price of the raw material {{as well as that of}} the finished products, transportation, storage and marketing costs. The profit margins of 34 %, 39 %, 81 % and 31 % of their sales price were obtained for fish sausage, fish ball, <b>fish</b> <b>stick</b> and fish burger, respectively. Actual production cost could be minimized if the fish is purchased directly from the farmers. Consumer's acceptance and marketability tests showed that both rural and urban people preferred fish ball than fish sausage. However, response towards the taste, flavor and color of fish ball and fish sausage was found to vary with occupations and age of the consumers. A correlation was observed between age group and acceptance of new products. Fish ball, <b>fish</b> <b>stick</b> and fish burger were found to be the most preferable items to the farmers because of easy formulation process with common utensils. Good marketing linkage and requirement of capital had been identified as the prerequisites for operating small-scale business on value-added fish products...|$|E

40|$|Silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix is {{contributing}} {{significantly to the}} total production of fish through aquaculture in Bangladesh. However, its low market price has become a serious concern to the fish farmers. The suitability of silver carp mince {{for the production of}} various value-added products (VAPs) - surimi, fish sausage, fish burger and <b>fish</b> <b>stick</b> was studied during April-September 2000 to ensure more appropriate and profitable utilization of silver carp. Surimi/frozen mince block was produced by washing the silver carp mince with 0. 1 % NaCl for 7 - 8 min (4 - 5 min agitation and 3 - 4 min settling). A two-step heating schedule for incubation at 50 °C for 2 h and cooking at 95 °C for 30 min gave high textured good quality consumer product. With the addition of cryoprotectants, surimi could be kept frozen for 5 months without loosing [sic] much of its textural and sensory qualities. Mince-mix and a batter with different ingredients and spices were formulated to produce fish burger using potato smash as the binding agent. Fish flake-mix and a batter with different ingredients and spices were formulated to prepare <b>fish</b> <b>stick</b> using both potato starch and potato smash as filler ingredients. Unwashed and washed frozen mince block or fresh flesh of silver carp was used to prepare fish sausage by heating at 100 °C for 1 h after incubating at 50 °C for 2 h. A spice-mix formulated with various local spices at the rate of 1. 0 - 1. 2 % gave good texture and flavor to the sausage. A good-appeared sausage-pink color was developed by combining three food-grade colors of asthaxanthin. Products prepared with potato starch, potato smash and rice smash had an acceptable bacterial load in refrigeration (5 °C) for up to 8 days and in room temperature (28 °C) for up to 3 days. No coliform bacteria were found in the products prepared...|$|E

40|$|Meat {{rendering}} operations produce stick water waste {{which is}} rich in proteins, fats, and minerals. Membrane distillation (MD) may further recover water and valuable solids, but hydrophobic membranes are contaminated by the fats. Here, commercial hydrophobic polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) membranes with a hydrophilic polyurethane surface layer (PU-PTFE) are used {{for the first time}} for direct contact MD (DCMD) on real poultry, fish, and bovine stick waters. Metal membrane microfiltration (MMF) was also used to capture fats prior to MD. Although the standard hydrophobic PTFE membranes failed rapidly, PU-PTFE membranes effectively processed all stick water samples to colourless permeate with sodium rejections > 99 %. Initial clean solution fluxes 5 – 6 L/m 2 /h declined to less than half during short 40 % water recovery tests for all stick water samples. <b>Fish</b> <b>stick</b> water uniquely showed reduced fouling and up to 78 % water recovery. Lost flux was easily restored by rinsing the membrane with clean water. MMF prior to MD removed 92 % of fats, facilitating superior MD performance. Differences in fouling between stick waters were attributed to temperature polarisation from higher melt temperature fats and relative proportions to proteins. Hydrophilic coated MD membranes are applicable to stick water processing but further studies should consider membrane cleaning and longer-term stability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This work {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} temperature on headspace solid-phase microextraction of volatile and furanic compounds in coated <b>fish</b> <b>sticks.</b> The major goal was {{the analysis of the}} samples as consumed, to reproduce volatile compounds people feel when consuming those products. Extraction at 37 ºC (the human body temperature) throughout the HS-SPME analysis of volatile and furanic compounds in coated fish was compared with higher extraction temperatures, which are frequently used for this kind of determinations. The profile of volatile compounds found in deepfried (F) and non-fried (NF) coated fish at 37 and 50 ºC was different from that obtained at 80 ºC. Concerning furan and its derivatives, an extra formation of these compounds was observed at higher extraction temperatures. The analysis of volatile and furanic compounds in <b>fish</b> coated <b>sticks</b> simulating the cooking and eating conditions can be reliably carried out setting the headspace absorption temperature at 37 ºC.
