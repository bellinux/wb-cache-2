5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models <b>for</b> <b>human</b> and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines <b>for</b> <b>human</b> or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals <b>for</b> <b>Human</b> Use.|$|E

5000|$|While {{gene therapy}} <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> has been ongoing with some success, a gene therapy <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> to gain color vision {{has not been}} {{attempted}} to date. However, demonstrations using several mammals (including primates such as a squirrel monkey) suggest that the therapy should be feasible <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> as well. It is also theoretically possible for trichromats to be [...] "upgraded" [...] to tetrachromats by introducing new opsin genes.|$|R

5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough <b>for</b> <b>human</b> flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E

50|$|The {{frequency}} range of dog hearing is between 16-40 Hz (compared to 20-70 Hz <b>for</b> <b>humans)</b> {{and up to}} 45-60 kHz (compared to 13-20 kHz <b>for</b> <b>humans),</b> which means that dogs can detect sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory spectrum.|$|R
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} to be active in pro-democracy groups; she also wrote another play, Sang Raja (The King). Towards the end of 1998, with the political situation in Indonesia increasingly unstable and Sarumpaet rumoured to be wanted for stirring up dissent, she fled to Europe via Singapore. In December 1998, the Tokyo-based Asia Foundation <b>for</b> <b>Human</b> Rights awarded Sarumpaet the Female Human Rights Special Award.|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue <b>for</b> <b>human</b> consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market <b>for</b> <b>human</b> consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|Although the tested {{potatoes}} {{were not}} a commercial variety and not intended <b>for</b> <b>human</b> consumption a contract was signed with Cambridge Agricultural Genetics, which included a profit-sharing agreement, if potatoes developed using this technology were approved and released commercially. In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded {{that they did not}} significantly affect growth, despite some hypertrophy of the small intestine and a slight decrease of gut enzyme activity.|$|E

However, {{it is estimated}} that less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of triclocarban <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> is represented by vegetable consumption.

5|$|Cacti {{have many}} other uses. They are used <b>for</b> <b>human</b> food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines. In {{addition}} to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in herbal medicine.
