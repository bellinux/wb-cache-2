5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>button,</b> only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

50|$|The R-360 {{was also}} known for its many {{interior}} safety features such as a safety harness similar to a roller coaster harness, two seatbelts which attached to the harness, and an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Button.</b> Its exterior safety features included an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>button</b> on the attendant tower, a series of pressure-sensitive mat intrusion systems which would trigger an alarm when any of the mats were stepped on while the game was in motion, and due to how large and heavy the main cabinet was, a plexiglass fence surrounded the cabinet to avoid anyone from getting {{too close to the}} cabinet.|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} report describes the design (both hardware and software) of an embedded controller for the Staüli work-cell {{available at the}} Perception and Manipulation Laboratory at IRI. This system {{is based on a}} commercial embedded computer (Beaglebone Black [3]) and it is capable of managing all the work-cell devices. This includes a custom planar XY robot, two simple grippers at the end effector of each Staübli robot, a six degrees of freedom force and torque sensor and optionally the two Staülbi robots themselves. This embedded system also monitors all the safety features integrated into the work-cell to provide updated information about {{the current state of the}} work-cell to all the device drivers and control programs. The safety features available at the Staübli work cell include several <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>buttons,</b> a laser curtain surrounding the perimeter of the work-cell and two mechanical fuses at the last joint of the Staübli robot. See [6] for a more detailed description of the Staübli work-cell. This document is intended as a complete reference manual of the embedded system, both from a software and a hardware points of view, for maintinance purposes and also to alow the addition of new features and upgrades in the future.

50|$|Red pushbuttons {{can also}} have large heads (called {{mushroom}} heads) for easy operation and to facilitate the stopping of a machine. These pushbuttons are called <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>buttons</b> and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions. This large mushroom shape {{can also be found}} in buttons for use with operators who need to wear gloves for their work and could not actuate a regular flush-mounted push button.As an aid for operators and users in industrial or commercial applications, a pilot light is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide feedback if the button is pushed. Typically this light is included {{into the center of the}} pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start.|$|R

40|$|A new {{generation}} of mobile robots has recently been designed based on the successful hardware and software architecture of Care-O-bot [2]. The robots have been created to communicate with and to entertain visitors in a museum. Their tasks include welcoming visitors, leading a guided tour in the museum, or playing with a ball. Keywords: Mobile Robot, Museum Robots, Self Localization, Obstacle Avoidance, Communication HARDWARE PLATFORM Fig. 1 Basic platform and "fully dressed" museum robot (Museumsstiftung Post und Kommunikation) Each vehicle is equipped with two driven wheels (differential drive) including shaft encoders for motion tracking. The robots are able to move at a speed of up to 1. 2 m/s. Four castor wheels are further used for keeping the robots upright. A gyroscope is integrated in the robot platforms to track their current orientations. A 2 D laser scanner {{is attached to the}} front of each robot. It is used for self localization, navigation, and obstacle detection. Additional safety sensors are a bumper {{at the bottom of the}} robots and several infrared sensors which are integrated in the bumper facing upwards. These sensors are used to detect obstacles above the scanning level of the laser scanner. Activating one of the safety sensors as well as pressing either of the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>buttons</b> results in an immediate stop. Besides software restricting the allowed operation area, a magnetic sensor facing towards the ground is used as a secondary system to prevent the robots from leaving their assigned area. This area is bounded by a magnetic band lowered in the ground. Being equipped with several long lasting batteries the robots are able to move independently for up to ten hours without interruption.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{controls}} are essential parts of industrial machinery {{because they are}} designed to stop the operation in case of emergencies without risks to operators, equipment, products, or facilities. Current guidelines for <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> controls have been formulated based on experience but not on empirical studies. The main objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} the type and orientation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons on the reaction time, mode of activation, and preferences of subjects in order to formulate guidelines for their selection. An experiment consisting of a simple, cooperative assembly operation with a Microbot was designed for this study. The main conclusions of this research are that reaction time to activate <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbutton is not affected by the orientation of the control but it is influenced by the type of control. The mode of activation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons is influenced by both the type and the orientation of the control. Subjects preferred <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards or with half guards over controls with full guards, and subjects also preferred an inclined orientation of the control over horizontal or vertical orientations. The following guidelines are recommended for the selection of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons. Select <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards. If a guard is absolutely required, select a guard with slots or a half guard to ensure adequate visibility of and access to the button. If possible, give <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons an inclined orientation (about 45 °) on the control panel. Avoid using vertical orientations for these controls...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A motion planner of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{must make}} an {{operating}} humanoid robot to a stationary state under the emergency signal. It {{plays an important}} role in prevention of falling over because humanoid robots fall over easily. Immedi-ately after the emergency signal, it must generate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion in real-time. We modeled a humanoid robot as a simple dynamic system consists of ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) and COG (Center of Gravity) as its states. The <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion is generated by a state feedback. We determined optimal feedback gains in terms of the initial conditions and the pole assignment. The proposed method realized a reliable <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> with low computational cost. Furthermore, it can easily predict the possibility of the successful <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> at any time.

40|$|On January 6, 2016 at El Paso, the Guppy {{winch motor}} was changed. After {{completion}} of the operational checks, the load bar was being reinstalled on the cargo pallet when the motor control FORWARD relay failed in the energized position. The pallet was pinned at all locations (each pin has a load capacity of 16, 000 lbs.) while the winch was running. The wire rope snapped before aircraft power could be removed. After disassembly, the fractured wire rope was shipped to ES 4 lab for further characterization of the wire rope portion of the failure. The system was being operated without {{a clear understanding of}} the system capability and function. The proximate cause was the failure of the K 48 -Forward Winch Control Relay in the energized position, which allowed the motor to continuously run without command from the hand controller, and operation of the winch system with both controllers connected to the system. This prevented the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> feature on the hand controller from functioning as designed.
