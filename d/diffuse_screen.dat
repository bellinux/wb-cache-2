The four-wavelength photometer has a field of view of about 1.2 ° and was pointed along the local magnetic field line as well; the EISCAT radar and the photometer conducted common-volume measurements. Auroral lights with different wavelengths were fed into four channels by beam splitters and dichroic mirrors. The photometer has two dichroic mirrors used for separating blue and infrared wavelengths. Interference filters at 427.8, 630.0, 670.5, and 844.6  nm were selected based on Ono (1993) to obtain characteristic auroral emissions. Auroral emissions after the interference filters were detected by four photo-multipliers. Two wavelengths of emissions at 427.8 and 630.0  nm were utilized in this paper. Intensity of the photometer was calibrated by a calibration system at the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) in Japan. The transmission curves of the filters were measured by illuminating a <b>diffuse</b> <b>screen</b> with a scanning grating monochromator at NIPR. The filter efficiency for 427.8  nm was obtained by integrating, in wavelength, the product of the normalized filter transmission curve and the normalized synthetic spectrum at 300  K calculated following Kurihara (2004). Photometer data were obtained with an A/D board, and their time resolution reached 0.1  s. Images of the digital camera were used for monitoring auroral structures as well as weather conditions. The field of view of the digital camera was about 90 ° ×  60 ° (about 240  ×  140  km at 120  km height) with a fish-eye lens. We obtained sky images every minute with an exposure time of 8  s.|$|E

40|$|Many {{temperate}} climates, {{like most}} Italian ones, {{are characterized by}} considerable daily temperature ranges. In these cases, the thermal inertia of the building has a significant influence on the management of solar and internal heat gains; then on the energy demand for HVAC, {{this is especially true}} in the cooling period. Winter and summer requirements regarding thermal inertia may be in conflict with each other, in particular when the use of the building is discontinuous, as in the case of offices. A lower thermal inertia can allow a more rapid heating in the morning and minor nocturnal losses during the winter, whereas a higher inertia may allow a slower daytime heating and a better exploitation of night free cooling during the cooling period. In this study, a typical office room has been studied by means of computer simulations. The only external wall of the room faces south and is entirely glazed; therefore, it requires the use of some device for solar control. Relatively to this room, the combined effects of some different solar control strategies and three constructive technologies, characterized by different thermal inertia, have been explored. A first strategy is based only on the use of an internal reflecting and <b>diffusing</b> <b>screen,</b> a second on the use of external movable slats, a third on the use of small slats inserted between the glasses. Strategies based on the two types of slats can be integrated with the use of an internal <b>diffusing</b> <b>screen.</b> Computer simulations were performed using a software that allows simultaneous analysis of energy and comfort issues, automatically taking into account any control action aimed at maintaining the thermal and luminous comfort.

Moreover, if the working room is large, the values of physical parameters influencing comfort are relevantly variable from point to point.

Radiometric compensa tion methods have been proposed to reduce the disturbance caused by interreflection, but nothing has been proposed for evaluating the phenomenon itself and the effectiveness of compensation methods. In this paper, we propose a radiosity-based method to simulate light transfer in immersive environments, from a projector to a camera (the camera gives the image a user would see in a real room). This enables us to evaluate the disturbances resulting from interreflection. We also consider the effectiveness of interreflection compensation and study the influence of several parameters (projected image, projection onto a small or large part of the room, reflectivity of the walls).

In contrast to the bulk we observe, at temperatures well below the onset for surface melting (TB = − 12. 8 °C), broad Lorentzian lines disclosing that the near-surface hydrogen bonding network has lost its long-range coherence prior to surface melting. A quantitative analysis of the results shows that a Bjerrum domain structure with a typical domain size of ξB= 20 − 30 Å is present in a mesoscopic surface layer of a thickness greater than 250 Å. Within this surface layer the Bjerrum defect density is 〈nB〉 = (5. 7 ± 2. 5) × 1025 m− 3.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{rear projection}} <b>diffusing</b> <b>screens.</b> We provide a methodology, a theoretical background, metrics, and experimental results {{to aid in}} the understanding and design of such screens. For this work, a theoretical model has been developed to predict local fluctuations of measured color that appear as image noise in projection screens. This predictive model is based on Fraunhofer diffraction along with Huygens' wavelet analysis and linear systems theory. Of importance are the figures of merit that have been defined and used to compare the theoretical predictions and experimental results. The range of validity of the model has also been determined. We set up an experiment to test the theoretical model. By experimentally varying the numerical aperture of the input illumination, color variations on screens have been measured and characterized. The results of both the experiment and the model show a strong relationship between the polychromatic image noise {{and the size of the}} illumination cone. As the size of the illumination cone was decreased from 6 to less than 0. 1 millisteradians, there was more than a threefold increase in the figures of merit. Our model shows insight, validates and augments a common rule of thumb. It is often assumed that making the screen structure significantly larger than the coherence length of the source will result in a system with minimal noise. The model shows that this is correct, but it also provides predictions in the cross over region. This allows one to understand how the image noise in a projection system will change as screen designs are changed. Ultimately, this allows screen solutions to be assessed before they are reduced to practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Photosynthetically active solar {{radiation}} {{can be either}} direct or diffuse. Due to atmospheric scattering, {{solar radiation}} is never fully direct. Under heavy overcast conditions however, it can be fully <b>diffuse.</b> <b>Screens</b> and glass that transform direct light into diffuse light are used {{under the assumption that}} diffuse light is more evenly distributed over the canopy, increasing crop photosynthesis rate. The Intkam crop growth model computes leaf photosynthesis rate in 5 leaf layers, for the sunlit and shaded leaf area and for the leaf areas receiving direct and diffuse light. It integrates instantaneous leaf photosynthesis rates to the crop photosynthesis rate. Instantaneous canopy photosynthesis is used to compute the seasonal growth of organs. This process approach enables a detailed analysis of the effects of variations in natural light. An analytical comparison was made between 100 % direct and 100 % diffuse light for a representative day in winter (day 24) and in summer (day 202). Sunlit leaf area is illuminated by both direct and diffuse light, whereas a shaded leaf area is illuminated by diffuse light only. These components vary within and among leaf layers, and were all quantified. On both days, a higher instantaneous crop photosynthesis was computed under fully diffuse light than under fully direct light. This difference is caused by the more homogeneous distribution of diffuse light than direct light at a certain canopy depth, in combination with a declining response to increasing light intensities of the photosynthesis rate. Experiments with three types of diffuse glass and a whitewash were conducted in 2011. Light scattering of the glass (haze) varied from 45 - 71 %, with at least the same transmission as the reference. Tomato production under diffuse glass was increased by 8 - 11 % in early June, and was maintained to November. The Intkam model simulated approximately the same relative seasonal production increases under diffuse glass...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{collection}} and redistribution {{of the direct}} and diffuse components of daylight in buildings remains a major objective of advanced fenestration systems. Such systems, including novel solar blinds, new glazing or coating materials and daylight-redirecting devices, can improve significantly the penetration of daylight in deep rooms to reduce electricity consumption while improving visual comfort conditions greatly; at the same time, they can lead to larger solar gains in winter combined with lower solar loads in summer. To allow their integration in buildings and benefit from their potential as energy-efficient strategies, an in-depth and accurate knowledge of their directional optical properties is necessary. These properties are described by Bidirectional Transmission (or Reflection) Distribution Functions, abbreviated BT(R) DF, that express the emerging light flux distribution for a given incident direction. Such detailed transmission or reflection functions are intended {{to be used by}} the building industry to optimize the luminous performances of innovative solutions for windows and to describe photometric properties of complex glazing and shading materials according to a common format. On the other hand, they will allow daylighting simulation tools to improve their potentialities and integrate complex fenestration systems reliably in the simulation models. Their accurate assessment requires an appropriate experimental equipment. An innovative bidirectional goniophotometer, based on digital imaging techniques, was designed and set up for that purpose: instead of scanning the emerging light flux distribution by moving a sensor from point to point, an original method was used that comprises a rotating <b>diffusing</b> <b>screen</b> on which the emerging light flux is reflected towards a digital video-camera, used as a multiple-points luminance-meter. This novel approach significantly reduces the time needed to monitor BT(R) DF data, lowering it down to a few minutes per incident direction instead of several hours for conventional assessment methods, which is a critical parameter in BT(R) DF assessment as about a hundred incident directions are usually required. At the same time, it allows the gathering of continuous transmitted (reflected) light distribution figures, only limited in resolution by the pixellisation of the digital images. Moreover, by taking advantage of the considerable luminance range reached when images are captured and superposed at different integration intervals, combined to the appreciable flexibility in the data processing offered by digital imaging-based techniques, a remarkable accuracy can be achieved when assessing BT(R) DF data. This PhD thesis explains the different conception, calibration and processing stages that were necessary to develop the bidirectional goniophotometer into a functioning, validated measurement device. Its design for combining BTDF and BRDF assessments is described, the various calibration procedures for converting the CCD camera into a reliable multiple-points luminance-meter are detailed, as well as the image and data processing phases. An in-depth validation of the performed measurements was realized based on different approaches and led to a relative error on BT(R) DF data of only 10 %, allowing to confirm the high accuracy and reliability of this novel device...|$|R

This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). Polarized 3D glasses with suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from RealD. Projecting such images requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as silver screens); a normal <b>diffuse</b> white projection <b>screen</b> causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.|$|R

These functional units themselves are usually oligomers of several integral proteins, which have their own symmetry. Depending on the symmetry, they form clusters on different packing lattices. Moreover, local membrane inhomogeneities, e. g., the so-called membrane domains, rafts, stalks, etc., lead to different patterns even within the structures on the same packing lattice. Units in the cluster compete for <b>diffusing</b> molecules and <b>screen</b> each other. Here we propose a general approach that allows one to quantify the screening effects. The approach is used to derive simple approximate formulas giving the trapping rates of diffusing molecules by clusters of absorbers on lattices of different packing symmetries. The obtained results describe smooth variation of the trapping rate from {{the sum of the}} rates of individual absorbers forming the cluster to the effective collective rate.

This study proposes a novel paradigm to investigate the spatial distribution of visual attention. Simple reaction times (SRTs) to dots presented over the visual field were used to assess attentional allocation in space. We analyzed the data with several geostatistical methods. One of these, stochastic simulation, has been used in various fields, such as petroleum geology, hydrogeology, meteorology, and oceanography and seems to be particularly suitable for our purposes because it emphasizes spatial continuity patterns. Geostatistical stochastic simulation has the advantage of global precision, in other words it reproduces both the spatial variance and the statistical distribution characteristics of the phenomenon under study. As in any geostatistical method the basic tool is the variogram, which is used to predict data at any point within the domain. Simulations provide several different scenarios of equal probability, with the same spatial statistics of the original data. We used 5 different tasks and through SRTs we assessed attention (shorter or longer RTs were taken to indicate, respectively, higher or lower attentional focus). In experiment 1 participants were asked not to attend to any particular region, but rather try to spread their attention as uniformly as possible over the computer <b>screen</b> (<b>diffuse</b> attention).

40|$|Modern {{greenhouse}} covering {{and screen}} materials {{are able to}} transform direct sunlight into diffuse light. After entering the greenhouse the sunlight is scattered and penetrates the crop where it is absorbed and used for photosynthesis. Diffuse light {{has been shown to}} increase light interception of crops, increase crop photosynthesis and results in higher yields. Many different types of diffuse covering materials are available, and growers select materials based on crop, outside climate where the greenhouse is located and market situation. Earlier measurement methods to evaluate diffuse covering materials have been proposed (Hemming et al., 2008) and are mainly based on the measurement and evaluation of the hemispherical light transmittance, the average amount of light coming into the greenhouse (Nijskens et al., 1985; Papadakis et al., 2000) and the Haze (e. g., ASTM-D 1003 - 07), the average amount of scattered light reaching the crop. A more detailed evaluation of the angular and spectral light transmittance of materials is needed (Hemming et al., 2014), including the spatial distribution of scattered light, or the way light is scattered by a material. In this paper we propose a new method of measuring the spatial distribution of scattered light by a bi-directional transmittance distribution function (BTDF) measurement. By comparing the BTDF values of a <b>diffuse</b> covering or <b>screen</b> material with the BTDF values of a Lambertian diffuser, we calculate one simple value for material characterisation, the F-scatter. F-scatter is a more representative value for the scattering properties of a material than Haze. The detailed material scatter properties can be used for further raytracing analysis of materials in greenhouses with a specific roof construction, at a specific location for any moment of the year. It can also be used for 3 D functional crop models in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of solar shading devices on energy use and {{daylight}} quality in office rooms. The impact on energy use is analysed through computer simulations with the dynamic energy simulation program Derob-LTH while the impact on daylight quality is investigated through measurements in full-scale experimental office rooms and simulations with the program Radiance. This thesis also includes a literature review of research on solar shading as well as design tools to incorporate shading devices {{at an early stage}} in the design of buildings. This thesis indicates that, in cold countries, shading devices may provide more annual energy savings than any solar-protective (reflective, tinted) glazing and that the optimum glazing transmittance is orientation- and climate-dependent. For example, high annual energy savings are obtained on the south facade with higher transmittance glazings (compared with the east and west facade) because the potential for passive solar gain utilisation in the winter is high in comparison with the annual cooling demand. Exterior shading devices like awnings and overhangs may reduce the cooling demand dramatically but they are not suitable as daylight (glare) control devices. Devices like screens and venetian blinds are preferable because they cover the entire window area, which prevents sunlight patches in the room and the direct view of the bright sky. Screens and venetian blinds also reduce daylight in the room to levels that are suitable for computer work. However, it is essential that the screen be of a <b>diffusing</b> type since <b>screens</b> with a strong (specular) transmittance component result in poor daylight quality. The study on daylight quality also indicated that a screen transmittance of around 15 % may be optimum for a standard (3. 5 by 6. 0 m 2) south-oriented office room with a window covering around 25 % of the facade area (12 % of the floor area) ...|$|R
40|$|A novel Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 {{texturization}} {{process for}} the surface structuring of the monocrystalline silicon substrate, aimed to improve the silicon optical characteristics {{to be used in}} solar cells, has been proposed in this thesis. The proposed process consists in the wet chemical anisotropic texturization of (100) oriented silicon with a new solution which has been designated as ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution. The alkaline solution forms micrometric pyramids on the (100) silicon surface. This process presents several operation advantages: (i) no additives are required, contrarily to NaOH or KOH based processes; (ii) the 20 times lower concentration of chemicals compared to previously established high concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 processes allows saving costs and simplifies a possible implementation in the industry; (iii) the process temperature at semi-industrial scale is lower than the temperature of Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 texturization processes found in the literature; (iv) the texturing solution can be reused several times; and (v) it can be applied to (100) silicon substrates with different characteristics. The resulting morphology obtained with the ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution presents low values of standard weighted reflectance and smaller and more sharpened pyramids than the high concentration texturization process. Furthermore, it produces smoother facets of the pyramids, which is advantageous regarding to the mitigation of the surface recombination velocity. Different influencing parameters of the process, as the process temperature or the initial roughness of the substrate, have been studied. The ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution has been used to study the mechanism of pyramid formation on (100) silicon by means of AFM and SEM. The proposed ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solution has been applied to a solar cell process as texturization step. The influence of the Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 texturing on solar cell processing steps, as formation of phosphorous doped emitter layer, passivation, and deposition of thin layers, has been studied. The comparison of p-Cz phosphorous <b>diffused</b> and <b>screen</b> printed silicon solar cells produced with the high concentration and the new ultra-low concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 solutions demonstrate enhanced solar cell electrical parameters for the ultra-low Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 concentration process. This is related to a lower front reflection and enhanced light trapping, and to the smaller size of the pyramids, which benefit cell processing, and probably to the lower facets nanoroughness, compared to the high concentration Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 textured surface. The here proposed texturization method is a promising candidate to be implemented in the industry...|$|R
