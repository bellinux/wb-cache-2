40|$|AbstractThe human LDL {{receptor}} (LDLR) has {{a binding}} domain {{which consists of}} seven contiguous ligand-binding (LB) repeats, each ∼ 40 amino acids long with three disulfide bonds.

40|$|AbstractSpinal and bulbar {{muscular atrophy}} (SBMA) is an X-linked, adult-onset, {{neurodegenerative}} disorder affecting only males and {{is caused by}} expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the N-terminal A/B domain of human androgen receptor (hAR). Although no overt phenotype was detected in adult fly eye photoreceptor neurons expressing mutant hAR (polyQ 52), ingestion of androgen or its known antagonists caused marked neurodegeneration with nuclear localization and structural alteration of the hAR mutant. Ligand-independent toxicity was detected with a truncated polyQ-expanded A/B domain alone, which was attenuated with cytosolic trapping by coexpression of the unliganded hAR E/F ligand binding domain. Thus, {{our findings suggest that}} the <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> of androgen to the polyQ-expanded hAR mutants leads to structural alteration with nuclear translocation that eventually results in the onset of SBMA in male patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule L 1 {{plays a crucial role}} in development and plasticity of the nervous system. Neural cells thus require precise control of L 1 expression. Results We identified a <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> site for nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factors in the regulatory region of the mouse L 1 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed binding of nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A) to this site. Moreover, for a brain-specific isoform of NFI-A (NFI-A bs), we confirmed the interaction in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Reporter gene assays showed that in neuroblastoma cells, overexpression of NFI-A bs repressed L 1 expression threefold. Conclusion Our findings suggest that NFI-A, in particular its brain-specific isoform, represses L 1 gene expression, and might act as a second silencer of L 1 in addition to the neural restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). </p...|$|E

40|$|Nucleic acids rich in guanine {{are able}} to fold into unique {{structures}} known as G-quadru-plexes. G-quadruplexes consist of four tracts of guanylates arranged in parallel or antiparal-lel strands that are aligned in stacked G-quartet planes. The structure is further stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and monovalent cations centered between the planes. RHAU (RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element) {{is a member of}} the ATP-dependent DExH/ D family of RNA helicases and can bind and resolve G-quadruplexes. RHAU contains a core helicase domain with an N-terminal extension that enables recognition and <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> affinity to RNA and DNA G-quadruplexes.

40|$|AbstractThe use of typed {{intermediate}} languages {{can significantly}} increase {{the reliability of}} a compiler.

We propose to take the use of types in compilation a step further by verifying that the transformation itself is type correct, {{in the sense that it}} is impossible that it produces an ill typed term given a well typed term as input. We base our approach on higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), a representation of programs where variables in the object language are represented by meta-variables. We use a representation that accounts for the object language's type system using generalized algebraic data types (GADTs). In this way, the <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> and type structure of the object language is exposed to the host language's type system.

40|$|Substrate {{effects on}} the {{activation}} kinetics of Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase by p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB) have been studied. On {{the basis of the}} kinetic equation of substrate reaction in the presence of pCMB, all modification kinetic constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate binary and ternary complexes have been determined. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that the modification of Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase by pCMB shows single-phase kinetics, and that changes in the enzyme activity and tertiary structure proceed simultaneously during the modification process. Both substrates, NADPH and 7, 8 -dihydrofolate, protect dihydrofolate reductase against modification by pCMB. In the presence of a saturating concentration of NADPH, the value of kcat for 7, 8 -dihydrofolate in the enzyme-catalysed reaction increased four-fold on modification of Cys- 6, accompanied by a two-fold increase in Km for the modified enzyme. The utilization of the binding energy of a group to increase kcat rather than reduce Km implies that the <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> energy of the group is not realized in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, but is used to stabilize the enzyme-transition-state complex...|$|E

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The {{serotonin}} (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) transporter (SERT) {{plays an}} essential role in the termination of serotonergic neurotransmission by removing 5 -HT from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic neuron. It is also of pharmacological importance being targeted by antidepressants and psychostimulant drugs. Here, five commercial databases containing approximately 3. 24 million drug-like compounds have been screened using a combination of two-dimensional (2 D) fingerprint-based and three-dimensional (3 D) pharmacophore-based screening and flexible docking into multiple conformations of the binding pocket detected in an outward-open SERT homology model. Following virtual screening (VS), selected compounds were evaluated using in vitro screening and <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> assays and an in silico hit-to-lead (H 2 L) screening was performed to obtain analogues of the identified compounds. Using this multistep VS/H 2 L approach, 74 active compounds, 46 of which had Ki values of ≤ 1000 nM, belonging to 16 structural classes, have been identified, and multiple compounds share no structural resemblance with known SERT binders.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of complex conformational changes {{is required for}} insulin to bind to the insulin receptor. Recent experimental evidence points to the B chain C-terminal (BC-CT) as the location of these changes in insulin. Here, we present molecular dynamics simulations of insulin that reveal {{new insights into the}} structural changes occurring in the BC-CT. We find three key results: 1) The opening of the BC-CT is inherently stochastic and progresses through an open and then a "wide-open" conformation [...] the wide-open conformation is essential for receptor binding, but occurs only rarely. 2) The BC-CT opens with a zipper-like mechanism, with a hinge at the Phe 24 residue, and is maintained in the dominant closed/inactive state by hydrophobic interactions of the neighboring Tyr 26, the critical residue where opening of the BC-CT (activation of insulin) is initiated. 3) The mutation Y 26 N is a potential candidate as a therapeutic insulin analogue. Overall, our results suggest that the binding of insulin to its receptor is a highly dynamic and stochastic process, where initial docking occurs in an open conformation and <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> is facilitated through interactions of insulin receptor residues with insulin in its wide-open conformation...|$|E
40|$|Vibrio vulnificus hemolysin (VVH) {{is thought}} {{to be a member of}} the cholesterol-dependent {{cytolysin}} (CDC) family of pore-forming toxins. To date, the structure-function relationships of CDCs produced by Gram-negative bacteria remain largely unknown. We show here that the aromatic ring of phenylalanine residue conserved in Vibrionaceae hemolysins is essential for oligomerization of VVH. We generated the VVH mutants; substituted Phe 334 for Ile (F 334 I), Ala (F 334 A), Tyr (F 334 Y), or Trp (F 334 W); and tested their binding and oligomerizing activity on Chinese hamster ovary cells. Binding in all mutants fell by approximately 50 % compared with that in the wild type. Oligomerizing activities were completely eliminated in F 334 I and F 334 A mutants, whereas this ability was partially retained in F 334 Y and F 334 W mutants. These findings indicate that both hydrophobicity and an aromatic ring residue at the 334 th position were needed for <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> activity and that the oligomerizing activity of this toxin was dependent on the existence of an aromatic ring residue at the 334 th position. Our findings might help further understanding of the structure-and-function relationships in Vibrionaceae hemolysins...|$|E

To {{ensure that all}} significant conformational space was searched, the starting trisaccharide conformers for docking were all possible combinations of the corresponding disaccharide low-energy conformers. All docked trisaccharides occupied subsites − 1 and + 1 in very similar modes to those of corresponding nonreducing-end disaccharides.

For the one docked branched substrate, steric hindrance in the α-(1, 6) -glycosidic oxygen suggests that the active-site residues have to change position for hydrolysis to occur. Subsite + 1 of the glucoamylase active site allows flexibility in binding but, at least inAspergillus glucoamylases, subsite + 2 selectively binds substrates α-(1, 4) -linked between subsites + 1 and + 2.

Recent {{studies suggest that}} it may play significant roles in atherogenesis. LOX- 1 is a type-II membrane protein that structurally belongs to the C-type lectin family molecules. This {{study was designed to}} characterize the specific domain on LOX- 1 that recognizes oxLDL. Truncation of the lectin domain of LOX- 1 abrogated oxLDL-binding activity. Deletion of the utmost C-terminal ten amino acid residues (261 - 270) was enough to disrupt the oxLDL-binding activity. Substitutions of Lys- 262 and/or Lys- 263 with Ala additively attenuated the activity. Serial-deletion analysis showed that residues up to 265 are required for the expression of minimal binding activity, although deletion of the C-terminal three residues (268 - 270) still retained <b>full</b> <b>binding</b> activity. Consistently, these alterations in LOX- 1 impaired the recognition by a functionally blocking monoclonal antibody for LOX- 1.
