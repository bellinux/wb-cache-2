500|$|Of the reviewers, Time rated it an A-minus and added, [...] "Burton and Depp infuse the {{brilliant}} cold steel of Stephen Sondheim's score with a burning passion. Helena Bonham Carter and a superb supporting cast bring focused fury to this musical nightmare. It's bloody great." [...] Times Richard Corliss named the film {{one of its}} top ten movies of 2007, placing it fifth. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it four stars out of four, lauding Burton's visual style. In his review in Variety, Todd McCarthy called it [...] "both sharp and fleet" [...] and [...] "a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim's landmark 1979 theatrical musical ... things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton, expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan, and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap {{by far the biggest}} audience to see a pure Sondheim musical, although just how big depends on the upscale crowd’s tolerance for buckets of blood, {{and the degree to which}} the masses stay away due to the whiff of the highbrow." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-plus in its Movie Reviews section and stated, [...] "To stage a proper Sweeney Todd, necks must be slit, human flesh must be squished into pastries, and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton, who... has tenderly art-directed soup-thick, tomato-red, fake-gore blood with the zest of a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock." [...] She went on to refer to the piece as [...] "opulent, attentive... so <b>finely</b> <b>minced</b> a mixture of Sondheim's original melodrama and Burton's signature spicing that it's difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for the job." ...|$|E

50|$|To prepare ganjang gejang, crabs {{are first}} {{thoroughly}} cleaned using a brush while submerged {{in a bowl}} of water, and are then rinsed to remove the moisture. The crabs are put in a hangari (earthenware crock) and are salted for about six hours. To prepare the sauce, a mixture of ganjang is boiled briefly along with sesame oil, sugar, <b>finely</b> sliced scallions, <b>minced</b> garlic, ginger, and finely shredded fresh red chili pepper. Once the salted crabs are removed from the hangari and placed in a suitable bowl, the hot sauce is poured onto the crabs. An hour later, the ganjang is removed from the bowl and reheated until boiling. It is again poured over the crabs, and the procedure is repeated for a third and fourth time. The dish can be eaten once the sauce is chilled. If using boiled ganjang after it has been chilled, the gejang can be eaten two weeks after preparation, and it can be preserved for longer. A variation involves adding minced beef while the sauce is poured over the crabs, endowing the gejang with more spices. In recent days, some people add lemon, chili pepper, or traditional medicine when making gejang in order to remove the fishy smell and to increase its rich flavor.|$|R
40|$|The Fallopian tube {{provides}} physiological {{support to}} both gametes and the embryo. Experimental approaches {{to improve the}} outcome of infertility treatment have included co-culture systems, whereby sperm, ova and/or embryos are cultured in a monolayer of Fallopian tube epithelial cells. This approach {{has been shown to}} be superior to other methods based on co-culture with other cell types. In addition, the role of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation is becoming increasingly recognised as one of the major cellular functions. GJIC plays an important role in fertilisation as well as in the normal development of both the embryo and foetus. It is also involved in the sexual maturation of the adult and in the maintenance of health throughout life. As such, GJIC may be the key element in the understanding of cellular functions especially during the reproductive process. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were to examine some of the cellular and molecular aspects of the human Fallopian tube epithelium in relation to infertility. In the first part of this study, the gap junction proteins, connexins were examined by immunohistochemical and Western blotting techniques. Fallopian tubes were removed from women at different stages of the ovarian cycle. The results demonstrated the presence of gap junction proteins, connexins (cx) in the human Fallopian tube throughout the ovarian cycle. Fimbrial and ampullary regions were separated and subsequently processed for Western blotting analysis using a range of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies directed against cx 26, cx 32 and cx 43. The intensity of staining varied depending upon the hormonal status of the patients examined and appeared to be upregulated during the secretory stage as opposed to the proliferative phase of the ovarian cycle. Human Fallopian tube did not express cx 32, regardless of the anatomical site examined. In all cases though, the expression of both cx 26 and 43 appeared to be more prevalent in the ampullary region. The second part of this investigation focussed on transforming Fallopian tube epithelial cells into an immortal cell line. Normal cells cannot be sustained indefinitely, as cell degeneration occurs with continuous passaging. In most IVF treatments, sperm and ova are allowed to fertilise in a conventional medium but there is the potential that the Fallopian tube epithelial cells may be employed in IVF treatments in the future. Therefore, current techniques used to isolate and culture epithelial cells from the Fallopian tube were evaluated, in order to assess the best method that provides an optimal yield of Fallopian tube epithelial cells, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The cells were isolated using (i) a mechanical technique, whereby the mucosal layer of the tube were <b>minced</b> <b>finely</b> using a pair of scissors and (ii) an enzymatic method which consisted of the enzymes, trypsin and pancreatin. The results showed that enzymatic isolation provided a large number of cells, but there was a significant detrimental effect on cell survival and their secretory status. In contrast, cells isolated by the mechanical method were fewer in number than those obtained by the enzymatic method but cell survival and secretory status were relatively better. Regardless, of the isolation technique employed, the Fallopian tube epithelial cells had a limited lifespan in culture. Bearing this in mind and coupled with the realisation that the interactions between the tubal epithelial cells and gametes/embryos cannot adequately be studied in vivo, the next part of the study investigated ways of establishing an immortalised human Fallopian tube cell line. Such a cell line would be able to survive in culture indefinitely and therefore could be a potential model, which could mimic the in vivo milieu more closely. In order to obtain a 'bank' of Fallopian tube epithelial cells, cells isolated by either the mechanical or enzymatic method were cultured in growth medium for 24 - 48 hours prior to being transfected with a transforming gene, the SV 40 Large T-antigen. Various techniques were used to transfect the epithelial cells in culture; these included well-established methods such as DNA co-precipitation as well as more advanced methods using cationic liposomes. The results from this study demonstrated that human Fallopian tube epithelial cells can be transiently transfected and could survive for over 102 days in culture, whilst still retaining many of the morphological characteristics of the original epithelial cell type. By examining both the cellular and molecular aspects of the tube as described above, it was anticipated that further insight into the complex nature of this structure would be achieved. Furthermore, it was hoped to improve the current understanding and knowledge of the Fallopian tube's functions, thereby facilitating a greater awareness of the issues important in establishing and maintaining an in vitro model of the Fallopian tube...|$|R
