5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and <b>epicardial</b> layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E

25|$|The healthy <b>epicardial</b> {{coronary}} artery {{consists of three}} layers, the intima, media, and adventitia. Atheroma {{and changes in the}} artery wall usually result in small aneurysms (enlargements) just large enough to compensate for the extra wall thickness with no change in the lumen diameter. However, eventually, typically as a result of rupture of vulnerable plaques and clots within the lumen over the plaque, stenosis (narrowing) of the vessel develops in some areas. Less frequently, the artery enlarges so much that a gross aneurysmal enlargement of the artery results. All three results are often observed, at different locations, within the same individual.|$|E
25|$|CRT {{devices have}} at least two leads, one passing through the vena cava and the right atrium into the right {{ventricle}} to stimulate the septum, and another passing through the vena cava and the right atrium and inserted through the coronary sinus to pace the <b>epicardial</b> wall of the left ventricle. Often, for patients in normal sinus rhythm, there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate synchrony with the atrial contraction. Thus, timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions, as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function.|$|E

2500|$|Cardiac {{syndrome}} X, sometimes {{known as}} microvascular angina {{is characterized by}} angina-like chest pain, {{in the context of}} normal <b>epicardial</b> coronary arteries (the largest vessels {{on the surface of the}} heart, prior to significant branching) on angiography. The original definition of cardiac syndrome X also mandated that ischemic changes on exercise (despite normal coronary arteries) were displayed, as shown on cardiac stress tests. The primary cause of cardiac syndrome X is unknown, but factors apparently involved are endothelial dysfunction and reduced flow (perhaps due to spasm) in the tiny [...] "resistance" [...] blood vessels of the heart. Since microvascular angina is not characterized by major arterial blockages, it is harder to recognize and diagnose. Microvascular angina was previously considered a rather benign condition, but more recent data has changed this attitude. Studies, including the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE), suggest that microvascular angina is part of the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease, perhaps explaining the higher rates of angina in women than in men, as well as their predilection towards ischemia and acute coronary syndromes in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.|$|E

50|$|CDX1 {{has also}} been shown to play an {{important}} role in embryonic <b>epicardial</b> development. It has been demonstrated that CDX proteins suppress cardiac differentiation in both zebrafish and mouse embryonic stem cells, but the overall mechanism for how this happens is poorly understood. However, CDX1 has been shown to be transiently expressed in the embryonic heart 11.5 days post coitum (dpc). This transient expression is thought to induce <b>epicardial</b> epithelial-to-mesynchemal transition and thus proper cardiovascular formation. It has been shown that low-dose CDX1 induction caused enhanced migration and differentiation of epicardium-derived cells into vascular smooth muscle, where as continued high dose induction of CDX1 or CDX1 deficiency diminished the ability of these cells to migrate and differentiate into smooth muscle by the actions of TGF-β1. Furthermore, CDX1 induction also altered transcript expression of genes related to cell adhesions for EMT and angiogenesis. Therefore, along with its known roles in intestinal patterning and differentiation, CDX1 is also shown to be important in <b>epicardial</b> development.|$|E

50|$|Although Dr. Cox's 2004 {{definition}} specifically excludes an <b>epicardial</b> {{approach to}} eliminate AF, {{he and others}} pursued this important goal, {{and the meaning of}} the term changed as successful <b>epicardial</b> procedures were developed.

These were performed epicardially, on the beating heart, without cardiopulmonary bypass or median sternotomy.

5000|$|A {{gradient}} in {{the levels}} of both MLC2v phosphorylation and its kinase, cardiac MLCK, {{has been shown to}} exist across the human heart from endocardium (low phosphorylation) to epicardium (high phosphorylation). [...] The existence of this gradient has been proposed to impact cardiac torsion due to the relative spatial orientation of endocardial versus <b>epicardial</b> myofibers. In support of this, recent studies have shown that MLC-2v phosphorylation is critical in regulating left ventricular torsion. Variations in myosin cycling kinetics and contractile properties as a result of differential MLC-2v phosphorylation (Ser14/15) influence both <b>epicardial</b> and endocardial myofiber tension development and recovery to control cardiac torsion and myofiber strain mechanics.|$|E

Progressively weaker pacing stimuli are administered, which results in asystole in the second half of the tracing. At the end of the tracing, distortion results from muscle contractions due to a (short) hypoxic seizure. Because decreased pacemaker stimuli do not result in a ventricular escape rhythm, the patient can be said to be pacemaker-dependent and needs a definitive pacemaker.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 20% of {{the cases}} of Brugada {{syndrome}} {{have been shown to}} be associated with mutations in a gene that encodes for a sodium ion channel in the cell membranes of the muscle cells of the heart (the myocytes); this is often referred to as a sodium channelopathy. The majority of patients affected by Brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease, as of 2015. The gene, named SCN5A, is located on the short arm of the third chromosome (3p21). Loss-of-function mutations in this gene lead to a loss of the action potential dome of some <b>epicardial</b> areas of the right ventricle. This results in transmural and <b>epicardial</b> dispersion of repolarization. The transmural dispersion underlies ST-segment elevation and the development of a vulnerable window across the ventricular wall, whereas the <b>epicardial</b> dispersion of repolarization facilitates the development of phase 2 reentry, which generates a phase 2 reentrant extrasystole that captures the vulnerable window to precipitate ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation that often results in sudden cardiac death. At present time however, all the reported patients who died because of the disease and were submitted to detailed autopsy study have shown a structural right ventricular pathology underlying the syndrome.|$|E
