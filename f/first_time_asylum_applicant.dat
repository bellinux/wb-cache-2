40|$|This version: August 15, 2017 (original version: December 7, 2016) Cette version: 15 août 2017 (version originale: 7 décembre 2016) The {{member states}} of the European Union {{received}} 1. 2 million <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>asylum</b> applications in 2015 (a doubling compared to 2014). Even if asylum will be granted {{for many of the}} refugees that made the journey to Europe, several obstacles for successful integration remain. This paper focuses on one of these obstacles, namely the problem of finding housing for refugees once they have been granted asylum. In particular, the focus is restricted to the situation in Sweden during 2015 – 2016 and it is demonstrated that market design can {{play an important role in}} a partial solution to the problem. More specifically, because almost all accommodation options are exhausted in Sweden, the paper investigates a matching system, closely related to the system adopted by the European NGO “Refugees Welcome”, and proposes an easy-to-implement algorithm that finds a stable maximum matching. Such matching guarantees that housing is provided to a maximum number of refugees and that no refugee prefers some landlord to their current match when, at the same time, that specific landlord prefers that refugee to his current match...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of Apouviepseakoda v. Gonzales, the {{majority}} and the dissent of the Seventh Circuit heavily criticized the immigration judge’s behavior during the removal hearing. Yet, the majority seemed {{to go out of}} its way to affirm denial of asylum. The majority held that, although the IJ’s behavior during the asylum hearing was inappropriate, it did not amount to reversible error. The majority would reverse only if the IJ’s behavior were so inappropriate that it frazzled the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> or barred large portions of the applicant’s testimony. What this decision does not account for is the fact that the IJ, who was openly hostile towards the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant,</b> was making a subjective finding regarding the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant’s</b> truthfulness and believability. In such a situation, the Seventh Circuit’s rule requiring actual prejudice in addition to IJ bias will frequently result in the denial of otherwise valid asylum claims. Where the IJ exhibits bias against the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant,</b> the ability of the IJ to serve as a fact-finder is compromised. When the basis for the denial of an asylum application is an adverse credibility determination, the threshold for a finding of reversible error should be much lower where the IJ exhibits bias against the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the principles and factors underlying the culturally competent nursing care of <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants.</b> <b>Asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> are a highly vulnerable group, whose health is often severely compromised prior to arrival in the UK due to exposure to torture, violence and rape. Although they are entitled to primary health care services whilst their asylum claim is under consideration, their level of welfare support has been significantly eroded over the last decade. An analysis of the nursing literature revealed mainly US notions of cultural competence, which were based on a private health care insurance system rather than a universal health care system of equitable, accessible and non-discriminatory service provision, such as the NHS. A Five Steps Model of cultural competence (Quickfall 2004) was later revised to provide a theoretical framework for this research study. Data for this ethnographic study were collected during 2005 - 2007 with <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> and community nurses within one Health Board in Scotland, using participant observation, individual, narrative and group interview methods. The data were analysed for their categorical content. The findings are presented as vignettes to highlight cultural competence issues. Three major themes emerge from the study findings, which highlight the intermediary function of community nursing. The provision of equitable, accessible and non-discriminatory services remains pertinent in the 21 st century. Secondly, the cross-cultural promotion of health involves a partnership process to ensure effective communication and the negotiation of person centred care. Thirdly, the delivery of socially inclusive services requires the aiding of <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> adaptation to a new host environment. This study contributes to community nursing knowledge in explaining, through synthesis of the literature and study data, a model of cultural competence for the care of <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants.</b> It also provides a set of best practice statements, which require further investigation.

40|$|The {{international}} community finds itself {{today in the}} throes of the largest refugee crisis since World War II. As millions of refugees continue to flee violence and persecution at home, the immediate concern is humanitarian, but in the long-term, the important question becomes: What are our obligations to those who cannot return home? U. S. asylum law is designed not only to offer shelter to legitimate refugees, but also to protect the country from those who seek asylum under false pretenses. Lawmakers and policymakers have struggled to calibrate corroboration requirements for asylum claims with the reality that many legitimate asylum seekers {{may not be able to}} obtain such corroboration. Prior to Congress’s passage of the REAL ID Act (“REAL ID”) in 2005, no single standard governed the circumstances in which an immigration judge (IJ) could require an <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> to provide extrinsic evidence to corroborate credible testimony. Though REAL ID established that <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> usually must provide corroborating evidence whenever an IJ decides to require it, Congress created an exception for otherwise credible applicants who do not have such evidence and cannot reasonably obtain it. The circuits disagree, however, as to whether IJs must tell <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants,</b> before a decision is rendered, if they will be required to provide corroborating evidence and what sort of evidence they will need to provide. This Note argues that 8 U. S. C. § 1158 (b) (1) (B) (ii) reveals an unambiguous congressional intent to require an IJ to give <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> advance notice of the evidence deemed necessary to corroborate otherwise credible testimony. It further contends that this advance notice must specify the type of corroboration expected, in order to give applicants who cannot reasonably obtain corroborating evidence a meaningful opportunity to avail themselves of the corroboration exception...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on Refugee Status Determination (RSD) procedures, in order to {{understand}} the relationships among language, translation / interpreting, evidentiary assessment, and what we call the ‘listening state’. Legal systems have only recently begun to consider whether adjudicative processes ought to take place in multiple languages concurrently, or whether the ideal procedure is to monolingualize evidence first, and then assess it accordingly. Because of this ambivalence, <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> are often left in the ‘zone of uncertainty’ between monolingualism and multilingualism. Their experiences and testimonies become subject to an ‘epistemic anxiety’ only infrequently seen in other areas of adjudication. We therefore ask whether <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> ought to enjoy a ‘right to untranslatability’, taking account of the State's responsibility to cooperate actively with them or whether the burden ought to remain with the applicant to achieve credibility in the language of the respective jurisdiction, through interpretation and translation...|$|R

In 1999 the EU Member States decided to work towards a Common European Asylum System. In this context the Procedures Directive was adopted in 2005. This directive provides for important procedural guarantees for <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants,</b> but also leaves much discretion to the EU Member States to design their asylum procedures. An important result of the adoption of the Procedures Directive is that asylum procedures now fall within the reach of the Charter and general principles of EU law. This book examines the meaning of the EU right to an effective remedy for the legality and the interpretation of the Procedures Directive. For this purpose the EU Courts’ case-law on the EU right to an effective remedy is examined. The interpretation of the EU right to an effective remedy is inspired by international law. Therefore this book also extensively discusses the ECtHR’s case-law as well as the views of the UNHCR and UN Committees concerning procedural rights for <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants.</b> The result of this exercise is a set of procedural standards with regard to several key issues of asylum procedures: the right to remain on the territory of the Member State, the right to be heard, the standard and burden of proof and evidentiary assessment, judicial review of the establishment and qualification of the facts and the use of secret evidence.

40|$|<b>Asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> in the UK must show, to a ‘reasonable {{degree of}} likelihood’, a well-founded fear of persecution, {{on the basis}} of race, religion, {{political}} opinion or membership of a particular social group, in the event of return ‘home’. This requirement presents myriad challenges both to claimants and decision-makers. Based on findings from a three-year national study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, this paper explores those challenges as they relate to women seeking asylum in the UK whose applications include an allegation of rape. The study explored the extent to which difficulties relating to disclosure and credibility, which are well documented in the context of women's sexual assault allegations in the criminal justice system, might be replicated and compounded for female asylum-seekers whose applications include a claim of rape. Findings suggest that the structural and practical obstacles faced in establishing credibility, and the existence of scepticism about rape claims and asylum-seeking more generally, mean that decision-making can often be experienced as arbitrary, unjust, uninformed or contradictory, making it difficult for women <b>asylum</b> <b>applicants</b> who allege rape to find refuge in the UK.
