500|$|Addressing his approach, Weisman {{said that}} {{eliminating}} {{the human element}} eliminated the [...] "fear factor" [...] that people are <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> or that they will die; {{it is meant to}} be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of Spiked related the book to [...] "today's romanticisation of nature" [...] in that it linked [...] "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" [...] with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the [...] "Nature knows best" [...] notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.|$|E
500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} know what he was doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was {{deployed}} at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby." ...|$|E

500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

2500|$|The authors {{argue that}} a major factor for Israel's {{economic}} growth {{can be found in}} the culture of the Israel Defense Forces, in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued. IDF soldiers [...] "have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong,</b> you say so." [...] Neither ranks nor ages matter much [...] "when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles," [...] and [...] "Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rocker Partners, renamed Copper River Management, filed a {{counterclaim}} against Overstock in November 2007, alleging overstatement of profits, false projections, and misrepresentations about the company's ventures. Copper River also alleges that Byrne tried to silence critics by suing them. A {{portion of this}} suit was {{settled out of court}} on October 13, 2008, when Overstock.com and Gradient dropped the claims against each other after Gradient retracted allegations that Overstock's reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the FASB, stated they believed Overstock.com complied with GAAP standards, and that three directors were independent according to NASD standards, and apologized. Byrne has said the apology and settlement [...] "represents a great step forward in our case", while Copper River's attorney stated that [...] "If somehow this improved Overstock's case, then Gradient would admit to <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> and they haven’t.", and that he expected the settlement to help Copper River's case.|$|E

[...] Some second thought had perhaps told her that any such arrangement would be injurious to the noble blood of the Traffick family, and she had therefore [...] "felt it to be her duty" [...] to extract the letter from the family letter-box, and to give it to her father.
