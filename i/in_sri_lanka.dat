5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district <b>in</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lanka,</b> paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna <b>in</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lanka</b> by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans <b>in</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lanka</b> from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{scholarly}} consensus over {{the presence of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people <b>in</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lanka,</b> also known as Eelam in Sangam literature.

Theories about Tamil people's presence <b>in</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lanka</b> feed into the cycle of ethnic conflict. Another theory states that the Sri Lankan Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.|$|E
