50|$|Low-voltage <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (LVEM) is an <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> which {{operates}} at accelerating voltages {{of a few}} kiloelectronvolts or less. Traditional <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> use accelerating voltages {{in the range of}} 10-1000 keV.|$|R
50|$|An <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> uses a {{controlled}} {{beam of electrons}} to illuminate a specimen and produce a magnified image. Two common types are the scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) and the transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM).|$|R
50|$|Electron {{microscopy}} (EM) is {{a focused}} area of science {{that uses the}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> {{as a tool for}} viewing tissues. Electron microscopy has a magnification level up to 2 million times, whereas light microscopy only has a magnification up to 1000-2000 times. There are two types of <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes,</b> the transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> and the scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|R
30|$|Morphology {{studies were}} {{observed}} from images captured on a JEOL (JEM 1010) transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM), a JEOL (JEM 2100, at 200 kV) high-resolution transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (HRTEM) and a LEO 1450 scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM).|$|R
30|$|X-ray powder {{diffraction}} patterns (XRD) of {{the products}} were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Philips PW 3050 / 60, MPSS) using Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectroscopy was performed at room temperature in a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw RM- 1000), employing an Ar+ laser for excitation (λ = 514 nm). Scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) images were obtained by a scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (JEOL, JSM- 5610 LV). Transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) images and high-resolution <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (HREM) images were recorded on a transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (JEOL, JEM- 2100 F). For TEM observations, the nanoparticles were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and then dropped onto carbon-coated copper grids.|$|R

30|$|Transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) of gold {{nanorods}} {{was obtained}} with a JEM- 1230 <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (JEOL, Japan), operating at 120 kV.|$|R
30|$|A {{scanning}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) {{is one of}} {{the high-end}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> that produces images of a sample by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. In this work, the surface morphology studies were carried out by scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) by JEOL, JSM 35 CF, Japan.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposal}} {{to assess the}} quality of scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> images using mixed Lagrange time delay estimation technique is presented. With optimal scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> scan rate information, online images can be quantified and improved. The online quality assessment technique is embedded onto a scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> frame grabber card for real-time image processing. Different images are captured using scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> and a database is built to optimally choose filter parameters. An optimum choice of filter parameters is obtained. With the optimum choice of scan rate, noise can be removed from real-time scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> images without causing any sample contamination or increasing scanning time...|$|R

25|$|Other {{completely}} {{different approach to}} microscopy is <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (EM), which gives a beam of electrons {{in order to be}} focused onto the desired specimen with a design capable of giving a magnifying power up to 100,000 times.6 <b>Electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are also used but very little when compared to light <b>microscopes.</b> (TEM) transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> is more difficult to use and requires more sample preparation than scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) and thus have found very few applications in forensic science.|$|R
25|$|In 1932, Ernst Lubcke of Siemens & Halske {{built and}} {{obtained}} images from a prototype <b>electron</b> <b>microscope,</b> applying concepts {{described in the}} Rudenberg patent applications. Five years later (1937), the firm financed the work of Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries, and employed Helmut Ruska (Ernst’s brother) to develop applications for the microscope, especially with biological specimens. Also in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne pioneered the scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> The first commercial <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> was produced in 1938 by Siemens. The first North American <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> was constructed in 1938, at the University of Toronto, by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier, and Albert Prebus; and Siemens produced a transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) in 1939. Although contemporary transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are capable of two million-power magnification, as scientific instruments, they remain based upon Ruska’s prototype.|$|R
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the as-prepared samples {{was observed}} by a field emission scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (FE-SEM, JSM 6330 F, JEOL) and its structure {{was determined by}} a transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (TEM) and a high resolution-transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (HRTEM) (JEM 2010 HR, JEOL) with an Oxford EDS spectrometer and an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, PW 1830, Philips).|$|R
25|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are used}} to {{investigate}} the ultrastructure {{of a wide range}} of biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms, cells, large molecules, biopsy samples, metals, and crystals. Industrially, <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are often used for quality control and failure analysis. Modern <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> produce <b>electron</b> micrographs using specialized digital cameras and frame grabbers to capture the image.|$|R

30|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopic (SEM) {{measurements were}} performed on a Philips XL 30 <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The samples were deposited on the Si substrate surface. High-resolution transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> image was acquired on a JEOL JEM- 2010 transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (JEOL Ltd., Akishima-shi, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200  kV. The sample was deposited onto a 230 -mesh copper grid covered with Formvar.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{became popular}} {{following}} the Second World War. Ernst Ruska, working at Siemens, developed {{the first commercial}} transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> and, in the 1950s, major scientific conferences on electron microscopy started being held. In 1965, the first commercial scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> was developed by Professor Sir Charles Oatley and his postgraduate student Gary Stewart, and marketed by the Cambridge Instrument Company as the [...] "Stereoscan".|$|R
50|$|Microscopes can be {{separated}} into several different classes. One grouping {{is based on}} what interacts with the sample to generate the image, i.e., light or photons (optical <b>microscopes),</b> <b>electrons</b> (<b>electron</b> <b>microscopes)</b> or a probe (scanning probe microscopes). Alternatively, microscopes can be classed on whether they analyze the sample via a scanning point (confocal optical <b>microscopes,</b> scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> and scanning probe microscopes) or analyze the sample all at once (wide field optical <b>microscope</b> and transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes).</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are {{expensive}} {{to build and}} maintain, but the capital and running costs of confocal light microscope systems now overlaps with those of basic <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field cancelling systems.|$|R
