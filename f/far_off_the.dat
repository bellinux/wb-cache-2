5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> 200 operational hours {{considered for a}} pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced crews and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E
5|$|The low lying coral {{islands of}} Lakshadweep are {{situated}} off the south-western coast of India. The Andaman and Nicobar islands lie <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast of India. The Palk Strait and {{the chain of}} low sandbars and islands known as Rama's Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the south-eastern coast. The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E

25|$|The Rottweiler often {{carries the}} head {{on an even}} plane with the back, or carries the head up but with the neck and {{shoulders}} lowered. Some females lower the entire front end slightly when using their eyes. Males also do this when working <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> stock in an open field. This is rarely seen in males when working in confined spaces such as stock yards.|$|E

25|$|The waters {{which it}} {{inhabited}} were fairly shallow epicontinental or shelf seas. Remains found <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> prehistoric shore {{suggest that it}} either ventured far out and/or that it bred on islands. A considerable number of juvenile specimens are known. These tend {{to be from the}} northern part of its range - today's Canada and Alaska - though they have also been found in Kansas. This suggests that the birds were migratory like some penguins are today, moving polewards in summer to breed. The Cretaceous had a much warmer climate than today; the waters inhabited by Baptornis were subtropical to temperate.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 both McCarthy and O'Brien guided Cork {{to another}} Munster final appearance. Once again provincial rivals Tipperary stood in their way. The coaches had {{prepared}} their team well and a 4–17 to 4–11 victory was the result. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Cork take on Galway. McCarthy's side were the favourites {{going into the}} game, however, Galway had other ideas. A 4–12 to 5–5 defeat showed that the Cork team were <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> championship pace.

25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{struggled}} with the bat, making a duck, trapped by Laker as Australia were bowled out for 148. With Lindwall and Davidson unable to bowl, Miller took 2/58 as England declared at 3/188 and set Australia a target of 258 in four hours. Australia struggled for one hour before Miller came to the crease with the score at 2/18. He struggled for 46 minutes in making four and again fell lbw to Laker, with the score at 3/41. He had been unsure {{as to how to}} play Laker and played <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back foot and took guard outside leg stump. Australia ended at 3/120 when stumps were drawn.|$|E

The Sultan gives Kilala a huge diamond as a token for being Jasmine's first friend. Jafar turns into Sylphy after she left and attempts to steal the diamond, but Kilala and Rei figure him out. Kilala returns the diamond and Jasmine gives her a flower given to her by Aladdin as a token to their friendship. Angered, Jafar has Iago steal the flower and take it <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> desert. They find a nearly drowned Aladdin and Genie. Sylphy steals the lamp again and wishes to find the flower. It changes into the sixth gem: an amethyst.|$|E

25|$|Other {{scenarios}} {{suppose that}} geological changes diverted the Sutlej towards the Indus and the Yamuna towards the Ganges, following which the river {{did not have}} enough water to reach the sea any more and dried up in the Thar desert. Active faults are present in the region, and lateral and vertical tectonic movements have frequently diverted streams in the past. The Saraswati may have migrated westward due to such uplift of the Aravallis. According to geologists Puri and Verma a major seismic activity in the Himalayan region caused the rising of the Bata-Markanda Divide. This resulted in the blockage of the westward flow of Sarasvati forcing the water back. Since the Yamunā Tear opening was not <b>far</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> blocked water exited from the opening into the Yamunā system.|$|E
25|$|She {{missed the}} 2008 Asian Indoor Championship in Doha {{and began the}} outdoor season with another {{national}} record, recording 51.75seconds at the Shizuoka International in May. She was expected to improve further at the Osaka GP, but wet conditions slowed the athletes and she finished third with 52.55seconds. At the national championships, which were also the trials for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she beat hurdles specialist Kubokura to the title and was selected to represent Japan at the Olympics. At the Olympics in August, she recorded 52.60seconds in the qualification rounds, which was not sufficient to progress. She returned to the track with the Japanese relay team. While their time of 3:30.52 was not <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> team's national record, it left them in eighth place at the heats stage.|$|E

He focused on the track in 1962 and came away with his first individual medal at the 1962 European Athletics Championships, securing the bronze medal in the 10,000 metres behind Soviet runner Pyotr Bolotnikov, {{in spite of a}} groin injury. Fowler was only the second British man to win a European medal at that distance, after Frank Sando. He made an appearance over the same distance at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games, but was <b>far</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> podium in eighth place.
