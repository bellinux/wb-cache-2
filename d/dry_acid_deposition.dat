Atmospheric particles, or particulate matter, can be solid or liquid with diameters varying from around 0. 002 [micrometers] to roughly 100 [micrometers]. Atmospheric aerosol sources {{can be classified}} as primary or secondary, with the primary aerosol being directly emitted from the corresponding sources and the secondary particles being formed in the atmosphere, for example, from gas-phase chemical reactions that produce condensable vapors. At the same time aerosol particles are ultimately connected {{with the formation of}} water droplets and equivalently with the formation of clouds and fogs in the atmosphere. The first part of this thesis concerns the mathematical modeling of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> and of the relevant physicochemical processes. Acid deposition consists of the delivery of acidic substances, principally sulfuric and nitric acid, from the atmosphere to the earth's surface. Upon emission to the atmosphere, SO 2 and NOx, are photochemically oxidized, yielding sulfuric and nitric acid vapors. Sulfuric acid is rapidly incorporated into aerosol particles, while nitric acid may be scavenged by particles or droplets or remain in the gas phase. Even {{in the absence of an}} aqueous phase (no clouds or fog), the acidic gases and dry particles can be transported to and deposited at ground level; this process is called dry deposition. When an aqueous phase is present (inside a cloud or a fog), gas-phase species like SO 2, HNO 3, NH 3 and aerosol particles are scavenged by water droplets resulting in a solution that can be significantly acidic. Additional cloudwater or fogwater acidity beyond that attained purely from scavenging of gases and particles results from aqueous-phase chemistry, most notably oxidation of dissolved SO 2 to sulfuric acid. These acidic droplets can reach the earth's surface either as precipitation or as impacted cloud and fogwater, in the processes termed wet deposition. If they are not rained or deposited out the aqueous droplets can evaporate leaving as residue new aerosol particles that may themselves undergo dry deposition to the earth's surface. The effects of acid deposition include soil and lake acidification, forest decline and deterioration of cultural monuments. Mathematical models are a major tool in our effort to understand and ultimately control acid deposition. The development of such a mathematical model represents a major challenge as it requires the ability to describe the entire range of atmospheric physicochemical phenomena. As a first step in the modeling, a comprehensive chemical mechanism for aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry was developed and its detailed sensitivity analysis was performed. The main aqueous-phase reaction pathways for the system are the oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI) by H 2 O 2, OH, HO 2, O 2 (catalysed by Fe 3 + and Mn 2 +), O 3, and [ [...] . ]. The dominant pathway for HNO 3 (aq) acidity is scavenging of nitric acid from the gas phase. HCOOH is produced because of the reaction of HCHO(aq) with OH(aq). The gas-phase concentrations of SO 2, H 2 O 2, HO 2, OH, O 3, HCHO, NH 3, HNO 3, and HCl are of primary importance. Increase of the liquid water content of the cloud results in a decrease of the sulfate concentration, but an increase of the total sulfate amount in the aqueous-phase. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, a condensed mechanism was derived. The next step was the development of a model that actually predicts the amount of liquid water in the atmosphere solving the energy balance. This Lagrangian model combines for the first time a detailed description of gas and aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry with a treatment of the dynamics of radiation fog, that is the fog that is created due to the radiative cooling of the earth's surface to the space during the night. The model was evaluated against a well documented radiation fog episode in Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley of California over the period January 4 - 5, 1985. This application showed that the model predictions for temperature profile, fog development, liquid water content, gas-phase concentrations of SO 2, HNO 3, and NH 3, pH, aqueous-phase concentrations of [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ], and finally deposition rates of the above ions match well the observed values. The fog was found to lead to a drastic increase of deposition rates over those in its absence for the major ionic species, with most notable being the increase of sulfate deposition. Several important differences were found to exist between the characteristics of a radiation fog and a representative cloud environment. Radiation fogs typically develop under stable conditions (very low wind speed) resulting in weak mixing and significant vertical gaseous species concentration gradients. Because of the proximity of the fog to ground-level sources of pollutants like SO 2 and NOx, the corresponding gas-phase concentrations can reach much higher levels that in a cloud. In such a case, pathways for aqueous-phase sulfate production that are of secondary importance in a cloud environment may become significant in a fog. The next level of treatment beyond assuming that all the water droplets have the size and chemical composition is to explicitly model the size-composition distribution of droplets as a result of nucleation on aerosol particles. A third model was developed to study the distribution of acidity and solute concentration among the various droplet sizes in a fog or a cloud. The major finding of this study was that significant solute concentration differences can occur in aqueous droplets inside a fog or a cloud. For the fog simulated, during the period of dense fog, the solute concentration in droplets larger than 10 [micrometers] diameter increased with size, in such a way that droplets of diameter 20 [micrometers] attain a solute concentration that is a factor of 3. 6 larger than that in the 10 [micrometer] droplets. Chemical processes tend to decrease the total solute mass concentration differences among the various droplet sizes. Low cooling rates of the system also tend to decrease these concentration differences while high cooling rates have exactly the opposite effect. The mass/size distribution of the condensation nuclei influences quantitatively, but not qualitatively, the above concentration differences. The effects of equilibration processes on wet and dry deposition were then investigated and furthermore the accuracy of the currently used modelling approaches of these phenomena was examined. Atmospheric equilibration processes between two phases with different deposition velocities have the potential to affect significantly the amount of total material deposited on the ground. The magnitude of the effects of the equilibration processes depends primarily on the ratio of the deposition velocities of the two phases, on the production/emission rate of the gas-phase species, and on the initial distribution of species between the two phases. At this point all the tools were available for the detailed investigation of the cyclical relationship between the aerosol and aqueous droplets; a polluted atmosphere with high aerosol concentration assists the formation of the aqueous phase which itself appears to enhance smog production, visibility reduction and aerosol sulfate levels after its dissipation. A model including descriptions of aerosol and droplet microphysics, gas and aqueous-phase chemistry and deposition was used to study the transformation of aerosol to fog droplets and back to aerosol in an urban environment. Fogs in polluted environments have the potential to increase aerosol sulfate concentrations, but at the same time to cause reductions in the aerosol concentration of nitrate, chloride, ammonium and sodium as well as in the total aerosol mass concentration. The sulfate produced during fog episodes favors the aerosol particles that have access to most of the fog liquid water which are usually the large particles.

The 10 – day HYSPLIT back trajectories showed that majority of air masses arriving to Bangladesh were originated from the west. The gridded emissions (0. 055 ° or ~ 5. 5 km) for Dhaka division was prepared for 2006 by updating a preliminary emission inventory (EI) available for 2000 and by conducting a new EI for two major source categories, brick kilns and traffic. In Dhaka division as of 2006, the brick kilns contributed the largest SO 2 emission (about 70 %), while residential emissions had the highest share of CO and PM 10 (over 60 %) and substantial NMVOC (about 40 %). Emission rates of SO 2 and NOx in the dry season of 355 t/d and 183 t/d, respectively, were higher than the corresponding rates in the wet season of 60 t/d and 146 t/d, which was mainly due to the operation of brick kilns in the <b>dry</b> season.

Wet acidic deposition is what is {{commonly referred to as}} acid rain {{as it is in the}} form of rain, snow or fog. Dry deposition can be equally as important as wet deposition, but is in the form of acidic gases and particles. Scientists prefer to use the term <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> in referring to acid rain, as it includes both wet and dry deposition. All rain is naturally acidic with a pH of around 5. 5.

Acid chloride sulfate waters of the Rio Agrio drainage basin on the northwestern flank are the only waters on PO & that are affected by leakage of acid brines from the summit hydrothermal system. Acid sulfate waters found on the northwestern flank are produced by the interaction of surface and shallow groundwater with <b>dry</b> and wet <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> of SO * and H 2 S 0, aerosols, respectively. The <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> {{is caused by a}} plume of acid gases that is released by a shallow magma body located beneath the active crater of PO&. No evidence for a deep reservoir of neutral pH sodium chloride brine is found at PO & The lack of discharge of sodium chloride waters at PoEis is attributed to two factors: (1) the presence of a relatively volatile-rich magma body degassing at shallow depths (< 1 km) into a high level summit groundwater system; and (2) the hydrologic structure of the volcano in which high rates of recharge combine with rapid lateral flow of shallow groundwater to prevent deep-seated sodium chloride fluids from ascending to the surface. The shallow depth of the volatile-rich magma results in the degassing of large quantities of SOz and HCl. These gases are readily hydrolyzed and quickly mix with meteoric water to form a reservoir of acid chloride-sulfate brine in the summit hydrothermal system.

40|$|Copyright 2005 : Jing Ma This project {{presents}} {{an application of}} artificial neural network (ANN) approach to the simulation and prediction of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> conditions in the United States. The previous research is mainly focused {{on the effect of}} emission. However, with the increase of NOx emissions, <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> problem could become more serious in some areas despite stricter controls on SO 2 pollution from coal-burning power plants. Therefore, a more systematic approach that focuses on both SO 2 and NOx emissions is needed for the long-term simulation and prediction of the <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> condition. In this study, <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> data from various monitoring sites in U. S. were collected. Feedforwrd backpropagation ANN models were constructed. Based on SO 2 and NOx emissions from power plants and field data on precipitation chemistry, the networks were trained and tested. Then, the networks were used to predict SO 2 and NOx emissions and hydrogen ion concentration according to the projected acid precipitation ion concentrations. The results obtained from the ANN modeling approach indicate that although it is promising to bring the precipitation pH value up to 4. 8, it is difficult to increase the pH to a normal value of 5. 0 based on the current <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> data patterns. A higher pH value of 6. 0, which is necessary for full ecosystem recovery, would be a more challenging goal for 2010. Based on the prediction results for SO 2 and NOx emissions, it is critical that the reduction goal for NOx is added to the <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> related policy. i The prediction results of ANN models can provide reference value for the <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> policy making in the future.

Moreover, <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> {{becomes more and}} more serious in this area. In this context, two forest soils (a red soil and a yellow red soil, typically and commonly found in southern China) were collected from Hunan. The objectives are (i) to determine releases and changes in speciation fractions of heavy metals (especially Cd, Cu, and Zn) when the soils are contaminated with heavy metals and affected by simulated <b>acid</b> <b>deposition,</b> and (ii) to study effects of soil heavy metals and <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> on releases of soil Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Al 3 +. The soil samples were soaked in the solutions of CdCl 2, CuCl 2, and ZnCl 2 for 15 days to make contaminated soils containing 200 mg kg 1 of Cd, Cu, and Zn. Then the contaminated soils and the original soils were extracted with five simulated <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> solutions (pH ranged from 5. 6 to 3. 0 and total dissolved salts increased). The experimental results indicate that <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> leads to great releases of soil heavy metals due to complicated soil chemical processes, mostly cation exchange and partly dissolution of minerals at pH lower than 4. 2. These released heavy metals come mainly from soil exchangeable pools and other labile fractions. Releases of heavy metals are closely controlled by pH values or, in some cases, total cation contents in acid deposition; meanwhile, concentrations of heavy metals are negatively related to the relevant pH values in soil equilibrium solutions when pH values are in a range of 4. 2 – 5. 1.

The impact of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> ("acid rain") has been widely recognized. The processes by which <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> is neutral ized are closely related to the processes of normal chemical weathering; an understanding of the chemistry of weathering is thus essential for predicting the effects of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition.</b> 4. More high-qual ity data have become available on the chemical dynamics of smal I watersheds and large river systems, which represent the integrated effects of chemical weathering...|$|R
500|$|The mean annual {{precipitation}} for Larrys Creek is [...] According to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission: [...] "Pennsylvania receives the most <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> of any {{state in the nation}} because, in addition to being the third highest producer of the gases that cause <b>acid</b> <b>deposition,</b> we are also located downwind from the highest concentration of air pollution emitters." [...] The region's geology gives it a relatively low capacity to neutralize added acid. This makes the creek especially vulnerable to increased acidification from rain, which poses a threat to the long term health of the plants and animals in the creek.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>deposition,</b> in {{the form}} of <b>acid</b> rain and <b>dry</b> <b>deposition,</b> is the result of sulfur and {{nitrogen}} dioxide being emitted into the air, traveling and landing in a different place, and changing the acidity of the water or land on which the chemicals fall. <b>Acid</b> <b>deposition</b> in the Northeast United States from the burning of coal and in the West United States from utilities and motor vehicles caused a number of problems, and was partially exacerbated by the Clean Air Act, which forced coal power plants to use taller smoke stacks, resulting in farther transmission of sulfur dioxide in the air.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that enhanced <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> on to the canopies of commercial conifer forests in upland Wales has contributed to the release of Al into soil and stream waters. Relatively little is known about how soilhydrological and chemical processes interact in response to <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> and afforestation to regulate the transfer of Al-rich soil water into streams. A field-based hydrochemical study monitored the hydrology and soilwater chemistry of an afforested stagnopodzol at LlynBrianne (Mid-Wales) during a hydrological year. Water moved vertically through the soil profile, aided by root-promoted macropores. Soil water fluxes, estimated by the LEACHM model, indicated that 89...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} that has faced policy makers concerned with <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> is obtaining an integrated {{view of the}} underlying science related to <b>acid</b> <b>deposition.</b> In response to this challenge, the US Department of Energy is sponsoring {{the development of an}} integrated Tracking and Analysis Framework (TAF) which links together the key <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> components of emissions, air transport, atmospheric deposition, and aquatic effects in a single modeling structure. The goal of TAF is to integrate credible models of the scientific and technical issues into an assessment framework that can directly address key policy issues, and in doing so act as a bridge between science and policy. Key objectives of TAF are to support coordination and communication among scientific researchers; to support communications with policy makers, and to provide rapid response for analyzing newly emerging policy issues; and to provide guidance for prioritizing research programs. This paper briefly describes how TAF was formulated to meet those objectives and the underlying principals which form the basis for its development...|$|R
30|$|Cases of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> and {{acidification}} of most aquatic habitats {{have been}} documented (Baker et al., 1996; Sivaramanan, 2015). This phenomenon {{also referred to as}} acid rain is increasing especially in developing countries where modernization, urbanization and population increase have been a major driving force to the effect. One of the effects of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> on water bodies is the lowering of the pH levels, which consequently decreases fish population (Baker et al., 1996). But in spite of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> in these lakes and rivers, many fish species are known to live and adapt to the acidic waters. One of such fish species is Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, which has some mechanisms for adaptation to acidic water (Rebouças, Lima, Cavalcante, & Sá, 2015). Likewise, the tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum, shows increase growth in acidic waters and is negatively affected by waters with pH above 8 (Aride, Roubach, & Val, 2007). Similarly, Tribolodon hakonensis, a cyprinid teleost, lives and grows in the extremely acidic pH between 3.4 – 3.8 (Hirata et al., 2003).|$|R
40|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>deposition</b> {{commonly}} occurs due to {{conversion of}} primary acidic pollutants (SO 2 & NO 2) into secondary pollutants (H 2 SO 4 & HNO 3 and their salts). The main natural sources of <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> in Alexandria include lightening and microbial processes. Anthropogenic sources include traffic, industrial, fuel burning, and incineration activities. <b>Acid</b> <b>deposition</b> has ecological and economic effects {{in addition to}} health effects. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess acidity of dry and wet depositions in the atmosphere of Alexandria. Dry samples were collected as settled dust using plastic jar. Wet samples were collected as rain water using polyethylene bottle. All samples were analyzed for pH, sulfates, and nitrates. The relatively high pH values obsen ed in depositions of Alexandria city (6. 95 ± 0. 22) and (7. 14 ± 0. 49) for settled dust and rain water respectively indicating the conversion of the formed acids (H 2 SO 4 & HNO 3) into their salts. This explanation was confirmed by the relatively high concentrations of sulfates and nitrates. The average values were (14. 3 ± 4. 2...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} {{was made of}} the capacity of base cations to neutralize <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> and of the contribution of base cation deposition to forest nutrition in Europe. In large parts of southern Europe more than 50 % of the potential <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> was found counteracted by deposition of non-sea salt Mg 2 + + Ca 2 + + K+. In central and northwestern Europe, base cation deposition usually amounted to less than 25 % of the acid Input. Smallest base cation deposition relative to potential <b>acid</b> <b>deposition</b> was found in southern Scandinavia, Denmark, northern Germany and The Netherlands. A similar spatial pattern was found for the neutralization of acid anions in precipitation. Whereas in Scandinavia weathering is the dominant supplier of base cation to forest soils, in eastern and southern Europe, forests mainly rely on atmospheric deposition for the supply of base cations. Using error propagation, the random and systematic error in acid neutralization capacity for an average grid cell of 10 x 20 km was estimated to equal 45 - 55 % and 50 - 55 %, respectively...|$|R
