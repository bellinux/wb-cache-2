5|$|Although nothing <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> this image, we {{associate}} the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave {{her life for}} her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E

When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>In</b> order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it is a surprise party for Michael.|$|E
5|$|LCD Soundsystem {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, This <b>Is</b> <b>Happening</b> <b>in</b> May 2010. The album was LCD Soundsystem's first to {{debut in the}} top ten of the Billboard 200, selling around 31,000 copies in its first week of sales. The band officially disbanded in 2011, after playing their last show at Madison Square Garden. They eventually reunited in late 2015, embarked on a world tour, and released their fourth studio album, American Dream, in September 2017. It {{went on to become}} the band's first number-one album in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

25|$|Past the Wallula Gap the OWL is {{identified}} with the Wallula Fault Zone, which heads towards the Blue Mountains. The Wallula Fault Zone is active, but whether that {{can be attributed to}} the OWL is unknown: it may be that, like the Yakima Fold Belt, it is a result of regional stresses, and is expressed only in the superficial basalt, quite independently of what ever <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the basement rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this kind of {{argument}} is just that, in defining the meaning of what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> society, {{it is very difficult to}} provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.|$|E

25|$|In {{trying to}} {{appreciate}} how the quarter-wave plate transforms the linearly polarized light, {{it is important}} to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate what <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>In</b> the case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the quarter-wave plate merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field.|$|E
25|$|When asleep, {{a person}} is unable to make {{judgments}} as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, {{they are unable to}} help a person judge what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} these {{multiple}} firings from multiple areas {{to be combined}} into a specific extrinsic event, there must be help from the dorsal thalamus. It is not proven whether the dorsal thalamus is the primary organizer, but it does fit the specific profile for collecting neuronal activity and rapidly coordinating between what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the brain and outside of it. The space {{in and around the}} dorsal thalamus, the thalomocortical area, is able to generate fast voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations which allow it to react quickly to received messages. The types of channels that cover this area are presumed to be GABAergic. Since sensory awareness needs to be quick, the threshold for sodium and potassium in this area is quite low.|$|E
25|$|Few {{images of}} medieval {{football}} survive. One engraving {{from the early}} fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards {{each other with a}} ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.|$|E
25|$|Landless systems {{rely upon}} feed {{from outside the}} farm, {{representing}} the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge {{as well as a}} source for pollution. Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations, sometimes called factory farming. Much of this growth <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa. Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of growth hormones, are controversial.|$|E
