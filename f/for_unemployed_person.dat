40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} unemployment on the political preferences of citizens of the Czech Republic. It utilizes individual data from the international ISSP research for years 1994 - 2010. The hypothesis saying that unemployed people prefer left-wing parties to right-wing parties has been confirmed using the probit method. The probability of left-wing preference in case of entrepreneur is 14. 1 percentage points higher than <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>person.</b> This probability for economically inactive person is 4 percentage points lower. The assumption stating that positive influence on left-wing preference is stronger for involuntarily unemployed individual has been confirmed by the additional models. Voluntarily unemployed subjects prefer left-wing parties with probability 16. 1 percentage points lower than involuntarily unemployed individuals. A positive influence of age on preferences of left-wing parties and positive influence of religion on preferences of center parties have been confirmed. On the other hand, preferences of right-wing parties grow with higher social class or with increasing municipality size...|$|E

30|$|Although {{the first}} two {{hypotheses}} assume a general high willingness among <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> to accept job offers, one can expect a lower willingness with regard to interregional jobs. Anticipated moving costs {{are more likely to}} prevent unemployed individuals from accepting job offers. Although migration might be associated with higher relative income gains, it poses a higher risk <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> because periods of unemployment increase the risk of becoming unemployed again in the future (Arulampalam et al. 2001; Ludwig-Mayerhofer 2008 a: 214). This could be the case because employers have less information to evaluate the productivity of unemployed applicants, with detrimental effects {{on the quality of the}} match (Grassinger 1993). Awareness of this fact increases the risk of failure in the new job <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> and influences their assessment of the stability of the job on offer. This lower perceived job stability can be assumed to result in a comparatively lower propensity to accept interregional job offers. That is, it is likely that the actual costs of interregional migrations are assessed differentially by employed and unemployed individuals. The latter are more concerned with risk factors, such as the general employment options at the new location and the difficulty of finding new accommodations.|$|R

To study this question I utilize a reform which greatly reduced the incentives <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> to transfer to the SI. While there is evidence that this reform substantially lowered the incidence of sick reports among the unemployed, I find no evidence suggesting that the reduced sick re rate in turn affected the transition rate to employment...|$|R

30|$|Obviously {{employability}} is a {{key issue}} for labor market policy as labor market integration requires {{a certain degree of}} employability.

40|$|Support schemes <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> {{aiming to}} become {{self-employed}} have been recently reformed several times.

In 2006 both instruments were merged to the "start-up allowance" (Gründungszuschuss). Since the bridging allowance has been evaluated as effective and efficient and the start-up-subsidy reached new target groups, the latest reform shows several short-comings. First of all, an end of the start-up boom is to be expected with the newly attracted target groups not being reached anymore. Secondly, the design of the "start-up allowance" is suboptimal, where efficiency losses can be expected if participants aim at maximizing social transfers. First empirical evidence from data of 2007 supports most of these expectations. ...|$|R

40|$|By {{acknowledging}} the uncertainty and unpredictability {{of the job}} search process in an unemployment setting, the present study explored the predictive strength of dispositional employability in job search behaviours. Dispositional employability has been recognized as a potentially important personal resource that promotes job opportunities. However, it has rarely been assessed in an unemployment setting to date. According to recent employability models that differentiate between distal (i. e., personal strengths) and proximal (e. g., perceived employability) determinants of behaviour on the labour market, we hypoth- esized that: (i) dispositional employability relates positively to job search intensity and (ii) perception of one’s employment possibilities (i. e., perceived employability) serves as an explanatory mechanism of this relationship. The hypothesized structural model was tested among a heterogeneous sample of 533 <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> in Croatia. The results of structural equation modelling provided support for our hypotheses: dispositional employability related positively to job search intensity via perceived employ- ability. Accordingly, nurturing dispositional employability may be beneficial <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> as it relates positively to engagement in job search behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Based on West German {{data of the}} Socio-economic Panel (SOEP), the {{job entry}} of Dual System leavers is analyzed. All those are {{selected}} who successfully completed the Dual System {{during the period from}} 1984 - 1992. A short time after finishing their apprenticeship, every sixth gainfully employed person is working overqualified, i. e. at an inadequate job. Half of them are working in jobs which need absolutely no qualification. The number of persons working in inadequate positions exceeds the number of <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons.</b> The selection process leading to those jobs is influenced by labour market circumstances as well as by personal characteristics. Transitions from inadequate to adequate work within a period of one year are rare; the corresponding transition rate <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> is even higher. The starting wages in inadequate work are higher than those received in adequate jobs; however, the wage difference is compensated in just one year by much higher wage growth rates of those people working continually in adequate jobs.

40|$|The aim of {{the wage}} subsidy program in Hamburg is to {{encourage}} the creation of low wage jobs <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with poor labor market opportunities. If a firm hires an unemployed job seeker, both the employer and the employee each receive a monthly wage subsidy of 250 Euros in the first ten months in case of fulltime employment and 125 Euros {{in the first six}} months in case of part-time employment. Using propensity score matching, we evaluate the microeconomic employment effects of this program. The results show that there are significant positive average treatment effects on the treated even ten months after expiration of the subsidy. One reason for the medium-term employment effects of the temporary subsidies may be that participants accumulate human capital which increases their productivity. Another explanation is that temporary wage subsidies reduce quasi-fixed labor costs. ...|$|R

[...] The system was to be electrified at 1,500V DC, similar to the Dutch style of electrification that had also been used on the LNER's Newport-Shildon line. This system had the advantage that regenerative braking could easily be employed; this provided braking by allowing an electric locomotive's motors to act as generators, thus assisting with control of heavy freight trains when running downhill. The power generated by a descending train's braking was fed back to the overhead lines and either used by other trains requiring power in the same block of line, or dissipated as heat in resistive loads at the electrical sub-stations.|$|R
40|$|Great {{expectations}} were {{connected with the}} so-called Hartz IV reform which came into effect five years ago. In fact the number of unemployed recipients of Hartz IV benefits drastically went down during the last economic rebound. In earlier economic cycles the number of unemployed recipients of social benefits had stagnated in phases of recovery. But this alone is only a weak sign for success: Firstly, unemployment on the whole decreased more than in previous economic recoveries, and secondly, reentering the labor market is a longer process for Hartz IV recipients than <b>for</b> other <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons.</b> This means that for Hartz IV recipients, the development of worklessness is less linked to the overall economic labor demand than <b>for</b> other <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons.</b> This {{is partly due to}} the fact that many of them lack professional training and have only a slim chance to get a new job. Additionally, they often live in areas with considerable labor market problems. Insofar it is indeed a success if unemployment rates drastically went down also for social benefits recipients.

During the quarter after claiming the subsidy, wages were highest <b>for</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> that refused to participate, followed by the control group; wages were lowest for those who actually used the voucher. They explain this result by self-selection of experimental participants – subsidies were typically refused by high-wage earners, who were reluctant to identify themselves as beneficiaries of the government. In a recent study, Brouillette and Lacroix (2008) obtained similar conclusions. They analyzed the Canadian “Self Sufficiency Project,” where previously randomly selected <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons,</b> who then became eligible (after   12   months of unemployment) and qualified (through taking up a full-time job within   12   months after establishing eligibility), received a generous in-work benefit (a subsidy paid to the employee). They analyzed the average wage during the six years after random assignment, conditional on employment, and showed that participating treatment group members earned less than control group members – but only some of those who were assigned to the treatment group actually participated in the program: In particular, individuals with a low expected wage rate had an incentive to participate in the income supplement scheme, assuming they received an offer, whereas those with high expected income did not participate.|$|R
