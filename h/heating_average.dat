40|$|Since core-collapse {{supernova}} simulations still {{struggle to}} produce robust neutrino-driven ex-plosions in 3 D, {{it has been}} proposed that asphericities caused by convection in the progenitor might facilitate shock revival by boosting the activity of non-radial hydrodynamic instabili-ties in the post-shock region. We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic 2 D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport {{to examine the effects}} of velocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation geometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic condition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce semi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino <b>heating,</b> <b>average</b> turbulent veloci-ties in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation limit of non-radial instabil-ities. The squared turbulent Mach number, 〈Ma 2 〉, reflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive runaway occurs for 〈Ma 2 〉 & 0. 3, corresponding to a reduc-tion of the critical neutrino luminosity by ∼ 25 % compared to 1 D. In the light of this theory, progenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic mass flux onto the shock: Differential infall efficiently converts velocity perturbations in the progenitor into den-sity perturbations δρ/ρ at the shock of the order of the initial convective Mach number Ma. The anisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify post-shock turbulence. Large-scale (` = 2, ` = 1) modes prove most conducive to shock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high convective Mach numbers. Initial den-sity perturbations in the progenitor are only of order Ma 2 and therefore play a subdominant role.

Few studies have quantified the relationship between stream temperature and canopy cover in the climatologically distinct deciduous forests of the central U. S. Hydroclimate data were collected from two intensively instrumented stream reaches of opposite orthogonal compass orientation in a semi-karst watershed on the border of southern Missouri's Ozark region, USA, during the 2010 water year. Data were compared to above canopy reference measurements to calculate an energy budget for each stream reach. Average leaf area index (LAI) during the year was 2. 64 in the riparian zone adjacent to the E-W oriented reach, and 2. 43 in the N-S reach riparian zone. Air temperature and relative humidity transect data analysis indicated that riparian microclimate was significantly different ([alpha]= 0. 01) from the stream edge 25 or 40 meters away for 3 of 4 transects. Average stream discharge was 0. 15 m 3 / and 0. 25 m 3 /s within the E-W and N-S reaches respectively. Mean stream temperature was greatest in August and was 24. 4 °C in the E-W reach and 24. 0 °C in the N-S reach. Net shortwave radiation was the primary energy flux causing stream <b>heating</b> (<b>average</b> 44. 7 W/m 2 for E-W reach and 46. 8 W/m 2 for N-S reach). Results suggest that riparian management practices in Missouri should potentially be altered to include wider buffers (40 meters) with less thinning (density dependent on stream size and discharge) to maintain pre-harvest stream temperature regimes...|$|E

To our knowledge, the addition of NaAlg as a stabilizer of copper nanoparticles has not been previously reported. It is expected that the obtained results will provide valuable additional information on: (1) the influence of reducing agent ratio on the formation of copper nanoparticles in order to design functional nanomaterials with increased antibacterial activity, and (2) structural changes related to the incorporation of Cu NPs into the polymer matrix. Methods: Cu NPs were prepared by microwave heating using ascorbic acid as reducing agent and NaAlg as stabilizing agent. The characterization of synthesized Cu NPs by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and semiquantitative analysis of the weight percentage composition indicated that the average particle sizes of Cu NPs are about 3 &ndash; 10 nm, they are spherical in shape, and consist of zerovalent Cu and Cu 2 O. Also, crystallite size and relative particle size of stabilized Cu NPs were calculated by XRD using Scherrer&rsquo;s formula and FT from the X-ray diffraction data. Thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), FT-IR, second-derivative spectra, and 2 D-IR correlation analysis were applied to studying the stabilization mechanism of Cu NPs by NaAlg molecules. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of stabilized Cu NPs against five bacterial strains (Staphylococccus aureus ATCC 6538 P, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and O 157 : H 7, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 and 14028) were evaluated with macrodilution, agar dilution plate count, and well-diffusion methods. Results: On the basis of the semiquantitative analysis, there was a direct correlation between the reducing agent ratio and the percentage of zerovalent Cu. This was confirmed with the statistical analysis of population of Cu NPs from TEM micrographs. At lower reducing agent ratios, two phases coexist (Cu 2 O and zerovalent Cu) due to incomplete reduction of copper ions by the reducing agent; however, at higher reducing agent ratios, the Cu NPs consist mainly of zerovalent Cu. Crystallite size and relative particle size of stabilized Cu NPs showed considerable differences in results and tendencies in respect to TEM analysis. However, the relative particle size values obtained from FT of XRD data agreed well with the histograms from the TEM observations. From FT results, the relative particle size and reducing agent ratio of stabilized Cu NPs showed an inverse correlation. The incomplete reduction of copper ions at lower reducing agent ratios was also confirmed by DSC studies. FT-IR and 2 D-IR correlation spectra analysis suggested the first event involved in the stabilization of Cu NPs is their electrostatic interaction with &ndash;C=O of carboxylate groups of NaAlg, followed by the interaction with the available O&ndash;C&ndash;O-, and finally with the &ndash;OH groups. Bacterial susceptibility to stabilized nanoparticles was found to vary depending on the bacterial strains. The lowest MIC and MBC of stabilized Cu NPs ranged between 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L for all studied strains. Disk-diffusion studies with both E. coli strains revealed greater effectiveness of the stabilized Cu NPs compared to the positive controls (cloxacillin, amoxicillin, and nitrofurantoin). S. aureus showed the highest sensitivity to stabilized Cu NPs compared to the other studied strains. Conclusion: Cu NPs were successfully synthesized via chemical reduction assisted with microwave <b>heating.</b> <b>Average</b> particle size, polydispersity, and phase composition of Cu NPs depended mainly on the reducing agent ratio. Likewise, thermal stability and antibacterial activity of stabilized Cu NPs were affected by their phase composition. Because of the carboxylate groups in polymer chains, the structural changes of stabilized Cu NPs are different from those of NaAlg. NaAlg acted as a size controller and stabilizing agent of Cu NPs, due to their ability to bind strongly to the metal surface. Our study on the stabilizing agent&ndash;dependent structural changes of stabilized NPs is helpful for wide application of NaAlg as an important biopolymer.
