40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} vegetables subjected to minimal processing (in MAP, and intended for cooking or {{for use in}} salads), dehydrated condiments and ready-to-eat vegetables such as soups and purees, was assessed by reference {{to their ability to}} scavenge lipoperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity. In the case, the MAP vegetables the measurements were repeated during eight days of storage in a domestic refrigerator and after cooking (boiling, microwaving, pressure cooking, griddling, frying and baking). MAP vegetables had a good or very good antioxidant capacity, and showed no significant loss of antioxidant activity or scavenging capacity compared with fresh vegetables. The cooking treatments that keep the antioxidant activity of MAP vegetables are microwaving, sautéing and baking. The most aggressive method of cooking were steaming, boiling and frying. The dehydrated condiments (tablets) showed higher antioxidant activity than the ready-to-eat soup. The enrichment of stews and casseroles, with <b>dehydrated</b> <b>vegetable</b> tablets, and the consumption of soup or vegetable purees represent an increased antioxidant intake in our diet.

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on the bioavailability of Fe in infant weaning foods, {{mainly because of the}} difficulties of measuring Fe utilization directly in infants. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a safe and relatively noninvasive method for studying Fe bioavailability (measured as percent Fe incorporation into red blood cells) in infants using 54 Fe, 57 Fe, and 58 Fe stable isotopes. Four commonly used weaning foods were selected for study, labeled extrinsically with 57 Fe- or 58 Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate, and fed to five female and five male 9 -mo-old fasting infants, using a multiple-dosing technique. Each food was given three times, labeled with one isotope, with a fruit juice drink containing 50 mg of ascorbic acid, and three times, labeled with a different isotope, with an ascorbic acid-free drink. Fourteen days after the last test meal, a blood sample was obtained from a heel-prick, spiked with a known amount of 54 Fe, digested, and purified by ion exchange; isotopic enrichment and total Fe content were measured by quadrupole thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The proportion of administered dose of isotope circulating in the blood was calculated from an estimate of blood volume. The geometric mean bioavailability (range) was 3. 0 % (1. 2 - 9. 5 %) in a proprietary <b>dehydrated</b> <b>vegetable</b> product, 3. 0 % (1. 1 - 21. 2 %) in Weetabix whole-wheat breakfast cereal, 3. 1 % (1. 2 - 15. 4 %) in wholemeal bread, and 4. 3 % (1. 7 - 10. 3 %) in baked beans. When taken with the drink containing ascorbic acid, there was a 2 -fold increase in bioavailability in all foods except the vegetable meal, presumably because this was already fortified with ascorbic acid.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Bacillus subtilis α-amylase {{was used}} to hydrolyze starch from peeled and whole {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum). Effect of gelatinization temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, temperature of hydrolysis and presence of calcium ions were investigated. Optimum conditions for hydrolysis were when α-amylase levels were 0. 3 percent of the starch concentration {{in the presence of}} 400 ppm calcium at pH 7. 0 and 80 °C for 2 hr. After centrifugation to remove residual material, the supernatants were adjusted to pH 5. 0 to 5. 5 with 30 percent sulfuric acid and heated at 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate α-amylase. Treatment with four percent activated charcoal decolorized the clear hydrolysate before the product was spray dried. The dried product was a light yellow powder, slightly sweet, relatively bland in taste and readily soluble in water. Dried potato hydrolysate made from peeled potatoes had a dextrose equivalent of 30 and contained 85 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 5. 5 percent ash; while the hydrolysate from whole potatoes had a dextrose equivalent of 26 and contained 86 percent carbohydrates, 8. 4 percent protein and 6. 0 percent ash. The composition of the carbohydrates of the two hydrolysates were similar except the hydrolysate from peeled contained a higher concentration of glucose and lower concentration of saccharides with a degree of polymerization greater than four. At concentrations of greater than 40 percent, the potato hydrolysate made from whole potatoes did not show as high a viscosity as commercial corn syrup solids with a dextrose equivalent of 24; the potato hydrolysate adsorbed twice as much moisture as the commercial corn syrup solids at 75 percent relative humidity at 23 °C for 30 days. Substitution of sucrose with whole potato hydrolysate in chocolate milk revealed that substitution of two parts of sucrose by two parts of potato hydrolysate could be used with a slight loss of desirability. Fifty and one hundred percent addition of whole potato hydrolysate to a commercial <b>dehydrated</b> <b>vegetable</b> soup mix showed no decrease in the desirability of the product.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>vegetables,</b> which provides {{an important source}} of vitamins, is increasing worldwide. <b>Dehydrated</b> <b>vegetables</b> are located on non-refrigerated shelves in food shops and, therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the modifications that take place in the content of these labile micronutrients at the ambient conditions currently found in food shops. The present study discusses the effect of storage for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months on the content of thiamin and vitamin C in different commercial and pilot plant dehydrated garlic, onions, potatoes and carrots in darkness at room temperature under vacuum conditions. The content of b-carotene under these conditions was also studied in dehydrated carrots. Thiamin remained stable over the first 3 months of storage (# 2; 90 % retention), while long-term storage led to larger losses (retention of 85 % in garlic and 45 % in commercial carrots after 12 months of storage). The content of vitamin C drastically decreased during the storage period and even disappeared in some dried onions and carrots following 12 months of storage. Storage for 6 months at ambient conditions preserved 80 ¿ 90 % of the b-carotene content in <b>dehydrated</b> <b>vegetables,</b> while long-term storage led to significant b-carotene degradation (retentions between 43 and 81 %). These results suggest that vitamins are gradually lost during storage at the practical conditions in food shops and will thus provide relevant information concerning dried vegetables, so manufacturers may calculate shelf life under established storage conditions.
