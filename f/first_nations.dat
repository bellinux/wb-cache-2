5|$|<b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> and Inuit {{organizations}} {{ranged in}} size from band societies of a few people to multi-nation confederacies like the Iroquois. <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> leaders {{from across the country}} formed the Assembly of <b>First</b> <b>Nations,</b> which began as the National Indian Brotherhood in 1968. The Métis and the Inuit are represented nationally by the Métis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami respectively.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the <b>First</b> <b>Nations.</b> By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> typically {{did not like the}} police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E
50|$|The Aboriginal {{population}} was less urbanised and relatively few lived in Vancouver. There are 11 indigenous nations located within Metro Vancouver {{and most of}} these <b>First</b> <b>Nation</b> people live in <b>First</b> <b>Nation</b> Reserves.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions {{between the government and}} the <b>First</b> <b>Nations.</b> The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reservations north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> were unhappy about the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made arrests and the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> to relocate to the northern side of the line.|$|E
5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2011 census, Aboriginal {{peoples in}} Canada totaled 1,400,685 people, or 4.3% of the {{national}} population, spread over 600 recognized <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> governments or bands with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music. National Indigenous Peoples Day recognizes the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples {{to the history of}} Canada. <b>First</b> <b>Nations,</b> Inuit and Métis peoples of all backgrounds have become prominent figures and have served as role models in the Aboriginal community and help to shape the Canadian cultural identity.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local <b>First</b> <b>Nations.</b> The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples {{used the}} {{materials}} at hand {{to make their}} instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{advocate}} of prohibition of alcohol, especially among Native Americans and <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> peoples, Belcourt petitioned the US Congress {{to prevent the}} illicit trafficking of liquor from Canada into the United States.

5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him {{to stand on the}} defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or undecided, to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> symbols and elements. The Coat of Arms of Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an igloo, all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who live in the area, while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a <b>First</b> <b>Nations</b> symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut.|$|E
