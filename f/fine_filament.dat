60|$|Their Heteromita, however, multiplied rapidly by fission. Sometimes a {{transverse}} constriction appeared; the hinder half {{developed a}} new cilium, and the hinder cilium gradually split from its base to its free end, until it was divided into two; a process which, {{considering the fact that}} this <b>fine</b> <b>filament</b> cannot be much more than 1/100000 of an inch in diameter, is wonderful enough. The constriction of the body extended inwards until the two portions were united by a narrow isthmus; finally, they separated and each swam away by itself, a complete Heteromita, provided with its two cilia. Sometimes the constriction took a longitudinal direction, with the same ultimate result. In each case the process occupied not more than six or seven minutes. At this rate, a single Heteromita would give rise to a thousand like itself in the course of an hour, to about a million in two hours, and to a number greater than the generally assumed number of human beings now living in the world in three hours; or, if we give each Heteromita an hour's enjoyment of individual existence, the same result will be obtained in about a day. The apparent suddenness of the appearance of multitudes of such organisms as these in any nutritive fluid to which one obtains access is thus easily explained.|$|E

Comparisons {{of the same}} cells in adjacent sections revealed that alcoholic hyalin is a fibrillar deposit without limiting membranes and is readily distinguished from giant mitochondria. This characteristic fibrillar structure was encountered in hepatocytes, ductular cells and in benign and malignant hepatomas. Three distinct morphologic forms of alcoholic hyalin were observed: a) bundles of filaments in parallel arrays, b) clusters of randomly oriented fibrils and c) a granular or amorphous substance containing only scattered remains of fibrils.

40|$|SUMMARY: The <b>fine</b> <b>filaments</b> of Bacillus megaterium {{are shown}} to arise from large basal cells: they have paired nuclear bodies within walls differing in {{composition}} {{from those of}} the normal vegetative cells. No evidence was found for any sexual fusion of these filaments. Young cultures of Bacillus megaterium often contain filamentous forms, especially when grown on blood-containing media. These differ from the vegetative cells typical of the growth cycle described by the author (Bergersen, 1953). DeLamater (1951), and DeLamater & Hunter (1953), described fusion tubes by means of which a diploid phase was instituted in B. megaterium. These tubes were <b>fine</b> <b>filaments</b> which fused with large haploid cells and were supposed to transfer nuclear material from one cell to another. Bisset (1953) criticized this work and stated that the filaments involved were septate, and it was therefore difficult to understand how they could function as fusion tubes.

We have explored the elastic properties of cadherin and ankyrin repeats through molecular dynamics simulations using crystallographic structures of proteins with one cadherin repeat or 4 and 12 ankyrin repeats, and using models of 17 and 24 ankyrin repeats. The extension and stiffness of large ankyrin-repeat structures were found to match those predicted by the gating-spring model.

40|$|SummaryThe hair-cell tip link, a <b>fine</b> <b>filament</b> {{directly}} {{conveying force}} to mechanosensitive transduction channels, is composed of two proteins, protocadherin- 15 and cadherin- 23, whose mutation causes deafness.

We present crystal {{structures of the}} first and second extracellular cadherin repeats of cadherin- 23. Overall, structures show typical cadherin folds, but reveal an elongated N terminus that precludes classical cadherin interactions and contributes to an N-terminal Ca 2 +-binding site. The deafness mutation D 101 G, in the linker region between the repeats, causes a slight bend between repeats and decreases Ca 2 + affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that cadherin- 23 repeats are stiff and that either removing Ca 2 + or mutating Ca 2 +-binding residues reduces rigidity and unfolding strength. The structures define an uncharacterized cadherin family and, with simulations, suggest mechanisms underlying inherited deafness and how cadherin- 23 may bind with itself and with protocadherin- 15 to form the tip link...|$|E

There are often significant amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater and this is another potential source of nutrients for pearl oysters.

Oxygen for aerobic metabolism is extracted from the water fl owing through the mantle cavity and CO is discharged.

40|$|Electrospinning {{technique}} {{has attracted a}} lot of interests recently, although it was invented in as early as 1934 by Anton (Anton, 1934). A basic electrospinning setup normally comprises a high voltage power supply, a syringe needle connected to power supply, and a counter-electrode collector as shown in Fig. 1. During electrospinning, a high electric voltage {{is applied to the}} polymer solution, which highly electrifies the solution droplet at the needle tip (Li & Xia, 2004). As a result, the solution droplet at the needle tip receives electric forces, drawing itself toward the opposite electrode, thus deforming into a conical shape (also known as “Taylor cone” (Taylor, 1969)). When the electric force overcomes the surface tension of the polymer solution, the polymer solution ejects off the tip of the “Taylor cone” to form a polymer jet. The charged jet is stretched by the strong electric force into a <b>fine</b> <b>filament.</b> Randomly deposited dry fibers can be obtained on the collector due to the evaporation of solvent in the filament.
