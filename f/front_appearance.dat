50|$|<b>Front</b> Office <b>Appearance</b> {{is a term}} {{typically}} used in human resources to describe the expected look of workers who are typically the first people encountered by customers (sales, secretaries, customer service) and thus {{need to make a}} first good impression on customers. The opposite is NFOA (No <b>Front</b> Office <b>Appearance).</b>|$|R
50|$|Avon's {{main office}} {{was one of}} his front organizations, a strip club named Orlando's. It was here, behind a locked and heavily guarded door, that the drug money was counted and secured before being sent on to its {{ultimate}} destination. Avon usually conducted his business in this office, rarely venturing onto the street. The club's legal owner, Orlando Blocker, was kept away from the drugs {{in order to maintain the}} <b>front's</b> <b>appearance</b> of legitimacy for the city.|$|R
50|$|The knob {{appears to}} have once been a round barrow, but now is a {{semi-circular}} bank with a round <b>front.</b> Its <b>appearance</b> may have changed {{in part due to}} vandalism based on the belief it was used to hoard treasure.|$|R
50|$|The House at 59-63 Crystal Street in Southbridge, Massachusetts is a well-preserved multiunit {{residential}} structure {{built to}} provide worker {{housing for the}} American Optical Company {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. It is a 2.5 story wood frame house, in a late Victorian style with both Italianate and Colonial Revival elements. Its side hall, gable <b>front</b> <b>appearance</b> is typical of many late 19th century houses in Southbridge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{version of}} the Deluxe was the 5A3, and {{is often referred to}} as having a TV <b>Front</b> <b>appearance</b> because the wide panels around the grill were like the television sets of the 1950s. This was true also of the smaller Fender Princeton student and studio amp introduced in 1946 and upgraded in 1948. Subsequent versions of the Deluxe were the [...] "wide panel" [...] cabinet design 5B3, 5C3, and 5D3, followed by the [...] "narrow panel" [...] cabinet 5E3. The Deluxe was the most popular of the Tweed amplifiers made by Fender.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, at the Earl's Court Commercial Motor Show, the F2300 appeared. This model {{had been}} {{developed}} due to pressure from the British sales network, and DAF, seeing a sales potential in Europe as well, was happy to oblige. The facelifted 2300 received an all new <b>front</b> <b>appearance,</b> looking like a smaller version of the DAF 2800 (which is exactly what it was). The 2300 was available with two, three, or four axles. The new cab design was called the F220. It replaced the F2200, and soon thereafter a series of smaller variations appeared, replacing the old F218 cabs entirely. Either a short or a sleeper design were available. The heavier 2100 and up models have twin round headlights mounted down low, while the lighter F1600 and 1800 have single rectangular headlamps mounted in the bumper.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 October 1940, Hitler {{issued a}} {{directive}} releasing forces for other <b>fronts.</b> The <b>appearance</b> of preparations for Sea Lion {{was to be}} continued to [...] keep political pressure on Britain, and a fresh directive would be issued if {{it was decided that}} invasion was to be reconsidered in the Spring of 1941.|$|R
5000|$|Of her <b>front</b> cover <b>appearance</b> in November 1997, Courtney Love remarked, [...] "I {{wanted to}} do a kind of mock-Eagles, decadent '70s California-type thing, and I ended up looking like Pamela Anderson on the cover! Bad, dirty Pam! It was terrible. But I didn't do it on purpose and it was gone in thirty days." ...|$|R
50|$|Halo {{headlights}} (also {{known as}} Halos, Corona Rings, {{and referred to}} as Angel Eyes because of the distinctive arrangement of lights placed in a circular pattern) are automotive front lighting units with luminous rings inside the headlight assembly. Introduced in 2000 by BMW, halos were originally typical of this automaker's cars but soon became a popular customization option to enhance any vehicle's <b>front</b> end <b>appearance.</b>|$|R
5000|$|First {{presented}} in Japan in October 1979 was a facelifted LA4 version with large, rectangular headlights {{and a more}} orthodox and European <b>front</b> <b>appearance.</b> The final addition was a 2.2-liter diesel engine produced between August 1980 and July 1981 for the sedan (LA4SS) from November 1981 for the wagon (LA4SV). Its output was [...] and 104 lbft Nm. In October 1980, a fuel injected [...] version of the 2-liter engine was also introduced for the Japanese market; it was only available with the hardtop bodywork and full equipment. The 929 was replaced after November 1981 by the next generation Luce/929, although the second generation station wagon continued in production until March 1988 as no wagon replacement of subsequent generations was ever developed. At {{the time of the}} generational change, the diesel engine was also installed in the van (wagon) model, only available with the GL equipment level.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, work {{started on}} a Lexus variant of the Toyota Land Cruiser (J100), the LX (J100). The final design by Hiroya Kitazumi was {{approved}} in 1995, with updates by Kitazumi approved in 2001 and 2004. Testing was conducted from the mid-1990s till late 1997. In December 1997, the second generation LX 470 debuted at Los Angeles Auto Show, going on sale {{in the second quarter}} of 1998. It shared the floor plan and most body panels with the equivalent Land Cruiser, and differed in its <b>front</b> <b>appearance</b> and had a more luxurious interior. Exterior design differences included a quad-headlamp forward fascia with larger grille and different wheels. It was powered by a LEV-certified 4.7-liter V8 engine, which initially produced , later upgraded to , then [...] The final torque value was [...] It was rated to tow 6500 lb with the tow package installed.|$|E
50|$|A mid-life cycle {{cosmetic}} facelift {{and mechanical}} refresh {{was carried out}} for the 1981 model year. In response to the recent 1979 energy crisis, the 1981 rework featured several fuel saving techniques {{to help make the}} Rounded-Line C/K-Series pickups more fuel efficient. Again, engineers turned to wind tunnels to resculpt the front end with new sheet metal, reducing areas which could hinder air flow and cause drag. A sleeker front bow-like look emerged, similar to a ship's bow with the front end being gently swept back from the center. New dual tier halogen headlamps became available with the Deluxe <b>Front</b> <b>Appearance</b> package. Mechanical updates included more anti-corrosion techniques, reduced weight, and a new 5.0 L 305 cubic inch V-8 with electronic spark control. The 5.7 L 350 cubic inch pushrod V-8 was offered in California in place of the new 5.0 L 305 engine with electronic spark control, which did not meet California's emissions requirements.|$|E
5000|$|A styling update for 1992 {{produced}} a more rounded <b>appearance</b> <b>front</b> and rear. A padded landau roof, {{similar to one}} previously featured on the [...] "Landau" [...] model, was now an option on the Salon.|$|R
5000|$|Springwing (スプリングウィング) - The Springwing is a winged {{animal with}} hooved <b>front</b> legs. The <b>appearance</b> of a Springwing is {{reminiscent}} {{to that of}} a hippogriff. It springs itself off cliffs, gliding with the alpine updrafts to reach its destination.|$|R

5000|$|The 147 {{underwent}} {{a number of}} facelifts during its career. The earliest cars had a front clip similar to the European 127, but later a new, reverse-rake <b>front</b> <b>appearance</b> was developed. Later yet (1983), the front was redesigned to match Fiat's new corporate face {{as defined by the}} new Uno. The pre-facelift body remained in use for a few years on the cheapest 147 C - to mark the newer versions as different, they received the additional [...] "Spazio" [...] label: this name later came to replace the [...] "147" [...] badge in Argentina. Along with the facelift, engine outputs all crept up by a few horsepower. In Venezuela, the Spazio was sold exclusively with the more powerful 72 PS engine as used in the Brazilian TR version. Production of the 147 C continued into 1987, after it had effectively been replaced by the new Uno. A mere 256 cars were built in 1987, however.|$|E
5000|$|The F30 and F31 Leopards were direct {{competitors}} to the Toyota Soarer, Mazda Cosmo, and the all-new Honda Legend coupe in 1986, Whereas the Soarer had the 1JZ-GTE, A twin-turbo 3.0 straight six; the similar-looking Leopard coupé {{came with the}} options of a V6 engine, thereby installing the engine aligned with the front axle and offering better front-to-rear weight distribution. The displacements of the Nissan V6 were of either a 3.0L or a 2.0L, {{and they were the}} VG30DET, VG30DE, VG20DET (post 1988), VG20ET (prior to 1988), and VG20E. Early 2.0 turbo versions had the single-cam (per bank) VG20ET, but from August 1988, the quad cam version appeared. The bodywork was also facelifted at this time, and now featured a somewhat smoother <b>front</b> <b>appearance.</b> It was the facelifted version that was exported to the USA, and approximately 12,000 Leopards were sold (with around 6,000 of those being converted to convertibles by ASC). In the USA, the F31 was called the Infiniti M30. Output of the VG30DE engine also increased marginally {{at the time of the}} facelift. Available in top spec form was the new turbocharged 3 litre VG30DET engine which produces [...] Only the smaller VG20ET and VG20DET engines had intercoolers.|$|E
5000|$|The Noxon House is a Georgian Home in Poughquag, a Hamlet of Beekman, in Dutchess County, NY. It {{was built}} in 1770 by Benjamin Noxon (born 1745) and stands {{alongside}} {{of what was once}} known as the Old Upper Road in historic Poughquag, NY. It is an intact Georgian home of the era, with brick exterior, hipped roof, square, symmetrical rectangular shape, paneled front door at center decorative windows and elements on either side over front door, five double hung sash windows across the second floor front and four on the first floor,four and four paired chimneys. It preserves a typical Georgian floor plan inside, with four over four and a center staircase ascending, another staircase descending behind it to the lower level and what was the original kitchen for the house. That kitchen still retains a beehive bread oven, large fireplace and original fittings, panels and beamed ceiling. Throughout, the house preserves its original wide plank floors, original windows and glass panes, many original moldings and doors, 8 fireplaces with original surrounds and mantels and original timbers and beams throughout the house. The house has a long history in the area and It is mentioned in travel accounts from the early nineteenth century."The old Poughquag Tavern, (now the residence of Daniel Thomas, Esq.) though of not so ancient origin as those just mentioned, yet may well claim mention here. It was built about the year 1800, by Henry Brill. It was afterwards considerably remodeled, but the <b>front</b> <b>appearance</b> is much {{the same as it was}} originally. This was the [...] "half-way house" [...] for the line of stages, running between New Mildorf and Poughkeepsie, and was well patronized by travelers and drovers. Its upper room has often resounded to the tread of the [...] "light fantastic toe," [...] and the loungers of the bar-room as often regaled with travelers' stories, for which the hardy adventurous life of those early times afforded abundant material. The Noxon house, built about the same time, was erected by Benjamin Noxon; and a portion of the brick of which it is constructed was manufactured on the farm on which it stands. It is rapidly falling into decay, and will soon be numbered among the things that were. The Beekman Cemetery is pleasantly located on the southern and western slope of a gentle eminence, north of the village of Poughquag. It is tastefully laid out, and decorated with evergreens, which mingling with the pure white marble of the numerous monuments and headstones, produce a pleasing effect.|$|E
50|$|The Velo Rossa is a fibre {{reinforced}} plastic composite (usually fiberglass) automobile body built by Reaction Research (a.k.a. ZTrix.com and formerly known as VR Engineering) in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. It is designed to re-style {{the body of the}} 1970-1978 Datsun/Nissan S30 Z series cars. <b>Front</b> end <b>appearance</b> panels (hood, fenders) are replaced. Doors and rear external components (which are part of the unitized body/frame of the Datsun) are over-skinned after trimming out the wheel wells for wider tires.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Schorer {{notes in}} his 1961 {{biography}} of Lewis that reception of The Man Who Knew Coolidge was mixed. It suffered both unfavorable reviews, including critic Heywood Broun calling it [...] "the dullest writing ever {{to come from a}} first-class writing man", and favorable notices, among the latter being a <b>front</b> page <b>appearance</b> on the New York Times Book Review section. Schorer himself appeared unimpressed, calling The Man Who Knew Coolidge [...] "a more trivial project".|$|R

50|$|Gingivitis, gingival enlargement, and {{increased}} levels of dental plaque are common in persons who chronically breathe through their mouth. The usual effect on the gums is sharply confined to the anterior maxillary region, especially the incisors (the upper teeth at the <b>front).</b> The <b>appearance</b> is erythematous (red), edematous (swollen) and shiny. This region receives the greatest exposure to airflow during mouth breathing, and {{it is thought that}} the inflammation and irritation is related to surface dehydration, but in animal experimentation, repeated air drying of the gums did not create such an appearance.|$|R
50|$|For Operation Barbarossa, the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, Germany deployed the 8.8 cm Flak in 51 mixed AA battalions. They were mostly Luftwaffe-subordinated units attached to the Heer at corps or army level, with approximately one battalion per corps. The weapon saw continuous use on the eastern <b>front.</b> The <b>appearance</b> of the outstanding T-34 and the later KV tanks shocked the German panzer crews and anti-tank teams, who could only penetrate the Soviet tanks' armor at extremely close range on the order of 200 yards when using the standard 37 mm and 50 mm guns while the Russian 76mm gun was effective out to 1000 yards.|$|R
50|$|This Gothic {{church at}} 381 Main Street faces east {{from the west}} side of Main Street on the central block between Court and Washington streets. it is set back from the street with a lawn in <b>front.</b> Its {{substantial}} <b>appearance,</b> emphasized by the sombre tones of the heavy brownstone construction, contrasts greatly with the flat facades and brightly decorated storefronts on Main Street.|$|R
5000|$|The DKW 3=6 (F93). This {{was built}} in Brazil between 1958 and 1967 as the DKW-VEMAG Belcar ("beautiful car"). The station wagon was called the [...] "Vemaguet". The {{mechanics}} remained unchanged. In 1965, Fissore reworked the <b>front</b> and rear <b>appearance,</b> with twin headlights, and a new grile. The front doors were front hinged, in total about 51,000 of the Belcar variants were built in Brazil.|$|R
50|$|Armed Forces Radio Service {{shows in}} which Crosby participated during wartime (December 7, 1941 - August 15, 1945) totalled more than 70 and {{included}} Command Performance (30 appearances), Mail Call (13 appearances), GI Journal (19 appearances), Song Sheet (at least 5 appearances), Personal Album (many <b>appearances),</b> <b>Front</b> Line Theatre, and Jubilee (at least twice). In addition his regular Kraft Music Hall show was transcribed for the Armed Forces.|$|R
50|$|In 1770 the {{entrance}} front to the house, {{as well as}} the south front were cased with brick and the old windows were replaced with large, sash windows. The old, gabled attics were concealed behind a wall of brick; and sham, glazed windows were added to the new, brick <b>front</b> giving the <b>appearance</b> of a third floor without attics. The north wing of the house, as well as part of the back were not modernized, and remained as timber and plaster.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the brick nogging (infill between the timbers) is plastered with stucco while the timbers are not; this is unusual as the only house in Kentucky known to have this feature. The 32 ft by 28 ft house also has a steep roof and just one window each for the two <b>front</b> rooms. The <b>appearance</b> {{of the house is}} much like historic Colonial dwellings in the eastern colonies. The construction is thus dated to pioneer era and perhaps the 18th century.|$|R

50|$|In 1969, the Ambassador {{received}} a major restyling, with a 4 in gain in overall length and wheelbase. The 122 in wheelbase {{was accompanied by}} an increase in front and rear track from 58.5 to 60 in. The <b>front</b> end <b>appearance</b> was revised with new quad headlight clusters mounted horizontally in a new molded plastic grille. The grille itself was blackout with a chrome horizontal bar that connected the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille's raised center portion, and it faintly recalled Packard's classic grille/hood combination. Richard A. Teague, AMC's Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car's appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The People's Chamber [...] (German: Volkskammer) was the unicameral {{legislature}} of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). From {{its founding}} in 1949 until the first free elections on 18 March 1990, {{all members of the}} Volkskammer were elected via a list controlled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), called the National <b>Front.</b> Despite the <b>appearance</b> of a multi-party system, all these Bloc parties were completely subservient to the SED. In addition, seats were also allocated to various mass organizations affiliated with the SED, such as the Free German Youth.|$|R
40|$|We study a dual front {{behavior}} {{observed in}} a reaction–diffusion system arising initially {{in the context of}} phase field models. A precursor front propagates into a stable phase, generating a metastable “intermediate phase”. This intermediate phase then decays via an oscillating front, producing a periodic structure which later coarsens. Unlike previously studied models in which dual <b>fronts</b> appear, the <b>appearance</b> of the split front is controlled not by an interchange of wave speeds, but by the existence of the precursor wave. By means of an expansion in small thermal diffusivity, we argue that this behavior is generic...|$|R
