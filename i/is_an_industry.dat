500|$|Imperial Bedrooms also {{breaches}} {{several new}} territories. When compared to Less Than Zero, its [...] "huge shift" [...] is a technological one. The novel picks up on {{many aspects of}} the early 21st-century culture, such as Internet viral videos which depict executions. The novel reflects how technology changes the nature of interpersonal relationships. Additionally, Clay is text-stalked throughout the book; Ellis himself had been [...] "text-stalked" [...] before in real life. Ellis feels this was an unconscious exploration of the dynamics brought on by the new technology. The author also predicts that [...] "fans of Less Than Zero" [...] may [...] "feel betrayed"; Imperial Bedrooms thrust is its [...] "narrative... of exploitation". One reviewer describes the novel's [...] "central theme" [...] as [...] "Hollywood <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> town running on exploitation", and criticizes this theme for being unoriginal in 2010. An Irish Times review notes positively however that Ellisvision of society is bleak; his dark studies of the human animal as shocking as ever." [...] The new setting poses questions, such as [...] "Is Hollywood intended as a variation of ancient Rome? Is the movie industry a coliseum?" [...] Another review found that the celebrity setting, as visited before in his novel Glamorama (1998), allows Ellis to make a number of observations about contemporary pop culture via Clay, such as when he asserts [...] "that exposure can ensure fame". Ellis comments how in Less Than Zero, Clay's passivity worked to protect him from the [...] "bleak moral landscape he was a part of", which he views as Clay's major flaw. Ellis developed this into the more unabashedly 'guilty' Clay of the new novel. Ellis says that [...] "a portrait of narcissism was the big nut that I had. Of entitlement. This imperial idea." [...] The difference he notes between this [...] "portrait of a narcissist" [...] and his earlier ones, such as American Psycho and Lunar Park, {{come in the form of}} its more moral bent: [...] "This time", Ellis comments, [...] "the narcissist reaches a dead end." [...] To one reviewer, Clay's world at its most exaggerated, in the scenes of torture, reach Huxleyan heights of dystopian fantasy, comparing Imperial Bedrooms to Brave New World (1932), [...] "where the [...] "command economy" [...] now manifests as rampant, late-capitalist consumerism, where ambien is the new soma and humans are zombies: one character's face is [...] "unnaturally smooth, redone in such a way that the eyes are shocked open with perpetual surprise; it's a face mimicking a face, and it looks agonized." ...|$|E
