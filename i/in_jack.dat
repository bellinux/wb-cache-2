5|$|Colonies {{are mainly}} {{polygynous}} with polyandrous queens, however, polyandry <b>in</b> <b>jack</b> jumper colonies {{is low in}} comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated {{to each other as}} mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation <b>in</b> <b>jack</b> jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away.|$|E

5|$|After an {{impressive}} underdog triumph {{in making the}} playoffs in 2010, and Joe Sacco finishing third <b>in</b> <b>Jack</b> Adams Trophy voting, the Avs failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in 2011. Earning only 68 points in the standings, setting a franchise record for losing and winless streaks after the All-Star break, the Avalanche have seen their worst season yet since moving to Denver. One point less than their previous worst season in 2008–09. They finished 29th in the 30-team NHL, besting only their division mates, the Edmonton Oilers. Matt Duchene set a franchise record as the youngest scoring leader in Quebec/Colorado history with 67 points, sharing the club goals-leader title with David Jones, each with 27 tallies. Former Avs great Peter Forsberg attempted a comeback in the NHL with Colorado mid-season. After two games, zero points and compiling a plus-minus rating of –4, however, Forsberg announced his retirement from professional hockey. Captain Adam Foote also retired after the final game of the season.|$|E

When he confronts Devon Banks in his office, Devon offers Jack a position in the mail room, laughing, but Jack accepts. Jack later tells Liz of his plan to work his way back to his old job through honest means, though Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) shows a sexual interest <b>in</b> <b>Jack</b> he could leverage into a quicker promotion. When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her business adviser. Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he can sue the drivers.|$|E

During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten.

5|$|Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had {{to contend}} with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which {{consisted}} of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the AWA. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring <b>in</b> <b>Jack</b> Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E

5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by spore print color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow spore print and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously <b>in</b> <b>jack</b> pine and Scotch pine forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
5|$|The English cloth {{industry}} grew considerably at {{the start}} of the 15th century, and a new class of international English merchant emerged, typically based in London or the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economies of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. Fishing in the North Sea expanded into deeper waters, backed by commercial investment from major merchants. Between 1440 and 1480, however, Europe entered a recession and England suffered the Great Slump: trade collapsed, driving down agricultural prices, rents and ultimately the acceptable levels of royal taxation. The resulting tensions and discontent played an important part <b>in</b> <b>Jack</b> Cade's popular uprising in 1450 and the subsequent Wars of the Roses. By the end of Middle Ages the economy had begun to recover and considerable improvements were being made in metalworking and shipbuilding that would shape the Early Modern economy.|$|E

5|$|The Mummy is a 1911 American short silent film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film details the story of Jack Thornton, a businessman, who {{is in love with}} Professor Dix's daughter. Jack purchases a mummy and plans to win his respect as an Egyptologist, but the mummy is reanimated in Jack's room by a live electrical wire. The mummy takes immediate interest <b>in</b> <b>Jack,</b> but is rejected and mummifies him. Before Professor Dix can cut up the now-mummified Jack, she returns and saves him. Jack explains everything and the film concludes with Professor Dix marrying the mummy.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis <b>in</b> <b>jack</b> jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder <b>in</b> <b>Jack</b> Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E

5|$|Queens are polyandrous, {{meaning that}} queens will mate more than once; queens mate with one to nine males during a nuptial flight, and the {{effective}} number of mates per queen ranges from 1.0 to 11.4. Studies {{show that most}} queen ants will only mate {{with one or two}} males. If the number of available male mates increases, the number of effective matings per queen decreases. Colonies are polygynous, meaning that a colony may house multiple queens; there are on average one to four queens per colony, and in multiple-queen colonies, the egg-laying queens are unrelated to one another. Based on a study, 11 of the 14 colonies tested were polygynous (78.57%), showing that this is common <b>in</b> <b>jack</b> jumper colonies. When the queen establishes a nest after mating, she will hunt for food to feed her young, making her semi-claustral. Nests can hold as few as 500 ants or as many as 800 to 1,000. Excavated nests typically have populations ranging from 34 to 344 individuals. Jack jumper ant workers are gamergates, having the ability to reproduce in colonies with or without queens.|$|E
