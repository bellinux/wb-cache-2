5000|$|At the Khan's court, Kolya lays {{plans to}} use the Mongol army to enter China and rebuild the trading posts and towns that were lost in the Discontinuity. Sable disagrees, and instead proposes to take the army to Babylon. She hopes to find the unexplained radio beacon, believing it {{connected}} to whatever <b>inconceivable</b> <b>event</b> caused the Discontinuity, and thus the centre of power in [...] "Mir". When Sable saves the Khan's life by shooting dead a sabre-toothed cat with her hidden side arm, Genghis accepts her as truly an emissary of Heaven, takes her to his bed, and agrees to her plan to take Babylon.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{original}} licensing application for the prototype fast-breeder reactor, MONJU, the event progression during an unprotected loss of flow (ULOF), {{which is one}} of the technically <b>inconceivable</b> <b>events</b> postulated beyond design basis, was evaluated. Through this evaluation, it was confirmed that radiological consequences could be suitably limited even if mechanical energy was released. Following the Fukushima-Daiichi accident, a new nuclear safety regulation has become effective in Japan. The conformity of MONJU to this new regulation should hence be investigated. The objectives of the present study are to conduct a preliminary evaluation of ULOF for MONJU, reflecting the knowledge obtained after {{the original}} licensing application through CABRI experiments and EAGLE projects, and to gain the prospect of in-vessel retention for the conformity of MONJU to the new regulation. The preliminary evaluation in the present study showed that no significant mechanical energy release would take place, and that thermal failure of the reactor vessel could be avoided by the stable cooling of disrupted-core materials. This result suggests that the prospect of in-vessel retention against ULOF, which lies within the bounds of the original licensing evaluation and conforms to the new nuclear safety regulation, will be gained...|$|R

During this <b>event,</b> <b>inconceivable</b> amount of material riches were piled up before him in offering, and taking this as an auspicious event, Zhabdrung Rinpoche significantly renamed the place as Pungthangkha meaning "the Mouth of the Plains to Heaps [of Riches]. " Then he had everyone present there to sit in rows and recite the lineage-supplication to his successive re-incarnations, which was indeed the beginning of the present-day "Zhugdrel Phunsum Tshogpa" (rows of auspicious sitting) ceremony. Since then, as all forms of noble activities were ventured with the preceding of this ceremony, it served the purpose of accomplishing all endeavors free of obstacles. As such, although we may lack physically displayed offering, yet through our mental visualization, we must always offer any food or drinks before partaking them to the objects of our refuge, the Three Jewels and the local protectors and gods with utmost faith while reciting the following offering verses. Doing this will not only enable us to receive blessings of the material energy but also serve as a method to accumulating merits. For this reason, the offering verses of Zhugdrel Phunsum Tshogpa, food and tea are translated into English...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{recording}} naturally occurring activity from peripheral nerves in waking human subjects was first presented in 1966 (Vallbo and Hagbarth, 1967). This recording technique allows the afferent {{activity in the}} single units to be assessed with an extreme accuracy while, at the same time, the subject's experience of the stimuli may be explored with psychophysical methods. This approach opens the possibility (a) to define exactly the functional properties of primary afferent units in man and (b) to assess directly whether a correlation exists between a defined property of the afferent activity, and {{an element of the}} perceptive ex-perience. It seems that these kinds of studies may narrow the gap, so far <b>inconceivable,</b> between biophysical <b>events</b> in the nervous system and perceptive phenomena within the mind, and thereby con-tribute {{to an understanding of the}} mechanisms by which the human brain brings into existence the product which we introspectively experience as consciousness. The present report is a discussion of some problems and pit-falls in the study of psychoneural correlates in tactile sensibility, particularly as seen in relation to this recording technique. On the other hand, other experimental approaches which feasibly may be combined with this technique will not be considered, such as block-ing of selected groups of nerve fibers with local anaesthetics or compression, nor artificial activation of nerve fibers by electrical stimulation. The fundamental work on psychoneural correlates in tactile sensibility by Mountcastle's group and others was largely based on neurophysiological data extracted from subhuman primates and psy-chophysical data collected from human subjects (Werner an...|$|R
