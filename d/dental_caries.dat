Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

2500|$|Naturalized from Latin into English (a loanword), caries in its English form {{originated}} as a mass noun {{that means}} [...] "rottenness", that is, [...] "decay". When used in that sense, it takes singular verb inflections (just {{like the word}} decay does). Thus caries was not traditionally a plural word synonymous with holes or cavities; that is, {{it was not the}} plural form of any singular form cary meaning hole or cavity. Nonetheless, the idea that it is such a plural is a reanalysis that naturally occurs to most English speakers, and the reanalyzed sense is common enough to be entered in various dictionaries and to exist in respectable usage. It still shows a hint of its reanalyzed origins in that it remains idiomatically limited to a plurale tantum sense—that is, like scissors or glasses, one speaks of plural caries obligately in the plural—not of one scissor, glass, or cary. (This is why one can look for a singular count-noun form of <b>dental</b> <b>cary</b> in any of a dozen major medical and general dictionaries and not find it listed.) Many still use it in the traditional sense (mass, singular), which is why they speak of carious lesions rather than just caries when they intend the plural count sense.|$|R

5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since <b>dental</b> <b>caries</b> associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of <b>dental</b> <b>caries.</b> The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid <b>dental</b> <b>caries.</b>|$|E

5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} <b>dental</b> <b>caries,</b> enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of <b>dental</b> <b>caries</b> in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces <b>dental</b> <b>caries.</b> This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} silver diammine fluoride (SDF) solution application in arresting <b>dental</b> root <b>caries</b> and to assess the color of arrested caries lesions. MethodsThis {{study was conducted in}} elderly centers in Hong Kong. A total of 83 elders with 157 root surfaces with active caries lesion were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Gp 1 (placebo control) —annual application of soda water; Gp 2 –annual application of SDF solution; Gp 3 –annual application of SDF solution immediately followed by potassium iodide (KI) solution. Color of the arrested root caries lesion was assessed with reference to PANTONE color plates and classified into one of the followings: yellow (7401 U); light brown (1245 U); dark brown (4635 U); and black (Black U). Status of root surfaces was assessed every 6 months by the same independent examiner. ResultsAfter 30 months, 100 (64 %) of the included root caries lesions were reviewed. The arrest rates of root caries were 45 %, 90 %, and 93 % in Gp 1 (control), Gp 2 (SDF) and Gp 3 (SDF/KI), respectively (χ 2 test, p 0. 05). The distributions of arrested caries lesions by color were not significantly different between the SDF and SDF/KI groups (χ 2 test, p> 0. 05). ConclusionsApplication of SDF solution, with or without application of KI afterwards, is effective in arresting root caries among elders in a water fluoridated area. In the long term, blackening of arrested root caries is not reduced by immediate application of KI after the application of SDF.

5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The <b>dental</b> <b>caries</b> of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} <b>dental</b> <b>caries</b> {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and <b>dental</b> <b>caries</b> may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

Materials and methods: In this study, 50 intact and carious molar and premolar teeth were mounted in wax and underwent bitewing radiographic techniques. Then 40 volunteer dental students from Isfahan Faculty of Dentistry categorized proximal carious lesions in special questionnaires. Subsequently the teeth were sectioned in a mesiodistal direction at the center of the contact area and evaluated clinically under a microscope at × 5. The results reported by the students were compared with the results of microscopic evaluation (gold standard). Statistical formulas were used to determine specificity, sensitivity and false positive and negative results. Results: This study showed that sensitivity of intact and carious surfaces were 64. 8 % and 62. 2 %, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity of enamel and dentin caries were 55. 6 % and 69. 6 %, respectively.
