40|$|This article {{examines}} popular {{dissatisfaction with the}} proportionality standard in self-defense law, which holds that the prevention of harm cannot be achieved by causing harm that is disproportionate. Legal elites, such as prosecutors, judges, and legal scholars, have long championed versions of this standard. But there is an increasingly widespread movement in the United States and Europe to modify elite notions of proportionality. Common to these movements is the desire to replace complicated balancing tests with clearer rules, which would limit the discretion of prosecutors and judges, and to permit use of deadly force against attackers in more situations. Fueling the movements {{is the belief that}} government is not able or willing to adequately protect its citizens. While these reform movements are occurring in many countries, the article focuses on three places in particular: Florida, Britain, and Belgium. For each place, the author discusses events that led to dissatisfaction with existing rules, political debates surrounding reform, and detailed legislative action. Efforts in Florida and Britain show an approach to reform that centers on presumptions that deadly force may be used in certain situations, such as a forcible entry into a home. Efforts in Belgium show another approach, which is in effect an expansion of provocation doctrine: anyone who exceeds the bounds of proportionality because of emotion (fear, anxiety, or panic) caused by attack or threat of attack is not criminally liable. The paper then analyzes the two types of efforts. The author concludes that emotions caused by attack are proper <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>mitigation,</b> but not for complete exoneration. Reforms that emphasize presumptions may be justified, particularly presumptions about {{the use of force against}} those who forcibly intrude into the home...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problems associated with acting under orders. Bearing in mind that all the recipients of orders are beholden to their superiors, and every citizen is beholden not only to the laws of the state but also to his conscience, the question arises as {{to the extent to which}} the obedience of the person carrying out the orders should or can exempt him from punishment. This paper seeks to answer the question of the actual content, in German and in international law, of the regulations pertaining to actions carried out in compliance with orders, and in particular whether such actions represents particular grounds for exemption from punishment or should only be considered within the framework of other reasons for granting exemption from punishment. Answers will be sought to the question of whether acting under orders should represent grounds for exemption from punishment in a stricter sense or merely <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> of sentence. This question is based on the interplay of international and national criminal law precepts and consequently it concerns the point of intersection between international law and criminal law. Therefore it was necessary to investigate the primary sources of international law to that effect in terms of art. 38 Section 1 of the ICJ Statute. International agreements, international legal custom and legal principles as recognized by civilized nations can be seen as the primary sources of international law. The primary sources of international law are the aforementioned forms of lawmaking inasmuch as the process whereby a law as such is created already provides a sufficient basis for legal validity for the ensuing rights and obligations. In addition to the three primary sources of international law the essential aspect was to consider the most important judicial decisions and the decisive learned opinions as an aid to achieving a judicial finding in terms of art. 38 Section 1 lit. of the ICJ Statute. Finally, an elicitation was necessary of the rulings by international organizations, i. e. by intergovernmental and non-governmental international organizations, which are described in art. 38 I of the ICJ Statute as not being legal sources sui generis, but which are increasingly important in the evolution of international law. Finally it should be pointed out that, in contrast to domestic law, international law does not recognize any limitation on the types of lawmaking...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} climate change viewed from the poverty context of the region will deepen {{the plight of the}} continent. Nonetheless, the {{engagement}} of the asset of local governance will bring about a lot of opportunities owing from the fact that governance is about creating opportunities with, through and for society. In the face {{of climate change}} in Africa local governance will create a number of opportunities {{for the benefit of the}} region including technological Innovation, local government finance enhancement, social capital improvement and capital and asset investment. This is against a background of passivity, half-hearted involvement and indifference by the civic society pertaining to issues of local development. This paper assesses the role of the institution of local government as it gives the general oversight over actions parametrically availed by local citizens, line ministries and departments and bilateral and multilateral agencies as they act on the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> and adaptation to the climate change challenge with a special focus on the Africa region...|$|R
5000|$|If X {{is charged}} with assault and the {{evidence}} shows {{that he was only}} slightly drunk {{at the time of the}} act, he will not escape the clutches of the criminal law, because he will then be convicted of assault and the only role the intoxication will play will be to serve as a <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the <b>mitigation</b> of punishment. If the evidence shows that at the time of the act he was very drunk ..., so drunk that he lacked capacity, he would likewise not escape the clutches of criminal law, because he would then be convicted of contravening this section. However, if the evidence reveals that at the time of the act he happened to fall into the grey area between ‘slightly drunk’ and very drunk’, he will completely escape the clutches of criminal law; he will then ‘fall’ between the proverbial ‘two chairs’ and it would then be impossible to convict him of any crime. In this way the section could undoubtedly lose much of its effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|In performance-based {{geotechnical}} earthquake engineering, {{the required}} degree and spatial extent of <b>ground</b> densification <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> of liquefaction beneath a structure should be determined {{based on the}} acceptable levels of performance of foundation. Currently, there is no solution for evaluation {{of the amount of}} settlement and tilt of footings constructed on a densified ground which is surrounded by a liquefiable soil. This implies the need for numerical procedures for simulation of seismic behavior of shallow foundations supported on both liquefiable and densified subsoil. In this paper, the dynamic response of shallow foundations on a densified ground is studied using a 3 D fully coupled dynamic analysis. For verification of the numerical model, simulation of a series of centrifuge experiments has been carried out and the results were compared with the experimental measurements. After verification of the numerical model, a comprehensive parametric study has been performed to develop a methodology for estimating the effectiveness of subsoil densification in reducing liquefaction-induced settlement of shallow foundations. Range of problem variables were considered {{in a way that the}} possibility of bearing capacity failure is low enough. The proposed methodology can be utilized for development of a performance-based design procedure <b>for</b> liquefaction hazard <b>mitigation</b> by soil densification...|$|R
40|$|As {{increasing}} urbanization {{is taking}} place worldwide, earthquake hazards pose serious threats to lives and property in urban areas. <b>For</b> seismic hazard <b>mitigation,</b> a practical earthquake forecast method appears to be far from realization, because of the extreme complexity involved in earthquake processes (e. g., Kanamori et al., 1997). Another approach to mitigate seismic hazards {{is the development of}} early warning systems (ews) (Nakamura, 1984, 1988; Heaton, 1985; United States National Research Council, 1991; Teng et al., 1997; United States Geological Survey, 1998; Wu et al., 1998; Wu and Teng, 2002; Allen and Kanamori, 2003). An ews provides a few seconds to tens of seconds of warning time <b>for</b> impending <b>ground</b> motions, allowing <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> measures in the short term. Early warning systems that estimate the severity of ground shaking and its onset time are in operation in Japan (Nakamura, 1984, 1988, 1989), Mexico (Espinosa-Aranda et al., 1995), and Taiwan (Teng et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1998, 1999; Wu and Teng, 2002). This timely information can be used to minimize property damage and the loss of lives in urban areas. It can also be used for real-time loss estimation to aid emergency response and recovery (Wu et al., 2002) ...|$|R

I am loth to rake any of these ancient scandals from their well-deserved oblivion; but I must make good a statement which may seem overcharged to the present generation, and there is no piece justificative more apt for the purpose, or more worthy of such dishonour, than the article in the 'Quarterly Review' for July, 1860. (I was not aware when I wrote these passages that the authorship of the article had been publicly acknowledged. Confession unaccompanied by penitence, however, affords no <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> of judgment; and the kindliness with which Mr. Darwin speaks of his assailant, Bishop Wilberforce (vol. ii.), is so striking an exemplification of his singular gentleness and modesty, that it rather increases one's indignation against the presumption of his critic.) Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr. Young, the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a [...] "flighty" [...] person, who endeavours [...] "to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation," [...] and whose [...] "mode of dealing with nature" [...] is reprobated as [...] "utterly dishonourable to Natural Science." [...] And all this high and mighty talk, which would have been indecent in one of Mr. Darwin's equals, proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of conscience, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to Mr. Darwin's views, he can ask, [...] "Is it credible that all favourable varieties of turnips are tending to become men;" [...] who is so ignorant of paleontology, that he can talk of the [...] "flowers and fruits" [...] of the plants of the carboniferous epoch; of comparative anatomy, that he can gravely affirm the poison apparatus of the venomous snakes to be [...] "entirely separate from the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to themselves;" [...] of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask, [...] "what advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into which the blood can be evaporated?" [...] Nor does the reviewer fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with a little stimulation of the odium theologicum. Some inkling of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology, and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the proviso that he cannot [...] "consent to test the truth of Natural Science by the word of Revelation;" [...] but, for all that, he devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr. Darwin's theory [...] "contradicts the revealed relation of the creation to its Creator," [...] and is [...] "inconsistent with the fulness of his glory." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} a cost-effectiveness analysis of four water-saving irrigation techniques that are widely implemented in China {{to address the}} impacts of climate change: sprinkler irrigation, micro-irrigation, low-pressure pipe irrigation and channel lining. The aim is to thoroughly understand the economic feasibility of water-saving irrigation as an approach to coping with climate change. Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis, this study finds that water-saving irrigation is cost-effective in coping with climate change, and has benefits <b>for</b> climate change <b>mitigation</b> and adaptation, and for sustainable economic development. For the cost-effectiveness ratio of mitigation and adaptation, only that of channel lining is negative (<b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> is − 43. 02 to − 73. 41 US$/t, for grain yield increase − 34. 35 to − 20. 13 US$/t, and for water saving − 0. 020 to − 0. 012 US$/m 3). Sprinkler irrigation has the highest incremental cost <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> (476. 03 – 691. 64 US$/t), because when sprinkler irrigation is used, there may be additional energy needs to meet water pressure requirements, which may increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional irrigation. <b>For</b> <b>mitigation,</b> in districts where the pumping head for pressure {{is lower than the}} critical energy saving head, sprinkler irrigation should be avoided. Micro-irrigation has the highest incremental cost for adaptation followed by sprinkler irrigation and low-pressure pipe irrigation, but when considering the revenues from improved adaptation, all of the measures assessed are economically feasible. The results suggest that <b>for</b> <b>mitigation</b> and adaptation objectives, micro-irrigation performs best. From an economic perspective, channel lining is recommended. Therefore, a balanced development of channel lining and micro-irrigation according to different geographical conditions is recommended...|$|R
