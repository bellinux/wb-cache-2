40|$|A highly {{efficient}} method {{for the production}} of Bacillus thuringiensis protoplasts was developed. Formation of protoplasts was due to the activa-tion of autolytic factors. In order to achieve induc-tion of this autolytic system in a rapid and effi-cient manner, the appropriate conditions for growth and treatment were determined and opti-mized. Protoplast preparations obtained in this way were subjected to transformation with plas-mid DNA and to <b>interspecific</b> <b>fusion</b> with a Bacil-lus subtilis rec- strain. Results indicated that these protoplasts could efficiently take up exogenous plasmid DNA as well as act as DNA donors in fusion experiments. 2...|$|E
40|$|Protoplasts and {{spontaneous}} fusion bodies can be isolated {{from a number}} of tissues, by treating the tissues with a mixture of macerating and cellulolytic enzymes. The shape of the spontaneous fusion bodies frequently reflects the parental tissue structure. An electron microscopic study of the treatment of the oat root tip and tobacco leaf with enzymes, reveals that spontaneous fusion is brought about by the expansion of plasmodesmatal connexions within the tissue. Specific treatments befo 3 B and during enzyme treatment can affect the level of spontaneous fusion. The culture of spontaneous fusion bodies in solid media is less successful than in liquid media, where cytoplasmic reorganization, wall regeneration and division occur. The pattern of division is irregular and may not be mitotic. The level of multinucleation in cultures declines with time. Whilst some spontaneous fusion bodies decline and others may subdivide, microdensitometric evidence suggests that nuclear fusion or close aggregation may be occurring. There is, however, no microscopic evidence for nuclear fusion. The fusion of originally separate, uninucleate protoplasts can be induced by treatment with sodium nitrate. Membrane adhesion and fusion are followed by organelle redistribution and vacuolar fusion. No <b>interspecific</b> <b>fusion</b> bodies are formed and the intraspecific fusion products demonstrate a low viability. Other salts induce protoplast adhesion and abnormal plasmalemmar activity but not fusion. Similarly, Concanavalin A and lysozyme induce strong adhesion but no fusion. Treatment of protoplasts with Sendai virus can induce adhesion and eventual lysis, with membrane fusion as a likely intervening stage. Lysolecithin induces a similar reaction. It is possible that such reactions could be controlled to successfully induce protoplast fusion...|$|E

ΔpAMβ 1 is a 15. 9 -kilobase nonconjugative, deletion derivative of pAMβ 1, which is considerably larger than the pGKV plasmids (approximately 4. 5 kilobases). In general, ΔpAMβ 1 was transferred more efficiently than the pGKV plasmids. Using electroporation, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that failure of efficient transfer for the pGKV plasmids was, except for one case, caused by incompatibility of these plasmids with resident plasmids of the recipient strain...|$|R
40|$|Single {{nucleotides}} {{in higher}} plant organellar mRNAs {{are subject to}} post-transcriptional alterations by RNA editing, typically resulting in changes of the encoded protein sequence. Although some information has been acquired on the general features of the editing processes in both plastids and plant mitochondria, the mechanisms and factors involved in the selective recognition of the nucleotide to be edited are still unknown. To {{gain a better understanding}} of how an editing site is specifically selected by the organellar RNA editing machinery, we have attempted to rescue a previously generated tobacco plastid editing mutant. Using an <b>interspecific</b> protoplast <b>fusion</b> approach, we were able to restore RNA editing activity for a specific site in the psbF transcript that otherwise remained unedited. Our results suggest (i) that site-specific trans-acting factors mediate chloroplast editing site recognition and (ii) that these factors are of extraplastidic origin...|$|R

40|$|The present-day range {{distribution}} of many species has {{been influenced by}} re-occuring glacials of the past. By the retreat into different refugia situated in more southerly regions, species were geographically separated and sometimes diverged into separate lineages. After having re-occupied their formerly ice-covered habitats, these species pairs nowadays often exhibit parapatric distribution and some hybridize along their contact zones. Such a scenario probably also accounts for {{the origin of the}} very common monogynous and monandrous ant sibling species Temnothorax nylanderi and T. crassispinus. While the latter inhabits Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, T. nylanderi can be found in Western Europe. They occasionally hybridize along a narrow contact zone in North-Western Germany. In this study, using morphometry and genetic markers, the position of the contact zone in Southern Germany and Northern Italy was determined. The differentiation within and between the two species was analysed and the genetic structure of Central and South European T. nylanderi populations was compared. Further, the impact of hybridization on colony level was studied in detail. Previous findings were confirmed, that T. nylanderi can be exclusively found in Western and T. crassispinus in Eastern Europe, separated by a small zone of overlap. In Bavaria, the contact zone is situated along the Franconian Jura. South of the Alps, it probably lies somewhere in North-Eastern Italy, because in Slovenia and Croatia, only T. crassispinus has been found. The contact zone therefore runs far more west than expected from previous results. The genetic division between the species was constant with 2. 4 % and 3. 5 % divergence in the CO &# 921; and Cyt b haplotypes, suggesting that the species might have split 1. 5 - 2 Myr ago. Both species exhibited genetic uniformity on the nuclear and mitochondrial level. Their haplotypes revealed a lack of geographical origin, indicating rapid post-glacial recolonization. Further population genetic studies using microsatellite markers on several Central and South European T. nylanderi populations revealed equal rates of heterogenous (two or more matrilines) colonies due to colony fusion, a typical characteristic of this species. Thus, also in southern populations, colony odour appears to be mainly environmentally determined. Besides that, no bottleneck-induced north-south differences in genetic variability could be proofed. The significant inbreeding in both South and North European populations is probably a species-specific trait. It might result from random mating over time and habitat patchiness. As the sibling species are morphologically very similar, hybrids were classified by heterozygosity at the diagnostic allozyme locus GPI. Like in Northern Germany, both species co-occured in a rather narrow contact zone, which does not extend over more than 25 km. The narrowness of the contact zone apparently demonstrates hybrid inferiority. This was further confirmed by the detailed analysis of the hybrid zone, were almost no fertile hybrid queens were found. Pure hybrid colonies, consisting of exclusively heterozgous workers were rare. Instead most colonies contained both hybrid and T. crassispinus workers and co-occurred with pure T. crassispinus colonies. Besides that, the weight of hybrid virgin queens, which were as abundant as pure species� gynes (mostly T. crassispinus), is apparently negatively influenced by hybridization. However not directly, because co-occuring homozygous queens in hybrid colonies were also lighter. Mating was found to be almost exclusively unidirectional according to mitochondrial DNA data. Mixed hybrid colonies apparently originate by colony fusions between pure and hybrid lineages, as other reasons can be ruled out. The existence of <b>interspecific</b> colony <b>fusions</b> in nature has been additionally supported by laboratory experiments, where heterospecific fusions could be documented. This is probably facilitated by the high relatedness between the species and the environmentally influenced nestmate discrimination. Hybridization between the sibling species T. crassispinus and T. nylanderi apparently leads to an evolutionary dead-end. However {{it does not seem to}} be too costly, as hybrid colonies produced slightly more workers than pure species colonies...|$|R
