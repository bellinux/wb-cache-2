50|$|The M5 Bomb Trailer is a 2½ ton {{capacity}} vehicle {{used during}} World War II for transporting bombs from munitions storage areas to the aircraft for loading. Up to six M5s can be towed in a train. The trailer weighs 7,200 pounds when fully loaded.The front {{pair of wheels}} are mounted on a caster assembly like a shopping cart. They are free to rotate 360 degrees about their vertical axis. There is a <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> that resembles 1/2 of a disk brake rotor that has friction pucks pressing against it to dampen oscillations of the caster assembly. These trailers would be towed out to the flightline all hitched together like a train and the train would stop at the first bomber and the last trailer in the train would be disconnected. The train would then continue {{on to the next}} bomber. After the train left, the crew would manhandle the trailer to a position under the bomber to enable the loading of the bombs. The front caster wheel assembly made this relatively easy. And so each trailer would be detached and when the towing vehicle had left the last trailer, it would circle around and go back and pick up the now empty first trailer detached. Then it would proceed to pick the rest of the trailers, one at a time.|$|E

The model provides visualization of deformation and calculates force feedback during simulated epidural needle insertion. A spring-mass-damper (SMD) network is configured from {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRI) slices of patient’s lumbar region to represent varying stiffness throughout tissue structure. Reaction force is calculated from the SMD network and a haptic device is configured to produce a needle insertion simulation.

40|$|Jonas Chickering was the {{foremost}} American piano-maker in the early- to mid-nineteenth century. He perfected the iron frame {{in the square}} piano and the grand piano, adding stability and strength to the instruments, and launching his company into the international market. Even more, he took advantage of an age in which technology, transportation, financial abundance, and American idealism converged, propelling the piano, its music, and its artists into the American mainstream. The Chickering firm in the mid- 1800 's {{was one of the}} most respected manufacturing companies in the United States. In the history of pianoforte design, Jonas Chickering bridged the gap between the 19 th-century European pianoforte and the modern design epitomized by the Steinway company. His firm was also largely responsible for the "piano craze" that overtook the United States in the mid- 1800 's, in which "middle-class" status was epitomized by stationing a piano in the living room. This document gives an overview of the nineteenth-century Chickering company as a whole. It focuses specifically upon the design and construction of the nineteenth-century Chickering square and grand. In conducting research for this dissertation, I began with a study of five Chickering instruments at the Smithsonian Institution, particularly noting the physical evolution of the square piano. Important primary-source information was gathered at the Smithsonian Institution Archives Center, whose Chickering & Sons collection includes the majority of the Chickering Piano Registers. A visit to the Fiske Museum in Claremont, California afforded an opportunity to study the earliest known Chickering grand in a public collection, as well as two Chickering squares. I also visited numerous other Chickering grands in California to trace further the evolution of the grand line. In order to examine more closely a representative instrument, the author acquired an 1869 Chickering square (Serial # 34936). Through dismantling its action and <b>damper</b> <b>assemblies,</b> I was able to gain more insight into the Chickering company's designs and production methods. A detailed summary of findings is included. This writer's intent is to explain the technological, musical, and ideological success of the Chickering company in producing perfect instruments for their time...|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the more conventional squeeze-film bearing damper designs, a Viton- 70 shear-mounted, elastomeric damper was built and tested in a T- 55 power turbine high-speed balancing rig.

40|$|Milling {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacturing}} industry. Numerous efforts {{have been made to}} improve the efficiency of milling. For the efficiency of the milling process, high demands on the material removal rate and the surface generation rate. The process parameters determining the two rates are restricted by the occurrence of regenerative chatter. This project deals with reduction of chatter vibration in end milling tool by introducing the dampers. The main objective of the present work is to design a damped milling tool. A mechanical damper has been introduced to reduce tool vibration in milling tool. The mechanical damper is composed of multi-fingered cylindrical inserts placed in a matching cylindrical hole in center of standard end mill cutter. Centrifugal forces during high speed rotation press the flexible fingers against the inner surface of the tool. Bending of the tool and <b>damper</b> <b>assembly</b> due to cutting forces causes relative axial sliding between the tool inner surface and damper fingers dissipates in the form of friction work simple numerical analysis using ANSYS is performed to estimate the amount of friction work during bending.

40|$|Abstract. Model {{updating}} {{techniques are}} used to update the finite element model of a structure, so that updated model can be predicted the dynamic behavior of an actual assembly structure more accurately. Most of the model updating techniques neglects damping and so amplitudes of vibration at resonance and antiresonance frequencies cannot be predicted by using of these updated models. In dynamic design of structures predicting of these properties is necessary. This paper presents a new technique to create an accurate finite element (FE) updated model of complex assembly structures consisting of substructures and real joint by considering damping of them. Given the fact that modal testing of real joints (such as bolt with some washers) are almost impossible. The updated model of assembly structure is obtained in four steps. In the first step, mass and stiffness matrix of substructures, joint and assembly structure are updated using modal data and Eigen-sensitivity approach. In the second step, <b>damping</b> of <b>assembly</b> structure is identified using complex modal data and updated mass and stiffness matrices which are obtained in first step. In the third step, the effect of damping of joint on frequency response functions (FRFs) extracted from updated model was shown. In the forth step, damping matrix of joint is updated by using FRF-based model updating method and finally damped updated model of assembly structure compared with measured data...|$|R

40|$|Friction induced {{vibrations}} in automotive brakes {{is recognized}} as {{a major problem in}} industry. Squeal is a difficult subject because of its unpredictability caused by a not completely understood sensitivity to variation of the system parameters. In the literature several analytical and numerical studies deal with the relationship between damping and system propensity to have instability. These studies highlight the existence of a nonintuitive effect of damping distribution on modal coupling that gives rise to the unstable vibrations. The complexity of commercial brakes and the difficulties to identify the values of modal <b>damping</b> in brake <b>assemblies</b> lead to the necessity to rely on experimental analysis using simplified test rigs. This paper presents an experimental investigation {{of the relationship between the}} distribution of modal damping and the propensity to develop squeal in a beam-on-disk setup, which reliably reproduces squeal events with easy control and measurement of the damping of the disk and the beam, respectively. The experiments highlight the key role played by the modal damping distribution on squeal: A nonuniform repartition of the modal damping causes an increase of the squeal propensity...|$|R
40|$|Virtually all {{previous}} research on the squeeze-film <b>damping</b> of rotor <b>assemblies</b> has considered the use of only one damper. However, many aero-engine rotor assemblies {{have at least two}} dampers and the interplay between them {{is an important factor in}} the overall vibration performance of the rotor. The purpose of this paper is to report results on a test facility which simulates the rotor of an aero-engine of the size used to power an executive jet. It draws general conclusions on the application of two squeeze-film dampers (SFDs) to such a rotor, while in the process qualitatively validating a suggested theoretical model of the SFD. The test facility is a three bearing rigid rotor assembly incorporating two sprung bearing supports, each in series with a weakly sealed squeeze-film damper. A range of practical configurations with different SFD static misalignments is studied. Non-linear jump phenomena and subharmonic resonances are demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically for a range of rotor unbalance. The paper is concerned with predicting and measuring rotor-centre responses and vibration orbits and drawing conclusions that are relevant to the designer.

40|$|The {{elaboration}} {{of an effective}} immune response against pathogenic microbes such as viruses, intracellular bacteria or protozoan parasites relies on the recognition of microbial products called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Ligation of the PRRs leads to synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Infected cells and other stressed cells also release host-cell derived molecules, called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, danger signals, or alarmins), which are generic markers for damage. DAMPs are recognized by specific receptors on both immune and nonimmune cells, which, depending on the target cell and the cellular context, can lead to cell differentiation or cell death, and either inflammation or inhibition of inflammation. Recent research has revealed that DAMPs and PAMPs synergize to permit secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) : PAMPs stimulate synthesis of pro-IL- 1 β, but not its secretion; while <b>DAMPs</b> can stimulate <b>assembly</b> of an inflammasome containing, usually, a Nod-like receptor (NLR) member, and activation of the protease caspase- 1, which cleaves pro-IL- 1 β into IL- 1 β, allowing its secretion.

Active vibration controlled drilling is introduced to reduce the vibration and increase the efficiency of drilling process. In this system, two main components that determine the damping coefficient are magnetorheological (MR) <b>damper</b> and spring <b>assembly.</b> Performance of vibration damping system is depending on the viscosity of MR fluid in the damper and spring constant of spring assembly. One of the key issues that are unclear from the design is {{the correlation between the}} axial spring stiffness configuration and the damping force which needs to be tuned actively.

The objective of the project is to extract the correlations for the viscous damping coefficient, equivalent spring stiffness and power input to the system. Simplified vibration model is thus created using Simulink, together with experimental data fed from APS Technology’s in-house team. Inputs of the simulation such as force exerted, mass of mandrel, spring constant and step time are based on the experimental data and can be adjusted to suit different experiments.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{has been}} to develop a front {{suspension}} of Hi-Per design suitable for a mid- or full size standard car. A Hi-Per suspension is {{a variant of the}} MacPherson strut suspension, with the difference of a steered knuckle and a rigid damper strut. In a MacPherson suspension the whole <b>damper</b> and knuckle <b>assembly</b> is steered, limiting the position of the steering axis by the body mounts of the strut. The designed suspension should fit into the same interface as a suspension of MacPherson type and should be applicable for three different models with different ride heights. The vehicles featuring the new Hi-Per suspension shall have an increased track width making an unchanged MacPherson suspension unsuitable with respect to kingpin offset based phenomena such as torque steer or influence of road disturbances. The base for the Hi-Per design was an available MacPherson vehicle and previous Saab vehicle models, of which one features a Hi-Per suspension design. Within the thesis, solutions available on the market today has been investigated and benchmarked as well as previous solutions within Saab. This has together with the free thinking of the designers hopefully form the best solution possible for the new Hi-Per design. The focus of the suspension has been to achieve a high level of commonality, {{at the same time as}} design requirements of packaging and kinematics are fulfilled together with maintenance and assembly improvements. Within the thesis a large effort has been used for packaging in CAD, at the same time as the geometry is verified by kinematic multi body simulations. This was done in order to fulfil wheel parameters and static design factors of the suspension. Within this thesis a complete pre-study has been performed. This pre-study has resulted in a design proposal, based on the simulation results incorporating Saab vehicle- and suspension requirements. The CAD-models have been designed with regards to clearance during bump, rebound and steering. The models have been designed with similar wall thickness and geometries as the existing Saab Hi-Per solution. The recommendations of this thesis are to continue working with the design proposal with regards to compliance calculations and more specific CAD-designs. There has not been any FE-analysis performed on the parts. Therefore there is a need to further investigate the CAD-models with regards to compliance calculations.
