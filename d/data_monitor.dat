40|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>data</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{and the need}} for the use of <b>data</b> <b>monitoring</b> committees in clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry differ from those of trials sponsored by government. <b>Data</b> <b>monitoring</b> is a continuous process in industry trials due to the regulatory requirements and the need to more thoroughly evaluate safety of new compounds. As part of this process, interim analyses are employed to make decisions about treatment effects. In some cases, such analyses may require the use of an external <b>data</b> <b>monitoring</b> committee to assist in the data review, analysis and decision making. A number of examples of interim analyses, with and without <b>data</b> <b>monitoring</b> committees, are discussed.

In particular the issues of sponsor participation in the <b>data</b> <b>monitoring</b> committee and controls of the decision making process are considered...|$|R

50|$|At-home {{long-term}} video-EEG monitoring {{reduces the}} financial burden, since {{the individual is}} no longer at a hospital, or place of care, {{for long periods of}} time, as well as allowing for possible epileptic triggers to remain. For example, how an individual has habits at their home, the feeling of their bed when sleeping, or stress levels at home may influence the onset of an episode. Remaining at home will keep the patient under the conditions they would normally be under, when experiencing a seizure. In contrast, long-term video-EEG monitoring may record non-cerebral signals from throughout the body such as biological and extra-physiological artifacts and thus makes the data logs susceptible to displaying false positives that can result in false seizure reports. These false data reports may then impede the neurologist from distinguishing where an episode may begin and end, or if an episode occurred at all. The use of at-home devices also introduces obstacles such as daily visits by a professional to collect the data logs and {{to take care of the}} equipment, equipment hazards, and lighting issues for the video recording device. Having long-term video-EEG monitoring sessions in a clinical setting provides a controlled environment that allows the health professional to most efficiently collect <b>data,</b> <b>monitor</b> seizure inducing procedures, and keep the equipment functioning properly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Water {{utilities}} {{continue to}} be interested in implementing syndromic surveillance for the enhanced detection of waterborne disease outbreaks. The authors evaluated the ability of sales of over-the-counter diarrheal remedies available from the National Retail <b>Data</b> <b>Monitor</b> to predict endemic and epidemic gastrointestinal disease in the San Francisco Bay Area. Methods Time series models were fit to weekly diarrheal remedy sales and diarrheal illness case counts. Cross-correlations between the pre-whitened residual series were calculated. Diarrheal remedy sales model residuals were regressed on the number of weekly outbreaks and outbreak-associated cases. Diarrheal remedy sales models were used to auto-forecast one week-ahead sales. The sensitivity and specificity of signals, generated by observed diarrheal remedy sales exceeding the upper 95 % forecast confidence interval, in predicting weekly outbreaks were calculated. Results No significant correlations were identified between weekly diarrheal remedy sales and diarrhea illness case counts, outbreak counts, or the number of outbreak-associated cases. Signals generated by forecasting with the diarrheal remedy sales model did not coincide with outbreak weeks more reliably than signals chosen randomly. Conclusions This work does not support the implementation of syndromic surveillance for gastrointestinal disease with data available though the National Retail <b>Data</b> <b>Monitor.</b> </p...|$|E
