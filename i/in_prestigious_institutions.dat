40|$|We {{study the}} location-specific {{component}} of research productivity for economics and finance faculty {{over the last}} three decades. We find that there was a positive effect of being affiliated with a top 25 university in the 1970 s; this effect weakened in the 1980 s and disappeared in the 1990 s. The decline in elite university fixed effect is due to the reduced importance of physical access to productive research colleagues, which in turn seems due to innovations in communication technology. One implication is that knowledge-based organizations should find it more difficult to capture rents vis-à-vis workers. We find that faculty salaries increased the most where the estimated spillover dropped the most. Despite the loss in local spillovers, elite universities still enjoy an edge in average productivity because of agglomeration of top researchers <b>in</b> <b>prestigious</b> <b>institutions</b> with high long-term research reputations.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{motivation}} of learners of Japanese in four universities across two countries, focusing specifically on the: 1) diversity of motivation {{in the process of}} language learning; 2) motivation as a predictor of academic achievement; 3) dichotomous instrumental/integrative paradigm; and 4) comparison of the de-gree of motivation among the universities. Three out of four universities did not show significant differences in the degree of motivation within an academic year. However, the outcomes were varied depending on the universities in comparing motivation among students enrolled in different course levels. Positive motivation and anxiety were found to be the best predictors of academic achievement. With regard to the integra-tive/instrumental dichotomy, neither element was seen as a better predictor.

40|$|While {{more and}} more {{services}} become virtualised and always accessible in our society, laboratories supporting Computer Science (CS) lectures have mainly remained offline and class-based. This apparent abnormality is due to several limiting factors, discussed in the literature, such as {{the high cost of}} deploying and maintaining computer network testbeds and the lack of standardisation for the presentation of eLearning platforms. In this paper, we present the FORGE toolkit, which leverages experimentation facilities currently deployed in international initiatives for the development of e-learning materials. Thus, we solve the institutional challenge mentioned in the ACM/IEEE 2013 CS curricula concerning the access and maintenance of specialised and heterogeneous hardware thanks to a seamless integration with the networking testbed community. Moreover, this project builds an ecosystem where teaching and educational materials, tools and experiments are available under open scheme and policies. We demonstrate how it already meets most of the requirements from the Network and Communication component of CS 2013 and some of the labs of the Cisco academy. Finally, we present experience reports illustrating the potential benefits of this framework based on first deployments in four post-graduate courses <b>in</b> <b>prestigious</b> <b>institutions</b> around the world...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to {{highlight}} the importance of operating with concepts, accepting the challenges offered by empirical reality. To do so, the empirical material produced by the research developed by Grupo de Pesquisa em Sociologia da Educação – SOCED/PUC-Rio was used as reference. On several occasions, Bourdieu questioned the merely theoretical reading of concepts. He recommended “experimenting with theoretical things”. In this text, we seek to exemplify the consequences of the experience of operating with his concepts, focusing on two main aspects: the conditions of habitus transformation; and the empirical outline of cultural capital in school elites <b>in</b> <b>prestigious</b> <b>institutions</b> in Rio de Janeiro. In the case of the cultural capital study, his proposal of working “with and against authors” became evident. Although the merit of this author of Education Sociology is undeniable, the empirical outline of the cultural capital, in his vast work, was highly influenced by the French reality at the time of his research. To operate with the concept of cultural capital in a way that is appropriate to the empirical challenges we faced, we turned to authors who have addressed the transformations of the cultural field beyond the perspective of the borders between high culture and popular culture analyzed by Bourdieu...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in approaches for creating new ventures has been amplified {{by a recent}} surge in practitioner-driven entrepreneurial methods. Entrepreneurship education programs <b>in</b> <b>prestigious</b> <b>institutions</b> as well as prominent incubators and accelerators have started adopting these methods. However, there are only few insights into how these methods relate {{to the practice of}} entrepreneurship and the implications for entrepreneurs and their organizations adhering to the various principles of these methods. A useful discussion of the interplay between entrepreneurial methods and the practice of entrepreneurship requires {{a better understanding of the}}se methods and their constituents. Although the notion of entrepreneurial methods exists in different forms in the entrepreneurship literature, there is no common understanding of the notion. This thesis seeks to present a better understanding of the entrepreneurial methods that guide entrepreneurial behavior. It reviews nine entrepreneurial methods and contributes by developing a conceptual framework to explain, organize and improve entrepreneurial methods. The proposed framework is based on a scheme that includes a trio of terms: logic, model, and tactics. Logic is the overarching rationale orienting the conduct of all venture creation activities. Model consists of related courses of action for conducting the activities deemed necessary to implement the logic. Tactics refer to a collection of practices aimed at progressing specific aspects of the process, which are guided by the model and are in line with the logic. The proposed framework will allow scholars as well as practitioners to rework and refine their prescriptive guidelines, and suggest directions for future entrepreneurial methods. Further, an interview-based case study provides insights into the relation between entrepreneurial methods and entrepreneurial practice...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{entering}} {{higher education}} in good numbers, candidates from some black and minority ethnic groups are concentrated <b>in</b> less <b>prestigious</b> <b>institutions.</b> A similar pattern is evident in candidates' applications, raising important questions {{about the role of}} 'self-exclusion'. Statistical analysis confirms that candidates from some minority ethnic groups tend to target lower-ranking institutions, but these differences are almost entirely explained by other variables, particularly academic attainment, type of school attended, number of A-levels taken and subject mix. It follows that some minority ethnic groups appear to be indirectly disadvantaged by patterns of schooling that do not prepare candidates for elite higher education. Similar processes are evident in relation to social class, although candidates from less privileged family backgrounds remain less likely to target high-status institutions even when other variables are taken into account...|$|R

50|$|Blair {{wrote in}} a time when print culture was flourishing and {{traditional}} rhetoric was falling out of favour. By focusing on issues of cultivation and upward mobility, Blair overshadowed the prevailing opinions of rhetoric and capitalised on the 18th century belief in the potential to rise above one's station. At this time, new money industrialists and merchants caused the middle class to rise and the English empire to grow. Blair's optimistic view that upward mobility could be affected by an understanding of eloquence and refined literature fit perfectly with the mentality of the time. In particular, the ideas presented in Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres were adapted <b>in</b> many <b>prestigious</b> <b>institutions</b> of learning and served as the guide on composition for many years.
