5|$|Born in University College Hospital in Fitzrovia, London, Miliband is {{the younger}} son of {{immigrant}} parents. His mother, Marion Kozak, {{a human rights}} campaigner and early CND member, is a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust thanks to being protected by Catholic Poles. His father, Ralph Miliband, was a Belgian-born Polish Jewish Marxist academic whose father fled with him to England during World War II. The family lived on Edis Street in Primrose Hill, London. His elder brother, David Miliband, still owns the <b>house</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|The White <b>House</b> <b>today</b> {{serves as}} a hotel and {{has a number of}} conference rooms on the ground floor, {{following}} extensive renovations in the 1990s. The hotel comprises 41 guest bedrooms (35 en-suite) across the White House and its modern extension. The White House also houses a bar in the Group Room, and a canteen-style restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} <b>house,</b> <b>today</b> the Ellwood House Museum's Education and Visitors Center, {{was built}} by Perry Ellwood as a multi-car garage. It had a grease pit for automobile repair work. On the second floor was an apartment for the Ellwood family chauffeur. The building originally had garage doors on both sides so cars could drive in one side {{and out the other}} side of the structure. The original doors are on display inside the Ellwood House Visitors Center.|$|E

5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia {{did their}} best to outdo each other in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold a reception for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State <b>House</b> (<b>today</b> Independence Hall), which might otherwise have been torn down. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original thirteen states during a four-month visit; the stay stretched to sixteen months as he visited all twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|The <b>house</b> <b>today</b> appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air {{could be described as}} Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E
25|$|On the grounds, behind Wheatland, stand a privy, a smokehouse, and a {{carriage}} house. A stable used {{to stand on}} the property but was replaced by the carriage house in the late 1880s; an icehouse also no longer exists. The carriage <b>house,</b> <b>today,</b> houses meeting and reception space.|$|E

25|$|Several {{buildings}} {{were designed by}} architect Conrad Schick: {{the mission of the}} London Jews' Society (today the Anglican International School); parts of the German hospital, and the Tabor <b>House</b> (<b>today</b> the Swedish Theological Institute) (#58), which Schick made into his own home. Schick planned the William Holman Hunt House (#64), which Hunt himself built.|$|E
25|$|Abram's {{most visible}} changes, begun in 1876, {{were the two}} front window gables, adding a Picturesque aspect to the house, and an update to the front entranceway and the {{accompanying}} hall, although it is uncertain from the <b>house</b> <b>today</b> exactly what changes were made. The porch roof may {{have been changed to}} its flat hipped style, more consistent with tastes of the time.|$|E
25|$|The first theatre in New Orleans was the French-language Theatre de la Rue Saint Pierre, {{which opened}} in 1792. The first opera in New Orleans was {{performed}} there in 1796. In the nineteenth century the city was the home of two of America's most important venues for French opera, the Théâtre d'Orléans and later the French Opera <b>House.</b> <b>Today,</b> opera is performed by the New Orleans Opera.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{was started by}} the D'Evercy family around 1220, and slowly expanded between then and the 18th century. For 750 years it remained little known, and little recorded. For {{a few years after}} World War II Brympton d'Evercy was a boys' school, before being reclaimed by its owners as a private <b>house.</b> <b>Today</b> occasionally hired out as a location for filming or a hospitality event, it remains essentially a private residence.|$|E
25|$|Several {{blocks to}} the south, along Liberty Street, is another site of major {{historical}} interest — the Hasbrouck <b>House,</b> <b>today</b> preserved as Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site owing to its use for that purpose during {{the last years of}} the Revolutionary War. To the north the area becomes more residential but still includes some of the city's older and larger homes, although some have been allowed to deteriorate in the last several decades.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years after}} the {{founding}} of Raleigh, the first Masonic lodge was built. Due to increased membership, the Masons raised funds {{for the construction of}} a new temple. The Masonic Temple Building, once used by local lodges and the state Grand Lodge, contained retailers on the first floor and offices throughout the rest of the building. The Masons sold the property in 1951 and relocated to the former Josephus Daniels <b>House.</b> <b>Today,</b> the downtown building continues to provide commercial and office space.|$|E

25|$|The Universal Tontine Association {{also failed}} to {{generate}} the hoped-for interest. In November 1792, its investors met at the Pennsylvania State <b>House</b> (<b>today</b> Independence Hall) {{to decide what to}} do with their fund. On November 12, they adopted a proposal to form a general insurance company, to be called the Insurance Company of North America. On November 19, the investors adopted articles of association, giving the company the ability to write fire, life, or marine insurance, though initially the investors would focus solely on marine.|$|E
25|$|At first, some of {{the younger}} Livingstons' estates {{followed}} the British colonial patterns of Clermont. Rhinebeck <b>House,</b> <b>today</b> known as Grasmere, is the best-preserved example. Later on the houses began to show the influence of contemporary French tastes, abandoning the large central hall in favor of smaller rooms and passageways inside and focusing more attention on the garden side of the house, which usually faced the river and mountains as well. Montgomery Place, built by Janet Livingston Montgomery after the death of her husband Richard, is the only example from this period that remains largely as it was when first built.|$|E
25|$|The Major Jacob Hasbrouck Jr. House {{is located}} on Huguenot Street in the Town of New Paltz, New York, United States. It was built in 1786 by Hasbrouck, {{grandson}} of Jean Hasbrouck, {{one of the original}} Huguenot settlers of the New Paltz area in the late 17th century, after he had moved out of the family home, two miles (3.2km) to the south in what is today the Huguenot Street Historic District.

25|$|The house {{known as}} 112 Ocean Avenue still exists {{but it has}} been renovated and the address changed in order to {{discourage}} sightseers from visiting it. The famous quarter round windows have been removed and the <b>house</b> <b>today</b> looks considerably different from its depiction in the films. The house in Toms River used as the location for the first three films has also been modified for the same reason. For the 2005 film version, the house was renamed 412 Ocean Avenue. The 2005 film remake says that the basement of the Lutz home was built in 1692, but 112 Ocean Avenue – also known as High Hopes – was built around 1924 for John and Catherine Moynahan.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the arts, Mary had a range of interests. She had a chemistry laboratory at Wilton House, where she developed medicines and invisible ink. From 1609–15 Mary Sidney probably {{spent most of her}} time at Crosby Hall in the City of London (now relocated as a private residence to Chelsea, London). She traveled with her doctor, Sir Matthew Lister, to Spa on the Continent, where she relaxed by shooting pistols and playing cards. In 1615 she commenced the building of a grand hunting lodge with fine vistas, Houghton House in Bedfordshire, on an estate granted to her by King James I, which she completed in 1621, shortly before her death. It is said that the <b>house,</b> <b>today</b> a ruin, was the model for House Beautiful in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).|$|E
25|$|Lancaster, as a {{historic}} city, {{has a wide}} range of historic buildings and venues. The city is fortunate to have retained many fine examples of Georgian architecture. Lancaster Castle, the Priory Church of St. Mary and the Edwardian Ashton Memorial are among many sites of historical importance. The city has numerous museums,including Lancaster City Museum, Maritime Museum, the Cottage Museum, and Judges' Lodgings Museum. Lancaster Friends Meeting House dating from 1708, is the longest continual Quaker meeting site in the world with the original building built in 1677. George Fox, founder of Quakerism, was near the site several occasions in the 1660s and spent two years imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. The meeting <b>house</b> <b>today</b> holds regular Quaker meetings and {{a wide range of}} cultural activities including adult learning, meditation, art classes, music and political meetings. The Lancaster Grand Theatre is another one of Lancaster historic cultural venues, under its many names, has been {{a major part of the}} social and cultural life of Lancaster since being built in 1782.|$|E
