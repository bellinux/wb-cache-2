5|$|In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, {{and played}} Boston in the Finals {{for the first}} time since 1969. The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> is {{credited}} as a turning point of the series. Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs {{got off to}} a good start, {{jumping out}} to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time in}} school history.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1971–72 NBA season, West was smarting {{from his}} {{frequent}} injuries and losses and considered retirement. The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach. Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career, the Lakers had a {{season for the}} ages. The team was powered by Sharman's emphasis on tough defense and <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> offense, and L.A. embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak, {{en route to a}} then-record 69 wins in the regular season. West himself contributed with 25.8points and led the league with a career-high 9.7assists per game. He was named All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>breaks</b> {{occur when}} an {{offensive}} player has the ball, and {{comes into the}} defensive half without anyone covering him. <b>Fast</b> <b>breaks</b> usually occur because a player caught an outlet pass from the goalie, won a face-off, or stripped the ball on defense and carries it the other way.|$|R

50|$|His {{speciality}} were <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> {{and goal}} area passes to the pivot or the left winger. In 45 national team games he scored 121 goals.|$|R
5|$|The Netherlands scored first, but Kean soon equalised, {{assisted}} by Stewart. The Dutch team responded, but Gauci took two points with a <b>fast</b> <b>break,</b> and then assisted Crispin in putting Australia in the lead, one which the Gliders would not relinquish. Stewart made {{the next two}} scores, from outside the paint, and assisted Crispin to bring the score to 6–16. The Dutch team fought back, {{but there was a}} 12–18 deficit at quarter time. The Australian defence shut down their opportunities in the second quarter, and the score was 20–30 in Australia's favour at half time, and 29–40 {{by the end of the}} third quarter. The Dutch team redoubled their efforts in the final quarter, and won the quarter 20–18, but the Gliders won the game, 49–58.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{part of his}} NBA career, Parker was still {{considered}} an erratic shooter of the ball and during the 2005 off-season, Coach Popovich decided {{to work on this}} aspect of his play. Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three-point shots, and among others, corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position. As a result, by the 2006–07 season, Parker had reduced his three-point shots by 117 while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005, and his accuracy rose by 4% (field goals and three-point shots) {{and he was able to}} connect on 78% of his free throws that season. Parker's field goal percentage is also high for a point guard, and his speed also makes him a <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> player. However, his style of play has had adverse effects on his knees (tendinitis).|$|E
5|$|Barkley was a {{prolific}} scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game {{during the regular}} season for his career and 23.0 points-per-game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> with a powerful dunk. He {{was one of the most}} efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).|$|E
50|$|Praha used {{a series}} of <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> and {{efficient}} three-point shooting to get off to an early 17-10 lead. A layup by Silvia Dominguez made the score 17-12 {{at the end of}} the first quarter.|$|R
50|$|She broke a fast {{by eating}} paprika with roasted fish, and {{was turned into}} a dog by Tonacatecuhtli as {{punishment}} because paprika is a banned food in such <b>fast</b> <b>breaking</b> customs. She also {{takes the form of a}} red serpent.|$|R
50|$|The first {{championship}} {{was held}} in Portugal in June 1994. The host nation had not managed to qualify for any World Championship thus far, and they finished 12th and last after losing all six games, including 21-38 to Romania in the 11th-place play-off. Sweden became the first European champion after defeating Russia by 34-21 in the final, Russia's heaviest loss in their international history. Both teams {{had gone through the}} tournament without loss, but Sweden's <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> became the key in the final; they scored 14 of their 34 goals on <b>fast</b> <b>breaks.</b> Swedish middle back Magnus Andersson was named the event's best player and Russian left back Vasily Kudinov was top scorer with 50 goals.|$|R
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} component of Showtime was the Lakers' <b>fast</b> <b>break.</b> In a typical sequence, rebounders such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kurt Rambis, and A. C. Green would quickly release an outlet pass to Johnson, who would race down the court and distribute the ball to players such as Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy, Byron Scott, and Michael Cooper for a finishing layup or slam dunk. Oftentimes, Johnson would rebound the ball and drive the ball up court himself on a <b>fast</b> <b>break.</b> He would sometimes deliver the ball to teammates with a no-look pass.|$|E
25|$|With {{the game}} tied 61–61 with under five seconds left, West Virginia's Tyrone Sally blocked Nate Funk's three-point attempt and then dunked off the <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> with 2.9 {{seconds to play}} to send the Mountaineers to the second round.|$|E
50|$|It {{was while}} {{playing for the}} Virginia Union University {{basketball}} team, however, that Jackson's leaping ability took off. He averaged over 20 rebounds per game and was known for jumping over the defender's head on <b>fast</b> <b>breaks.</b> He was the CIAA freshman {{of the year in}} 1958.|$|R
50|$|In basketball, <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> {{are often}} the result of good {{defensive}} play such as a steal, obtaining the ball off a block or a missed shot by the opposing team and a rebound, where the defending team takes possession of the ball and the other team has not adjusted.|$|R

25|$|His intense {{work ethic}} and {{athletic}} physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (<b>fast</b> <b>break</b> points). During the 1990 Slam Dunk Contest, Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with dunks and a skillful finger roll that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter, taking about three thousand and making almost one thousand three-pointers in his career.|$|E
25|$|Harden scored all 16 of his {{points in}} the third quarter, when the United States outscored Lithuania 33–14 for a 96–68 victory. After a tight first half, the U.S. started forcing {{turnovers}} to trigger its <b>fast</b> <b>break,</b> opening up the game. Irving scored 18 points and Thompson had 16 off the bench.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} part of the 20th century, under the {{leadership}} of Harry Payne Whitney, polo changed to become a high-speed sport in the United States, differing from the game in England, where it involved short passes to move the ball towards the opposition's goal. Whitney and his teammates used the <b>fast</b> <b>break,</b> sending long passes downfield to riders who had broken away from the pack at a full gallop.|$|E
50|$|Daniels is a {{defensive}} player, who is skilled at both anticipating passes and making steals and possesses {{an ability to}} block shots despite being only 6'7". A solid offensive player, {{he is also a}} great ball handler that can bring the ball up on both <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> and against presses.|$|R
5000|$|McRoberts {{can play}} both power forward and center. His scoring mostly comes off <b>fast</b> <b>breaks,</b> rebounds and hustle plays. He is a screen-setter with a decent jumper, and {{possesses}} excellent passing skills {{for a big}} man. He is considered an average defender. Pau Gasol called McRoberts [...] "scrappy and a hustler".|$|R
25|$|Ronnie O'Sullivan {{compiled}} the <b>fastest</b> maximum <b>break</b> in snooker, {{which took}} 5 minutes and 20 seconds {{recorded in the}} first round of the 1997 World Championship.

25|$|Yunus A. Ma, imam of the Taipei Grand Mosque in September 2008, {{said that}} Ramadan is the {{opportunity}} for Taiwanese Muslims to think over their faith and deeds. The Chinese Muslim Association regularly distributes the schedule for fast, prayer and <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> during the fasting months. During the fasting month in 2016, the Taipei Grand Mosque made a request to employers or companies hiring Muslim workers to be more flexible and easy towards {{them so that they}} will be able to fully observe the fasting.|$|E
25|$|Under coach D'Antoni, the Suns popularized the <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> offense {{known as}} 7 seconds or less (which was later {{published}} in a book written by Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum). Though criticized for a supposed lack of defense, the Suns specialized an efficient offense designed to quickly get off shots that made regrouping on defense difficult for the opposing team. With Steve Nash, Shawn Marion and Amar'e Stoudemire (and {{to a lesser degree}} Joe Johnson and Raja Bell), the Suns were arguably the NBA's most entertaining and exciting team.|$|E
25|$|In Game 6, Pippen {{made the}} {{signature}} play of his career. Midway {{in the third}} quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls <b>fast</b> <b>break,</b> charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several {{feet away from the}} basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93–79.|$|E
50|$|In basketball, run and gun is a fast, {{freewheeling}} {{style of}} play that features {{a high number of}} field goal attempts, resulting in high-scoring games. The offense typically relies on <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> while placing less emphasis on set plays. A run-and-gun team typically allows a large number of points on defense as well.|$|R

50|$|Though his {{offensive}} strategy led to high scores, Moe's Denver teams were never adept at running <b>fast</b> <b>breaks.</b> His teams at times appeared {{to give up}} baskets {{in order to get}} one. He disputed the fact that his teams did not play defense, attributing the high scores to the pace of the game.|$|R
25|$|Alumni and {{associates}} {{of the college}} have {{also contributed to the}} world of athletics, sports management and professional sponsorships. Founding member of the Boston Red Sox, Harry Lord graduated in 1908, and played the very first baseball of the Red Sox two years after his graduation in 1911. In 1927, the college graduated another member of the Red Sox, Charles Small, who pitched for the team for ten years. Frank Keaney graduated in 1911, and is credited as the inventor of baseball's <b>fast</b> <b>break.</b> Overall the college has graduated 11 Olympians, including: Emily Bamford, Hayley Johnson, Justin Freeman, Mike Ferry, Nancy Fiddler, Arnold Adams, Art Sager, Ray Buker, Harlan Holden, and Vaughn Blanchard. Andrew Byrnes, class of 2005, won the Olympic Gold Medal Rowing for the Canadian National Team.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 2014, Paul George, who {{was playing}} in a Team USA {{scrimmage}} {{in preparation for the}} FIBA World Cup, suffered a catastrophic open fracture to his right leg (tibia and fibula) while trying to defend James Harden on a <b>fast</b> <b>break.</b> As he tried to defend Harden from advancing to the rim, George's leg caught on the stanchion of the hoop, and fractured. He was stretchered off of the court. Many described his injury as one of the worst and most graphic injuries they'd seen since the Kevin Ware incident. A day later, George successfully underwent surgery. He was expected to miss the entire 2014–2015 season. On April 5, 2015 Paul George returned from his injury to play in a game against the Miami Heat. George shot 5 of 12 from the field and tallied two steals, two rebounds and two assists in a winning effort. He played 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the National Championship game was tightly fought, with neither team taking a lead larger than five points in the first 19 minutes. In the last minute of the half, North Carolina briefly went up by seven points, and had a chance to go up by nine. However, Villanova's Josh Hart blocked a layup attempt, which led to a Phil Booth jump shot {{at the other end of}} the court, cutting the deficit to 39–34 as the clock expired. At halftime, Joel Berry II of the Tar Heels led all players with 15 points. Despite {{entering}} the game ranked only 294th out of all 351 Division I teams in three-point shooting, North Carolina hit seven of their nine three-point attempt in the first half. However, the Tar Heels hit just 32% of their two-point attempts. Villanova had the edge in points the paint by a 18–12 margin, connecting on 65% on their two-point shots. The Tar Heels led in <b>fast</b> <b>break</b> points by a 10–2 margin and collected five offensive rebounds compared to only one for Villanova. Villanova's Kris Jenkins played just four minutes in the half after getting into early foul trouble.|$|E
50|$|Offensively, he {{can handle}} the ball on <b>fast</b> <b>breaks</b> and deliver passes to his {{teammates}} for scores. He is a capable three-point shooter who provides spacing for the offense by stretching the opposing defense. Green is also adept at scoring around the basket. His outstanding interior defense combined with his offensive repertoire form a unique two-way skill set.|$|R
50|$|Prior the 2006 draft, this 6'4 draft {{volunteered to}} have a workout with the Aces and coach Tim Cone was {{impressed}} with the intensity and work ethic of this former University of Santo Tomas stalwart. During his days with the Growling Tigers, Luanzon had shown abilities to hit the jumpers, defend the wing players and finish the <b>fast</b> <b>breaks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Before the game, Real Madrid {{was heavily}} favored, as they sought a league-record ninth title. Real {{got off to}} a good start, taking an 11-point lead in the first half, behind a 19-2 run.
