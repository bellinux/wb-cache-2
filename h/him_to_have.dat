5|$|Cuthbert died on 26 October 760, and {{was later}} {{considered}} a saint with a feast day of 26 October. He was buried in his church of St. John, {{and was the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury that was not buried in St Augustine's Abbey. His letters to the Anglo-Saxon missionaries on the European continent show <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been highly educated.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of August 3, 1924, Nicol died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 53. His death was treated as suspicious, as a {{post-mortem}} examination found <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> four broken ribs that led to his death. He was interred at the Union Cemetery in Milwaukee.|$|E

5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in the {{refrigerator}} and medicine for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E
5|$|As Madge and {{her family}} turns to {{celebrate}} Christmas, the Doctor attempts to slip away, but Madge catches him, and as she sees the TARDIS realises {{that he is the}} man in the space suit from three years before. She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They invite <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Christmas dinner, as they had always set him a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E

50|$|Anthony James Griffith (born 28 October 1986) is an English-born Montserrat {{international}} footballer {{who plays}} for Northern Premier League Division One North side Colwyn Bay.

5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E

5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on his right knee, and on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> yet another operation on his right knee. After the return of Howard Kendall as manager in November 1990, Whiteside managed to appear in a few reserve team games, but this only delayed the inevitable, and {{he was forced to}} retire from the game at the age of 26 in June 1991. He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{initially}} makes {{light of}} the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. He closes the meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks to meet with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex.|$|E

60|$|Reverence was {{strongly}} implanted in him. His old nurse (still his sister's valued servant) remembers the little {{seven years old}} boy, after saying his own prayers at her knee, standing opposite to his little brother, admonishing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attention with 'Think, Jemmy; think.' In fact, devoutness seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been natural <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> It appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the first strongly traceable feature in <b>him,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gradually subdued his faults one by one.|$|R
5|$|Michael takes relish {{in being}} able to freely {{proclaim}} his relationship with Jan to his bosses, making Jan uncomfortable. She eventually pulls him aside and tries to get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with her in the bathroom. Michael refuses and she becomes angry. As they drive home together, Jan hypothesizes that she only enjoyed being with Michael because their relationship was undisclosed and therefore unethical, and that disclosing it was a mistake. Michael is hurt and upset at this, and Jan takes back her comments to keep him from crying.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and had told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma {{said that he would}} not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested if the Company wished. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{he returns}} to Panyeredan to visit his family with Anwar. While there, Anwar sees some night watchmen quivering in fear near a {{cemetery}}. When told that they had seen a ghost, Anwar enters the cemetery with Hasan to disprove its existence. However, Hasan thinks he sees a ghost and runs away frightened. When ridiculed for this by Anwar, Hasan's faith is broken. This leads <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a large fight with his family about their Islamic faith, which results in Hasan's family disowning him. Upon his return to Bandung, Hasan marries Kartini.|$|E
5000|$|Kalb's {{work has}} {{addressed}} numerous topics including globalization, nationalism, labor history, and class. Although {{a social and}} cultural anthropologist by training, Kalb's scholarship has often utilized historical evidence in addition to or in lieu of fieldwork, leading <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> been described by historian Michael Hanagan as [...] "an anthropologist, equally at home with historical methods and debates".|$|R

5|$|Robert of Melun (c. 1100â€“ 27 February 1167) was an English {{scholastic}} Christian theologian {{who taught}} in France, {{and later became}} Bishop of Hereford in England. He studied under Peter Abelard in Paris before teaching there and at Melun, which gave him his surname. His students included John of Salisbury, Roger of Worcester, William of Tyre, and possibly Thomas Becket. Robert {{was involved in the}} Council of Reims in 1148, which condemned the teachings of Gilbert de la PorrÃ©e. Three of his theological works survive, and show <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been strictly orthodox.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's contemporaries {{believed}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been involved}} {{in some of the}} bloodier events of the war, although later histories have largely exonerated him. Rupert had grown up surrounded by the relatively savage customs of the Thirty Years' War in Europe. Shortly after his arrival in England he caused consternation by following similar practices; one of his early acts was to demand two thousand pounds from the people of Leicester for the King as the price of not sacking Leicester. Although in keeping with European practices, this was not yet considered appropriate behaviour in England and Rupert was reprimanded by the King.|$|E
5|$|Saint-SaÃ«ns's student {{compositions}} {{included a}} symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber {{believed that the}} prize {{should have gone to}} Saint-SaÃ«ns, considering <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more promise than the winner, LÃ©once Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-SaÃ«ns had greater success in a competition organised by the SociÃ©tÃ© Sainte-CÃ©cile, Paris, with his Ode Ã  Sainte-CÃ©cile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).|$|E
