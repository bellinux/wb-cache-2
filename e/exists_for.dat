5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers.

When conducting studies of {{such areas as}} the range of motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.|$|E

5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released.

This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of his reign, Caracalla {{declared}} divine support for Egyptian deity Serapisa god of healing. The Iseum et Serapeum in Alexandria was apparently renovated during Caracalla's co-rule with his father Septimius Severus. The evidence for this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> this {{in the form of}} two papyrii that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200AD. Upon Caracalla's ascension to sole ruler in 212, the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis' image. This was a reflection of the god's central role during Caracalla's reign. After Geta's death, the weapon that had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis into the role of Caracalla's protector from treachery.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E

There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

Tell Brak contracted during the following periods H and J, and became limited to the mound. Evidence <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> an interaction with the Mesopotamian south during period H, represented by the existence of materials similar to the ones produced during the southern Jemdet Nasr period. The city remained a small settlement during the Ninevite 5 period, with a small temple and associated sealing activities.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright.

The right of paternity <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
