40|$|Microorganisms, {{especially}} gram-negative bacteria, {{are considered}} {{to play a role}} in the etiology of certain corneal infiltrative events (CIEs) observed during soft contact lens wear. This study explored the possibility of microbial colonization of soft contact lenses as a risk factor leading to CIEs. In a clinical trial conducted from March 1993 to January 1996, 330 subjects wore disposable soft contact lenses on a 6 -night extended-wear and <b>disposal</b> <b>schedule.</b> During this period, 4, 321 lenses (118 during CIEs; 4, 203 during asymptomatic lens wear) were recovered aseptically and analyzed for microbial colonization. A greater percentage of lenses were free from microbial colonization during asymptomatic wear than during CIEs (42 versus 23 %; P < 0. 0001). The incidence of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungi was greater during CIEs than during asymptomatic lens wear (P < 0. 05). During asymptomatic lens wear, gram-positive bacteria were isolated most frequently and were usually normal external ocular microbiota. Of the gram-positive bacteria, the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was greater during CIE than during asymptomatic wear (7. 6 versus 0. 6 %; P < 0. 0001). While gram-negative bacteria were seen in few cases during asymptomatic wear, their incidence during CIE in comparison to asymptomatic wear was substantial and significant (23. 7 versus 3. 8 %; P < 0. 0001). Also, the level of colonization was high. Of CIEs, events of microbial keratitis, contact lens acute red eye, and asymptomatic infiltrative keratitis were associated with lens colonization with gram-negative bacteria or S. pneumoniae. Colonization of soft contact lenses with pathogenic bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria and S. pneumoniae, appears to be a significant risk factor leading to CIE...|$|E

With a focus on Malawi and other developing world countries, the chapter highlights a variety of issues around accountability and appraisal. The chapter posits that the role of records appraisal cannot be overemphasized given their importance in various socio-cultural endeavours such as being utilized as a basis for providing justice to the victims of Dr Banda’s victims and combating the culture of impunity.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the role of records surveys {{in the management of}} public records in Zimbabwe. The goal was to determine how far records surveys were going in enhancing sound records management practices, thereby improving public service delivery, accountability and good governance. Through interviews, questionnaires and document review it was revealed that records surveys were struggling to attain their intended goal of nurturing sound records management practices in public registries. The lack of ideal mission statements, registry manuals, written disaster management plans, vital records protection programmes, adequate records management training, records retention and <b>disposal</b> <b>schedules,</b> top management support, financial constraints and unclear archival legislation were cited as some of the challenges affecting records and information management surveys from nurturing acceptable records management practices.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of records management in secondary health care delivery system. The {{purpose of the study}} is to appraise the records and archive management in all the recorded information generated in the state hospitals under the secondary health care delivery system, through the process of creation, preparation, disposal distribution, use, storage, retention and disposition of records, determining the validity of documents and its existence in the hospital. A descriptive survey was adopted with simple percentage analysis. 50 respondents were selected from two state hospitals in Osun State Nigeria. 50 copies of questionnaire was administered and 46 copies of questionnaire were returned with a response rate of 92 %. The findings revealed that lack of uniform retention policy, absence of legal authority on disposal records and document, lack of funds to purchase standard filing shelves and cabinets, and lack of attention by the hospital managements was responsible for misfiling, mislaying, overcrowding and reduced storage space in the state hospitals. It was recommended that legal authority should be instituted nationwide to support records retention and <b>disposal</b> <b>schedules</b> and archive documents for effective and efficient record management in secondary health care delivery system in Nigeria. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} 28 double-shell tanks (DSTS) at Hanford {{are currently}} planned to continue operation {{through the year}} 2028 when <b>disposal</b> <b>schedules</b> show removal of waste. This schedule will place the DSTs in a service life window of 4 O to 60 years depending on tank construction date and actual retirement date. This paper examines corrosion- related life-limiting conditions of DSTs and reports the results of remaining useful life models developed for estimating remaining tank life. Three models based on controllable parameters such as temperature, chemistry, and relative humidity are presented for estimates to {{the year in which}} a particular DST may receive a breach in the primary tank due to pitting in the liquid or vapor region. Pitting {{is believed to be the}} life-limiting condition for DSTs,however, the region of the most aggressive pitting (vapor space or liquid) requires further investigation. The results of the models presented suggest none of the existing DSTs should fail by through-wall pitting until well beyond scheduled retrieval in 2028. The estimates of tank breach years (the year in which a tank may be expected to breach the primary tank wall) range from 2056 for pitting corrosion in the liquid region of tank 104 -AW to beyond the next millennium for several tanks in the vapor region...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} that records surveys are a critical function that supports a frame-work for managing public records. The study was motivated by the recognition that the key step in ensuring that records are properly managed on a continuing basis at each stage of the life cycle is to examine all records created and maintained by an office through, among other activities, conducting a records and information management survey. The study employed a quantitative methodology to gather data using self-administered questionnaires completed by registry supervisors working in government ministries, face-to-face interviews held with former and current National Archives of Zimbabwe archivists and records management assistants as well as content anal-ysis of records survey reports. The findings revealed that records surveys are a strong pillar supporting the frame-work for managing public records in Zimbabwe. However, most public registries have not yet realized the benefits of records surveys due to the difficulties that hinder them from implementing the recommendations. The study recommends that key records management activities such as records appraisal, developing a vital records management programme and creating retention and <b>disposal</b> <b>schedules</b> may be effectively managed if the recom-mendations of records surveys are implemented by public registries in Zimbabwe...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{the records}} {{preservation}} status in Zimbabweâ€™s National Museums, this study tries to ascertain the future of museums as information centres. Using the records life cycle principle and the continuum model which state that documents should be properly managed {{from the time they}} are created until their ultimate disposal, this study examined the preservation strategies employed by Zimbabweâ€™s National Museums to ensure their records survive into the future. For the museumâ€™s purpose in life to be justified and meaningful, records that are generated {{as a result of the}} museum's programmes and activities must be regarded as corporate assets, whose preservation should be given due consideration. Using the survey research design, the study employed interviews; questionnaires, observations and the social media to collect data from the informants of the study. An over{{view of the}} significant findings of the study reflects that museum records management issues are not yet an appreciated phenomenon in Zimbabweâ€™s National Museums. That was evidenced by the lack of knowledge and practice on basic records management activities such as the availability of a records management policy, records procedures manual, conducting records surveys, creating retention and <b>disposal</b> <b>schedules.</b> Objects are the raison dâ€™etre of museums and this renders object records as mission critical, to the extent that museums cannot function without them. The study established that museum practitioners in Zimbabweâ€™s National Museums focus absolutely on objects and object related records. The value of records related to other museum functions or those that document wider administrative and business activities is largely overlooked. These records include documentation concerning building maintenance, development, finance, staff, exhibitions and projects. To that effect, museum practitioners are encouraged to consider managing museum records as part of their key duties...|$|R
40|$|Research problem: Despite its {{ubiquitous}} usage, {{there has}} been a lack of research into the New Zealand public sector’s use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT). Email records pose a particular problem, especially when their management is left {{in the hands of the}} end user. This poses a risk where the Public Records Act 2005 (PRA) is concerned. The research within this paper explores the retention and disposal of email records within New Zealand tertiary institutions so that the attitudes of information professionals responsible for the retention of email records are captured, as are the perceived risks of managing such records. Methodology: For the purpose of this study quantitative data was collected to determine the understandings, attitudes, and concerns of information professionals. The unit of analysis was drawn from a population consisting of information professionals within New Zealand tertiary institutions. For the purpose of this research, tertiary institutions that operate as publically funded crown entities were identified. The research was undertaken with a Continuum perspective. Results: Within tertiary institutions, the issues of email management do not appear to lie with the appraisal policies or retention and <b>disposal</b> <b>schedules.</b> Instead the main risks associated with email records stem from the original creator, or end user, being responsible for identifying what emails are records and managing them appropriately. The implementation of electronic document and records management systems (EDRMS) varied between institutions, but majority of the research participants identified them as being of importance to the capture and management of email records. Implications: The findings show that there is a lack of empirical evidence into how the end users within tertiary institutions are treating email records. Further study is needed within tertiary institutions as well as the wider public sector regarding the risks posed by the mismanagement of email records. There is also the need for further research into the implementation of EDRMS, and how EDRMS vendors in New Zealand are meeting legislative requirements...|$|R
40|$|The System Cost Model (SCM) was {{developed}} by Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies in Idaho Falls, Idaho and MK-Environmental Services in San Francisco, California to support the Baseline Environmental Management Report sensitivity analysis for the U.

The model can be used to evaluate total complex costs based on various configuration options or to evaluate site-specific options. The site-specific cost estimates are based on generic assumptions such as waste loads and densities, treatment processing schemes, existing facilities capacities and functions, storage and <b>disposal</b> requirements, <b>schedules,</b> and cost factors. The SCM allows customization of the data for detailed site-specific estimates. There are approximately forty TSD module designs that have been further customized to account for design differences for nonalpha, alpha, remote-handled, and transuranic wastes. The SCM generates cost profiles based on the model default parameters or customized user-defined input and also generates costs for transporting waste from generators to TSD sites...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} four decades {{treatment}} and <b>disposal</b> of <b>scheduled</b> wastes resulting in many environmental problems such as illegal dumping, illegal export and import of wastes. Nevertheless, with new technology development and increasing commitment, many types of scheduled wastes can be recovered or recycled. However, there are three main issues to consider when discussing scheduled waste management hierarchy, which are lack of awareness on the importance of scheduled waste recovery or recycling, regulatory constraints, and lack of knowledge on the state-of-the-art technology for the recovery or recycling processes. The aim and objectives of the study are to produce the recovery or recycling process flow for potential scheduled wastes that can be recovered or recycled, identify the waste acceptance criteria and material balance calculation. The study was conducted through an evaluation and comparison on the recovery or recycling processes done by the related industries in Malaysia and site visit to recycling factory. From the study, it was found out that out of total 77 types of scheduled wastes listed in the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations 2005 First Schedule, there are 41 (53 %) types are being recovered or recycled while the flow of recovery or recycling processes for 16 (21 %) types of scheduled waste has been reviewed. In addition, the waste acceptance criteria have been identified from the minimum level of acceptance prior to recovery or recycling processes. The material balance calculation which indicates the percentage of treated or recovered waste materials, residual sludge material generated and wastewater discharged if the plant is operated at its maximum capacity is also been addressed in order to enable the factory or consultant have the certainty to invest in the required new technology, hence to ensure efficient scheduled wastes recovery activities...|$|R
40|$|Boehmite (e. g., {{aluminum}} oxyhydroxide) {{is a major}} non-radioactive {{component in}} Hanford and Savannah River nuclear tank waste sludge. Boehmite dissolution from sludge using caustic at elevated temperatures is being planned at Hanford to minimize the mass of material disposed of as high-level waste (HLW) during operation of the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP). To more thoroughly understand the chemistry of this dissolution process, we have developed an empirical kinetic model for aluminate production due to boehmite dissolution. Application of this model to Hanford tank wastes would allow predictability and optimization of the caustic leaching of aluminum solids, potentially yielding significant improvements to overall processing time, <b>disposal</b> cost, and <b>schedule.</b> This report presents an empirical kinetic model {{that can be used}} to estimate the aluminate production from the leaching of boehmite in Hanford waste as a function of the following parameters: (1) hydroxide concentration; (2) temperature; (3) specific surface area of boehmite; (4) initial soluble aluminate plus gibbsite present in waste; (5) concentration of boehmite in the waste; and (6) (pre-fit) Arrhenius kinetic parameters. The model was fit to laboratory, non-radioactive (e. g. 'simulant boehmite') leaching results, providing best-fit values of the Arrhenius A-factor, A, and apparent activation energy, E{sub A}, of A = 5. 0 x 10 {sup 12 } hour{sup - 1 } and E{sub A} = 90 kJ/mole. These parameters were then used to predict boehmite leaching behavior observed in previously reported actual waste leaching studies.

S. Environmental Protection Agency`s Health and Environmental Protection Standards for Uranium and Thorium Mill Tailings (40 CFR Part 192; 60 FR 2854). The EPA standards describe specific conditions for which the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) may apply for supplemental standards for contaminated ground water rather than meeting background levels or numerical standards. To achieve compliance with Subpart A of the EPA standards the residual radioactive materials are currently being consolidated on the site by the DOE in a disposal cell, isolating them from direct human or ecological contact and further dispersion into the environment. Completion of the <b>disposal</b> cell is <b>scheduled</b> for early 1995. An environmental assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) were completed in 1987. Concurrence with the UMTRA Surface Project Ambrosia Lake remedial action plan (RAP) was granted by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and state of New Mexico in 1990. The DOE deferred compliance with Subpart B of the EPA standards in the Surface Project RAP. This site observational work plan (SOWP) is the first document to address ground water compliance under Subpart B at the Ambrosia Lake site. The Ambrosia Lake UMTRA Project site is within the Grants Mineral Belt {{and was one of}} numerous uranium mills supplied by many local mines.

The U- 3 ax/bl is a historic disposal unit within the Area 3 Radioactive Waste Management Site located on the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The unit, which was formed by excavating the area between two subsidence craters (U- 3 ax and U- 3 bl), was operationally closed in 1987. The U- 3 ax/bl <b>disposal</b> unit is <b>scheduled</b> for permanent closure under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as a hazardous waste landfill. Existing records indicate that, from July 1968 to December 1987, U- 3 ax/bl received 2. 3 x 10 {sup 5 } cubic meters (8. 12 x 10 {sup 6 } cubic feet) of waste. NTS nuclear device testing generated approximately 95 percent of the total volume disposed of in U- 3 ax/bl, the majority of which came from the Waste Consolidation Project (80 percent of the total volume) (Elletson and Johnejack, 1995). Area 3 is located in Yucca Flat, within the northeast quadrant of the NTS. The Yucca Flat watershed is a structurally closed basin encompassing an area of approximately 780 square kilometers (300 square miles). The structural geomorphology of Yucca Flat is typical of the Basin and Range Physiographic Province. Yucca Flat lies {{in one of the most}} arid regions of the country. Water balance calculations for Area 3 indicate that it is continuously in a state of moisture deficit. The U- 3 ax/bl Disposal Unit will be closed in place by installing a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act equivalent cover. Following cover construction a fence will be installed around the cover to prevent accidental damage to the cover. Post-closure monitoring will consist of site inspections to determine the condition of the engineered cover and cover performance monitoring using Time-Domain Reflectometry arrays to monitor moisture migration in the cover. Any identified maintenance and repair requirements will be remedied within 60 working days of discovery and documented in writing at the time of repair. Results of all inspections/repairs for a given year will be addressed in a single report submitted annually to the NDEP. Soil moisture will be monitored within the cover for a period of at least two years prior to establishing performance criteria for NDEP regulatory purposes...|$|R
