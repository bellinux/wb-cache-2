5|$|A {{number of}} Liliaceae genera are popular {{cultivated}} plants {{in private and}} public spaces.

5|$|In art, mythology, religion, {{literature}} and film, plants play important roles, symbolising themes such as fertility, growth, purity, and rebirth.

5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of <b>Decorative</b> <b>Arts</b> was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E
5|$|Emu leather has a {{distinctive}} patterned surface, {{due to a}} raised area around the feather follicles in the skin; the leather is used in such items as wallets, handbags, shoes and clothes, often {{in combination with other}} leathers. The feathers and eggs are used in <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> and crafts. In particular, emptied emu eggs have been engraved with portraits, similar to cameos, and scenes of Australian native animals.|$|E
60|$|What is the {{difference}} between absolutely <b>decorative</b> <b>art</b> and a painting? <b>Decorative</b> <b>art</b> emphasises its material: imaginative art annihilates it. Tapestry shows its threads as part of its beauty: a picture annihilates its canvas: it shows nothing of it. Porcelain emphasises its glaze: water-colours reject the paper.|$|R

5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman <b>decorative</b> <b>arts,</b> and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the <b>decorative</b> <b>arts,</b> and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> in the Western world in such forms as the Rococo and later the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E

5|$|<b>Decorative</b> <b>arts</b> for luxury {{consumers}} included fine pottery, {{silver and}} bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. The {{manufacture of pottery}} {{in a wide range}} of quality was important to trade and employment, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through her}} {{retirement}} in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co-chair. Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the head of the household science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head of the household arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E

5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of <b>decorative</b> <b>arts.</b> Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin {{a new level of}} artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E

The municipal art gallery, Galerie Robert Heitz, in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions.

5|$|Images of {{the black}} swan played only a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E

5|$|Born in Walthamstow, Essex, to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family, Morris {{came under the}} strong {{influence}} of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university, he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded a <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others: the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Becoming highly fashionable and much in demand, the firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, Morris assumed total control of the company, which was renamed Morris & Co.|$|E
5|$|Known {{for more}} than a century of arts, Meridian {{contains}} many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events. One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.|$|E
5|$|People visiting {{or living}} in Rome or the cities {{throughout}} the Empire {{would have seen}} art {{in a range of}} styles and media on a daily basis. Public or official art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology. At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality. In the private sphere, objects made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees of aesthetic quality and artistic skill. A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and <b>decorative</b> <b>arts</b> at his home—though some efforts strike modern viewers and some ancient connoisseurs as strenuous rather than tasteful. Greek art had a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions and the occasional description in a Greek or Latin literary source.|$|E
