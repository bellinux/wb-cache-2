25|$|At Pancrase 1996 Anniversary Show, {{taking place}} on September 7, Rutten defended his undisputed title against Masakatsu Funaki in what is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest fights in Pancrase history. The Japanese wrestler came near finishing the match earlier with an ankle lock, but Rutten escaped miraculously and proceeded to fend Funaki off for the rest of the bout, utilizing the same stalling strategy he had used against Suzuki. Funaki made a wide usage of the knee-on-stomach and mount position to initiate leglock attacks, but the Dutch countered every time and eventually pushed Masakatsu away, moment in which the Japanese threw an illegal kick to Rutten while he was getting up. In response, the Dutch fighter knocked Funaki down with a palm strike, and then completely broke <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a second palm strike to a supine Masakatsu. The stunned Japanese tried to trade hits with Rutten, only for Bas to capitalize on this with his famed striking game. Rutten knocked him down twice with palms and knees, and he followed landing a lengthy, unanswered string of strikes until a knee to the face finally downed Funaki for the KO victory. In doing so, he became a three-time King of Pancrase.|$|E
500|$|In the fall, Michaels {{joined forces}} with real-life friend Hunter Hearst Helmsley (later known as Triple H), Helmsley's then real life girlfriend Chyna, and Rick Rude to form the stable D-Generation X (DX). Michaels {{continued}} his rivalry with Bret Hart and his reformed Hart Foundation, which was now a pro-Canada stable. Michaels taunted the group and Canada by engaging in acts such as blowing <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> and humping the Canadian Flag. Michaels later claimed the flag desecration was Hart's idea. Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a championship match at Survivor Series in November 1997 against Hart. Michaels {{came out of this}} match, dubbed by fans the [...] "Montreal Screwjob", as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Michaels now held both the WWF World Heavyweight and European championship at the same time. Michaels dropped the European Championship to D-Generation X member Hunter Hearst Hemsley in a farcical match.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Atkinson reprised his {{character}} for a live performance {{as part of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the London Symphony Orchestra in its performance of [...] "Chariots of Fire", conducted by Simon Rattle. For this scene, Bean does not wear his usual brown tweed sports jacket, but the traditional clothing of the musician - white tie and tails. As they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the synthesiser and gets jealous of the more interesting part being played on the grand piano. Still bored, he takes out his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and tries to retrieve his handkerchief from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the synthesizer, until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> his handerchief, he throws it into the grand piano.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday, July 24, 1910, Newport transported in one trip, 500 {{persons to}} the dock at the Newport waterfront. [...] A crowd of 1,500 people {{gathered}} at the dock to greet the new arrivals. [...] A city marshall, M.B. Grant, had to clear {{a path through the}} crowd to allow the disembarking passengers to cross the dock from the steamer to the street. [...] While doing so, Grant encountered Howard Bush, a merchant from Summit, Oregon, and asked Bush to step back. [...] Bush refused, struck Grant a blow on <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> a fist, and knocked Grant to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Cuss is {{a doctor}} living {{in the village of}} Iping. Intrigued by tales of a bandaged {{stranger}} staying at the Coach and Horses Inn, Dr. Cuss goes to see him under the pretence of asking for a donation to the nurse's fund. Cuss is scared away after Griffin pinches <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> an invisible hand. Cuss immediately goes to see the Rev. Bunting, who, not surprisingly, does not believe the doctor's wild story and is quite amused to hear it [...] Later, Cuss and Bunting obtain the Invisible Man's notebooks, but these are subsequently stolen back from them by the invisible Griffin, when he also takes both men's clothes.|$|E
2500|$|First Woman and First man carried [...] {{to their}} hogan, and First Man made a cradle board and tied her in it. [...] "Now {{she will be}} my daughter," [...] he said. [...] First woman took the baby and breathed on her four times. [...] "Now," [...] she said, [...] "she will be my daughter." [...] At {{the end of the}} second day the baby laughed for the first time. The Coyote named [...] arrived and said, [...] "I was told that my {{grandchild}} laughed for the first time." [...] First Woman took charcoal and gave it to the Coyote saying: [...] "This is the only thing that lasts." [...] He painted <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> it and said, [...] "I shall know all things. I shall live long by it." [...] Satisfied with the gift, he departed. Since then persons always receive a gift when a baby laughs for the first time, and the First Laugh Ceremony is performed.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he tapped <b>his</b> {{handsome}} <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> pencil. [...] "They {{have made me}} happy!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The Molson Centre in Montreal {{was sold}} out, {{with more than}} 20,000 fans in attendance. Rumors of Hart's {{imminent}} departure from WWF had leaked and consequently heightened the fan interest in the match. The mixed signals and a war of words between Hart, McMahon, Michaels and WCW further heightened anticipation. Emotions were also running high due to the Hart–Michaels rivalry and the [...] "U.S. vs. Canada" [...] storyline. While both men had been cordial with each other backstage, WWF officials ordered the deployment {{of a large number}} of company agents around the ring as a precaution if Hart decided to attack Michaels or McMahon in reaction to the double-cross. Highly unusual for any wrestling match, the deployment was explained on television as a necessary precaution in wake of the intense animosity between Hart's and Michaels' characters. There was also some legitimate concern that Michaels could be attacked during the planned in-crowd brawl, by fans angered at his actions of demeaning the Canadian flag. Michaels' entrance was greeted by loud booing and upon entering the ring, he proceeded to rub the Canadian flag against his crotch, picked <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>with</b> it and later humped it—Michaels maintains that this flag desecration was actually suggested by Hart as an effective way to draw heat and emotion. The palpable anger of the fans was converted into raucous cheering as Hart entered the ring carrying the Canadian flag and wearing the championship belt. Hart, however, was visibly disturbed when segments of the crowd that were aware of his move to WCW jeered him with chants of [...] "You sold out!" [...] as the match progressed.|$|E
