5|$|After the war, {{development}} continued, {{including the}} growth of Old Town up the hillside (Green Street Farm <b>Estate)</b> <b>and</b> the housing estates of Hampden Park, Willingdon Trees and Langney. During {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, there were controversies over the demolition of Pococks, a 15th-century manor house on what is now the Rodmill Housing <b>Estate,</b> <b>and</b> the granting of planning permission for a 19-storey block at the western end of the seafront. The latter project (South Cliff Tower) was realised in 1965 despite a storm of protest led by the newly formed Eastbourne and District Preservation Committee, which later became Eastbourne Civic Society, and was renamed the Eastbourne Society in 1999. Local conservationists also failed to prevent the construction of the glass-plated TGWU conference and holiday centre, but were successful in purchasing Polegate Windmill, thus saving it from demolition and redevelopment. Most of the expansion took place on the northern and eastern margins of the town, gradually swallowing surrounding villages. However, the richer western part was constrained by the Downs and has remained largely unchanged. In 1981, a large section of the town centre was replaced by the indoor shops of the Arndale Centre.|$|E
