40|$|This {{submission}} {{relates to}} a single issue, but one which may potentially impact upon the survival of an individual financial institution, and importantly {{the stability of the}} financial system; that is, organisational <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>planning.</b> Please find attached, as part of this submission, my paper which puts forward the proposition that disruption to critical business operations of a financial institution from a natural, technical or physical disaster represents a negative externality that may seriously impact the overall stability of the banking system and financial system generally. It is argued that the level of organisational <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> varies significantly between banks and as such is an uncompensated risk within the financial system. This conclusion is drawn from a detailed examination of bank <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> practices conducted in 1994 by the writer. A survey of selected international bank supervisors of their practices for the regulation of organisational <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>planning</b> indicates a divergence of practices. Of note is the regulatory requirement within the United States of America for financial institutions to develop, test and maintain comprehensive <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans.</b> These must be signed-off annually by the board of directors, and are subject to audit by regulatory examiners.

2500|$|Disaster {{recovery}} (DR) {{and business}} continuity {{refers to an}} organization’s ability to recover from a disaster and/or unexpected event and resume operations. Organizations often have a plan in place (usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "Disaster Recovery Plan" [...] or [...] "Business Continuity Plan") that outlines how a recovery will be accomplished. The key to successful disaster recovery is to have a plan (emergency plan, <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plan,</b> continuity plan) well before disaster ever strikes. Often used together, the terms Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery are very different. Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue critical functions and business processes after the occurrence of a disaster, where as Disaster Recovery refers specifically to the Information Technology (IT) and data-centric functions of the business, and is a subset of Business Continuity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> (DRPs) for IT {{systems have}} been {{improving}} over the past decades; some metrics became widely accepted such as recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). However, <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> and solutions vary in their design, sophistication and their required RTO/RTO. Therefore, a need to categorize <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>plans</b> into tiers has become necessary. Fortunately, a number of classifications exist but sometimes they are not fully explained; so, independent researchers may find the classification confusing or inappropriate for {{the current state of}} technology with significant overlap among tiers. Moreover, advances in communication and technology and the introduction of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> as a service (DRaaS) by several cloud service providers (CSPs) has reshaped the area of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> and development of DRPs. Therefore, one can argue that the old classification of 7 -tiers of DRPs is obsolete and a new classification is needed. Here, we try to survey these classifications, understand the common grounds and the differences and try to suggest some improvements to gap them...|$|R
