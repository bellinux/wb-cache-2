40|$|Discussion of {{some results}} {{of the effects of}} ionospheric {{irregularities}} on NASA satellite tracking and data acquisition operations. <b>Ionospheric</b> scintillation <b>fading</b> produced by irregularities has been observed at 136 MHz (vhf), 400 MHz (uhf), 1550 MHz (L-band) and 1700 to 2200 MHz (S-band). Details of these observations are presented. Vhf scintillation effects are evident in both auroral and equatorial regions. Fading effects decrease with increasing radio frequency in the auroral region. The same frequency dependence for fading is not observed in the equatorial region. Although there is a seasonal and diurnal character to scintillation in the equatorial region, <b>fading</b> <b>effects</b> are usually more severe than in the auroral region for a given radio frequency. Space diversity measurements indicate that reasonable solutions for vhf telemetry problems are available for either region. Space diversity should provide a solution for microwave frequencies as well. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>fading</b> amplitude for 1700 MHz is relatively small in the auroral region. In the equatorial region amplitude fading levels for 1550 -MHz signals from ATS- 5 are often much larger than expected. Observations of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP) operating at 2300 MHz observed near the geomagnetic equator show fading peaks in excess of 15 dB...|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} of Internet of Things (IoT) has received extensive attention recently. This paper presents a novel analytical model {{to investigate the}} eavesdropping attacks in Wireless Net of Things (WNoT). Our model considers various channel conditions, including the path loss, the shadow <b>fading</b> <b>effect,</b> and Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>effect.</b> Besides, we also consider the eavesdroppers in WNoT equipped with either omnidirectional antennas or directional antennas. Extensive simulation results show that our model is accurate and effective to model the eavesdropping attacks in WNoT. Besides, our results also indicate that the probability of eavesdropping attacks heavily depends on the shadow <b>fading</b> <b>effect,</b> the path loss <b>effect,</b> Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>effect,</b> and the antenna models. In particular, {{we find that the}} shadow <b>fading</b> <b>effect</b> is beneficial to the eavesdropping attacks while both the path loss <b>effect</b> and Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>effect</b> are detrimental. Besides, using directional antennas at eavesdroppers can also increase the eavesdropping probability. Our results offer some useful implications on designing antieavesdropping schemes in WNoT...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that small-scale <b>fading</b> <b>effects</b> caused by multipath propagation may affect link characteristics and transmission performance in turn; however, as small-scale <b>fading</b> <b>effects</b> describe the {{fluctuations in the}} received signal envelope relative to the local average of the path loss effects, {{in the case of}} week small-scale <b>fading</b> <b>effects,</b> i.e., the average power of the small <b>fading</b> <b>effects,</b> which are commonly modeled as Rayleigh random variables is relatively small, the impacts of small-scale fading on channel characteristics and transmission performance are relatively small compared to pass loss effects, thus can be ignored. In this case, the proposed algorithm in this paper can be applied under acceptable error threshold.|$|R

We use transmission power control to compensate for large-scale fading and exploit receiver antenna (space) diversity to combat small-scale fading. We show that the interferences across the antennas are jointly Gaussian in a large system, and then characterize the signal-to-interference ratio for both independent and correlated (across the antennas) small-scale fading cases. Our results show that when each user's small-scale <b>fading</b> <b>effects</b> are independent across the antennas, {{there is a clear}} separation between the gains of transmission power control and diversity combining, and the two gains are additive (in decibels). When each user's small-scale <b>fading</b> <b>effects</b> are correlated across the antennas, we observe that, in general, the gains of transmission power control and diversity combining are coupled. However, when the noise level diminishes to zero, using maximum ratio combining "decouples" the gains and achieves the same diversity gain as in the independent case. We then characterize the Pareto-optimal (minimum) transmission power allocation for the cases of perfect and noisy knowledge of the desired user's large-scale <b>fading</b> <b>effects.</b> We find that using antenna diversity leads to significant gains for the transmission power...|$|R

While <b>fading</b> <b>effects</b> may result in the variation of change gain, in the case that the variation of the channel gain is relatively slow, we can also assume that at interested transmission time, channel characteristics are static, i.e., the channel gain is a constant, and design the corresponding spectrum handoff and power allocation scheme.|$|R

Statistical distributions of the received signal levels during ionospheric scintillation occurrences are presented which may be of use to communications system engineers with operational requirements in the equatorial regions. The distributions show that during expected periods of scintillation, the L band signal typically falls 1. 1 db below the median for 1. 0 percent of the time, and the VHF signal falls 11. 5 db below the median for 1. 0 percent of the time...|$|R
