5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
500|$|Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept {{two sets}} of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson {{and the other for}} {{miscellaneous}} events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work. Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: [...] "Mr. Thrale told me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and all that they can collect about him is put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, if Mrs. Thrale does not intend to do it herself." [...] After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786). The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.|$|E

2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> I shall never approve them." [...] He would accept the Constitution, [...] "because I expect no better and because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> {{that it is not}} the best".|$|E
2500|$|Roger Scruton stated that: [...] "His major work Being and Time is formidably difficult—unless it is utter nonsense, {{in which}} case it is laughably easy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> how to judge it, and have read no {{commentator}} who even begins {{to make sense of}} it".|$|E
2500|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that global—that a trend of global warming exists. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that {{it is fair to say}} that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change.|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> we {{handled it}} all correctly. [...] The mass {{intrusion}} of pickets into Notts, not just Yorkshiremen; I accept {{some responsibility for}} that, and so will the left have to. [...] I think if as an executive we had approached Notts without pickets, {{it might have been}} different. [...] Because I reject, I have made this clear since the strike, that 25 or 30,000 Notts miners, their wives and families and communities are scabs and blacklegs. [...] I refuse to accept this. [...] We did alienate them during the strike.|$|E
2500|$|Abdul Jalil Khalil, an Al Wefaq National Islamic Society {{member of}} parliament, {{described}} the 17 February pre-dawn police {{raid on the}} Pearl Roundabout encampment as [...] "real terrorism", stating that [...] "whoever took the decision to attack the protest was aiming to kill." [...] Its MP Jassim Hussein said that [...] "I don't think the regime is willing to meet most of our demands. But even if it does, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> it {{will be enough to}} get the youth off the street. It is personal now." [...] Following demands from young protesters {{for the end of the}} ruling regime and in protest against the deaths during demonstrations, all eighteen party MPs submitted their official resignations from parliament.|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's [...] "heroism" [...] of saving Iris, and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which {{is the goal of}} so many of Scorsese's characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sacks left Britain {{and flew}} to Montreal, Canada on 9 July 1960, his 27th birthday. He visited the Montreal Neurological Institute and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), {{telling them that}} he wanted to be a pilot. After some {{interviews}} and checking his background, they told him he would be best in medical research. Dr. Taylor, the head medical officer, told him, [...] "You are clearly talented and we would love to have you, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> about your motives for joining." [...] He was told to travel for a few months and reconsider. He used the next three months to travel across Canada and deep into the Canadian Rockies, which he described in his personal journal, later published as Canada: Pause, 1960.|$|E
2500|$|... "ven if {{the policy}} and {{rationale}} were clear and unambiguous, there is a deeper problem with motions of this sort that prevents them from attracting a broad base of support: they rely on the false (or limited) analogy implied by the word 'apartheid'. This {{is not to say}} that there are no points of comparison, for there are – just as there are in a host of other countries where minority ethnic and national groups are oppressed. Nor is it even to say that the suffering experienced by Palestinians is less than that endured by 'non-whites' in South Africa: it may or may not be (although <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> how to do the sums). But as I have argued elsewhere: 'The validity of the analogy does not depend on a catalogue of atrocities, however appalling.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{they set}} a wedding date, Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), {{who was married}} to Daniel's {{grandmother}} Madge (Anne Charleston), returned to Erinsborough for the ceremony. He gave Daniel some advice about marriage, telling him to have [...] "realistic expectations." [...] Phillipps thought that Daniel and Amber were rushing into marriage, but explained that the producers wanted the wedding to air {{as part of the}} show's 30th anniversary in March 2015. He thought they should have waited another year. Phillipps also admitted that he did not think Amber and Daniel were well suited, saying [...] "they are very easygoing people and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if that creates the best sparks." [...] On the day of his wedding, Daniel decided to be [...] "a hopeless romantic" [...] and try to get Amber an antique ring from a well that belonged to his ancestor. Phillipps explained that Amber had been obsessing about the love story connected to the ring and Daniel wanted to give it to her on their wedding day. Daniel and Imogen climbed into the well, but the ladder gave way, trapping them down there and forcing Daniel to miss his wedding. While Daniel worried about Amber, she assumed that he had run off with Imogen. After a few days, Josh worked out where Daniel and Imogen were, and they were rescued, leading to a reconciliation between Daniel and Amber.|$|E

2500|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, {{challenged}} the film's high praise by saying [...] "there {{should be no}} need to pretend There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece just because Anderson sincerely {{tried to make it}} one." [...] Some critics were positive toward the work but less laudatory, often criticizing its ending. Roger Ebert assigned the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, [...] "There Will Be Blood is the kind of film that is easily called great. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by No Country for Old Men, and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But There Will Be Blood is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp." [...] Carla Meyer of the Sacramento Bee, who gave the film the same star rating as Ebert, opined that the final confrontation between Daniel and Eli marked when the work [...] "stops being a masterpiece and becomes a really good movie. What was grand becomes petty, then overwrought." [...] In 2014, Peter Walker of The Guardian likewise argued that the scene [...] "might not be the very worst scene in the history of recent Oscar-garlanded cinema [...] but it’s perhaps the one most inflated with its own delusional self-importance." ...|$|E
