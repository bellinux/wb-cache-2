In these experiments, carried out on the OMEGA laser, absolute spectral measurements of dd protons and tt neutrons were obtained. From these measurements, it was concluded that the dd yield is anomalously low and the tt yield is anomalously high relative to the dt yield, an observation that we conjecture to be caused by a stratification of the fuel in the <b>implosion</b> core.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{multicast}} protocol that guarantees reliable message delivery in an efficient manner. In the proposed protocol, the channel <b>implosion</b> <b>effect</b> is diminished by transmitting ACK packet alternately at the receiver nodes, {{and the channel}} utilization is increased using multiple selective retransmission request scheme. In addition, we minimized the replicated retransmissions by maintaining timestamps for the retransmitted packets. Especially, the number of control messages is reduced by electing one responding node among the receivers by only looking at the message sequence number. The proposed protocol {{can be applied to}} the multicasting service over any broadcast medium. This paper investigates the performance of the proposed protocol by evaluating delay and number of control messages in the satellite communication medium.

40|$|The low-mode shell {{asymmetry}} and high-mode {{hot spot}} mixing {{appear to be}} the main reasons for the performance degradation of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) <b>implosion</b> experiments. The <b>effects</b> of the mode coupling between low-mode P 2 radiation flux asymmetry and intermediate-mode L =  24 capsule roughness on the implosion performance of ignition capsule are investigated by two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations. It is shown that the amplitudes of new modes generated by the mode coupling are in good agreement with the second-order mode coupling equation during the acceleration phase. The later flow field not only shows large areal density P 2 asymmetry in the main fuel, but also generates large-amplitude spikes and bubbles. In the deceleration phase, the increasing mode coupling generates more new modes, and the perturbation spectrum on the hot spot boundary is mainly from the strong mode interactions rather than the initial perturbation conditions. The combination of the low-mode and high-mode perturbations breaks up the capsule shell, resulting in a significant reduction of the hot spot temperature and implosion performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure-driven}} inertial {{collapse of}} a cylindrical void in an inviscid liquid is an integrable, Hamiltonian system that forms a finite-time singularity as the radius of the void collapses to zero. Here it is shown that when the natural cylindrical symmetry of the void is perturbed azimuthally, the perturbation modes neither grow nor decay, but instead cause constant amplitude vibrations about the leading-order symmetric collapse. Though the amplitudes are frozen in time, they grow relative to the mean radius which is collapsing to zero, eventually overtaking the leading-order symmetric implosion. Including weak viscous dissipation destroys the integrability of the underlying symmetric <b>implosion,</b> and the <b>effect</b> on the stability spectrum is that short-wavelength disturbances are now erased as the implosion proceeds. Introducing a weak rotational flow component to the symmetric implosion dynamics causes the vibrating shapes to spin as the mean radius collapses. The above theoretical scenario is compared to a closely related experimental realization of void implosion: the disconnection of an air bubble from an underwater nozzle. There, the thin neck connecting the bubble to the nozzle implodes primarily radially inward and disconnects. Recent experiments were able to induce vibrations of the neck shape by releasing the bubble from a slot-shaped nozzle. The frequency and amplitude of the observed vibrations {{are consistent with the}} theoretical prediction once surface tension effects are taken into account. Comment: Ph.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} methods against drug-resistant bacteria can be surface-modified materials with biocidal nanoparticles. Ultrasonic technologies have been confirmed as an effective method of coating various materials with antibacterial and fungicidal substances [25 – 28]. Many researchers classify the ultrasound method as a “green technology” [29, 30]. The method is based on the use of cavitation phenomena, which is the formation, growth, and collapse of cavitation bubbles in the liquid medium [31, 32]. Imploding bubbles generate immense amounts of energy in microregions up to 5000  K and pressure up to 2000  atm within {{a short period of time}} [33, 34]. Consequently, shock waves and so-called microjets directed toward the solid surface are generated [35]. Located in a liquid medium, NPs are driven up by the <b>implosion</b> <b>effect</b> and jet streams at high speed (>[*] 100  m/s) on the solid surface and form a layer [36]. Acoustic cavitation can also lead to change in the physical properties of sonicated objects, e.g., resizing of GO flakes [37, 38].|$|E

40|$|The {{shock wave}} is {{deformed}} and the vortex is elongated simultaneously during the shock-vortex interaction. More precisely, the shock wave is deformed to a S-shape, {{consisting of a}} leading shock and a lagging shock by which the corresponding local vortex flows are accelerated and decelerated, respectively: the vortex flow swept by the leading shock is locally expanded and the one behind the lagging shock is locally compressed. As the leading shock escapes the vortex {{in the order of}} microseconds, the expanded flow region is quickly changed to a compression region due to the <b>implosion</b> <b>effect.</b> An induced shock is developed here and propagated against the vortex flow. This happens for a strong vortex because the tangential flow velocity of the vortex core is high enough to make the induced-shock wave speed supersonic relative to the vortex flow. For a weak shock, the vortex is basically subsonic and the induced shock wave is absent. For a vortex of intermediate strength, an induced shock wave is developed in the supersonic region but dissipated prematurely in the subsonic region. We have expounded these three shock-vortex interaction patterns that depend on the vortex flow regime using a third-order ENO method and numerical shadowgraphs...|$|E
