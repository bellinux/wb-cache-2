5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating <b>from</b> <b>between</b> 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating <b>from</b> <b>between</b> 50,000 and 45,000BC, recovered from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been recovered from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was recovered dating <b>from</b> <b>between</b> 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been recovered from Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated <b>from</b> <b>between</b> the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated <b>from</b> <b>between</b> the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E

5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness <b>from</b> <b>between</b> six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|Having Fun with Elvis on Stage is a 1974 {{spoken word}} concert album by American singer and {{musician}} Elvis Presley.

5|$|In 2000, the Temple had {{thirteen}} pylons, {{which were}} {{operating in the}} United States, Australia, Germany, and across Sweden and Finland. The extent of the Temple's membership has not been publicly revealed by the group, however in 2005 Petersen noted that academic estimates for the Temple's membership varied <b>from</b> <b>between</b> 300 and 500, and Granholm suggested that in 2007 the Temple contained circa 200 members. The Temple's members come {{from a variety of}} racial backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|In the 5thcentury, Saxon {{settlers}} {{named the}} area Crow's Leah—meaning a crow-infested clearing, or Crow's Wood. This name evolved over time, {{and the present}} spelling appeared by the early 14thcentury. By this time, nearby settlements were more established: the Saxon church at Worth, for example, dates <b>from</b> <b>between</b> 950 and 1050AD.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{professional}} obligations {{after the}} birth of his first son in 1987 coincided with a reduction in his literary output. During the 1990s he instead focused his attention on his novel Feuers Geraun. Two early versions of this novel's chapters were published by the Upper Austrian magazine die Rampe in 1994 (Der Schreiber von Aram) and 1997 (Das Gesetz). These chapters deal with Jewish and biblical traditions. The publishing list on Ebner's website lists only six publications in anthologies by 2004, but seventeen are listed <b>from</b> <b>between</b> 2005 and 2008.|$|E

5|$|On October 13, 2006, {{two days}} after the crash, the FAA banned all fixed-winged {{aircraft}} from the East River corridor unless in contact with local air traffic control. The new rule, which took effect immediately, required all small aircraft (with the exception of helicopters and certain seaplanes) to seek the approval of and stay in contact with air traffic control while in the corridor. The FAA cited safety concerns, especially unpredictable winds <b>from</b> <b>between</b> buildings, as the reason for the change.|$|E

All the major styles of English medieval architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular, are represented in the present building.|$|E
