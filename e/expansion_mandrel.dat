The outer portion of each coupling is slipped over the outer jacket and an inner ring is inserted into the rubber liner. A tool called an <b>expansion</b> <b>mandrel</b> is placed inside the hose and expands the ring. This squeezes the jackets and liner between the ring and serrations on the outer portion of the coupling to form a seal {{all the way around the}} hose.|$|E

To permit the mounting of sealing rings on the workpiece, an <b>expansion</b> <b>mandrel</b> is provided to expand the sealing ring. The <b>expansion</b> <b>mandrel</b> is retained by at least two brackets which are split {{in the direction of the}} mandrel longitudinal axis.

40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} a slender well concept for exploration drilling with 15000 psi pressure rating based on enabling technologies. The main findings relates {{to the use of}} expandable liner hangers to reduce the required radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. Finite element analysis of the liner hanger expansion is performed in Ansys Workbench, a platform for advanced engineering simulations. The background for the thesis relates to the high cost of constructing offshore wells. There is a potential for considerable cost reduction by starting the well with a substantially smaller diameter, without compromising the final pipe size across the zone of interest. The topic builds on ongoing research in SBBU – Centre for drilling and wells for improved recovery, a joint project between NTNU, Sintef, University in Stavanger and IRIS. The slender well concept renders the possibility to use modified 3 rd or 4 th generation semi-submersible rigs. These rigs have significantly lower day-rates compared to new 5 th and 6 th generation rigs. Cost reduction is also expected with respect to consumption of steel for casing, drilling fluids and cement. Additional savings in steel is obtained by basing the casing program mainly on liners. The expandable liner hanger of choice is based on the XPak liner hanger developed by TIW. Finite element analysis indicated that a pressure rating of 15000 psi is feasible with the proposed liner hanger system. To avoid reduction in burst and collapse rating, the <b>expansion</b> <b>mandrel</b> is retained in the liner hanger after expansion. The mandrel is designed such that it creates an internal flush design with the liner string. It is recommended to use metal-to-metal sealing to avoid communication around the liner top. The slender well is constructed with limited radial clearance between consecutive casing sections. The problem of high surge pressures during running in hole is overcome by introducing a surge protection system with an artificial inner annulus to displace drilling fluids. The concept of pre-installing a liner string in the surface casing is introduced to render the possibility of an additional casing section and reduction in riser ID. The concept is untested and further evaluation is recommended. For further work on the topic proper field testing is recommended to validate the reliability of the concept. An assessment of slender well production drilling is also recommended to fully exploit the potential in slender well design. More detailed analysis and testing is necessary to qualify the expandable liner hanger for 15000 psi. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} semi-empirical relations for the maximum stress concentration factor (SCF) around circular holes embedded in aluminum tubes under various <b>expansion</b> ratios and <b>mandrel</b> angles. Finite element models were developed to study the expansion of a typical aluminum tube with embedded holes of various sizes. An elastic perfectly-plastic material behaviour was {{used to describe the}} structural response of the tubes under expansion. Various hole-diameter-to-tubewall- thickness ratios, tube <b>expansion</b> ratios, and <b>mandrel</b> angles were considered to determine the stress state around the hole at zero and 90 degree locations from which the maximum SCF was determined. Semi-empirical relations for the maximum SCF using the Lagrange interpolation formulation were developed. The developed relations were found to predict the SCFs accurately...|$|R
40|$|Within Radial Axial Ring Rolling process, a new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed {{in order to minimize}} the amount of required FE simulations to reach the final set of optimal parameters for the set-up of the process. Through a kinematic approach, a mathematic model {{has been developed}} with the aim of predicting the evolution of ring expansion. Based on volume constancy principle, Keeton’s correlation and assuming an initial value for the inner diameter of the blank, which minimizes the scrapped material, the proposed algorithm allows also to determinate blank initial geometry. Optimal ranges for mandrel and axial rolls motion laws are calculated for both speeds in order to reach the final desired geometry of the ring, respecting the conditions that ensure process stability and ring uniform <b>expansion.</b> Moreover, <b>mandrel</b> feeding speed is assumed to be linear and upper axial roll feeding speed is accordingly derived through Keeton’s correlation which ensures process stability. Ring geometry is estimated for each ring portion (slice) and not in terms of average value for the considered round. The mathematical model has been tested through FE simulations applied to three different ring shapes resulting in a reasonable error (< 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of coldworking to evaluate the extent and movement of elasto-plastic front, considering both elastic strains and strain hardening effects, is developed. The elasto-plastic solution for a plate specimen with a hole subjected to internal pressure is developed using modified Nadai's auxiliary variable and von Mises yield criterion. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of specimen width on pressure requirement for a given extent of elasto-plastic boundary. It is observed that for a specified elasto-plastic boundary the displacement {{at the edge of}} the hole varies linearly with the pressure. It is also observed that with increase in strain hardening, the pressure required is higher and the corresponding displacement {{at the edge of the}} hole is smaller in magnitude. Residual stresses decrease with increase in strain hardening. The method evolved here correlates the necessary pressure with the radial <b>expansion</b> using a <b>mandrel</b> to achieve the same amount of coldworking...|$|R
40|$|At present, one of {{the highly}} demanded types of metal {{products}} is steel pipes for constructional purposes. The most important characteristics are their dimensional accuracy and surface finish, high level of mechanical properties and operating characteristics. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the precision of the internal channel of pipes, because this parameter determines the reliability and cost-effectiveness of their use. One of the most effective ways to increase the precision of the internal channel is pipe <b>expansion</b> by a <b>mandrel.</b> To investigate the accuracy of pipes a program of finite element simulation should be used. This has allowed us to investigate the extrafocal expansion at the inlet and outlet of the deformation zone, the inhomogeneity of deformation and the increasing pipe accuracy. The evaluation of these characteristics is an important factor for developing optimal conditions of deformation and tool design high-precision pipes in order to produce in terms of their inner diameter...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. A typical Joule-Thomson (J-T) {{refrigerator}} {{consists of}} a recuperative heat exchanger, a gas <b>expansion</b> nozzle, a <b>mandrel,</b> and a compressed gas storage bottle. The thermodynamic performance of a J-T refrigerator depends highly on the hydraulic and heat transfer characteristics of the recuperative heat exchanger. The typical recuperative heat exchanger of a J-T refrigerator has a double helical tube and fin configuration, but other heat exchanger configurations may be used, including the two-flow type helical tube and fins configuration, the twostage heat exchanger configuration, a double helically wound tube circuit arranged in a spiral channel, etc. In this study, the performance of J-T refrigerators with single and two-flow type recuperative heat exchangers was investigated. The effectiveness-NTU approach was adopted to predict the thermodynamic behaviors of the heat exchangers for the J-T refrigerators. The results show {{the effect of the}} operating conditions on the performance of the heat exchanger and refrigerator for three types of heat exchangers. The influences of mass flow rate and supply pressure on the effectiveness of the heat exchanger and the refrigeration power are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{expansion}} of submerged tubes {{is accomplished by}} propelling a mandrel through it using differential pressure. This process deforms the tube beyond its elastic limit. Toward {{the end of the}} <b>expansion</b> process, the <b>mandrel</b> pops out of the tube resulting in displacement, stress, and pressure waves propagating through the system. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the dynamics of the tube-fluid system due to the pop-out phenomenon. The model takes into consideration the coupling effect between fluids and the structure, as well as the inherent system damping of its response. An analytical solution describing the wave propagation in the tube-fluid system was obtained. The model identified the potential failure locations and showed that the inherent system damping reduced the chances of failure but could not eliminate it completely. In addition, it showed that the coupling effect was more prominent in the tube as compared to the outer and inner fluids. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the geometrical and material properties on the response. The sensitivity analysis showed that the coupling effect vanished with the increase in tube stiffness and reached an asymptotic value with an increase in formation stiffness...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} approach to increasing fatigue resistance of many assemblies involves {{the creation of}} regions of compressive residual stress. For example, riveting holes used in modern passenger aircraft are currently subjected to cold <b>expansion</b> using split <b>mandrel</b> tools. The method is relatively expensive and not entirely problem-free. In the present study we consider a method of creating residual stresses around drilled holes referred to as 'dimpling', that itself is a variation of a novel technique known as the StressWave™ process. An experimental procedure is described {{for the creation of}} localised regions of significant plastic deformation and residual stress by 'dimpling', allowing the production of cold-worked and residually-stressed specimens. The overall aims of this study were to determine thickness-average residual stesses by two different techniques, namely, one destructive technique (Sachs boring) and one non-destructive (high energy X-ray diffraction); and to compare the results. In Sachs boring experiments the variation of strain gauge readings with increasing diameter of the central hole was recorded. A classical elastic-ideally plastic axisymmetric model for plane stress conditions was used in the analysis. Energy dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments were performed for non-destructive assessment of residual elastic strains. The two different stress evaluation techniques used in this project led to consistent results. Good correlation was found between the stresses obtained from X-ray diffraction results and those deduced from Sachs boring experiments.
