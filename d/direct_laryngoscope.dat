50|$|The {{conventional}} <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> uses a line {{of sight}} provided by a rigid viewing instrument with a light on the blade or intra-oral portion which requires a direct view of the target larynx; this view is clearly seen in 80-90% of attempts. The frequent failure of direct laryngoscopy to provide an adequate view for tracheal intubation {{led to the development}} of alternative devices such as the lighted stylet, and a number of indirect fiberoptic viewing laryngoscopes, such as the fiberscope, Bullard scope, Upsher scope, and the WuScope. Though these devices can be effective alternatives to direct laryngoscopy, they each have certain limitations, and none of them is effective under all circumstances. One important limitation commonly associated with these devices is fogging of the lens. In an attempt to address some of these limitations, Dr. Jon Berall, a New York City internist and emergency medicine physician, designed the camera screen straight video laryngoscope in 1998. The first true video laryngoscope Glidescope was produced in 1999 and a production version with 60 degree angle, an onboard heater, and a custom screen was first sold in dec 2000. The true video laryngoscope has a camera on the blade with no intervening fiberoptic components. The concept is important because it is simpler to produce and handle the resultant images from CMOS cameras. The integrated camera leads to a series of low cost variants that are not possible with the hybrid Fiberoptic units.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundVideo {{laryngoscope}} {{has recently}} been introduced as an alternative for performing intubation; however, its validity in emergency settings has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess its value compared with <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> in emergency settings. PurposeWe conducted a meta-analysis to assess its value compared with <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> in emergency settings. MethodsPubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies published through April 2011. Trials that reported data comparing video laryngoscope versus direct laryngoscope-assisted intubation {{in the emergency room}} or prehospital locations were included. ResultsFour trials reporting a total of 1305 participants were identified. During intubation, video laryngoscope failed to produce high rates of successful intubation (success rate: 0. 70; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 49 – 1. 01). Time to intubation was not different when using either video laryngoscope or <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> (standardized mean difference: 0. 19; 95 % CI: - 0. 20 — 0. 58). Furthermore, video laryngoscope seems to achieve a similar glottic view as <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> (ratio of better glottic view: 0. 96; 95 % CI: 0. 63 – 1. 46).

40|$|Purpose. Emergency {{physicians}} {{are at risk}} for infection during invasive procedures, and the respirators can reduce this risk. This study aimed to determine whether endotracheal intubation using <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscopes</b> affected protection performances of respirators. Methods. A randomized crossover study of 24 emergency physicians was performed. We performed quantitative fit tests using respirators (cup type, fold type without a valve, and fold type with a valve) before and during intubation. The primary outcome was respirators’ fit factors (FF), and secondary outcomes were acceptable protection (percentage of scores above 100 [*]FF [FF%]). Results. 24 pieces of data were analyzed. Compared to fold-type respirator without a valve, FF and FF% values were lower when participants wore a cup-type respirator (200 [*]FF [200 - 200] versus 200 [*]FF [102. 75 – 200], 100 % [78. 61 – 100] versus 74. 16 % [36. 1 – 98. 9]; all P< 0. 05) or fold-type respirator with a valve (200 [*]FF [200 - 200] versus 142. 5 [*]FF [63. 50 – 200], 100 % [76. 10 – 100] versus 62. 50 % [8. 13 – 100]; all P< 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} intubation time and success rate according to respirator types. Conclusions. Motion during endotracheal intubation using <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscopes</b> influenced the protective performance of some respirators.

40|$|There {{are a few}} {{reports about}} {{bradycardia}} or asystole caused by direct laryngoscopy. However, we encountered severe bradycardia in response to suspension laryngoscopy for laryngeal polypectomy after safely completing tracheal intubation using a <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> with a curved blade. The tip of the curved blade of the <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> is positioned at the vallecula (between {{the base of the}} tongue and the pharyngeal surface of the epiglottis) during tracheal intubation, while the blade tip of the suspension laryngoscope lifts the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis or supraglottic area during surgery. Therefore, suspension laryngoscopy can be said more vagotonic than curved-blade direct laryngoscopy. Because of the possibility of bradycardia induced by suspension laryngoscopy, clinicians must be careful about severe bradycardia even after safely completing intubation using direct laryngoscopy.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} video-guided laryngoscopy for nasogastric tube placement. Methods: This was an observational comparative study {{performed in a}} hospital. The participants included volunteers from the medical staff (physicians and nurses) experienced with nasogastric intubation, and non-medical staff (medical students, pharmacists and emergent medical technicians) with knowledge of nasogastric intubation but lacking procedural experience. Medical and non-medical hospital staff performed manual, laryngoscope-assisted and video-guided laryngoscope nasogastric intubation both in the presence {{and in the absence}} of an endotracheal tube, using a manikin. Nasogastric intubation times were compared between groups and methods. Results: Using the video-guided laryngoscope resulted in a significantly shorter intubation time compared to the other 2 methods, both with and without an endotracheal tube, for the medical and non-medical staff alike (all p <  0. 05). For the medical staff, mean nasogastric intubation time was significantly shorter using video-guided laryngoscope without endotracheal intubation, <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> with endotracheal intubation and video-guided laryngoscope with endotracheal intubation compared to manual intubation without endotracheal intubation (0. 49, 0. 63 and 0. 72 vs. 5. 63, respectively, p ≤  0. 008).

40|$|Surgeons may {{occasionally}} encounter {{difficulty in}} visualizing the whole larynx with a <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> In such cases, rigid endoscopic laryngosurgery using a <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> is an optimal solution. Multidirectional {{examination of the}} larynx using rigid endoscopes during direct laryngoscopy, leads to better control {{and management of the}} ventricle, inferior surface of the vocal fold and subglottis, and the anterior commissure. Currently, 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 70 degrees and 120 degrees angled rigid telescopes are used worldwide. Our experience in telescopic endolaryngeal surgery provided us the opportunity to work with AESOP 3000 (automated endoscope system for optimal positioning), coupling a robotic arm to a rigid endolaryngeal telescope. The use of this device allows the surgeon to control the field of view and operate with both hands. A total of 20 patients presenting a laryngeal lesion were randomly selected and included in this study undergoing a robot-assisted procedure. Three of 20 patients presented a difficult laryngeal exposure with direct laryngoscopy due to a rigid, short neck (1 male, 1 female) and prominent teeth (1 male). We used Karl Storz Hopkins II long rigid endoscopes having 0 degrees, 30 degrees and 70 degrees direction of view, a Storz Xenon 300 cold light, a Storz Tricam SL camera, the Kleinsasser <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> The instruments we used are all commercially available for microlaryngeal surgery and included upward curved instruments in case of difficult laryngeal exposure.

40|$|Background and Aims: C-MAC ® video {{laryngoscope}} (VL) with Macintosh blade {{has been}} found to improve Cormack-Lehane (C-L) laryngoscopic view as well as intubating conditions for orotracheal intubation. However, studies done on the performance of C-MAC ® VL for nasotracheal intubation (NTI) are very few in number. Hence, we compared laryngoscopy and intubating conditions between Macintosh <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> and C-MAC ® VL for NTI. Methods: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I, II patients, aged 8 - 18 years, posted for tonsillectomy surgeries under general anaesthesia with NTI were randomised, into two groups. Patients in group 1 were intubated using Macintosh <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope</b> and group 2 with C-MAC ® VL. C-L grading, time required for intubation, need for additional manoeuvres and haemodynamic changes during and after intubation were compared between the groups. Results: C-L grade 1 views were obtained in 26 and 29 patients in group 1 and group 2, respectively (86. 7 % vs. 96. 7 %). Remaining patients were having C-L grade 2 (13. 3 % vs. 3. 3 %). Duration of intubation was less than a minute in group 2 (93. 3 %). Need for additional manoeuvres (M 1 -M 5) were more in group 1 (97 % vs. 77 %). M 1 (external manipulation) was needed more in group 2 compared to group 1 (53. 3 % vs. 30 %). Magill′s forceps alone (M 4) and M 4 with additional external manipulation (M 5) were needed more in group 1 compared to group 2 (60 % vs. 16 %). Conclusion: The overall performance of C-MAC ® VL was better when compared to conventional direct Macintosh laryngoscope during NTI in terms of glottis visualisation, intubation time and need for additional manoeuvres...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background and objective: This was a prospective, {{randomized}} {{clinical study}} {{to compare the}} success rate of nasogastric tube insertion by using GlideScopeTM visualization versus <b>direct</b> MacIntosh <b>laryngoscope</b> assistance in anesthetized and intubated patients. Methods: Ninety-six ASA I or II patients, aged 18 - 70 years were recruited and randomized into two groups using either technique. The time taken from insertion of the nasogastric tube from the nostril until the calculated length of tube had been inserted was recorded. The success rate of nasogastric tube insertion was evaluated in terms of successful insertion in the first attempt. Complications associated with the insertion techniques were recorded. Results: The results showed success rates of 74. 5 % in the GlideScopeTM Group as compared to 58. 3 % in the MacIntosh Group (p = 0. 10). For the failed attempts, the nasogastric tube was successfully inserted in all cases using rescue techniques. The duration taken in the first attempt for both techniques was not statistically significant; Group A was 17. 2 ± 9. 3 s as compared to Group B, {{with a duration of}} 18. 9 ± 13. 0 s (p = 0. 57). A total of 33 patients developed complications during insertion of the nasogastric tube, 39. 4 % in Group A and 60. 6 % in Group B (p = 0. 15). The most common complications, which occurred, were coiling, followed by bleeding and kinking. Conclusion: This study showed that using the GlideScopeTM to facilitate nasogastric tube insertion was comparable {{to the use of the}} MacIntosh laryngoscope in terms of successful rate of insertion and complications...|$|R

ObjectivesThis article presents {{the case of}} a difficult airway patient that went into shock because of atonic bleeding after vaginal delivery for stillbirth. Case reportA 32 -yr-old woman with atonic bleeding after vaginal delivery for stillbirth was transferred to our hospital. She manifested shock, and her respiratory condition was progressively deteriorating. Airway obstruction caused by neck swelling and pharyngolaryngeal edema was apparent. We tried tracheal intubation using <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>laryngoscopes.</b> However, it turned out that insertion of the laryngoscopic devices to the oral cavity was impossible. After several attempts using the Trachlight™, successful intubation was finally made. After hysterectomy, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated for five days. At discharge from the ICU, her Mallampati score was I-II. Her body weight decreased 60 kg to 51 kg during ICU stay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Direct {{laryngoscopy}} is {{the method}} currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, {{with the potential}} to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta-analysis to compare direct versus indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www. clinicaltrials. gov and www. controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscopes.</b> DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta-analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5. 49 seconds, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 37 to 9. 60; I(2) = 90 %; very low-quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 1. 02; I(2) = 67 %; low-quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4. 93, 95 % CI 1. 33 to 18. 31; I(2) = 0 %; low-quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low-quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low-quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0. 007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0. 001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low-quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 21; I(2) = 59 %). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low-quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To compare intubating {{laryngeal}} mask airway (ILMA) with direct laryngoscopy {{in patients with}} cervical spine injury. Patients and Methods:: Prospective, hospital based study conducted during March 2004 to May 2005, in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tabriz Medical Science University, Iran. We compared the excursion of the upper cervical spine during tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy with awake intubation via Laryngeal mask airway in 40 patients. Results: Intubating {{laryngeal mask}} caused less extension (at C 2 - 3 and C 1 - 2) than intubation by <b>direct</b> <b>laryngoscope.</b> Patients, who were locally anesthetized and sedated tolerate intubation well. However laryngoscopy is still the fastest method to secure an airway.

40|$|No {{aspect of}} the {{practice}} of pediatric anesthesia is more essential than airway management. Pediatric anesthesiologists are the ‘go to’ specialists when infants and children with difficult airways present anywhere in the hospital. To our advantage, rapid technical advances have taken place during the past decades and the number of tools available to assist us in providing and maintaining a secure and stable airway has increased significantly. Until the 1970 s tracheal intubation with a conventional laryngoscope or blind nasal intubation were the mainstays of establishing an artificial airway. The choice of endotracheal tubes was limited. During the past 20 years a remarkable assortment of equipment and novel techniques to facilitate optimal airway management have been developed. These include supraglottic airways, <b>direct</b> and fiberoptic <b>laryngoscopes</b> and transtracheal devices. Improved imaging of the airway prior to initiation of airway management, with CT and MRI, for example, and during airway manipulation and instrumentation, using fiberoptic cameras and portable video displays, is now widely used. While new developments in airway management have helped us improve the quality of care of our patients, new challenges have also arisen. Which techniques should we learn, teach and employ? Which endotracheal tubes should be utilized – uncuffed or cuffed, old or new design? Which of our patients need preoperative imaging of the airway and/or sleep studies? What are the risks of newer interventions, including novel airway devices and laser instruments...|$|R
40|$|The C-MAC videolaryngoscope {{is a novel}} {{intubation}} {{device that}} incorporates a camera system {{at the end of}} its blade, thereby facilitating obtaining a view of the glottis without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes. It retains the traditional Macintosh blade shape and can be used as a <b>direct</b> or indirect <b>laryngoscope.</b> We wished to determine the optimal stylet strategy for use with the C-MAC. Ten anaesthetists were allowed up to three attempts to intubate the trachea in one easy and three progressively more difficult laryngoscopy scenarios in a SimMan manikin with four tracheal tube stylet strategies: no stylet; stylet; directional stylet (Parker Flex-It); and hockey-stick stylet. The use of a stylet conferred no advantage in the easy laryngoscopy scenario. In the difficult scenarios, the directional and hockey-stick stylets performed best. In the most difficult scenario, the median (IQR [range]) duration of the successful intubation attempt was lowest with the hockey-stick stylet; 18 s (15 - 22 [12 - 43]) s, highest with the unstyletted tracheal tube; 60 s (60 - 60 [60, 60]) s and styletted tracheal tube 60 s (29 - 60 [18 - 60]) s, and intermediate with the directional stylet 21 s (15 - 60 [8 - 60]) s. The use of a stylet alone does not confer benefit in the setting of easy laryngoscopy. However, in more difficult laryngoscopy scenarios, the C-MAC videolaryngoscope performs best when used with a stylet that angulates the distal tracheal tube. The hockey-stick stylet configuration performed best in the scenarios tested...|$|R
