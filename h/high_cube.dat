40|$|Abstract—We numerically {{demonstrate}} that the transmission through a deep subwavelength (λ 0 / 20) aperture in a metal plate could be greatly enhanced owing to the resonance effects of a high permittivity (κ) dielectric cube tightly coupled to the aperture. The transmission enhancement originates from the confinement and re-radiation of the electromagnetic energy impinging onto the <b>high</b> κ <b>cube</b> which operates in the 1 st Mie resonance mode, and behaves as an ultra-small magnetic dipole antenna. The complex permittivity of the cube governs the operating frequency and the enhancement in terms of bandwidth and transmissivity maximum. Additionally, based on the isotropic response of the <b>high</b> κ <b>cube</b> with dimensions comparable to the aperture size, the almost independence of the enhancement properties on the illumination polarization and incidence angle was assessed. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Suppose {{that there}} is such a dissection. Make a face of C its {{horizontal}} base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle R by the cubes which rest on it. Each corner square of R has a smaller adjacent edge square, and Rs smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge. Therefore, the smallest square s1 in R is surrounded by larger, and therefore <b>higher,</b> <b>cubes</b> on all four sides. Hence the upper face of the cube on s1 is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let s2 be the smallest square in this dissection. The sequence of squares s1, s2, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number. This contradicts our original supposition.|$|R

For example, to reduce the operational cost and to offer a competitive price to customers, the utilisation of wagons and trains must be improved, both by advance and proper planning and by improving the technical aspects. One example of technically improved utilisation is the VEL wagon, which is a 26  m long wagon with two bogies that can load two 40 feet containers or three swap-bodies (or combinations of unit loads including <b>High</b> <b>cubes)</b> on an 80  ft loading area. It implies better loading factors of trains, 10  % more TEU per length on fewer axles, and thus lower energy consumption, less maintenance and lower cost per transported unit (VEL wagon 2012). Other measures are short‐coupled wagons with draw‐bars, or automatic couplers without buffers.|$|R

This texture was much intensive in the tape at 99 % thickness reduction than in the tape at 87 % thickness reduction. The 99 % reduction tape showed a higher fraction and sharper cube texture than the 87 % reduction tape after annealing treatment.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultrahigh}} straining {{on the evolution}} of <b>cube</b> texture in <b>high</b> purity nickel (99. 97 %) processed by Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) is investigated in the present study. Fully recrystallized nickel sheet having average grain size of 28 µm is deformed by ARB to the strain levels of εeq= 3. 2 and εeq= 6. 4 corresponding to 4 and 8 cycles of ARB processing, respectively, and subsequently annealed at different temperatures. The 8 cycle ARB processed material consistently shows much <b>higher</b> <b>cube</b> volume fraction as compared to the 4 cycle processed material after different annealing treatments. Almost 100 % cube volume could be obtained in the 8 cycle processed material after annealing at 800 °C. The development of extremely sharp cube texture in the 8 cycle processed material could be attributed to the oriented nucleation of cube grains at early stages of recrystallization and subsequent growth of these grains. The results indicate that ultrahigh straining could be useful for applications requiring near perfect cube texture such as substrates for coated superconductors applications...|$|R

40|$|Physiological {{changes during}} insect {{ontogeny}} should be manifest in changes in nutrient requirements and food preference. To investigate ontogenetic changes in food preference and digestive physiology, third- through sixth-instar gypsy moth larvae were provided choices among artificial diets differing in protein and lipid concentrations. Control larvae received two identical cubes of diet that were nutritionally complete, each containing a balanced mixture of protein and lipid. A {{second group of}} larvae received two different but complementary cubes, one deficient only in protein, the other deficient only in lipid. During early to late instars, preference shifted away from lipid-deficient, <b>high</b> protein <b>cubes</b> toward protein-deficient, <b>high</b> lipid <b>cubes.</b> This {{is consistent with the}} need for late-instar larvae to accrue energy reserves and specific fatty acids required during the pupal and non-feeding adult stages. Male larvae ate a higher proportion from the protein-deficient, high-lipid cube than females, possibly the result of greater energy demands by adult males. Female larvae tended to grow faster on deficient, complementary cubes than larvae provided complete cubes, despite poorer food utilization efficiency. These shifts and sex-specific variations in preference for protein and lipid likely reflect changing nutrient demands and fundamental physiological differences...|$|R
