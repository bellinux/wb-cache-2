Understanding the way in which one learns to move through this process is an important part of identifying how one becomes interculturally competent. It is essential to recognize factors specific to the individual as well as the cultures and societies they are moving between. It has been found that people who successfully adapt interculturally to become bicultural or multicultural have high correlations with extroversion, creativity, restraint and intellect.

40|$|BACKGROUND The work {{described}} in this paper has emerged from an ALTC/OLT funded project, Exploring <b>Intercultural</b> <b>Competency</b> in Engineering. The project indentified many facets of culture and intercultural competence that go beyond a culture-as-nationality paradigm. It was clear from this work that resources were needed to help engineering educators introduce students to the complex issues of culture {{as they relate to}} engineering practice. A set of learning modules focussing on intercultural competence in engineering practice have been developed that cover the various aspects of culture in engineering identified in the project. Supporting the resources, an eBook detailing {{the ins and outs of}} <b>intercultural</b> <b>competency</b> has also been developed to assist engineering educators to embed opportunities for students to develop skills in unpacking and managing cross-cultural challenges in engineering practice. PURPOSE This paper argues that the Engineering Across Cultures eBook and learning modules provide a useful tool for creating opportunities for to develop their intercultural competence. The authors also propose a plan for establishing a community of practice in the area in intercultural competence in engineering education. DESIGN/METHOD A key aim of this project overall was to go beyond the culture-as-nationality approach adopted in much of the work around <b>intercultural</b> <b>competency</b> (Deardorff, 2011). The eBook explores different dimensions of culture such as workplace culture, culture 2 ̆ 7 s influence on engineering design, and culture in the classroom. The book describes how these connect to industry practice and explore what they mean for engineering education. The packaged learning modules described here have been developed as a matrix of approaches moving from familiar known methods through complicated activities relying to some extent on expert knowledge. Some modules draw on the concept of 2 ̆ 7 complex un-order 2 ̆ 7 as {{described in}} the 2 ̆ 7 Cynefin domains 2 ̆ 7 proposed by Kurtz and Snowden (2003). RESULTS Several of the modules included in the eBook have already been trialled at a variety of institutions. Feedback from staff has been reassuringly positive but the evaluation to this point is limited. Further trials are planned for second semester 2012, and version 1 of the eBook and learning modules, Engineering Across Cultures, is due to be released in late October 2012. CONCLUSIONS The Engineering Across Cultures eBook and learning modules provide a useful and ready to employ resource to help educators tackle the complex issue of <b>intercultural</b> <b>competency</b> in engineering education. The book is by no means exhaustive, and nor are the modules, they instead provide an accessible, engineering specific guide to bringing cultural issues into the engineering classroom...|$|R

The project {{is driven by the}} principle that innovative teaching resources form part of broader pedagogic strategies that can actively help tackle issues of diversity common across the EU and feed into positive models of social cohesion. As issues related to migration present a transnational challenge, Mysty provides a transnational cross-sectional educational tool to enhance <b>intercultural</b> <b>competency.</b> We work from an awareness that ‘The current context of rapid migration into Europe associated with the international tensions, have revealed growing distances between different cultures and communities, including in educational setting, and involving intolerant attitudes and behaviours’ (www. mysty. eu). MYSTY aims to provide validity to experience irrespective of cultural background, using storytelling as a positive mechanism to counter negative stereotype (Salazar, 2010). How those voices are then ‘heard’ by different pupils both in situ and online will have to be negotiated with care (De Leeuw & Rydin, 2007). Different stories may reveal ethical, cultural or personal issues. As such, one of the questions we would like to address in this presentation is how to manage unexpected narratives or negative engagement. Pupils will be positioned as active agents in creating meaningful narratives; how these narratives then ‘fit’ with national curricula is a further question that we anticipate may elicit some interesting discussions. We are also encountering storytelling that owes more to the therapeutic (Chidgey, 2014; Thumim, 2010) and are thinking how that fits into our project...|$|R
