25|$|The carving {{seems to}} have been {{completed}} by December 1658, for Symon White (who is evidently a superior workman, receiving 22d. a day, the highest wage paid to anyone, and who was the master carver) is no longer employed. No other carvers are mentioned, and as there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of ornament, he may have done all the work himself, with the aid perhaps of his apprentices. Very probably he designed it also, and was, no doubt, trained in the new school of classic design, after the manner of Nicholas Stone, {{or any of the other}} carvers of that date, whose work could then be seen on St. Mary's Church porch, or elsewhere. Whether for temperance' sake or for other reasons bevers are now abated, and after this date John Jackson is not paid as overseer.|$|E
25|$|Polysilicon <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered {{by increasing the}} level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.|$|E

500|$|There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal {{of native}} Italian Christmas music. The most popular Italian Christmas carol is [...] "Tu scendi dalle stelle", the modern Italian words to which {{were written by}} Pope Pius IX in 1870. The melody is a major-key version of an older, minor-key Neapolitan carol [...] "Quanno Nascette Ninno". Other than that, Italians largely sing {{translations}} of carols that come from the German and English tradition ("Silent Night", for example). There is no native Italian secular Christmas music, which accounts for the popularity of Italian-language versions of [...] "Jingle Bells" [...] and [...] "White Christmas".|$|E
500|$|According to New Zealand {{music critic}} Graham Reid, a {{contemporary}} Australian review remarked on the album's religiosity: [...] "oftentimes {{the music is}} a more truthful guide {{to the sense of}} the lyrics than the words themselves. Harrison <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> wordsmith but he is a superb musician. Everything flows, everything interweaves. His melodies are so superb they take care of everything …" [...] Like Holden, Nicholas Schaffner approved of the singer's gesture in donating his publishing royalties to the Material World Charitable Foundation and praised the album's [...] "exquisite musical underpinnings". Although the [...] "transcendent dogma" [...] was not always to his taste, Schaffner recognised that in Living in the Material World, Harrison had [...] "devised a luxuriant rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Canadian-based website Jam!, Andrew Carver praised the {{different}} sounds on Supernature, {{which range from}} [...] "a blend of future noise" [...] to [...] "crushed velvet corruption"; he described the album as [...] "one sharp recording". Jessica Suarez of Spin magazine compared [...] "Ooh La La" [...] to Black Cherrys [...] "Strict Machine", saying that [...] "Ooh La La" [...] sounds [...] "so simplistic that [...] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy". She praised [...] "Ride a White Horse" [...] and [...] "Fly Me Away" [...] for featuring Alison Goldfrapp's [...] "velvet-soft vocals, which stay that way even when heavily processed". A less favourable reception came from Stylus Magazine reviewer Edward Oculicz, who stated [...] "Supernature <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> album" [...] and called several of its tracks too [...] "dull".|$|E

500|$|Suspicion was fuelled to {{some degree}} by her {{entertainment}} of questionable characters at court—for example, the reputed seer Nostradamus, who was rumoured to have created a talisman for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in necromancy and the black arts. Cosimo Ruggeri, in particular, {{was believed to be}} Catherine's own [...] "trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts", although there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear. Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.|$|E
500|$|According to The New York Times, Friends with Benefits, a film [...] "about {{love and}} {{sex in the}} age of social networking, gets some of its juice and tang partly by trash-talking its own genre. The setup is familiar, as are the {{essential}} elements: a single man and a single woman, two battered hearts yet a pair of resilient, eager, pretty bodies [...] Friends with Benefits starts from the premise that its characters, and you, are sick of the romantic comedy clichés they may secretly, or not so secretly, adore." [...] Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist felt that the film's central characters, both of whom were raised by a single parent in the film, [...] "start looking for ways to solve that problem because they were never given the opportunity to grow an emotional landscape from a nurturing, available parent. They were just quickly parentalized and became a caretaker. And the caretaking is all part of the 'going for a broken person' and trying to fix them." [...] He further added that [...] "love addiction ending in 'happily ever after' <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> message." ...|$|E
500|$|The final general {{classification}} {{of the race}} would definitely be decided on this stage, {{and a majority of}} the observers believed that Pinot would lose his lead since he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time trialist, meaning he is not at his best when fighting against the wind on rolling terrain. Geraint Thomas of Team Sky was only 34 seconds down coming into the stage and was among the favorites to take the overall victory. Tom Dumoulin (Giant-Alpecin) won the short prologue and was a contender for overall victory too since he is a time trial specialist, but he had 1' 24" [...] to make up for. Another contender for overall win was Simon Špilak of Team Katusha (47 seconds down). Fourth-placed Domenico Pozzovivo (Ag2r-La Mondiale) was an enigma, as he had mixed performances in time trials throughout his career. As far as the stage win in itself was concerned, solo effort specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory Racing) and Adriano Malori (...) were to be considered, but they had no chance of a victory in the general classification since they were too far down in the rankings.|$|E

He concluded that the show [...] "deserved to finish on top", and that {{while some of the}} scenes, such as Dwight's wedding seemed [...] "a little bit trite", the resulting product was successful. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode five stars out of five and {{wrote that the}} episode was able to provide solid conclusions for all of the characters. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that [...] "the quality of this series finale is found in the way it functions right now, in the afterglow of a TV show to which many devoted more than 100 hours of their lives. Some aspects of the episode fall flat, but when it hits, it hits." [...] Ultimately, he found that Finale' <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> piece of television" [...] but that it was the finale that [...] "The Office needed" [...] because it was [...] "the right point to jump off ... the circular track", due to the series idea of thematic reoccurrence. Tom Gliatto of People magazine, however, gave the episode a negative review, and wrote that [...] "this episode was poorly conceived and clumsily structured. It really wasn't worthy of all the years of affectionate humor that had gone before it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{elevation}} of the great central African plateau on which Zambia is located, typically between 1000 and 1300 metres, modifies temperatures, which are lower than for coastal areas at the same latitude, and pleasant {{for much of the}} year. On the plateau (covering about 80% of the country) mean minimums for June in the cool dry season are in the range [...] 6–12°C, mean maximums for October, the hot dry season are 28–35°C. Frost only occurs on a few days in winter on the highest exposed hills, or more widely in the lower humidity areas of the southern half of the country. Plants susceptible to frost do not grow in the southern half of the country.

It seems that Cniva was a skilled tactician and that he was very familiar with the surrounding terrain. Jordanes and Aurelius Victor claim that Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter.

More {{than a year before}} May became prime minister, Gaby Hinsliff wrote in a February 2015 Guardian article that [...] "one reason she gets on so well with Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre is that both prefer talking business to pleasure". According to Hinsliff, Dacre considers May's unsuccessful leadership rival, Boris Johnson, as [...] "morally reprehensible, because of his serial affairs, and fundamentally unserious". Despite this, Mail contributor Sarah Vine in a leaked email, believed Dacre (and Rupert Murdoch) would back Johnson if her husband, Michael Gove, was also part of the same ticket. The Independents John Rentoul also saw Gove as being Dacre and Murdoch's preferred candidate, but for him. [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> pitch".|$|E

2500|$|In 1877, Miller adapted his First Fam'lies of the Sierras into a play, The Danites, or, the Heart of the Sierras. It {{opened on}} August 22 in New York with McKee Rankin {{as the main}} character. The anti-Mormon play, which {{featured}} Danites hunting the daughter {{of one of the}} murderers of Joseph Smith, {{became one of the most}} commercially successful in a series of anti-Mormon dramas at the time. The Spirit of the Times, however, attributed its success to curious audience members expecting a disastrous failure and instead discovering a good show: [...] "The play proved to possess more than ordinary merit, and if it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> work, it is decidedly not a very bad one." [...] The Danites was extended from a run of only a few days to one of seven straight weeks before moving to another theatre and, ultimately, was performed to such a degree that it rivaled the popularity of Uncle Tom's Cabin. It was published in book form later in 1877. Miller later admitted that he regretted the anti-Mormon tone.|$|E

However, Robert Christgau named it [...] "dud of the month" [...] in his consumer guide for MSN Music, in which he wrote that most of the tracks are musically incomplete and, [...] "in the narrow sense of rhythm tracks, the beats have some ass to them, but as music they revert to fusion kitsch whenever the artiste sees an opening". Pitchfork critic David Drake commented that [...] "Kamaal the Abstract <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> record by any means. But it is an interesting one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh [...] ", viewing that [...] "each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise". William Grant of Drowned in Sound viewed that it [...] "seems a bit aimless at times", but ultimately praised its diverse sound and gave it an eight out of 10 rating. Dave Heaton of PopMatters commented that the album is [...] "mainly about feeling. There’s no storytelling meat to the songs, less wit, not much of Q-Tip’s creative approach to language. It’s mostly about riding the groove, and that Q-Tip does well".|$|E
