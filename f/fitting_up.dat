25|$|This {{building}} one of Charles Lanyon's earlier buildings {{was completed}} in 1838. It cost £1,125, plus £40 for the bench and <b>fitting</b> <b>up.</b> It is made mostly of basalt blocks with brick dressings. The main doorway {{is surrounded by a}} thick stone frame. A lot of the window frames and sills are made of brown basalt. Strangely enough it is not currently a listed building.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary role}} of the TTH version is the {{transport}} of 20 troops or more than 2,500kg of cargo, heliborne operations and search & rescue. It can quickly be adapted to MEDEVAC/CASEVAC missions by <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> to 12 stretchers or cargo delivery capability. [...] Additional roles include special operations, electronic warfare, airborne command post, parachuting, VIP transport and flight training.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, the Board of Regents {{authorized}} $3,000 ($78,947.37 in 2014 dollars) for {{the purchase}} of a parcel of land along South State Street. In 1891 a further $4,500 ($118,421.05 in 2014 dollars) was authorized [...] "for the purpose of <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> the athletic field." [...] Michigan began play on Regents Field in 1893, with capacity being expanded to over 15,000 {{by the end of the}} field's use.|$|E

60|$|July 6th.--We dined {{yesterday}} at the table d'hote, {{at the suggestion of}} the butler, in order to give less trouble to the servants of the hotel, and afford them an opportunity to go to kirk. The dining-room is in accordance {{with the rest of the}} architecture and <b>fittings</b> <b>up</b> of the house, and is a very good reproduction of an old baronial hall, with high panellings and a roof of dark, polished wood. There were about twenty guests at table; and if they and the waiters had been dressed in mediaeval costume, we might have imagined ourselves banqueting in the Middle Ages.|$|R
2500|$|James Madison is {{credited}} {{with the idea for}} creating a congressional library, first making such a proposition in 1783. The Library of Congress was established April 24, 1800, when President John Adams signed an act of Congress providing for the transfer of the seat of government from Philadelphia to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 [...] "for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ..., and for <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> a suitable apartment for containing them...." [...] Books were ordered from London and the collection, consisting of 740 books and 3 maps, was housed in the new Capitol.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after this}} event the {{preparations}} for spending the winter were completed; {{at least as}} far as the <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> of the vessel was concerned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind. I want {{to learn}} some new songs, and my {{children}} need <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> for the summer. They are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Razon said, [...] "The Project is {{actually}} a <b>fitting</b> follow <b>up</b> of a similar event last held last 2010 that not only left a mark in history {{in terms of the}} number of participants, but for the realization of its advocacy of providing free college education to beneficiaries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the best}} {{appointed}} in the country, sir," [...] he said proudly. [...] "Absolutely no expense has been spared in <b>fitting</b> it <b>up.</b> Every one of our appliances is of the latest possible description, and our bathrooms are an exact copy of those in a famous Philadelphia club." ...|$|R
6000|$|It will {{hardly be}} {{believed}} in ages to come, when our posterity shall be grown wiser by our loss, and, as I may truly say, at our expense, that a pastry-cook's shop, which twenty pounds would effectually furnish at a time, with all needful things for sale, nay, except on an extraordinary show, as on twelfth-day at night for cakes, or upon some great feast, twenty pounds {{can hardly be}} laid out at one time in goods for sale, yet that <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> one of these shops should cost upwards of £300 in the year 1710--let the year be recorded--the <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> to consist of the following particulars:-- ...|$|E
60|$|On the {{pulling down}} of the Old Inn by Mr. Powell, the {{panelling}} was purchased by Mr. Street, of Brewer Street, and was afterwards sold to Lord Ellenborough, for the <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> of his Lordship’s residence, Southam House, Cheltenham.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} Mr Stevenson saw the {{practicability}} and propriety of <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> the beacon, {{not only as}} a place of refuge in case of accidents to the boats in landing, but as a residence for the men during the working months.|$|E
5000|$|John Phelps {{was given}} {{instructions}} for [...] "matting {{the room in}} which they were to meet, and for <b>fitting</b> it <b>up</b> so that it might be very warm. At a later period Henry Scobell, clerk of Parliament, was required to deliver to John Phelps all papers and books returned from Scotland touching delinquents and sequestrations." ...|$|R
40|$|Acquired adult-onset {{hearing loss}} {{is a common}} {{long-term}} condition for which the most common intervention is hearing aid <b>fitting.</b> However, <b>up</b> to 40 % of people fitted with a hearing aid either fail to use it or may not gain optimal benefit from it. This is an update of a review first published in The Cochrane Library in 2014...|$|R
50|$|In 1732, Edward Worth, one of {{the most}} eminent Dublin {{physicians}} of his day, died and bequeathed to Steevens' Hospital £1,000 and his library, then valued at £5,000, together with £100 for <b>fitting</b> it <b>up.</b> The hospital built a specially designed room to house the Edward Worth Library, where it remains to this day under updated protective conditions.|$|R
60|$|It is {{a modern}} custom, and wholly unknown to our ancestors, who yet {{understood}} trade, {{in proportion to the}} trade they carried on, as well as we do, to have tradesmen lay out two-thirds of their fortune in <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> their shops.|$|E
60|$|I {{might give}} {{something}} of a like example of extravagance in <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> a cutler's shop, Anglicé a toyman, which are now come up to such a ridiculous expense, as is hardly {{to be thought of}} without the utmost contempt: let any one stop at the Temple, or at Paul's corner, or in many other places.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I want to {{pick and}} choose. A man turns the girls over one after another as one does the papers when one is <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> a room, or rolls them out as one rolls out the carpets. A very careful young man like Lord Popplecourt might reject a young woman because her hair didn't suit the colour of his furniture." ...|$|E
60|$|The gallery, {{as it is}} called, on the {{basement}} floor of the casino, is sixty feet in length, by perhaps a third as much in breadth, and is (after all I have seen at the Colonna Palace and elsewhere) a more magnificent hall than I imagined to be in existence. It is floored with rich marble in beautifully arranged compartments, and the walls are almost entirely eased with marble of various sorts, the prevailing kind being giallo antico, intermixed with verd antique, and I know not what else; but the splendor of the giallo antico gives the character to the room, and the large and deep niches along the walls appear to be lined with the same material. Without coming to Italy, one can {{have no idea of}} what beauty and magnificence are produced by these <b>fittings</b> <b>up</b> of polished marble. Marble to an American means nothing but white limestone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is {{away with}} Mrs Merdle,' {{returned}} that gentleman, slowly {{coming out of}} a long abstraction, in the course of which he had been <b>fitting</b> a tablespoon <b>up</b> his sleeve. 'It is not indispensable for him to be on the spot.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The longed-for hour came at last. The cabin tables {{having been}} removed, {{and rows of}} seats {{placed in front of}} the stage, the men were {{admitted}} from the deck, to which they had been expelled an hour previous in order not to impede preliminary arrangements. There was great joking, of course, as they took their seats and criticised the <b>fittings</b> <b>up.</b> David Mizzle was of opinion that the foot-lights [...] "wos oncommon grand", which was an unquestionable fact, for they consisted of six tin lamps filled with seal-oil, from the wicks of which rose a compound of yellow flame and smoke that had a singularly luminous effect. Amos Parr guessed that the curtain would be certain sure to get jammed at the first haul, and several of the others were convinced that O'Riley would stick his part in one way or another. However, an end was put to all remarks, and expectation raised on tiptoe by the ringing of a small hand-bell, and immediately thereafter a violent pulling at the curtain which concealed the stage; but the curtain remained immovable (they always do on such occasions), and a loud whispering was heard behind the scenes.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lightfoot began, in piteous {{tones of}} reproach to her husband,--"You unmanly! {{to treat a}} woman so who took you off the street. Oh, you coward, to lay your hand upon your wife! Why did I marry you? Why did I leave my Lady for you? Why did I spend eight hundred pound in <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> this house that you might drink and guzzle?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{islander}} {{was much}} interested and {{impressed by the}} sail and its results. He {{had not been able}} to under-stand exactly what I hoped to accomplish with it while we were <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> the boat; but when he saw the clumsy dugout move steadily through the water with-out paddles, he was as delighted as a child. We made splendid headway on the trip, coming into sight of land at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye know, father," [...] {{interposed}} {{the young}} girl, [...] "he talks of <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> the yacht for the fishing, and taking {{some of his}} most decent men on shares. He says he was very fond of fishing off the Massachusetts coast, in America. It will be, I'm thinking," [...] she said, suddenly turning to the consul with an almost pathetic appeal in her voice, [...] "a great occupation for the rich young men over there." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1975, MTA {{purchased}} the ship Hora to transform {{her into a}} research vessel, and renamed her MTA Sismik 1. After <b>fitting</b> her with <b>up</b> to date technology equipment for subsea geophysical exploration at seas around Turkey, she was commissioned in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Ukraine Prosthetic Assistance Project aims {{to address}} the {{immediate}} need in Ukraine, as well as brings long term results, providing the opportunity to both Ukrainian specialists and amputees to get better access {{to a variety of}} prosthetic components, devices, techniques and really understand the process of <b>fitting</b> and follow <b>up.</b>|$|R
25|$|In January 1858 Charles Pierre Melly, a Liverpool philanthropist (an {{ancestor}} {{of the late}} George Melly, musician and entertainer, and Andrée Melly film actress) applied to purchase a piece of corporation land {{for the purpose of}} transforming it into a free recreative ground, and <b>fitting</b> it <b>up</b> with a gymnasium and other appliances {{for the use of the}} local working-class people. With John Hulley, he founded the Liverpool Athletic Club at the Rotunda Gymnasium, Bold Street, Liverpool (with the motto mens sana in corpore sano – a healthy mind in a healthy body), and was its first president.|$|R
60|$|The first care of Captain Harvey, {{after getting}} his brig {{securely}} laid {{up in her}} icy cradle for the winter was to {{remove some of the}} stores to the island, where he had them carefully secured in a little hut which the crew built of loose stones. This relieved the strain on the vessel, and permitted the free circulation of air. The <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> of the interior of the brig was then begun.|$|E
60|$|By <b>fitting</b> <b>up,</b> I do {{not mean}} {{furnishing}} their shops with wares and goods to sell--for in that they came up to us in every particular, and perhaps went beyond us too--but in painting and gilding, fine shelves, shutters, boxes, glass-doors, sashes, and the like, in which, they tell us now, {{it is a small}} matter to lay out two or three hundred pounds, nay, five hundred pounds, to fit up a pastry-cook's, or a toy-shop.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt whether}} {{you can get that}} {{remedied}} here. I should advise you to rig out a temporary rudder. I'll tell you what I will do--I will send a couple of hundred men on board at once under my second officer. That will make short work of it, and I am sure {{that there is not a}} man on board who would not be glad to lend a hand in <b>fitting</b> <b>up</b> a prize that has been so gallantly won." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You guess correctly; he has volunteered already. And Mrs. Yorke--who, like you, seems {{disposed}} {{to regard the}} rioters as martyrs, and me, and especially Mr. Helstone, as murderers--is at this moment, I believe, most assiduously engaged in <b>fitting</b> it <b>up</b> with feather-beds, pillows, bolsters, blankets, etc. The victims lack no attentions, I promise you. Mr. Hall, your favourite parson, has been with them ever since six o'clock, exhorting them, praying with them, and even waiting on them like any nurse; and Caroline's good friend, Miss Ainley, that very plain old maid, sent in a stock of lint and linen, something {{in the proportion of}} another lady's allowance of beef and wine." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1904, Hotel del Coronado {{introduced}} the world's first electrically lit, outdoor living Christmas tree. From the San Diego Union, December 25, 1904: [...] "The tree {{selected for the}} honor {{is one of the}} three splendid Norfolk Island pines on the plaza [...] It has attained a height of fifty feet and its branches stand proudly forth. All day yesterday electricians were busy <b>fitting</b> it <b>up</b> and by night 250 lights of many colors gave beauty to the fine old pine. Lanterns, great and small, hung from its boughs. And now that an open-air Christmas tree had been introduced, it is likely that another Christmas Eve will find many California gardens aglow with light scattered from living foliage." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{must make}} use of terms and {{sometimes}} of provisional terms. But we must guard against such terms and the mental danger of excessive intension they carry with them. The child takes a stick and says it is a sword and does not forget, he takes a shadow under the bed and says it is a bear and he half forgets. The man takes a set of emotions and says it is a God, and he gets excited and propagandist and does forget; he is involved in disputes and confusions with the old gods of wood and stone, and presently he is making his God a Great White Throne and <b>fitting</b> him <b>up</b> with a mystical family.|$|R
