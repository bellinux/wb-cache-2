30|$|Signature {{matrices}} are matrices {{with specific}} structure and spectrum, and define ETFs up to unitary equivalence. While signature matrices of ETFs exist for certain frame dimensions, in this paper, we propose a numerical method that produces signature matrices <b>of</b> nearly equiangular <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary <b>dimensions.</b> These <b>frames</b> are almost tight, with frame vectors exhibiting near optimal correlation. Using the obtained frames as spreading sequences for CDMA systems, we reduce the interference {{experienced by the}} individual users, {{when the number of}} active users in the system changes. We also employ nearly equiangular frames to obtain sparse signals with CS, achieving high reconstruction performance of sparse recovery algorithms. The proposed frame constructions, which are based on signature matrices, rely on the solution of a structured inverse eigenvalue problem. Any progress towards the solution of similar inverse eigenvalue problems could improve the proposed constructions substantially.|$|R

30|$|Performance {{guarantees}} for recovery algorithms employed in sparse representations, and compressed sensing {{highlights the importance}} of incoherence. Optimal bounds of incoherence are attained by equiangular unit norm tight frames (ETFs). Although ETFs are important in many applications, they do not exist for all dimensions, while their construction has been proven extremely difficult. In this paper, we construct frames that are close to ETFs. According to results from frame and graph theory, the existence of an ETF depends on the existence of its signature matrix, that is, a symmetric matrix with certain structure and spectrum consisting of two distinct eigenvalues. We view the construction of a signature matrix as an inverse eigenvalue problem and propose a method that produces <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> any <b>dimensions</b> that are close to ETFs. Due to the achieved equiangularity property, the so obtained frames can be employed as spreading sequences in synchronous code-division multiple access (s-CDMA) systems, besides compressed sensing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Despite the {{important}} properties of unit norm tight frames (UNTFs) and equiangular tight frames (ETFs), their construction {{has been proven}} extremely difficult. The few known techniques produce {{only a small number}} <b>of</b> such <b>frames</b> while imposing certain restrictions on frame dimensions. Motivated by the application <b>of</b> incoherent tight <b>frames</b> in compressed sensing (CS), we propose a methodology to construct incoherent UNTFs. When frame redundancy is not very high, the achieved maximal column correlation becomes close to the lowest possible bound. The proposed methodology may construct <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> any <b>dimensions.</b> The obtained frames are employed in CS to produce optimized projection matrices. Experimental results show that the proposed optimization technique improves CS signal recovery, increasing the reconstruction accuracy. Considering that the UNTFs and ETFs are important in sparse representations, channel coding, and communications, we expect that the proposed construction will be useful in other applications, besides the CS.
