In 1808 Sir Humphry Davy proved the presence of methane in the gases produced by cattle manure. In 1859 a leper colony in Bombay in India built the first anaerobic digester. In 1895, the technology was developed in Exeter, England, where a septic tank was used to generate gas for the sewer gas destructor lamp, a type of gas lighting. Also in England, in 1904, the first dual-purpose tank for both sedimentation and sludge treatment was installed in Hampton, London.

The report contains a brief background on both <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tanks</b> and chemically enhanced primary treatment and a discussion of the governing technical considerations. The residents of Las Vegas produce a very high amount of relatively dilute domestic wastewater (approximately 1, 000 liters/person/day). Bench scale testing and pilot testing during January 2008 in the Las Vegas <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tanks</b> found that a dosage of approximately 150 mg/l alum (17 % Al 2 O 3) was necessary to treat Las Vegas? domestic wastewater. However, solution preparation and chemical injection were found to be difficult to achieve under current conditions and the cost of alum in this quantity is prohibitively expensive. The final recommendations to the municipality of Las Vegas include encouragement to conserve water and a comprehensive plan to better maintain the <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tanks</b> in order to achieve higher levels of treatment. This thesis also documents the author's efforts to ascertain the status of <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tanks</b> in the rest of Honduras in terms of their size, design, and maintenance. During January 2008 three other <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tanks</b> in the department of Santa Barbara and one in the department of La Paz were visited and all were found to be in varied states of disrepair.

50|$|The <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tank,</b> {{named for}} German {{engineer}} Karl Imhoff (1876-1965), is a chamber {{suitable for the}} reception and processing of sewage. It {{may be used for}} the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the extracted sludge. It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which collected solids slide down inclined bottom slopes to an entrance into a lower chamber in which the sludge is collected and digested. The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and no flow of sewage in the lower digestion chamber. The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6-9 months of digestion. The <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tank</b> is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank's simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber.|$|E

Beginning in 2005, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began working with stakeholders around the lake to assess anthropogenic environmental impacts on the lake. In January 2008, a technical team composed of Dr. Eric Adams from MIT, Aridai Herrera a civil engineer from Malcolm Pirnie, and MIT students Anne Mikelonis and Matthew Hodge, traveled to Las Vegas to work with the Municipality on domestic wastewater discharge, one of the previously identified environmental impacts on Lake Yojoa. In preliminary discussions with the Municipality, the team identified three goals for the project: evaluate the performance of the existing wastewater treatment facility, test the possibility of enhancements to this facility, and evaluate options for expanded sewerage and wastewater treatment throughout Las Vegas. The results of this project are a set of three recommendations for the Municipality to improve wastewater treatment. First, regular maintenance of existing facilities is necessary to achieve optimal performance for existing wastewater infrastructure. Second, substantial non-waste water is entering the sewerage leading to an average daily flow of 1, 000 L/person/day that has diluted concentrations of important wastewater contaminants. This situation makes any treatment difficult and prior to expanding sewerage, it is valuable to Las Vegas to investigate the source of non-waste water and to reduce the total flow to existing infrastructure. Finally, if the first two recommendations are acted upon, expanded treatment is subject to the constraints of Las Vegas, which are limited land availability and limited technical expertise. (cont.)

The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification.

A fraction of the final effluent was recycled back to the <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tank</b> with a recirculation rate of 50 % (hydraulic loading rate = 0. 37 m d- 1). The system's performance varied throughout the study. In Period I (summer) consistently high load removal efficiencies of TN (89 ± 5 %) and a removal rate of 6. 6 ± 1. 4 g TN m- 2 d- 1 were exhibited. In Period II (fall), the poor performance of the FWS during the senescence of macrophytes caused a large increase in organic matter, solids and nutrient concentrations, drastically deteriorating water quality. The determination of PPCPs was conducted during this period. Recalcitrant compounds, namely sulfamethoxazole, carbamazapine, TCEP and sucralose were negligibly removed in all CWs. However, noteworthy was the ˜ 30 % removal of sucralose in the VF wetland. Caffeine (80 %) and fluoxetine (27 %) showed similar elimination rates in both VF and HF units, whereas trimethoprim and DEET were significantly better removed in the VF than in the HF. The concentration of the four latter compounds showed a severe increase in the FWS, indicating possible desorption from the sediment/biomass during adverse conditions. Harvesting of the aboveground biomass in this unit returned the system's performance back to normality (Period III), achieving 77 ± 7 % TN removal despite the winter season, proving effluent recirculation as an effective strategy for TN removal in hybrid CW systems when stringent restrictions are in place.

Referred to as CAU 230 / 320, both CAUs are located at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and comprise two Corrective Action Sites (CASs), 22 - 03 - 01 (Sewage Lagoons) and 22 - 99 - 01 (Strainer Box). The Area 22 Sewage Lagoons site also includes a buried <b>Imhoff</b> <b>Tank,</b> sludge bed, and associated sewer piping. A September 1999 corrective action investigation identified the only contaminant of concern above preliminary action levels at this CAU (i. e., total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics). During this same investigation, three Corrective Action Objectives (CAOs) were identified to prevent or mitigate exposure to subsurface debris and contaminated soil. Based on these CAOs, {{a review of existing}} data, future use, and current operations in Area 22 of the NTS, three CAAs were developed for consideration: Alternative 1 - No Further Action, Alternative 2 - Closure in Place with Administrative Controls, and Alternative 3 - Excavation and Removal. These alternatives were evaluated based on four general corrective action standards and five remedy selection decision factors. Alternative 3 was chosen on technical merit as the preferred alternative for CAU 230 / 320. This alternative was judged to meet all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and will eliminate potential future exposure pathways to the buried debris and contaminated soils at both of the CASs within Area 22...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was the {{assessment}} of economic and environmental aspects of decentralised energy-saving wastewater treatment systems. The formulated investment and operation cost functions were adjusted by a power law function. The different wastewater systems serving population settlements between 50 p. e. and 250 p. e., presented associated investment costs varying from 400 €/p. e. to 200 €/p. e. and annual operation costs {{in the range of}} 70 €/p. e. to 20 €/p. e., respectively. A Life Cycle Analysis approach was used to compare the environmental impact alternative wastewater systems. The assessment was focused on two energy-saving systems (constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration) and a conventional one (activated sludge process). The low environmental impact of the energy-saving wastewater treatment systems was demonstrated, being the most relevant the global warming indicator. Options for reduction of life cycle impacts were assessed including materials used in construction and operation lifetime of the systems. A 10 % extension of operation lifetime of constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration systems lead to a 5 % and 7 % decrease in the abiotic depletion indicator, respectively, and to a 1 % decrease in CO 2 emissions in both systems. Replacing steel with HDPE in the activated sludge tank resulted in a 1 % reduction in CO 2 emission and 1 % in the abiotic depletion indicator. In the case of the <b>Imhoff</b> <b>tank</b> a 1 % reduction in CO 2 emissions and 5 % in abiotic depletion indicator were observed when concrete was replaced by HDPE. Therefore, considering the huge potential of energy saving wastewater treatment systems, the overall environmental impact of such design alternatives should not be discarded.
