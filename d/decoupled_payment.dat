40|$|<b>Decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> program, {{deemed to}} have less or no {{distortion}} on domestic production and trade, is largely implemented to support the farmers’ revenue in the EU agrofood sector. However it is analyzed by Moschini and Sckokai (1994) that when lump-sum transfer is not available, <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> is more efficient than coupled subsidies only when the income target for the farmers is high. Based on this idea, this paper analyzes the efficiency of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> in an imperfect competitive agrofood sector where raising public funds to finance <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> is costly. It is shown in a close economy that the likelihood of using <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> to substitute the output subsidy increases with the market power of the processor in the agrofood sector. In an open economy where trade policy instruments are available, an implementation of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> leads to a reduction of the domestic output subsidy. From a domestic welfare point of view it will induce {{an increase in the}} tariff in a net import country and in some condition, an increase in the export subsidy in a net export country.

30|$|In {{the context}} of the {{potential}} relationship between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and risk management decisions, Hennessy (1998) concluded in a US study that the term “decoupled” can be misleading as both the wealth effect and the presence of risk aversion can ensure that <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> affect production decisions. Indeed, Finger and Lehmann (2012) found among Swiss farmers that DP {{have a negative effect on}} the demand for hail insurance as a risk management strategy. Similarly, Koundouri et al. (2009) found that <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> significantly altered the risk attitude of farmers in Finland after European Union accession. The literature has not always, however, identified a significant relationship between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and risk attitudes or risk management decisions (Serra et al. 2011). It is therefore an empirical matter as to whether or not a relationship exists between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and farm income risk in a particular context.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} of this study can be interpreted {{in a number of different}} ways. One may conclude that the positive association between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and income risk is welcome as <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> appear targeted towards farms with a higher risk profile. However, under an expected utility framework, the results are somewhat concerning. In this framework, the positive relationship suggests that <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> induce farmers to take on greater risks in their market activities and that those farms with the largest payments are given an advantage in terms of their scope to manage market risks. The results suggest that some degree of asset integration is present and that the value of the <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> influence risk management behaviour.|$|R

40|$|In 2020, <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> will {{represent}} about 42 % of the CAP budget (green payments excluded). This report assesses the potential effects of European <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> on farmers' production decisions, {{prior to a}} sensitivity analysis of different coupling factors using the Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET). Scientific literature reveals different coupling channels such as capitalisation in land value, farmers' risk behaviour, credit accessibility, uncertainty about future policies and labour allocation through which European <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> influence farm choices and thus output. For each of these channels the relevant literature introducing theoretical and empirical assessments is evaluated {{with the aim of}} deriving plausible behavioural parameters that improve the representation of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> in economic simulation models. To capture completely decoupled production behaviour, many CGE models typically represent <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> as a uniform subsidy rate to the land using (agricultural) sectors.

We assess the possible effects of the 2013 CAP reform on the capitalization of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> in land rental values. Our estimates suggest that the CAP reform leads to an increase in the capitalization of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> by additional 16 cents for each EUR of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> relative to the pre-reform situation. However, there is a relatively large variation in the reform effects between MS particularly between Old Member States (OMS) and New MS (NMS). In NMS the capitalization rate slightly reduces from 76 % in the pre-reform period to 72 % in the post-reform period. Although, the rate is significantly lower in OMS, it almost doubles (from 20 % to 39 %) due to the reform. The main source of the post-reform capitalization in the EU are the entitlement stock changes accounting for 19 % of total post-reform capitalization level, followed by the internal convergence of payments with 18 %, the budget change (including external convergence) with 1 %, and the differentiation of payments (redistributive payment) with - 7 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the concept of decoupling and to assess the impact at the individual member state level in the European Union and in non-member regions of liberalising domestic support in the EU. Three scenarios are analysed each one of them illustrating the impacts of eliminating or decoupling the European agricultural support. It is found, that the existing domestic support payments in the EU are indeed coupled to production and hence they affect production decisions and distort international trade with adverse effects on the export potential of e. g. developing countries as a consequence. Furthermore, the value of this support is capitalised in significant higher land prices in Europe than would otherwise prevail. The scenarios illustrate the economic implications of transforming all domestic support payments (as well as other distorting policies) into a nationally homogenous and fully <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> to all agricultural land, i. e. irrespective of the farmers decision to crop or not. Specifically, the analysis suggest that it is possible to convert the existing agricultural support into a fully decoup-led payment which would not distort international trade and it indicates a way forward to offset the negative impact on land prices.

40|$|Under the Mac Sharry and Agenda 2000 reforms, direct {{payments}} comprised {{a significant portion}} of farmers' income in the EU. Farmers had to engage in production to receive these payments but the payments were relatively risk-free and therefore risk may not have {{played an important role in}} the production decision. This paper considers the effect of the decoupling of {{direct payments}} from production in the EU and in particular, on the role of production risk in the decision making process. In an environment where direct payments are completely decoupled from production, farmers may engage in an 'entitlement farming' system, that is retain their land only to activate the <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> and not actually produce any tangible goods. This paper examines the effect of production risk on the economic trade off between 'entitlement farming' and conventional farming. A stochastic budgeting model is developed for two representative farms. The model is used to measure the probability that the returns to the 'entitlement farming' system could be higher than the profit emanating from a conventional farming system given production risk. The results show that for the less efficient representative farm, the probability of achieving a significantly higher profit by engaging in entitlement farming is 46 percent, while further analysis shows that there is a 9 percent probability that profits from conventional farming systems would be only marginally higher than the 'entitlement farming' option.

40|$|The Mid-Term Review {{proposals}} {{presented by}} the European Commission in July 2002 and January 2003 correspond no doubt to the most radical CAP reform since the latter {{was established in the}} early 1960 's. This is not because these proposals include firm commitments on market access and export competition dossiers in the perspective of WTO talks. The proposals are silent on these points. This is because they finally achieve the shift from product to producer support by replacing all existing or newly introduced direct income payments, with a few exceptions, by a single <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> per farm, based on historical references and conditional upon cross-compliance to environmental, animal welfare as well as food security and quality criteria. In addition, they expand the scope of rural development instruments to promote food quality, meet higher standards and foster animal welfare and they increase amounts available for rural development by transferring funds from the first to the second pillar via the introduction of an EU-wide system of degression and modulation. This paper discusses these proposals from both an external and internal point of view. We analyse to what extent the MTR proposals could facilitate the EU negotiation position in the WTO. From a domestic point of view, these proposals correspond to appropriate changes in the right direction with however some important qualifications. We analyse these qualifications. We also discuss to what extent the MTR proposals should be considered as the ultimate reform of the CAP or as the third step, after 1992 and 1999, in the long-term process where public intervention would be mainly reserved for correcting market failures, notably the promotion of positive externalities and public goods as well as the reduction in risk and instability faced by agricultural producers.

40|$|An Economic Assessment of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy Reform. The main {{innovation}} of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reform is}} to replace most market aids {{by a single}} direct payment per farm disconnected from production choices and levels (decoupling process), conditional on the respect of statutory environmental, food safety, animal health and animal welfare standards as well as good agronomic and environmental practices (cross-compliance process). This <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> will be progressively reduced up {{to a maximum of}} 5 % and funds saved through this modulation mechanism will be switched from the first pillar of the CAP to a consolidated and strengthened rural development regulation confirmed as the second pillar of the CAP.

The objectives of this paper are the following. In a first stage, it presents the reform and proposes a qualitative analysis of measures adopted in June 2003. In a second stage, it provides a quantitative assessment of the reform for the European agricultural sector: impacts on supply, demand, exports and imports, prices, agricultural incomes, budget costs and welfare. In a third stage, the same exercise performed at the French scale allows us to give first responses to some interrogations raised by the decoupling of the income support policy.

40|$|Direct {{payments}} are recurring non-market transfers to farmers {{whether they are}} production related or not. There are three main types: (a) compensatory allowances (headage), (b) premia and (c) agri-environmental payments. In 1998 total payments amounted to £ 967. 3 million, up from £ 158. 4 million in 1992. The objectives {{of this study were}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these payments in maintaining farm units, their implications for farm efficiency and competitiveness and their impact on sustaining viable farm units and rural areas. Data from the National Farm Survey shows the average level of payment was £ 6, 670 in 1997 but varied substantially by farm size. For instance, farms over 100 ha on average received £ 28, 207 in contrast with £ 3, 305 for farms between 10 and 20 ha. Similarly, the distribution of payments by different farm systems shows considerable variation with tillage farmers receiving £ 15, 760 and cattle farms receiving less than £ 6, 000. The most significant feature, however, is the extent of the dependency of farm incomes on direct payments. For instance, on tillage and drystock farms these payments represented close to, or even exceeded the family farm income earned. This means that the income from sales are just about sufficient to cover the costs of production; the cheque in the post being the farm income. Without direct payments large segments of the farm population would operate at a loss; a situation which obviously could not be sustained. The impact of direct payments on farm efficiency and competitiveness is not so clear cut. Analysis of 1996 NFS data shows that the response on cattle farms to increased levels of direct payments was to reduce farm output. However, in terms of farm practice the dominant response was to increase stock numbers and farm inputs, such as feed and fertiliser. This latter response can be taken as adjustments to ensure sufficient stock numbers to maximise the level of payments and not necessarily a contradiction of reduced output responses. For instance the dominant anticipated response to a <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> system is a reduction in farm inputs and stock numbers, a response associated with the more progressive sector of farmers. Notwithstanding the present level of these payments it is clear that the viability of farm units on most small to medium-sized drystock farms can not be assured in a farm context only. Increasingly farmers and their spouses are opting for off-farm employment to supplement their household incomes and to sustain the viability of the family farm unit. Ultimately the optimum use of family labour which is marginal or surplus to farm activities, is deployment off the farm; this clearly has a positive influence on the viability of rural areas.

Against this background the Commission has put forward a communication on reform of the common market organisation for olive oil, tobacco and cotton. Reform proposals in the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sectors are aimed at reorienting support to 'reward healthy, high quality products and practices' and to supporting the development of 'alternative sources of income and economic activity'. In order to achieve this the majority of support is to be decoupled from production and integrated into the single farm payment scheme. Since the production of these crops is concentrated in less favoured regions of the EU it is also proposed to strengthen the rural development measures for these regions. For tobacco the existing tobacco premium is to be decoupled over a three-year period alongside a phasing out of the tobacco fund. During this transition period a special fund will be set up under the rural development pillar to support restructuring in tobacco-growing areas. By the end of the reform period more than 70 % of the current tobacco premium will have been converted into the single farm payments and at least 20 % will be deployed as restructuring assistance. In the olive-oil sector the approach is to be modified, for there are concerns that a complete conversion into a single <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> scheme could lead to land abandonment in traditional production areas. For this reason 40 % of payments are to remain linked to production with 60 % being decoupled and incorporated into the single farm payment scheme. In the cotton sector the Commission has proposed to incorporate part of the current support into the single farm payment scheme and to transform the rest into production aid granted as an area payment. Here again only partial decoupling is to occur. Commissioner Fischler noted that a slightly different approach was being adopted in the sugar sector with three options being put forward for further discussion. This follows the approach adopted in the dairy sector and is designed to find an approach which will minimise land abandonment throughout the EU. Further discussion was felt to be necessary since 'the sugar sector is a sensitive and also complicated sector, which has never, until now, been fundamentally reformed'. It is felt that there is therefore a need for a political debate on sugar-sector reform. Commissioner Fischler noted that in the sugar sector it was clear that any reform of the sugar market will have to: bridge the gap between domestic and world market prices; involve a decoupling of support; weigh the pros and cons of the quota system; take into account the international impact of reform. A concise summary of the situation in the raw tobacco, olive oil and cotton sectors, an explanation of how the common organisation of the market works and a summary of the situation on world markets can be found in the Commission memorandum of September 23 rd 2003. Comment: Reform of the EU tobacco regime is likely to exert a downward price on EU tobacco prices, which could affect ACP earnings from tobacco exports. More fundamentally, the facilitation of disengagement of EU farming from tobacco production will intensify pressures to reduce tobacco consumption in the EU, which could result in a shrinking of the EU tobacco market. In the olive oil and cotton sectors only partial decoupling is proposed. This highlights the extent to which the EU is willing to retain coupled farm payments where this is necessary to keep land under production, setting limits on the extent to which the EU can move over to decoupled farm payments. The Commission's cautious approach to sugar-sector reform highlights the sensitivity of this sector within the EU.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the effect of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> on labour supply of Dutch dairy farmers. Data availability leads {{to the fact that we}} can not estimate structural labour supply equations. We show how to derive reduced form equations suitable for policy simulations. We use the panel data sample selection estimation approach Wooldridge (1995) to estimate the off-farm labour supply equation. This method is based on Mundlak¿s (1978) linear panel data estimation approach, which we us to estimate the on-farm labour supply equations. Even though, simulations show a significant negative effect of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> on labour supply, the economic significance of this effect is very limited...|$|R
30|$|To {{test whether}} <b>decoupled</b> subsidy <b>payments</b> {{increase}} income risk on farms, we model income variability over 9  years for 927 farms in Ireland. This model supports {{the argument that}} <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and market income risk are closely and positively related. Even after correcting for individual level time trends {{and a variety of}} farm characteristics, these results remain robust. The positive relationship between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and income risk in Irish farms is similar to the payments and risk relationship found by Enjolras et al. (2014) for Italian farms. The small farm sizes and relatively large payment levels in both Italy and Ireland contribute to their similar risk patterns. This model also paints a picture of Irish farms that are likely to have highly variable incomes. These farms are likely to be large dairy farms with large outputs in addition to large and increasing subsidy payments and lower stocking rates.|$|R
