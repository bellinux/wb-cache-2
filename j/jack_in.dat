5000|$|The {{appearance}} of [...] "Jack" [...] as a surname {{is much less}} frequent than its use as a male given name. In 1990, in the United States, this surname is shared by about 0.007% of the population, though the geographical distribution of the surname has been broad since at least 1840, at which {{time there was a}} modest concentration of <b>Jacks</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania. In the late 19th century, the geographic distribution of <b>Jacks</b> <b>in</b> England was also broad, with concentration in North East England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and southern North West England. In 1891, the highest concentration of <b>Jacks</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom appeared in Scotland. The surname is considered almost exclusively Scottish.|$|R

5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South Africa {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South Africa Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union <b>Jack</b> <b>in</b> the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union <b>Jack</b> <b>in</b> the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras.

The flag included the Union <b>Jack</b> <b>in</b> the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use.
