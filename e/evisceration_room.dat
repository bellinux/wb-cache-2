50|$|Further Processing plants {{carry out}} {{operations}} such as cutting and deboning.Previously the conveyor belts carrying live chickens generally ran at {{a maximum of}} 140 chickens per minute, but the maximum speed has been increased to 175 birds/minute. Once the dead birds arrive in the <b>evisceration</b> <b>room</b> (usually dropped down a chute after the feet are removed), they are hung again on shackles {{much the same way}} as they were when they were alive.|$|E
40|$|A study {{concerning}} the technical validity of two control methods of cleaning and decontamination in Batna’s poultry slaughterhouse has been realized to verify their reliability. The first method {{is based on}} the counting of total germ colonies (cfu) thanks to petri dish (Rodac PCA®) used on different surfaces of the slaughterhouse sectors (quay of reception, slaughtering room, <b>evisceration</b> <b>room,</b> meats …) after decontamination. The second method (Kit PRO 3 S®) permits to put in evidence the presence of dirty on a visibly clean surface; it {{is based on the}} detection of proteins (µg/test) on the different surfaces inside the slaughterhouse (soil, wall, scale, chain, blood tray, drier, carpet…). The results of this experiment showed that there is a positive correlation between the two method...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydophila psittaci causes {{respiratory}} disease in poultry {{and can be}} transmitted to humans. We conducted a C. psittaci zoonotic risk assessment study of a chicken and turkey slaughterhouse. Eighty-five percent of the slaughtered chicken flocks tested positive by PCR and culture. Genotype D was discovered. Fifty-seven percent of the slaughtered turkey flocks tested positive by PCR and culture. Genotype D was present. For the chicken slaughterhouse employees, 7. 5 % and 6 % tested positive for C. psittaci by PCR and culture, respectively. In the turkey slaughterhouse, 87 % and 61 % of the employees tested positive by PCR and culture, respectively. All genotyped human samples contained genotype D. Using stationary bioaerosol monitoring {{by means of an}} MAS- 100 ecosampler and ChlamyTrap collection medium, chlamydial DNA, and viable organisms were detected in both the chicken and turkey slaughterhouses. Positive air samples were most frequently found in the animal reception area and <b>evisceration</b> <b>room.</b> Zoonotic transmissions were very common, especially from processed turkeys. Accurate diagnostic monitoring and reporting of C. psittaci infections should be promoted in poultry workers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Total aerobic bacteria, molds/yeasts, E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae {{in the air}} {{during the}} {{commercial}} production and processing of Japanese quail were enumerated at twelve different sites. Production-related sampling sites included the breeder and grow-out houses along with the hatchery setter, hatcher, egg room and chick room. Processing-related sampling sites included the hanging/stunning area, scalding/defeathering <b>room,</b> <b>evisceration</b> line, chiller exit, further processing area and shipping room. Sampling site {{had a significant effect}} on the log counts for total aerobic bacteria, molds/yeasts, E. coli and 10 Enterobacteriaceae and (P < 0. 0001). Moreover, significant correlation was found between airborne bacteria counts and both environmental temperature and humidity (P < 0. 05). During production, highest counts for total aerobic bacteria (8. 1 log cfu/ml air), molds/yeasts (3. 6 log cfu/ml air), E. coli (1. 9 log cfu/ml air) and 10 10 10 Enterobacteriaceae (2. 3 log cfu/ml air) occurred in the grow-out house.
