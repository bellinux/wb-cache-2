5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> soft material such as feathers or dry grass {{at the end of}} a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.|$|E
5|$|In The Flopsy Bunnies, Benjamin Bunny and {{his cousin}} Flopsy are the parents of six young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies.

While McGregor is distracted, the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse, and the sack filled with rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy. At home, Mr. McGregor proudly presents the sack to his wife, but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual content.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy industry, meanwhile, {{continued}} apace.

Felling Colliery, {{the oldest and most}} extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs. Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964.|$|E

5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E

It is the general mint of all famous lies, which are here like the legends of popery, first coined and stamped in the church.|$|E
5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
5|$|The spoil <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> Writhlington {{colliery}} {{is now the}} Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest, {{which includes}} 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossil specimens have been recovered. The complex geology and narrow seams made coal extraction difficult. Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79separate collieries and annual production was 1,250,000tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties; the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in September 1973. The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and marshalling yards in the town. The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. In recent years, Radstock has increasingly become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a <b>heap</b> <b>of</b> garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E
