5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a <b>discontinuity</b> in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance.

Natural languages vary {{with respect to the}} types of <b>discontinuities</b> that they permit. The fixed word order of English allows for relatively few <b>discontinuities</b> compared to, for instance, the Slavic languages, which are much more permissive. Even compared to a closely related language such as German, English is rigid, allowing few <b>discontinuities.</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{component}} forms {{used to construct}} distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a <b>discontinuity</b> on the transmission line.

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological <b>discontinuity,</b> during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a <b>discontinuity</b> in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The <b>discontinuity</b> can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in the calculation and measurement of the scattering parameters of printed circuit <b>discontinuities.</b> These <b>discontinuities</b> occur in a variety of structures, such as transitions between rectangular waveguide and printed circuits, junctions between circuits of different dielectric constants, and filters and impedance matching circuits. Because of the variety of devices in which these <b>discontinuities</b> occur, it is very useful to understand them in as great a detail as possible. Both theoretical and experimental studies of <b>discontinuities</b> were considered.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} metal joining process. The <b>discontinuities</b> and {{anomalies}} encountered {{in this type of}} welded joint differ from those of a conventional fusion weld. The <b>discontinuities</b> present in FSW are oriented in a different direction due to the unique formation process involved and are dispersed over the welded region widthwise as well as thicknesswise. The process of detection, evaluation, and characterization of these <b>discontinuities</b> is a challenging aspect, as no specific area is identified as a probable zone of <b>discontinuities.</b> In this study, typical <b>discontinuities</b> that are encountered during the FSW process were intentionally induced and then subjected to different types of nondestructive investigation. The methods and techniques adopted were liquid penetrant testing, radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, and eddy current testing. The interaction of these <b>discontinuities</b> and study of their response to different nondestructive testing (NDT) methods/techniques are presented in this paper. The eddy current technique appears to be most effective and simple NDT tool for identifying most of the <b>discontinuities.</b> However, a combination with other methods such as radiography is helpful in characterizing these <b>discontinuities...</b>|$|R
5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of <b>discontinuity</b> to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.
