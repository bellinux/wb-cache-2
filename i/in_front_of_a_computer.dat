25|$|The album's main {{recording}} sessions {{began in}} September 2012, and lasted for approximately four months. The band decided to record songs at Yamaguchi's home studio, {{as the group}} had grown tired of having to return to recording studios often due to their repeated commercial tie-up offers. They originally intended to re-record some parts of songs at a large recording studio, but instead used the home-recorded takes. The band felt that recording at Yamaguchi's home had a different atmosphere, as the location did not come with the pressure of time limits and recording staff, which made these sessions feel less like work. For the Sakanaction album sessions, the band found that they felt free to record any music that they wanted to, and that the location allowed for the band to develop a different sound, as this was the space where Yamaguchi usually listened to music. Yamaguchi described these home sessions as feeling like an after school club, how everyone worked together <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b> In addition to the main recording session, additional recordings were held at Alive Recording Studio in Setagaya and Aobadai Studio in Aobadai, Meguro.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, {{they do not have to}} worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E

Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene.

Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} through several related methods. One approach involves having patients sit <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> screen, on which either stars or triangles are projected simultaneously {{in different areas}} of the screen. [...] Patients are then asked to identify the locations and identities of the shapes. [...] Another similar approach is to project colored letters on the screen, again asking patients to identify the letter and color {{in different parts of the}} screen. [...] From this [...] information, a diagnosis of visual extinction can be attained. [...] A positive diagnosis results from a patient's inability to correctly identify shapes or letters projected simultaneously in {{different areas of the}} screen. However, the most common test for visual extinction is the finger confrontation model. In this test, the doctor asks the patient to note which of his hands have moving fingers. This can be used immediately following a stroke, for the doctorâ€™s quick diagnosis.|$|E
