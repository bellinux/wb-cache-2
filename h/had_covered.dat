5|$|On 30 November 2008, Barrowman exposed himself {{during an}} episode of Radio 1's Switch programme. Although the act was not seen (a show staff member <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the webcam), the BBC and Barrowman {{subsequently}} apologized for any offense caused.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main {{military operations}} ended, he would still get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Burial 195 {{was flooded}} with mud in antiquity. This flood <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> wooden objects that had {{completely}} rotted away {{by the time the}} tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the wooden originals long gone.|$|E

5|$|Many {{other species}} endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's {{ecosystem}} remains heavily damaged. Forests <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the entire island before humans arrived, but very little forestation {{can be seen}} today. Newton's parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues solitaire, the Rodrigues parrot, the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.|$|E
5|$|The new territories which David {{controlled}} were {{a valuable}} supplement to his income and manpower, increasing {{his status as}} one of the most powerful magnates in the Kingdom of the English. Moreover, Matilda's father Waltheof had been Earl of Northumberland, a defunct lordship which <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the far north of England and included Cumberland and Westmorland, Northumberland-proper, as well as overlordship of the bishopric of Durham. After King Henry's death, David would revive the claim to this earldom for his son Henry.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{electrical}} {{lines and}} drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by {{the afternoon of}} October1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead. Overall, {{nearly a third of}} the houses in La Paz were leveled.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Sognsvann Line {{was closed}} {{during the summer}} {{vacations}} due to improvements of the track and third rail. In 2008, the line was closed for approximately one week, due to leaves that <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the tracks. The operation of the line was replaced by buses that served temporary stops in Nordbergveien and Sognsveien. In 2010, a truck was stuck under the train bridge between Holstein and Kringsjå over Carl Kjeldsens vei. The bridge was damaged, and allowed for only one-way-traffic for two weeks. Half the trains had to stop at Berg in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|North-Western Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII.

The command was formed in January 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War, from the western part of Northern Area Command, which <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> all of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Darwin, North-Western Area Command was initially responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Under Wilkes' ownership, the Spirit, which {{previously}} <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> mainly sporting events, {{expanded its}} coverage to include political matters. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Wilkes covered the battles also. He {{was present at}} the First Battle of Bull Run and wrote an account of it. He continued to serve as a correspondent throughout the war and contracted the kidney disease which he later died from during his war journalism. Wilkes also used literary feuds with other newspapers, {{both in and out of}} the sporting press, to help his subscription rates. After the Civil War, Wilkes' Spirit was one of the three leading newspapers in New York City. Two, including the Spirit, of the three were mainly devoted to horse racing– the other being The Turf, Field and Farm by Sanders D. Bruce.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 Joseph Leidy described a Hadrosaurus skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the American Civil War that really fueled the expansion of fossil collection. The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of North America, including the discovery of the Western Interior Sea that <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the Cretaceous, the discovery of several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and the discovery of a number of new dinosaur genera including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. Much of this activity was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, which has become known as the Bone Wars.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E

5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that her parents <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November, the Tripartite Commission, {{consisting}} of representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the ECMM, discussed methods of evacuation {{with representatives of}} the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Médecins Sans Frontières and the Malteser International. On the night of 18/19 November, Rašeta and Croatian Health Minister Andrija Hebrang signed an agreement on the evacuation. The agreement guaranteed that the evacuees would travel via the route Lužac suburb–Bogdanovci–Marinci–Zidine junction–Nuštar–Vinkovci. They were to be handed over to international authorities at the Zidine junction, the hospital was to be placed under the contol of the ICRC and the ECMM was to oversee the entire operation. Hebrang notified the hospital director Vesna Bosanac of the agreement and told her that ICRC teams would arrive. That evening Siniša Glavašević, a radio reporter who <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the entire course of the siege from within the city, broadcast his final report from the hospital. Glavašević himself hoped to leave the city with the ICRC, fearing for his life should the Serb paramilitaries capture him.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{activities}} that became synonymous with Belle Vue was speedway (known {{at the time as}} dirt track racing), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built greyhound racing arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a speedway stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built speedway stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of the Belle Vue Aces, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (Belle Vue Rangers), baseball, stock car racing and tennis. The stadium <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> accommodation for 40,000spectators. As the speedway bikes ran on wood alcohol (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.|$|E

5|$|The 7th (Meerut) Division's 19th Brigade {{consisting}} of the 1st Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders, 28th Punjabis, 92nd Punjabis and 125th Napier's Rifles, with the 1st Guides and 20th Punjabis (21st Brigade) and the 134th Machine Gun Company attached, were formed into two columns {{in front of the}} British wire, each column on a frontage one battalion wide. The initial attack by the 28th and the 92nd Punjabis, under cover of the creeping barrage, was completely successful, and included the capture of a 150mm howitzer battery by five men of the 92nd Punjabis and the 1st Guides. The second attack on the Et Tire defensive line, by the 1st Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders and the 125th Napier's Rifles, met with more opposition but was eventually successful. Subsequently, 40 men from the 125th Napier's Rifles captured 200 soldiers and six machine guns defending the only crossing of the Zerquiye marshes. A second battery of 105mm howitzers behind the captured position and the trenches at Ayun el Basse, from which the German or Ottoman force <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the Zerquiye crossing, was seized by the 1st Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Cold Feet (2000) was {{extended}} {{from six to}} eight episodes by ITV. Bullen believed that the production team <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> all potential storylines {{in the first two}} series, so declined to write any more episodes. A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television, overseen by Bullen as a co-executive producer. Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series, leaving only David Nicholls on staff. The writing process had made Bullen think twice about not writing and he began thinking about further storylines, such as mid-life crises and IVF. The same year, he signed a two-year contract with Granada to develop new projects. A fourth series of Cold Feet, also of eight episodes, was commissioned for 2001. Bullen announced {{that he did not want}} to write a fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. His reasons were that with ITV's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year, the series would become like a soap opera. The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003. The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British <b>had</b> <b>covered</b> the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E
