One specific project goal is to demonstrate how a multidisciplinary approach can be used to detect reservoir compartmentalization. Teamwork is the norm for the petroleum industry. Teams of geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers work together to improve profits through a better understanding of reservoir size, compartmentalization, and orientation as well as reservoir flow characteristics. In this manner, integration of data narrows the uncertainty in reserve estimates and enhances reservoir management decisions. The process of integration has proven to be an iterative process. Integration has helped identify reservoir compartmentalization and reduce the uncertainty in the reserve estimates. The goal during the final phase of the project will be to quantify the value of integration and provide a template for making decisions...|$|E
40|$|A modular {{plastic hinge}} seismic special detail has been {{developed}} for use in steel special moment frames (SMFs). The aim of the special detail design is to dissipate seismic energy through stable yielding of a beam "link" in plastic hinge region. Reliable and repeatable energy dissipation at high ductility is assured through the elimination of weld failure modes, and the mitigation of local buckling and high multi-axis restraint. A casting process is used to configure the modular detail directly to meet these performance objectives. The primary features of the link region are an isolated flange with an integrally cast stiffener and a reduced section isolated web. Two forms of the detail exist: a plastic hinge modular node (PH-MN) and a bolted alternative, the bolted plastic hinge connector (BPHC). The PH-MN, a "node" occupying the entire beam-to-column joint, was used to develop the concept. The PH-MN configuration removes the <b>field</b> <b>weld</b> from the critical cross-section, reduces triaxiality and eliminates through-thickness failure modes at the beam/column interface. The BPHC preserves the primary features of the PH-MN and provides performance at nearly the same efficiency, but, as a replaceable field-bolted component, is significantly more economical, improves modularity, and has certain practical advantages. A design procedure was developed to create a family of modular designs...|$|E

40|$|Fourteen {{years after}} {{completion}} of Ford's 39 -foot space simulation chamber, leaks {{began to appear in}} its LN 2 shroud. Although the shroud had been tight since its acceptance, cracks appeared in 1983 in some of the <b>field</b> <b>welds</b> of the one inch tubes which interconnect the LN 2 panels. The resulting leaks were large enough to prevent pump down to high vacuum and could be heard easily when the chamber was at ambient conditions. New cracks appeared during each thermal cycle making it impossible to utilize the chamber for thermal vacuum testing. The analysis presented here implies that many, if not all, of the aluminum LN 2 shrouds now in use may be in various stages of fatigue failure. The probability is high that fatigue cracks are working through the aluminum tubing in heat-affected zones of some <b>field</b> <b>welds.</b> The cracks may not be apparent yet, but after the shroud has experienced a certain number of thermal cycles these cracks will work through the material and become serious leaks.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} study MIG welding process of {{aluminum}} alloy with longitudinal magnetic field, thermal efficiency with longitudinal magnetic field was analyzed, {{as well as}} softening behavior of heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal were investigated. The results showed that under the action of longitudinal magnetic <b>field,</b> <b>welding</b> current decreased and resultingly total heat input reduced as the exciting current increased, meanwhile at the anode surface current density and heat flux density decrease in the arc core and rise {{at the edge of}} arc, which made arc thermal efficiency increasing and melting efficiency decreasing. As a result of action of the magnetic field, the trend of grain growth of HAZ slowed down and the influence on base metal of heat input decreased. When the exciting current was 20 A, microhardness of HAZ and base metal improved evidently. However, as the exciting current continued to increase, the effect of magnetic field on softening behavior did not change significantly...|$|R
40|$|Although {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) {{has made}} its way to industrial application particularly in the last years, the FSW process, its influences and their strong interactions among themselves are still not thoroughly understood. This lack of understanding mainly arises from the adverse observability of the actual process with phenomena like material flow and deposition, large material deformations and thermomechanical interactions determining the mechanical properties of the weld. To close this gap an appropriate numerical model validated by experiments may be helpful. But because of the issues mentioned above most numerical techniques are not capable of modelling the FSW process. Therefore in this study a Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) approach is used for modelling the whole FSW process. A coupled thermomechanical 3 D FE model is developed with the CEL formulation given in the FE code ABAQUS® V 6. 12.

40|$|Dissimilar metal welds are {{necessary}} in high-pressure subsea systems and {{in cases where}} forged components must be welded to pipelines.
