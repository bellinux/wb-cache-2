5|$|In New York, Michael {{manages to}} talk to Wallace, who has {{seemingly}} been avoiding him, and complains that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> {{that he has to}} drive to New York in order {{to talk to}} him instead of on the phone, and that he deserves more respect after being at Dunder Mifflin for fifteen years. David agrees to fund an anniversary party for him and attend, but Michael abruptly announces his resignation from the company and walks out.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to men.|$|E

5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E

25|$|Many {{animal welfare}} groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> and cruel to animals. They {{argue that the}} chase itself causes fear and {{distress}} and that the fox is not always killed instantly as is claimed. Animal rights campaigners also object to fox hunting, {{on the grounds that}} animals should enjoy some basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).|$|E
25|$|The party {{opposes the}} government's {{naturalisation}} policies, and contends that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for ethnic Bahrainis to compete equally with foreign workers for jobs.

It opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, considering it an act of brutality against the Iraqi people.

25|$|Cattle {{have been}} in {{trespass}} on public lands in southern Nevada {{for more than two}} decades. This <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to the thousands of other ranchers who graze livestock in compliance with federal laws and regulations throughout the West.

An impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is now being conducted as a last resort.|$|E

25|$|The umpires are {{required}} {{to make sure that}} bowlers' and batsmen's footholes are cleaned out and dried whenever necessary to facilitate play. In matches of more than one day's duration, if necessary, the footholes made by the bowler in his delivery stride may be returfed or covered with quick-setting fillings to make them safe and secure. Players may also secure their footholes using sawdust provided that the pitch is not damaged or they do not do so in a way that <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to the other team.|$|E
25|$|A bowler may {{attempt to}} run out a batsman who leaves his ground before he {{delivers}} the ball, but must do so before he reaches the point in his action when he would normally release the ball. It <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for batsmen to attempt to steal runs during the bowler's run-up. If they try the umpires will allow the bowler to attempt a run out. Should the bowler not attempt a run out then the umpires will call dead ball, return the batsmen to their previous ends and award a 5 run penalty to the fielding side.|$|E
25|$|Tax Exemption for Minimum Wage Earners – He {{has filed}} Senate Bill No. 103 (Individual Tax Exemption for Minimum Wage Earners Bill) to exempt minimum wage earners {{in the private}} sector and {{government}} workers in Salary Grades 1 to 3, amending certain provisions of Republic Act No. 8424, otherwise known as the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. As per estimates by the National Wages and Productivity Board, there are 7 million workers earning the minimum wage and even below. For him, it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> and unjust that the government, under the law, is taking away a portion of their already subsistence-level income.|$|E

25|$|The bowling of fast short pitched {{balls and}} of high full pitched balls is {{dangerous}} {{and is also}} considered unfair. Where the umpire considers that there are regular fast short pitched balls, that by their length, height and direction, coupled with the relative skill of the batsman is dangerous, the umpire calls no ball and cautions the bowler. If this happens a second time in an innings, the bowler is barred from bowling again in that innings, also is reported to the authorities he is responsible to for further disciplinary action. Where a delivery, after pitching, passes {{over the head of}} the striker, the umpire calls no ball and includes it in his consideration of whether fast short pitched bowling <b>is</b> <b>unfair,</b> even though such a delivery is not dangerous.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{constant}} public debate about tracking students by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming <b>is</b> <b>unfair,</b> that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with economic analyst and commentator Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel, June 26, 2007, in speaking of income tax resistance, Paul said that he supports the right of those who engage in nonviolent resistance when they believe a law is unjust, bringing up the names of Martin Luther King, Jr., Lysander Spooner, and Mahatma Gandhi as examples of practitioners of peaceful civil disobedience; but he cautioned that those who do {{should be aware that}} the consequences could be imprisonment. He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law <b>is</b> <b>unfair.</b> However, he said that he prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E

25|$|A {{particularly}} prominent {{criticism of}} strong reciprocity {{theory is that}} it does not correspond to behavior found in the actual environment. In particular, the existence of third party punishment in the field is called into question. Some have responded to this criticism by pointing out that if effective, third party punishment will rarely be used, and will therefore be difficult to observe. Others have suggested that there is evidence of third party costly punishment in the field. Critics have responded to these claims by arguing that it <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for proponents to argue that both a demonstration of costly third party punishment as well as a lack of costly third party punishment are both evidence of its existence. They also question whether the ethnographic evidence presented is costly third party punishment, and call for additional analysis of the costs and benefits of the punishment. Other research has shown that different types of strong reciprocity do not predict other types of strong reciprocity within individuals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} Legend of Atrahasis, Enlil, {{the king of}} the gods, sets out to {{eliminate}} humanity, whose noise is disturbing his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother's plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods, except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, Enlil convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell humankind that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day Deluge, the flood hero frees a swallow, a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This {{is one of the oldest}} of the surviving Middle Eastern Deluge myths.|$|E
