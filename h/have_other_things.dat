Let us stop the slaughter, and let their people and our people live in peace.|$|E
500|$|In June 1958 Monteux {{conducted}} the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in three concerts, {{described by the}} orchestra's historian Richard Morrison as [...] "a sensation with players, press and public alike." [...] The first concert included Elgar's Enigma Variations, in which Cardus judged Monteux to be more faithful to Elgar's conception than English conductors generally were. Cardus added, [...] "After {{the performance of the}} 'Enigma' Variations, the large audience cheered and clapped Monteux for several minutes. This applause, moreover, broke out just before the interval. English audiences are not as a rule inclined to waste time applauding at or during an interval: they usually <b>have</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to do." [...] Monteux considered British concertgoers [...] "the most attentive in the world", and British music critics [...] "the most intelligent". However, a disadvantage of conducting a London orchestra was having to perform at the Festival Hall, of which he shared with Beecham and other conductors an intense dislike: [...] "from the conductor's rostrum it is impossible to hear the violins".|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2008 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gibbard laughed off suggestions that The Postal Service's long overdue follow-up to their 2003 hit Give Up {{would be an}} indie version of the Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy, which took 15 years to produce and release. Gibbard said that both he and Tamborello do not {{see it as a}} priority in light of their main projects, Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel, respectively. He said, [...] "The anticipation of the second record has been a far bigger deal for everybody except the two of us... I don't know about it being the indie-rock Chinese Democracy, but now that Chinese Democracy has come out, I guess it just becomes the second Postal Service record that will never come out. There never really was a plan to do a second album. We work from time to time together but we <b>have</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that take up all of our time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 25 November 2016, Deep Purple {{announced}} Infinite as {{the title}} of their twentieth studio album, which was released on 7 April 2017. In support for the album, Deep Purple embarked on 13 May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania on The Long Goodbye Tour due to end on 15 December 2017 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the time of the tour's announcement in December 2016, Paice told the Heavyworlds website it [...] "may be the last big tour", adding that the band [...] "don't know". He described the tour as being long in duration, and said: [...] "We haven't made any hard, fast plans, but it becomes obvious that you cannot tour the same way you did when you were 21. It becomes more and more difficult. People <b>have</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in their lives, which take time. But never say never." [...] On 3 February 2017, Deep Purple released a video version of [...] "Time for Bedlam", the first track taken from the new album and the first new Deep Purple track for almost four years.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they <b>have</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
