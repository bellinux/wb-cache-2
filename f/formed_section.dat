500|$|Nivelle {{moved the}} GQG {{headquarters}} forward to Beauvais in Picardy on 10 January and to Compiègne in Oise on 4 April. [...] At this stage the GQG staff numbered 450 officers and 800 enlisted personnel. [...] However, {{the failure of}} the Nivelle Offensive of April 1917 led to his downfall and replacement by General Philippe Pétain on 17 May. [...] Pétain expanded GQG's operations, establishing a new Section for Relations with the Civil Authorities and a Bureau for Aeronatics, Telegraphy and Aviation. [...] He later reformed the Second Bureau, absorbing into it the newly <b>formed</b> <b>section</b> for relations with the civil authorities and a new responsibility for cryptography. [...] A minor change in February 1918 saw the expansion of the Third Bureau, gaining telegraphy and liaison from the Bureau for Aeronautics and cryptography from the Bureau for Special Services. [...] In March the Bureau for Aeronautics gained control of anti-aircraft matters and the army medical departments under their own Bureau of Health Services. [...] This organisation would last until after the armistice with Germany in 1918.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{box section}} {{comprised}} two 9.8-metre wide dual lane traffic tubes and a 1.35 metres wide twin walled central tube for services and emergency access. The 1.2-metre thick base slab was cast first, {{followed by the}} 50cm thick central walls.

[...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel walers.|$|E

50|$|Next {{thorough}} {{reorganization of}} the Defence Staff occurred in 1961. An operation management (OPL 1 for studies, OPL 2 for war planning and OPL 3 for preparedness and exercises), four sections, one administrative and information department and a staff welfare bureau was <b>formed.</b> <b>Section</b> 1 comprised four departments, public, communication, military signals and quartermaster department, section 2 three departments: attaché, intelligence and interior department, section 3 two departments: the press and film and war history department, section 4 budget detail and two departments, research - and the planning department. An EDP office in section 1 was established in 1965 (later the EDP department). In 1968 the Total Defense Signal Security Department (Totalförsvarets signalskyddsavdelning) was added (formerly the National Signal Security Commission (Statens signalskyddsnämnd)).|$|E

5000|$|Waddams {{was one of}} the {{original}} sixteen townships. Michael Lawver was its first supervisor. Some of the areas earliest settlers lived {{in the vicinity of the}} newly <b>formed</b> <b>section.</b> The first settlers in the township were Levi Robey and his wife Almira (Waite). He claimed about one half of a section of land in the northwest part of the township. He first arrived in the county with his parents and siblings at Brewster's Ferry in November 1834. After making his claim he proceeded to build a double log cabin on the west side of the river. He cut logs for the cabin on the east side of the river and then pulled them across the frozen river by horse. The family moved into their new home on Valentine's Day of 1835 and lived there for twenty years. The site of his first cabin is at the foot of a hill at the present Robert Kleckler Farm on North Stubbe Road. He later built a new house ½ mile southwest of the first. That house still stands at the northwest corner of Fisher and North Stubbe Roads. When he settled in the area in 1835 his only white neighbors were his family at Brewster's Ferry, William Waddams and John Dixon (living at the present site of Dixon, IL). Also a man named Kent who lived in the area that is now Rockford, Illinois, and a man named [...] "Mack" [...] who married an Indian woman and lived at the mouth of the Pecatonica River.|$|E
50|$|When the {{exhibition}} is over, the organiser Emma Gad wins a Royal medal for her work. Gad is in retrospect mostly famous in Denmark for her book ‘Tact and Tone’ on correct bourgeois behavior and interaction. In the preface, she lays out one key rule for human interaction: to act with a good heart. As Frank Larsen (not without sarcasm) notes: {{it is unclear how}} her good heart played a role when having two kids taken away from their families, sent across the ocean, to be put in a cave for others to look at, and harassed when walking through the city to and from {{the exhibition}}. However, Cornelins earns a place at a school for children without parents, Vajsenhuset, after the exhibition and after settling and performing well in school he is also allowed to attend teacher college after finishing secondary school. It is at this time Denmark sells the islands to the USA during WWI. The Americans are afraid that the enemy can use the islands as a base close to their border, so USA wants to get in control of the islands. There are discussions internally in Denmark whether Cornelins can stay or not which ends in Cornelins favour. He wants to stay and ends up doing so. After graduating from the Jonstrup Teacher College, Cornelins begins his 55-year teaching career at the island of Lolland, where he used to spend many of his summer holidays after arriving in Denmark. While life in the Copenhagen area was initially tough at his first caretaker mother, he has precious memories of his Lolland summer holidays at Lønstrupgård. On the island of Lolland he becomes a well known public figure and later also nationally known in radio shows with artists and intellectuals. He teaches at Nakskov Public school where he also becomes a deputy inspector and in addition he also leads the city’s music school. During cancer treatment at Nakskov hospital after retiring, Cornelins picks up his harmonica and involves doctors and nurses in singing and dancing. This leads to the establishment of a White Choir. At his death bed in 1985 he hands over his harmonica to a former student, Ellis Nielsen, who continues the White Choir, and the idea spreads to other cities in the region where several other hospital choirs are <b>formed</b> (<b>Section</b> above extracted and summarised from Birgit Freiesleben, 1998, and Alex Frank Larsen, 2008).|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} an overview of the paper machine with focus on the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> is the first part in the paper machine where the paper pulp is injected through a head box. The paper pulp contains about 99. 5 % of water and 0. 5 % fiber. The water as content is reduced by vacuum and gravity. The problem to be studied in this project is related to external rewetting. This is water going back to the paper web from the forming fabric after the dewatering zone. The dewatering is based on vacuum slots under the forming fabric. The vacuum slots absorb water from the soaked paper pulp through the forming fabric. External rewetting causes problem, hence the paper will have a higher dry content when leaving the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The paper should have as low dry content as possible in the end of the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> Three different <b>forming</b> fabrics from Albany International were chosen for the project. The structures of the forming fabrics were two different double layers and one plain weave. The performance of the fabrics was studied by 4 different methods. The methods used were 2 different wicking tests, a vacuum dewatering trial and one foulard test. Also micro tomography was done to understand the structure of each design. The main test was a foulard test where the aim was to see in what way the rewetting got affected by different pores sizes. The results showed higher water content for the paper that was on top of the forming fabric with the larger pores...|$|R
30|$|Both fiber {{orientation}} and fiber flocculation are characteristic fluid dynamical phenomena of fiber suspension flows at low {{concentrations in the}} headbox and the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The main purpose of a headbox {{is to create a}} thin and even jet which then enters the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> In the headbox, the suspension is mixed in the turbulence generator and then accelerated in the contracting slice channel. After the slice opening, the jet enters into free air and hits the moving fabrics called “wires”, where the water removal and the formation of the fiber network are initiated. Subsequent water removal processes by pressing and drying make paper more solid, but the basic fibrous structure of paper does not change noticeably.|$|R
