50|$|BU cars is {{the generic}} term for BRT <b>elevated</b> <b>gate</b> cars used on {{predecessor}} {{lines of the}} New York City Subway system. Many of the cars were built by the Jewett Car Company and the Laconia Car Company.|$|R

50|$|After BMT {{service on}} the joint IRT-BMT Flushing Line ended in 1949, the Q-types were {{refitted}} for operation of the IRT Third Avenue Line in Manhattan. After the latter line closed in 1955, the Q-types were refitted again to operate on the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line in 1958 to replace the last <b>elevated</b> <b>gate</b> cars in passenger service. When {{the lower part of}} the Myrtle Avenue Line closed in 1969, the Q-types were finally retired. The oldest of the cars were in revenue service for 66 years, currently the longest such service life in New York City rapid transit operations.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{model of}} a Schottky-barrier carbon {{nanotube}} field- effect transistor (CNT-FET), with ferromagnetic contacts, has been developed. The emphasis is put on analysis of current-voltage characteristics as well as shot (and thermal) noise.

50|$|This {{elevated}} {{station was}} originally built on May 30, 1893 by the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad {{as the first}} station to be built along the Cypress Hills extension of the Lexington Avenue Elevated line, which was also shared by the Broadway <b>Elevated</b> east of <b>Gates</b> Avenue. The station has been exclusively for the Jamaica Line since 1950.|$|R
50|$|The {{conversion}} {{was done}} {{in order to create}} a fleet of elevated cars with automatic door controls capable of operating on the BMT Fulton Street Line, whose station platforms had been redone to accommodate 10 ft-wide equipment instead of the standard 8 ft-wide <b>elevated</b> cars. The <b>gates</b> and platforms at the ends of each three-car unit were enclosed and a motorman's cab placed in each.|$|R
50|$|The bump gate {{self-closing}} mechanism {{consists of}} two cables mounted on the gate, and also on an <b>elevated</b> crossbar. The <b>gate</b> does not swing on a conventional hinge. Instead it is fastened to cylinders that encircle a post. When the gate swings open, the swivel action causes the cables to raise the gate slightly. After the vehicle passes through, gravity causes the gate to swing like a pendulum (parallel to the ground) until it settles in the closed position.|$|R
25|$|On April 10, 1888, the Union Elevated {{opened the}} first piece of the Myrtle Avenue Elevated, from Adams Street at City Hall east over Myrtle Avenue to Grand Avenue, where it junctioned with the Brooklyn Elevated. The company {{operated}} through {{to the end of the}} Brooklyn Elevated at Van Siclen Avenue. Another branch operated by the Union Elevated, the Broadway <b>Elevated</b> from <b>Gates</b> Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, opened on June 25, 1888. This was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888. The Myrtle Avenue Elevated was extended north over Adams Street to Sands Street at the Brooklyn Bridge on September 1, 1888, and the Union Elevated began running between Sands Street and Van Siclen Avenue. The Union Elevated opened the Hudson Avenue Elevated, a branch of the Brooklyn Elevated from the intersection of Hudson and Park Avenues south to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal, on November 5, 1888, and began operating between Fulton Ferry and Flatbush Avenue.|$|R
60|$|From {{the shore}} {{we went up}} into the town, which is handsome, and of a cheerful aspect, with streets {{generally}} wide and well paved,--a cleanly town, not smoke-begrimed. The houses, if not modern, are, at least with few exceptions, new fronted. We saw one relic of antiquity,--a fine mediaeval gateway across the principal street, much more <b>elevated</b> than the <b>gates</b> of Chester, with battlements at the top, and a spacious apartment over the great arch for the passage of carriages, and the smaller {{one on each side}} for foot-passengers. There were two statues in armor or antique costume on the hither side of the gateway, and two old paintings on the other. This, so far as I know, is the only remnant of the old wall of Southampton.|$|R
40|$|ThemucolipinTRP (TRPML) {{proteins}} are {{a family}} of endolyso-somal cation channels with genetically established importance in humans and rodent. Mutations of human TRPML 1 cause type IV mucolipidosis, a devastating pediatric neurodegenerative disease. Our recent electrophysiological studies revealed that, although a TRPML 1 -mediated current canonlybe recorded in late endosome and lysosome (LEL) using the lysosome patch clamp technique, a proline substitution in TRPML 1 (TRPML 1 V 432 P) results in a large whole cell current. Thus, it remains unknown whether the large TRPML 1 V 432 P-mediated current results froman increased surface expression (trafficking), <b>elevated</b> channel activity (<b>gating),</b> or both. Here we performed systemic Pro substitutions in a region previ-ously implicated in the gating of various 6 transmembrane cation channels.

50|$|Though {{named for}} Jerome Avenue, the southernmost {{portion of the}} line runs {{underground}} beneath the Grand Concourse. North of the 149th Street station around the vicinity of Franz Sigel Park, the line curves to the northwest and emerges from a tunnel under Gerard Avenue north of East 153rd Street, and becomes an elevated line over River Avenue {{just south of the}} intersection with East 157th Street. Just north of Yankee Stadium station, the line encounters the skeletal remains of the IRT Ninth Avenue <b>elevated</b> line between <b>Gate</b> Number 8 and the east end of the 164th Street Parking Garage, between the intersections of 162nd and 164th Streets. Almost a block after 167th Street station, the line finally runs over the eponymous road when River Avenue ends at Jerome Avenue across from the intersection of West 169th Street.|$|R

Here we performed systemic Pro substitutions in a region previously implicated in the gating of various 6 transmembrane cation channels. We found that several Pro substitutions displayed gain-of-function (GOF) constitutive activities at both the plasma membrane (PM) and endolysosomal membranes. Although wild-type TRPML 1 and non-GOF Pro substitutions localized exclusively in LEL and were barely detectable in the PM, the GOF mutations with high constitutive activities were not restricted to LEL compartments, and most significantly, exhibited significant surface expression. Because lysosomal exocytosis is Ca 2 +-dependent, constitutive Ca 2 + permeability due to Pro substitutions may have resulted in stimulus-independent intralysosomal Ca 2 + release, hence the surface expression and whole cell current of TRPML 1. Indeed, surface staining of lysosome-associated membrane protein- 1 (Lamp- 1) was dramatically increased in cells expressing GOF TRPML 1 channels. We conclude that TRPML 1 is an inwardly rectifying, proton-impermeable, Ca 2 + and Fe 2 +/Mn 2 + dually permeable cation channel that may be gated by unidentified cellular mechanisms through a conformational change in the cytoplasmic face of the transmembrane 5 (TM 5). Furthermore, activation of TRPML 1 in LEL {{may lead to the}} appearance of TRPML 1 proteins at the PM...|$|R
