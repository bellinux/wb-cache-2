5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim dialect shows maximum {{divergence}} {{from the}} literary Standard Dialect of Malayalam. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> influenced by Arabic and Urdu {{rather than by}} Sanskrit or by English. The retroflex continuant zha of the literary dialect is realised in the Muslim dialect as the palatal ya.|$|E
25|$|Cheng Yu {{researched}} the old Tang Dynasty five-stringed pipa {{in the early}} 2000s and developed a modern version of it for contemporary use. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{the same as the}} modern pipa in construction save for being a bit wider to allow for the extra string and the reintroduction of the soundholes at the front. It has not caught on in China but in Korea (where she also did some of her research at) the bipa was revived since then and the current versions are based on Chinese pipa, including one with five-strings.|$|E

6000|$|... "You? Liberal?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the old Zilla. [...] "Why, George Babbitt, you're {{about as}} broad-minded and liberal as a razor-blade!" ...|$|R
60|$|Bob still {{remained}} at his post, or, more correctly speaking, the halter, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{against his will}} that he did so.|$|R
25|$|Lacrosse in Australia {{is a minor}} sport, with a {{long and}} proud history dating back to 1876, with a small but {{dedicated}} community of participants and volunteers. The established centres for the game are in the greater metropolitan areas of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. In these cities there are organised weekend field lacrosse competitions {{for men and women}} at senior and junior levels, played over the winter months (April until September). In the off-season, there are informal box lacrosse and sofcrosse competitions, though the majority of players in Australia are mostly of the field lacrosse type. Some lacrosse is also played in Sydney, Newcastle, South East Queensland, Townsville, Cairns and Hobart, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at the developmental level.|$|E
25|$|The Toyota 86 Shooting Brake Concept was {{displayed}} in Sydney, Australia in 2016. Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay {{model of the}} car {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{described}} {{writing the}} book as [...] "tremendous fun" [...] and a [...] "once in a lifetime challenge", but {{admitted that he had}} to take it [...] "really, really seriously." [...] After completing the writing process, Boyd commented that he did not [...] "attempt to write a pastiche Fleming novel... it's my own voice; I'm dealing with things and subjects I am interested in... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> my novel; it just features these characters invented by Fleming.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} the clock and jumped up. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> later than I had thought. She gave me her hands a little wistfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you saw it}} in {{the papers}} at all, depend upon <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> exaggerated!" [...] he {{answered}} quietly. [...] "Your father received my letter, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing bad. Some {{people would}} say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to your credit." [...] She looked away across the fields. [...] "I told her you were a vegetarian," [...] she added, carelessly.|$|R
500|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a {{minority}} view, three prominent twentieth-century masters claimed that White's advantage should {{or may be}} decisive with best play. Weaver Adams, {{then one of the}} leading American masters, was the best-known proponent of this view, which he introduced in his 1939 book White to Play and Win, and continued to expound in later books and articles until shortly before his death in 1963. Adams opined that 1.e4 was White's strongest move, and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter, [...] "White ought to win." [...] Adams' claim was widely ridiculed, and he did not succeed in demonstrating the validity of his theory in tournament and match practice. The year after his book was published, at the finals of the 1940 U.S. Open tournament, he scored only one draw in his four games as White, but won all four of his games as Black. Adams also lost a match to IM I.A. Horowitz, who took the black pieces in every game.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics are}} about the birth of Madonna's {{daughter}} Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In {{an interview with the}} Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: [...] "There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing {{that at the end of}} the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'." [...] Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was about confronting the past, [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] conversely is about [...] "moving onward." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] {{is another}} song {{in which the}} meaning was {{originally}} very vague. At first listening, {{it appears that the}} song is about going home, but this is not true. Collins has stated that the song lyrics refer to a patient in a mental institution, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> based on the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Peter Gabriel, Helen Terry, and Sting all provide backing vocals. The music video (shot during the NJR tour) features Collins in multiple cities around the world, including London, New York City, Tokyo, Moscow, Sydney, Paris, St. Louis, Los Angeles (Hollywood), San Francisco, and Memphis (Graceland). At the end of the music video, Collins arrives home and hears a woman (presumably his wife) from inside the house asking him where he has been. He replies by saying he has been to some of the cities mentioned above. The woman replies [...] "You've been down at the pub, haven't you?", as Collins grins at the camera.|$|E
50|$|Semere {{was another}} village, which, {{at the time}} of William the Conqueror was {{approximately}} the same size as Dickleburgh. By 1736 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> insubordinate, and now only exists in local street names.|$|R
60|$|No {{one seemed}} {{disposed}} {{to take advantage}} of this very generous offer; now that his particular portion of the work had <b>been</b> done, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as if every one save Isaac ignored him.|$|R
30|$|The [tax] system sort of functioned, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{extremely}} hard to use. So it wasn’t easy: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> expensive {{for people to}} comply, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a one-size-fits-all approach. It wasn’t a very personalized approach.|$|R
500|$|According to {{the musical}} scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his {{well-known}} bon mot about Saint-Saëns, [...] "He knows everything, but lacks inexperience" [...] ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience"). The winner, Victor Sieg, {{had a career}} no more notable {{than that of the}} 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may [...] "have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency". The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, [...] "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> better off when it does." [...] The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was [...] "a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul". The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as [...] "Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius", and [...] "Bad music well written".|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{academic}} and journalist John Lloyd, responding in 2007, Dacre is currently the only [...] "British newspaper editor who stamps himself on his newspaper every morning" [...] reflecting [...] "his unique blend of libertarian-authoritarian Conservatism". According to Roy Greenslade in The Guardian: [...] "The Mail is a rare national newspaper {{in that it is}} the embodiment of the values and views of its editor rather than its proprietor. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> Paul Dacre's paper". Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere is [...] "unlike almost every other owner, he is genuinely hands off".|$|E
2500|$|During {{interviews}} {{with one of}} her official fansites, Lopez also revealed that fans could expect a mixture of musical styles like her previous albums. [...] "Expect pop records, R and a little hip hop." [...] When Billboard previewed the album in January 2010, Ben-Yehuda Ayala said [...] "Lopez sings, talk-sings and broods (within pop reason) on the subject of love," [...] while Rap-Up said <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in keeping with the title, [...] "a love roller coaster, taking you through {{the ups and downs of}} a relationship." [...] Following her move to Island Def Jam, Lopez said she would still be pressing ahead with the album under the title Love?. [...] "I just feel like it's an endlessly fascinating topic that all my albums have been about. It's still very confusing to me and so I explore that on this album, probably more than my other albums." [...] She also revealed that her husband Marc Anthony initially disapproved of the title because he felt that it may imply that the couple were having marital problems. However in {{interviews with}} DJ Skee, she said [...] "love has always been a theme of my career and this record wasn't going to be different. The album has a lot of up-tempo, dancy, urban tracks." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} hailed by {{international}} critics {{as a success}} by a major new talent. Many Italian critics thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a Pasolini film, although Bertolucci made {{a conscious effort to}} create a distinct individual style.|$|R
50|$|THR {{experienced}} considerable {{difficulty with}} their suppliers during {{the coming months}} despite the public declarations by the newly formed Rolls-Royce Motors (of which the Diesel Division and THR <b>were</b> associated) that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alive and well.|$|R
50|$|Though {{most of the}} {{township}} was originally middle class in character by the early 20th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a working class district. The housing conditions were described in 1931 by the Manchester and District Social Survey Society.|$|R
2500|$|Terry Jones – who co-directed the {{original}} film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005: [...] "Spamalot is utterly pointless. It's full of air…Regurgitating Python is not high {{on my list}} of priorities." [...] However, when asked whether he liked Spamalot during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM The Bone shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, [...] "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun. [...] It's great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. [...] It isn’t really 'Python.' <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> Eric." [...] Jones went on to say, [...] "...I think {{the best parts of}} the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious! That {{is one of the great}} moments where the show really comes alive for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because the Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College (a public {{institution}} formed in 1866) {{was created by}} the state legislature after it took advantage of the federal Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862, the first male undergraduates at the new University of California were required to serve two hours per week for four years being trained in tactics, dismounted drill, marksmanship, camp duty, military engineering, and fortifications. In exchange for California's share of , North Hall, which no longer exists, housed an armory. In 1904, the service requirement was dropped to two years, and in 1917, Cal's ROTC was established more or less as it exists today with ROTC programs for the four main branches of the military. The university president's report from 1902 states that [...] "The University Cadets from last year numbered no less than 866. Appointments as second lieutenants in the regular army have been conferred upon several men who have distinguished themselves as officers in the University Cadets. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to be hoped that the War Department will establish permanently the policy of offering such appointments to the graduates of each year who show the highest ability in military pursuits." [...] Commander Chester W. Nimitz established the Naval ROTC at Cal in the fall of 1926. Transferred in June 1929, Captain Nimitz left a unit of 150 midshipmen enrolled with a staff of six commissioned and six petty officers.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016, Sony {{shifted the}} film's release date from July 28 to July 7, 2017, {{and said the}} film would be {{digitally}} remastered for IMAX 3D in post-production. J. K. Simmons expressed interest in reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker. The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear, and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover. He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with [...] "good faith" [...] in order [...] "to have more toys to play with as we put together a story", and that [...] "the agreement was that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in , and then working {{right now on the}} script and soon to be shooting". Sony Pictures chairman Thomas Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel. At CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming, a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character [...] "coming home" [...] to Marvel and the MCU. Tony Revolori and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's, and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark. Watts noted that Stark [...] "was always a part of" [...] the films' story because of his interactions with Parker in Civil War.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{walked around}} the room a few minutes, looking at the various things; and at last Rollo spied another little wheelbarrow, on a shelf. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{like the one at}} the door, only <b>it</b> <b>was</b> painted green.|$|R
60|$|She flashed back a {{smile of}} {{acknowledgment}} that included Smoke. He caught a feeling of chumminess, though {{at the same time}} he was bitingly aware that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> of a woman who embraced him in that comradely smile.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{the club was}} {{politically}} aligned to the Conservatives, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> formed at the outset for dissident Tories out of favour with the Carlton Club, and its membership contained numerous rebellious MPs and activists during its history.|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S. Ginell stated [...] "Not only was this Getz's most adventurous session since Focus {{and the first}} few bossa nova records, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> out of {{character}} for Boland, who usually played it safer than this".|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> anti-Cold War {{on foreign}} policy, {{and called for}} the end of the Marshall Plan and nuclear weapons, as well as friendship with the Soviets and support for Israel.
