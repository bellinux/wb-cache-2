Generally there is no unique method or approach for image segmentation. Clustering is a powerful technique that has been reached in image segmentation. The cluster analysis is to partition an image data set into a number of disjoint groups or clusters. The clustering methods such as k means, improved k mean, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>c</b> mean (FCM) and improved <b>fuzzy</b> <b>c</b> mean algorithm (IFCM) have been proposed. K means clustering is one of the popular method because of its simplicity and computational efficiency. The number of iterations will be reduced in improved K compare to conventional K means. FCM algorithm has additional flexibility for the pixels to belong to multiple classes with varying degrees of membership. Demerit of conventional FCM is time consuming which is overcome by improved FCM. The experimental results exemplify that the proposed algorithms yields segmented gray scale image of perfect accuracy and the required computer time reasonable and also reveal the improved <b>fuzzy</b> <b>c</b> mean achieve better segmentation compare to others.

In the first stage the ants cluster data to initially create raw clusters which are refined using the <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>C</b> Means algorithm. Initially, the ants move the individual objects to form heaps. The centroids of these heaps are redefined by the <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>C</b> Means algorithm. In the second stage the objects obtained from the <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>C</b> Means algorithm are hardened according to the maximum membership criteria to form new heaps. These new heaps are then moved by the ants. The final clusters formed are refined by using the <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>C</b> Means algorithm. Results from experiments with 13 datasets show that the partitions produced are competitive with those from FCM. The second algorithm, Fuzzy ant clustering with centroids, is also a two stage algorithm, it requires an initial knowledge of the number of clusters in the data. In the first stage of the algorithm ants move the cluster centers in feature space. The cluster centers found by the ants are evaluated using a reformulated <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>C</b> Means criterion. In the second stage the best cluster centers found are used as the initial cluster centers for the <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>C</b> Means algorithm.

Hard C Means was also used in the second stage and the partitions from the ant algorithm are better than from randomly initialized Hard C Means. The Fuzzy Ants algorithm is a novel method to find the number of clusters in the data and also provides good initializations for the FCM and HCM algorithms.

The {{quality of}} underwater images is {{directly affected by}} water medium, atmosphere, pressure and temperature. This emphasizes the necessity of image segmentation, which divides an image into parts that have strong correlations with objects to reflect the actual information collected from the real world. Image segmentation is the most practical approach among virtually all automated image recognition systems. Clustering of numerical data forms the basis of many classification and system modelling algorithms. The purpose of clustering is to identify natural groupings of data from a large data set to produce a concise representation of a system's behaviour. In this paper we propose <b>fuzzy</b> <b>c</b> means clustering method with thresholding for underwater image segmentation. This paper focuses on comparison of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>c</b> means clustering algorithms with proposed method for underwater images.
