5000|$|MM.106: Semi-dwarfing — Sometimes {{referred}} to as semi-vigorous, {{this is the most}} widely used of rootstocks. It is probably the best choice for the average garden under average conditions, being tolerant {{of a wide range of}} soils, and producing a tree with an eventual size of 12 to 18 ft. Trees on this stock begin producing fruit within three to four years, and yield 90 to 110 lb after some seven or eight years. MM106 is very suitable for use with weaker varieties that would produce undersized bushes with more dwarfing rootstocks. Can be trained as a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> <b>tree,</b> but is rather too vigorous for cordons unless the soil is poor. Requires staking for the first four or five years or so of its life. Trees on MM.106 are highly susceptible to collar rot especially when planted in soils that remain wet(poor percolation).|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of tree adjunct grammars is {{examined}} which was first introduced in (Joshi et al., 1975). Termed extended tree adjunct grammars, they provide for a more flexible, localized notion of adjunction than is possible {{within the context of}} <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> adjunct grammars. In fact, this new class is more powerful than that of <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> adjunct grammars since the latter is properly included in the former. The study of extended tree adjunct grammars is motivated by several linguistic considerations relating to weaknesses in the power of <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> adjunct grammars. First, <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> adjunct grammars, which can be used to compose the phrase structure grammar of the base component of a Chomsky-like transformational grammar, are not well suited to account for certain aspects of language structure such as the establishment and confirmation of selectional restrictions. Second, since the relational and categorical aspects of structure are simultaneously entailed by the process of adjunction in <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> adjunct grammars, it is difficult to study each separately. Finally, <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> adjunct grammars by their very nature do not admit a satisfactory description of the concept of the center of a constituent. Two major results concerning extended tree adjunct grammars are the primary focus of this article. The first and foremost is that any recognizable set can be realized as the tree set of such a grammar. The second is that a special form of automaton, called a deterministic linear bounded tree automaton, is sufficient to recognize this {{new class of}} tree adjunct grammars...|$|R
50|$|Generally pilots will {{practice}} {{making these}} turns using <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate turns. This will decrease the bank angle {{so that it}} is half of the calculated bank angle. When turns are made at <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate the line of latitude will only cause the compass to have an error of half as much. So our new calculation using a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate turn is as follows: (From east to north at 90 knots 0+22.5+3.5=26) the lead roll out heading read from the compass would be 26 degrees to fly on a north heading. (From west to north 360-22.5-3.5=334) The lead roll out heading read off the compass would be 334 degrees.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the <b>standard</b> regression <b>tree</b> method to clustered data. Previous works extending tree methods to accommodate correlated data are mainly based on the multivariate repeated-measures approach. We propose a "mixed effects regression tree" method where the correlated observations are viewed as nested within clusters rather than as vectors of multivariate repeated responses. The proposed method can handle unbalanced clusters, allows observations within clusters to be split, and can incorporate random effects and observation-level covariates. We implemented the proposed method using a <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> algorithm {{within the framework of the}} expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed regression tree method provides substantial improvements over <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> when the random effects are non negligible.

Previous works {{extending}} them to accommodate correlated data are based on the multivariate repeated-measures approach and not on the mixed effects approach; Abdollel et al.

We propose a “mixed effects regression tree ” method which is more flexible in terms of data requirements because the observations are viewed as nested within clusters rather than as multivariate vectors.

40|$|Relation {{extraction}} is {{the process}} of scanning text for rela-tionships between named entities. Recently, significant studies have focused on automatically extracting rela-tions from biomedical corpora. Most existing biomedical relation extractors require manual creation of biomedi-cal lexicons or parsing templates based on domain knowl-edge. In this study, we propose to use kernel-based learning methods to automatically extract biomedical re-lations from literature text. We develop a framework of kernel-based learning for biomedical relation extrac-tion. In particular, we modified the <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> kernel function by incorporating a trace kernel to capture richer contextual information. In our experiments on a biomedi-cal corpus, we compare different kernel functions for biomedical relation detection and classification. The experimental results show that a tree kernel outperforms word and sequence kernels for relation detection, our trace-tree kernel outperforms the <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> kernel, and a composite kernel outperforms individual kernels for relation extraction...|$|R

These calculations are performed with the Sapporo GPU library (Gaburov and Harfst 2009) and a <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> code with the same θ and Δ t_soft using the Bonsai GPU library (Bédorf et al. 2012). The calculation time for our P^ 3 T implementation is also proportional to N^ 4 / 3, as we presented above, while for the Hermite integrator it is proportional to N^ 7 / 3. The P^ 3 T scheme is faster than the direct Hermite integrator for N > 16 K and when N= 1 M (M= 2 ^ 20), the P^ 3 T scheme is about 50 {{times faster than the}} direct Hermite scheme. The pure tree code is slightly faster than the P^ 3 T scheme, but the integration errors are worse by several orders of magnitude (see Figures  6 and 10).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{dependency}} parsing method that uses bilingual constraints {{to improve the}} accuracy of parsing bilingual texts (bitexts). In our method, a targetside tree fragment that corresponds to a source-side tree fragment is identified via word alignment and mapping rules that are automatically learned. Then it is verified by checking the subtree list that is collected from large scale automatically parsed data on the target side. Our method, thus, requires gold <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> only on the source side of a bilingual corpus in the training phase, unlike the joint parsing model, which requires gold <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> on the both sides. Compared to the reordering constraint model, which requires the same training data as ours, our method achieved higher accuracy because of richer bilingual constraints. Experiments on the translated portion of the Chinese Treebank show that our system outperforms monolingual parsers by 2. 93 points for Chinese and 1. 64 points for English. ...|$|R
