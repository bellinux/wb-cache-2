In this paper, a field reinforcement experiment of an actual <b>hollow</b> <b>slab</b> bridge, which has experienced a destructive test with its transverse connections seriously damaged, was performed by applying external transverse and longitudinal prestress to it.

The data from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive tools such as frequencies, percentage and mean values.

There are no shear reinforcement inside the <b>hollow</b> core <b>slab</b> which makes it vulnerable to shear failure. The goal of the research is to focus on the shear capacity of the element and to study and analyze the number of ways to increase the capacity under the influence of heavy duty loads (30 - 50 kN/m^ 2). For this purpose, the analytical approach has been used, thus, determining and evaluating the behavior of <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> in shear using expressions and formulas in accordance with the standards and research papers. EC 1992 - 1 - 1, Finnish National Annex, the Product Standard of <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> EN 1168 and the research papers mentioned in the bibliography have been used as a reference for this study. The results show that the <b>hollow</b> core <b>slab</b> fail in shear such that the critical point of shear failure does not lie at the neutral axis, but in the lower region of web where tensile principal stresses are maximum and exceeds the tensile strength of concrete. The research also included the study of effectiveness of adding shear reinforcement inside the <b>hollow</b> core <b>slab</b> to increase the shear capacity. It has been concluded that the shear reinforcement are only effective in the region cracked in bending but not in uncracked region. If a shear crack is assumed to appear in the uncracked region near the support, the shear reinforcement becomes less effective as the anchorage failure tends to be the prevailing mode of failure. So, unless the issue of anchorage failure of pre-tensioned tendons is resolved, the use of shear reinforcement inside the <b>hollow</b> core <b>slab</b> is not effective.

40|$|In {{structural}} engineering ceilings affect both the building technique {{and the economic}} construction. Using precast prestressed <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> meets the demands of modern design and construction to a high extent. However, the shear resistance of <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> is considerably reduced if the slabs are bedded on slender beams or girders instead of rigid walls. According to investigations in Finland stresses in transverse direction of the slabs due to flexible supports {{may lead to a}} decrease in shear resistance of up to 60 %. The reduction in shear resistance depends on the composite action between the beam and the slabs, the beam deflection and the slabs’ cross section. No generally accepted design model allowing for a standardised and accurate shear design of prestressed <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> has been established in Europe so far. Further¬more, the differentiation between rigid and flexible supports is often not clear. Uncertainties in the design and open questions regarding the load bearing behaviour on flexible supports in general limit the application of prestressed <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs.</b> The aim of the present thesis is a thorough analysis of the load bearing behaviour of prestressed <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> on flexible supports. At first, {{the state of the art}} is summarised. Own experimental and numerical investigations on vital parameters affecting the load bearing behaviour are described in the following. The experimental investigations comprise eight full-scale tests on two-span floor systems with flexible supports and accompanying reference tests on single slabs with rigid supports. Continuative three-dimensional nonlinear FE-analyses provide deep insight into the failure mechanism and the influence of the beam’s bending stiffness on the load bearing behaviour. Based on the experimental and numerical results measures to enhance the shear resistance can be evaluated. A database of international tests with prestressed <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> on flexible supports from literature is generated to develop a realistic design model for shear. After evaluating the data an existing design model from Finland is used to recalculate the existing tests. An own design model is derived in the next step, whereas especially findings regarding the slabs’ load bearing behaviour and their composite action with the beam at the ultimate limit state are considered. Based on the results of 21 full-scale tests with different types of beams and slabs as well as a parametric study the own model is validated. It accounts for all important factors affecting the load bearing behaviour and hence contributes to an accurate and safe design of prestressed <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs</b> on flexible supports...|$|R

Parametric studies related to hourglass energy, erosion value and the material model of the concrete are performed in order to evaluate the effects on the dynamic response of the <b>hollow</b> core <b>slabs.</b> This numerical analysis is completed by experimental tests for validation purposes...|$|R
