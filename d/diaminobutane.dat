The bisesterdiamides were prepared from 1, 4 -butanediamine and dimethyl terephthalate or dimethylisophthalate respectively. They {{were analyzed by}} 1 H n. m. r., differential scanning calorimetry (d. s. c.) and high pressure liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.). The melting behaviour of the copolyesteramides was studied by d. s. c. The dynamic mechanical properties were investigated on injection moulded bars using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The melting temperature decreased with increasing 1, 4 -butyleneisophthalamide ester content. The crystallisation rate, the modulus above the glass transition temperature and the glass transition temperature hardly changed. The APEA of 1, 4 -butyleneisophthalamide ester and ethanediol was amorphous. The lowering of the melting temperature of the copolymers was probably caused by a decrease in lamellar size. The high crystallisation rate and the high physical crosslink density of the copolymers must be ascribed {{to the presence of}} 1, 4 -butyleneterephthalamide ester units which are able to crystallise fast and to form strong crystallites...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{derivatives}} of <b>diaminobutane</b> poly(propylene–imine) dendrimer DAB 32, of hyperbranched polyglycerol PG 5 and of hyperbranched polyester BH 40 were prepared. The functionalisation of the dendritic macromolecules {{was achieved by}} employing methods that are usually followed for the preparation of analogous compounds. The ability of these derivatives to encapsulate and release bioactive molecules {{in a controlled manner}} was studied. Specifically, derivatives of <b>diaminobutane</b> poly(propylene–imine) dendrimer bearing different number of polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties attached at their surface groups (three, six and twelve PEG chains) were prepared. The protective role of PEG in biological milieu was combined with the targeting properties of folic acid in another derivative of DAB 32. Also, two derivatives of hyperbranched polyglycerol bearing two and ten PEG chains, respectively, as well as a multifunctional derivative bearing PEG chains, as protective ligands, and folic acid, as targeting group, were prepared. Functionalisation of hyperbranched polyester was achieved by introducing PEG chains at the surface of the dendritic polymer. All derivatives were characterized with NMR, fluorescence and UV spectroscopy. The ability of the functional dendritic macromolecules prepared to act as drug delivery systems, was investigated using well–known anti–cancer drugs. So, derivatives of <b>diaminobutane</b> poly(propylene–imine) dendrimer were tested as potential carriers of Etoposide. In the case of hyperbranched polyglycerol derivatives Tamoxifen was employed, while functional hyperbranced polyester was tested as potential carrier of both Tamoxifen and Taxol. Cytotoxicity of all dendrimers was evaluated using HEK– 293 and A 549 cell lines. Furthermore, the role of folate during the entrance of multifunctional derivatives to cancer cells was examined. Specifically, a comparative study between derivatives bearing PEG chains and folic acid and derivatives bearing the same number of PEG chains but no folic acid, was conducted. The cell line used for this study was MDA. MB. 468, which is a cell line expressing folate receptors. Cells incubated with FITC–labelled derivatives of the functional dendritic polymers used for this study, were observed under a confocal microscope, in order for the difference in the ability of each derivative to enter cells to be estimated. ...|$|E

The CO 2 adsorption capacity of these materials is probed and compared with amine functionalized SBA- 15 material, in an effort to reach the maximal CO 2 /N ratio of 0. 5 when using dry conditions in a chemisorption process.

40|$|The amine oxidase {{family of}} enzymes {{has been the}} center of {{numerous}} mechanistic studies because of the medical relevance of the reactions they catalyze. This study describes transient and steady-state kinetic analyses of two flavin amine oxidases, mouse polyamine oxidase (PAO) and human lysine specific demethylase (LSD 1), to determine the mechanisms of amine oxidation. PAO is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) -dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of N 1 -acetylated polyamines. The pH-dependence of the kcat/Kamine indicates that the monoprotonated form of the substrate is required for catalysis, with the N 4 nitrogen next {{to the site of}} CH bond cleavage being unprotonated. Stopped-flow spectroscopy shows that the pH-dependence of the rate constant for flavin reduction, kred, displays a pKa of 7. 3 with a decrease in activity at acidic pH. This is consistent with an uncharged nitrogen being required for catalysis. Mutating Lys 315 to methionine has no effect on the kcat/Kamine-pH profile with the substrate spermine, and the kred value only shows a 1. 5 -fold decrease with respect to wild-type PAO. The mutation results in a 30 - fold decrease in kcat/KO 2. Solvent isotope effects and proton inventories are consistent with Lys 315 accepting a proton from a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the flavin N 5 during flavin oxidation. Steady-state and transient kinetic studies of para-substituted N,N'-dibenzyl- 1, 4 - <b>diaminobutanes</b> as substrates for PAO show that the kred values for each correlate with the van der Waals volume (VW) and the value. The coefficient for VW is the same at pH 8. 6 and 6. 6, whereas the p value increases from - 0. 59 at pH 8. 6 to - 0. 09 at pH 6. 6. These results are most consistent with a hydride transfer mechanism. The kinetics of oxidation of a peptide substrate by human lysine specific demethylase (LSD 1) were also studied. The kcat/KM pH-profile is bell-shaped, indicating the need for one unprotonated nitrogen next to the site of CH bond cleavage and another protonated nitrogen. The kcat and kred values are equal, and identical isotope effects are observed on kred, kcat, and kcat/KM, indicating that CH bond cleavage is rate-limiting with this substrate...|$|R

The higher generation dendrimeric derivative proved more effective when interacted with liposomes. This behavior was attributed to multivalent effects, which, as generally established, enhance the reactivity of multifunctional particles. Turbidimetry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy were used for investigating the {{interaction of}} the complementary particles while the redispersion of the aggregates was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

When water-soluble alkyldiamines such as diaminoethylene, <b>diaminobutane,</b> diethylenetriamine, and diaminohexane {{were used as}} spacers between the matrix and the enzyme, the surface concentration (SC) of the active ALP coupled on the matrix was increased, whereas {{the effect of the}} spacer on the SC was dependent on the length of the spacer. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was preimmobilized onto the LDPE films to provide a better simulation of the biological environment for the enzyme, and the SC of ALP on the matrix was significantly increased by coupling ALP onto the BSA preimmobilized surfaces.

Modification a) alone is able to give a good description of the experimental results obtained for polypropylene-imide with a <b>diaminobutane</b> core in water, while the simultaneous use of the three modifications is needed to adequately describe the experimental data of monodendrons and tridendrons of polybenzylether in THF...|$|E
40|$|A modular pathway for the {{preparation}} of tetradentate ligands was developed by employment of the nitroaldol reaction (Henry-reaction). Due {{to the use of}} basic solids as catalysts, namely the hydrotalcite Syntal 696 ® and the anion exchange resin Amberlyst A 21 ®, the reactions proceeded at room temperature and the products were obtained by simple work-up procedures. Furthermore, NMR investigations and single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed the stereoselectivity of the developed pathway. In the course of functional group interchanges, the employment of protecting groups was necessary. Protection with trialkylsilyl groups was easily and diastereoselectively achieved. The coordination behavior towards zinc chloride was studied as well as the catalytic activity of a custom-tailored vanadium(V) complex towards sulfoxidation. Moreover, the coordination behavior of carbonyl analogous Schiff-bases towards zinc chloride were examined.

40|$|Ionic or {{hydrogen}} bonding {{forces were}} employed for the preparation and characterization of novel liquid crystals {{derived from the}} interaction οf appropriate dendritic polymers with cholesterol based acids. At a first stage, the liquid crystalline character of salts resulting from the interaction of poly(propylene imine) dendrimers with 3 -cholesterylcarbonylpropanoic acid has been studied. The supramolecular structure and the observed liquid crystalline phases are dependent {{on the degree of}} protonation of primary amino groups as compared to that of tertiary amino groups. The glass transition temperatures of the materials are αt about 38 oC. At higher temperatures the ionic salts are transformed to SmC phases while a second order phase transition i. e. Smectic C to Smectic A, is observed between 90 and 110 oC depending on dendrimers generation. Additionally, two other cholesteric acids were also synthesized, i. e. pentanedioic acid mono-cholesteryl ester and succinic acid mono-(5 -cholesteryloxy-pentyl) ester which were employed for protonating the same dendrimers. The materials obtained exhibited liquid crystalline character at room temperature. At a second stage, <b>diaminobutane</b> poly(propylene imine) dendrimers of the second to fifth generation were functionalized by the introduction of the pyridyl moiety at their primary amino groups following an interaction with 3 -pyridyl isothiocyanate. These pyridinylated <b>diaminobutane</b> poly(propylene imine) dendrimers were subsequently interacted with succinic acid mono-cholesteryl ester acid for the formation of the corresponding hydrogen-bonded supramolecular complexes. The complexes obtained exhibited Smectic A liquid crystalline phases over a relatively broad thermal range, i. e. from about 60 oC up to 140 oC. Finally, a hyperbranched polyglycerol was reacted with 4 -pyridinoyl chloride hydrochloride for the introduction of the pyridinyl moiety at its external surface. This pyridinylated hyperbranched polymer was subsequently interacted with the above mentioned cholesterol-based carboxylic acids for the formation of the corresponding hydrogen-bonded supramolecular complexes. The materials obtained exhibited Smectic A liquid crystalline phases over a broad thermal range from room temperature up to above 100 oC. In conclusion, the interaction of poly(propylene imine) dendrimers or of a hyperbranched polyglycerol, either through ionic or hydrogen bonding interactions, with cholesterol based derivatives leads to liquid crystalline materials that exhibit mesomorphic properties over a broad temperature range. ...|$|E

The laboratory collision energies at which the fragment ion current is ∼ 50 % of the total ion current were found to increase with the size, but to be independent of charge state of the protonated POPAM dendrimers.

Cationic (non-acetylated) and acetylated (acetylation is a convenient strategy to neutralize the peripheral amine group) dendrimers exhibited different pH-dependent micellization, complexation, and encapsulation behaviour. The acetylated dendrimer encapsulated the Dp 21 under acidic conditions (pH =  3.0), while the cationic dendrimer encapsulated the drug under both acidic (pH =  3 and pH =  5.0) and neutral conditions (pH =  7.4). In addition, pH-responsive release was different for an acetylated- and a non-acetylated dendritic matrix. Non-acetylated dendrimers showed a much slower release rate than acetylated dendrimers under conditions of lower pH and a much faster release rate from non-acetylated dendrimer as pH values decreased.

Fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to study the interactions of G 5 PPIEDA (G 5 ethylenediamine cored poly(propylene imine)) dendrimer and two well known drugs (Famotidine and Indomethacin) at different pH conditions. The study suggested that at low pH the dendrimer-drug complexes are thermodynamically unstable as compared to neutral and high pH conditions. Calculated Potential of Mean Force (PMF) by umbrella sampling showed that the release of drugs from the dendrimer at low pH is spontaneous, median release at neutral pH and slow release at high pH. In addition, Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy calculations were also performed at each umbrella sampling window to identify the various energy contributions. To understand the effect of dendrimer chemistry and topology on the solubility and release profile of drugs, this study is extended to explore the solubility and release profile of phenylbutazone drug complexed with G 3 poly(amidoamine) and G 4 <b>diaminobutane</b> cored PPI dendrimers. The {{results indicate that the}} pH-induced conformational changes in dendrimer, ionization states, dendrimer type and pK(a) of the guest molecules influence the free energy barrier and stability of complexation, and thus regulate drug loading, solubility and release...|$|E
40|$|The {{lamellar}} compound titanium phenylarsonate was synthesized and intercalated with alkylmonoamines (methyl to heptyl), diaminoethane, <b>diaminobutane,</b> lutidine and alpha-picoline. The host {{was characterized}} through elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, surface analysis, porosity, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and electronic scanning microscopy. The intercalated compounds {{did not show}} significant increases in the interlamellar distances through X-ray diffractometry. The intercalation was confirmed by the thermogravimetric technique, indicating mass losses that correspond to the amines. The ideal intercalation was established by adding increments of 30. 0 x 10 - 6 dm³ of 0. 50 mol dm- 3 of each amine into a suspension of about 10 x 10 - 3 g of matrix. The number of moles intercalated with alkylmonoamines followed an aleatory order {{in relation to the}} increase of the aliphatic chain and the enthalpic values gave - 9. 18 ± 0. 07; - 12. 10 ± 0. 20; - 7. 61 ± 0. 02; - 6. 88 ± 0. 01; - 9. 47 ± 0. 03; - 12. 84 ± 0. 10 and - 14. 78 ± 0. 10 kJ mol- 1 for the sequence of alkylmonoamines and varied from - 3. 66 ± 0. 30 to - 10. 92 ± 1. 50 kJ mol- 1 for the alkyldiamines. The aromatic amines presented small thermal effects and the unfavorable intercalation is attributed to the large volume of the phenyl group inside the lamella, which hinders insertion of these bases inside the lamellar cavity...|$|E
40|$|Putrescine (<b>diaminobutane)</b> was {{previously}} found to stimulate proliferation of human fibroblasts in tissue culture, and a growth factor produced by these cells {{was identified as}} putrescine. In the present paper putrescine transport is studied. The rate of putrescine transport was dependent on temperature, {{and most of the}} labeled putrescine was retained by the cells after washing with excess unlabeled putrescine. The concentration of radioactivity after a [14 C]putrescine pulse was 85 times higher in the cells than in the medium, and over 95 % of the radioactivity in the cells was as unchanged putrescine. Butanol treatment removed 70 % of the radioactivity from the cells. The calculated Km was about the same for rapidly growing and for starved cultures, while Vmax was higher for the former than for the latter cultures. Putrescine transport was inhibited to varying degrees by other polyamines, but not by amino acids or divalent cations. Stimulation of cell proliferation by serum was followed by an 18 - 100 - fold increase in the rate of putrescine transport, which was not inhibitable with cyclic AMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or prostaglandin E 1. Removal of serum resulted in a rapid decrease in the rate of putrescine transport. Insulin in low serum medium and trypsin in the absence of serum also accelerated putrescine transport. Moreover, the rate of putrescine transport was dependent on cell density. It was faster in sparsely populated than in densely populated cultures. SV 40 -transformed human fibroblasts responded to addition and removal of serum {{in the same way as}} the untransformed parent cell line...|$|E

Surface modification of CNCs continues to gain significant research interest as it imparts new properties {{to the surface of the}} nanocrystals for the design of multifunctional CNCs-based materials. A small chemical surface modification can potentially lead to drastic behavioral changes of cell-material interactions thereby affecting the intended bio-application. In this work, unmodified CNCs were covalently decorated with four different organic moieties such as a <b>diaminobutane</b> fragment, a cyclic oligosaccharide (β-cyclodextrin), a thermoresponsive polymer (poly[N-isopropylacrylamide]), and a cationic aminomethacrylamide-based polymer using different synthetic covalent methods. The effect of surface coatings of CNCs and the respective dose-response of the above organic moieties on the cell viability were evaluated on mammalian cell cultures (J 774 A. 1 and MFC- 7), using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Overall, the results indicated that cells exposed to surface-coated CNCs for 24 h did not display major changes in cell viability, membrane permeability as well as cell morphology. However, with longer exposure, all these parameters were somewhat affected, which appears not to be correlated with either anionic or cationic surface coatings of CNCs used in this study.

40|$|In the 21 st century, {{cancer is}} {{becoming}} {{the curse of the}} ageing population in developed countries. No satisfactory therapies are available for many tumour types, and application of existing therapies is limited by severe side effects. Thus, there is a great need of new approaches in cancer treatment. DAB-Am 16 is a dendritic polymer with a globular structure, consisting of poly(propylene imine) branches that emerge from a <b>diaminobutane</b> core. Its intrinsic tumoricidal activity in mouse models was published in 2005, but no information on the mechanism of action was available. This thesis presents novel findings on the pathways underlying the anti-cancer activity of this dendrimer in vitro and in vivo. Extensive chemical characterisation of DAB-Am 16 confirmed its stability and purity. Severe time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was observed for a panel of human tumour cell lines, while a small population of persisters was identified. Toxicity was accompanied by a delayed or abrogated cell cycle. There was an increased number of S phase cells, while the ability to synthesise DNA or to undergo mitosis was progressively lost with increasing DAB-Am 16 concentration. The following cell death was found to be apoptotic and was biased in a cell cycle phase dependent manner. The order of apoptotic events upon DAB-Am 16 exposure was determined. Finally, an in vivo experiment confirmed that DAB-Am 16 has a pronounced effect against human pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice, while being well tolerated by the animals. Post mortem examination of tumour tissue revealed cell cycle blockage of tumour cells from DAB-Am 16 -treated mice. However, disposition for further proliferation was not diminished, and no significant difference in tumour vascularisation was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} {{dendrimer}} amphiphiles has an unexpected {{effect on their}} self-assembly. A series of <b>diaminobutane</b> poly(propylenimine) generation 3 dendrimer (DAB-dendr-(NH 2) (16)) amphiphiles has been synthesized, hearing ail average of five (PD 5), three (PD 3) and one (PD 1) palmitoyl group(s) per dendrimer molecule. Additionally DAB-dendr-(NH 2) (16) was derivatized {{with a layer of}} poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, degree of polymerization = 12) groups and conjugated to an average of 1 palmitoyl group at the PEG end (PPD 1). A Final amphiphile resulted from the conjugation of DAB-dendr-(NH 2) (16) with 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine-succinimidylpropionate (DSPE-PEG(3400) -SPA), i. e. : DPD 5 (with 4 DSPE-PEG arms). The critical micellar concentration in aqueous media followed the trend: DPD 5 < PD 5 = PD 3 < PD 1 < PPD 1 and amphiphiles eventually formed 10 - 20 nm monomolecular or multimolecular micelles and/or 200 nm spheres or tubules. Aggregation was entropy driven, as expected, for DPD 5, PD 5 and PD 1 and enthalpy driven with the most hydrophilic Compound PPD 1, but was unexpectedly enthalpy driven for PD 3. PD 3 aggregates formed low capacity hydrophobic domains with a limited capacity for encapsulation of cyclosporine A; encapsulation levels (mole drug per mole polymer) were 0. 099, 0. 014, 0, 099, and 0. 735 for PD 1, PD 3, PD 5, and DPD 5 and, respectively. We conclude that star shaped amphiphiles such as PD 3 are sterically hindered from self-assembling into high capacity hydrophobic domains in aqueous media, Amphiphile-membrane interactions were promoted by hydrophobic groups, but diminished by PEG moieties.

40|$|Perchlorate (ClO_ 4 ^-) {{has emerged}} as a major {{groundwater}} and surface water contaminant in the United States. Ion exchange (IX) is the most widely used technology for treating water containing lower concentrations of perchlorate (< 100 ppb). However, a major drawback of IX is the need for frequent regeneration or disposal of the perchlorate-laden resins. As a first step toward the development of high-capacity, selective and recyclable dendritic ligands for the recovery of perchlorate from aqueous solutions by dendrimer filtration, we tested the hypothesis that dendrimers with hydrophobic cavities and positively charged internal groups should selectively bind ClO_ 4 ^- over more hydrophilic anions such as Cl^-, NO_ 3 ^-, SO_ 4 ^(2 -), and HCO_ 3 ^-. We measured the uptake of ClO_ 4 ^- by the fifth generation (G 5 -NH_ 2) poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimer with a <b>diaminobutane</b> core and terminal NH_ 2 groups in deonized water and model electrolyte solutions as a function of (i) anion−dendrimer loading, (ii) solution pH, (iii) background electrolyte concentration, and (iv) reaction time. The ClO_ 4 ^- binding capacity of this dendrimer is comparable to those of perchlorate-selective IX resins. However, its ClO_ 4 ^- binding kinetics is faster and reaches equilibrium in ∼ 1 h. Note also that only a high pH (∼ 9. 0) aqueous solution is needed to release more than 90 % of the bound ClO_ 4 ^- anions by deprotonation of the dendrimer tertiary amine groups. The overall {{results of this study suggest}} that dendritic macromolecules such as the G 5 -PPI NH_ 2 dendrimer provide ideal building blocks for the development of high-capacity, selective and recyclable ligands for the recovery of anions such as perchlorate from aqueous solutions by dendrimer enhanced filtration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{absorption}} rate and CO 2 solubility of four new blends using concentrated piperazine (PZ) were measured. The blends are 6 m PZ/ 2 m hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), 6 m PZ/ 2 m <b>diaminobutane</b> (DAB), 6 m PZ/ 2 m bis(aminoethyl) ether (BAE), and 5 m PZ/ 2 m N- 2 (aminoethy) lpiperazine (AEP). The liquid film mass transfer coefficient (kg’) of the blends was measured at 20 100 °C using a wetted wall column (WWC). PCO 2 * was measured at 20 – 100 °C using the WWC, and at 100 – 160 °C using a total pressure apparatus. A semi-empirical VLE model was regressed for each blend using measured PCO 2 *, and the models show good agreement with experimental data. The process {{performance of the}} new blends is compared to 5 m PZ/ 2. 3 m AMP, 2 m PZ/ 4 m AMP, 8 m PZ, and 7 m MEA. The high pKa of primary diamines contributes to high lean and rich loading and low solvent capacity for 6 m PZ/ 2 m HMDA, 6 m PZ/ 2 m DAB, 6 m PZ/ 2 m BAE. The Habs of PZ/AEP and PZ/AMP is competitive with 7 m MEA. PZ/BAE and PZ/HMDA have Habs higher than 8 m PZ but lower than 7 m MEA. The energy performance of the solvent depends on CO 2 VLE and thermal stability. 6 m PZ/ 2 m HMDA, 6 m PZ/ 2 m AEP, and 5 m PZ/ 2 m BAE show good energy performance and are competitive with 8 m PZ. At 40 °C the {{absorption rate}} of 5 m PZ/ 2 m AEP {{is about the same}} as 8 m PZ; 6 m PZ/ 2 m DAB and 6 m PZ/ 2 m BAE have 10 % lower rates than 8 m PZ...|$|E
40|$|Five new thioantimonates {{have been}} {{synthesized}} {{in the presence}} of organic amines under solvothermal conditions and their structures determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All of the compounds are layered and contain antimony-sulphide anions of stoichiometry [Sb 4 S 7](2 -), but the structure of the anion formed is dependent on the amine used in synthesis. (H 3 N(CH 2) (4) NH 3) [Sb 4 S 7] (1) contains [Sb 4 S 7](2 -) double chains directed along [010]. Weak interchain Sb-S interactions between neighbouring chains cause the double chains to pack into layers in the ab plane. In the [001] direction, the layers of double chains alternate with doubly protonated <b>diaminobutane</b> molecules to which the chains are hydrogen bonded. Compounds of general formula (TH) (2) [Sb 4 S 7] (T= CH 3 (CH 2) (2) NH 2 (2), (CH 3) (2) CHNH 2 (3), CH 3 (CH 2) (3) NH 2 (4) and CH 3 (CH 2) (4) NH 2 (5)) adopt a more complex structure in which [Sb 3 S 8](7 -) units are linked by Sb- 3 (3 -) pyramids to form chains, which in turn are bridged by sulphur atoms to create sheets containing large heterorings. Pairs of such sheets form double layers of four atoms thickness that are stacked along [001]. Protonated amine molecules are located between anionic antimony-sulphide layers to which they are hydrogen bonded. Thermal analysis reveals that the decomposition temperature of materials containing [Sb 4 S 7](2 -) anions is dependent both on the structure of the anion, the lowest decomposition temperature being that of the low-dimensional phase (1) and on the identity of the amine, the decomposition temperature decreasing with an increasing number of carbon atoms and decreasing density.

40|$|Dendrimers {{are highly}} {{branched}} macromolecules of low polydispersity that provide many exciting opportunities for design of novel drug-carriers, gene delivery systems and imaging agents. They hold promise in tissue targeting applications, controlled drug release and moreover, their interesting nanoscopic architecture might allow easier passage across biological barriers by transcytosis. However, from the {{vast array of}} structures currently emerging from synthetic chemistry {{it is essential to}} design molecules that have real potential for in vivo biological use. Here, polyamidoamine (PAMAM, Starburst™), poly(propyleneimine) with either <b>diaminobutane</b> or diaminoethane as core, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) grafted carbosilane (CSi–PEO) dendrimers were used to study systematically the effect of dendrimer generation and surface functionality on biological properties in vitro. Generally, dendrimers bearing -NH termini displayed concentration- and in 2 the case of PAMAM dendrimers generation-dependent haemolysis, and changes in red cell morphology were observed after 1 h even at low concentrations (10 mg/ml). At concentrations below 1 mg/ml CSi–PEO dendrimers and those dendrimers with carboxylate (COONa) terminal groups were neither haemolytic nor cytotoxic towards a panel of cell lines in vitro. In general, cationic dendrimers were cytotoxic (72 h incubation), displaying IC values 50 – 300 mg/ml dependent on dendrimer-type, cell-type and generation. Preliminary studies with polyether dendrimers prepared by the convergent route showed that dendrimers with carboxylate and malonate surfaces were not haemolytic at 1 h, but after 24 h, unlike anionic 125 PAMAM dendrimers they were lytic. Cationic I-labelled PAMAM dendrimers (gen 3 and 4) administered intravenously (i. v.) to Wistar rats (| 10 mg/ml) were cleared rapidly from the circulation (, 2 % recovered dose in blood at 1 h).

40|$|Few inhibitors {{exist for}} CD 38, a {{multifunctional}} enzyme catalyzing {{the formation and}} metabolism of the Ca 2 +-mobilizing second messenger cyclic adenosine 5 ′-diphosphoribose (cADPR). Synthetic, non-hydrolyzable ligands can facilitate structure-based inhibitor design. Molecular docking was used to reproduce the crystallographic binding mode of cyclic inosine 5 ′-diphosphoribose (N 1 -cIDPR) with CD 38, revealing an exploitable pocket and predicting the potential to introduce an extra hydrogen bond interaction with Asp- 155. The purine C- 8 position of N 1 -cIDPR (IC 50 276 µM) was extended with an amino or <b>diaminobutane</b> group and the 8 -modified compounds were evaluated against CD 38 -catalyzed cADPR hydrolysis. Crystallography of an 8 -amino N 1 -cIDPR:CD 38 complex confirmed the predicted interaction with Asp- 155, together with a second H-bond from a realigned Glu- 146, rationalizing the improved inhibition (IC 50 56 µM). Crystallography of a complex of cyclic ADP-carbocyclic ribose (cADPcR, IC 50 129 µM) with CD 38 illustrated that Glu- 146 hydrogen bonds with the ligand N 6 -amino group. Both 8 -amino N 1 -cIDPR and cADPcR bind deep in the active site reaching the catalytic residue Glu- 226, and mimicking the likely location of cADPR during catalysis. Substantial overlap of the N 1 -cIDPR “northern” ribose monophosphate and the cADPcR carbocyclic ribose monophosphate regions suggests that this area is crucial for inhibitor design, leading to a new compound series of N 1 -inosine 5 ′-monophosphates (N 1 -IMPs). These small fragments inhibit hydrolysis of cADPR more efficiently than the parent cyclic compounds, with {{the best in the}} series demonstrating potent inhibition (IC 50  =  7. 6 µM).
