40|$|Emissions of {{greenhouse}} gases is accounted for and reported annually under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. In the current accounting system, emissions of CO 2 from <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (HWP) are attributed to {{the year of harvest}} and the country of harvest. All harvested wood is thus assumed to be oxidised to CO 2 in the year of harvesting, and no wood goes into long term storage. This is called the IPCC default approach. Much of the harvested wood will however be stored for a short or long period of time before it oxidises and this will cause a delayed emission of CO 2. If more wood is stored than oxidised in a given year, <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> will act as a sink and a removal of CO 2 is recorded. However, if the consumption of wood decreases to a level below what is oxidised, <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> will act as a source and emissions of CO 2 is recorded. In Norway, as on many other countries, the stock of <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> has been increasing for many years, and is likely to increase further.

Few studies have investigated the effects of different silvicultural systems, and the relative strength of in-situ forest carbon versus wood products pools remains in question. Our research (1) describes the impact of harvesting frequency and degree of post- harvest structural retention on carbon storage in northern hardwood-conifer forests, and (2) tests the significance of including <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> in carbon accounting at the stand scale. We stratified Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots to control for environmental, forest structural and compositional variables, resulting in 32 FIA plots distributed throughout the northeastern U. S. We used the USDA Forest Vegetation Simulator to project stand development over a 160 year period under nine different forest management scenarios. Simulated treatments represented a gradient of increasing structural retention and decreasing harvesting frequencies and included a “no harvest” scenario. The simulations incorporated carbon flux between aboveground forest biomass (dead and live pools) and <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (including carbon storage in landfills). Mean carbon storage over the simulation period, including carbon stored in <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> was calculated for each silvicultural scenario. We investigated tradeoffs among scenarios using a factorial treatment design and two-way ANOVA. The predictive strength of management scenarios relative to site-specific variables was evaluated using Classification and Regression Trees. Mean carbon sequestration was significantly (a = 0. 05) greater for “no management” compared to any of the active management scenarios. Of the harvest treatments, those favoring high levels of structural retention and decreased harvesting frequency stored the greatest amounts of carbon. In order to isolate the effect of in-situ forest carbon storage and <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> we did not include the emissions benefits associated with substituting wood fiber for other construction materials or energy sources.

40|$|Abstract Background The default {{international}} {{accounting rules}} estimate the carbon emissions from forest products by assuming all harvest is immediately emitted to the atmosphere. This {{makes it difficult}} to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of different forest management or manufacturing activities that maintain the storage of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) addresses this issue by allowing other accounting methods. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a new model for estimating annual stock changes of carbon in <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (HWP). Results The model, British Columbia <b>Harvested</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Products</b> version 1 (BC-HWPv 1), estimates carbon stocks and fluxes for wood harvested in BC from 1965 to 2065, based on new parameters on local manufacturing, updated and new information for North America on consumption and disposal of wood and paper products, and updated parameters on methane management at landfills in the USA. Based on model results, reporting on emissions as they occur would substantially lower BC’s greenhouse gas inventory in 2010 from 48 Mt CO 2 to 26 Mt CO 2 because of the long-term forest carbon storage in-use and in the non-degradable material in landfills. In addition, if offset projects created under BC’s protocol reported 100 [*]year cumulative emissions using the BC-HWPv 1 the emissions would be lower by about 11 %. Conclusions This research showed that the IPCC default methods overestimate the emissions North America wood products. Future IPCC GHG accounting methods could include a lower emissions factor (e. g. 0. 52) multiplied by the annual harvest, rather than the current multiplier of 1. 0.

The emission budget of harvesting operations depends on the loss of standing biomass by timber extracted from the forest site and logging losses on the one side, {{and on the other}} on the wood end use and the utilization of processing residues. We develop two scenarios to quantify the magnitude of CO 2 emissions by (1) energetic utilization, and (2) energetic and material utilization of harvested timber and compare the substitution effects for different fossil energy sources. Results The direct energetic use of harvested timber does not compensate for the losses of forest carbon stock. Logging residuals and displacement factors reflecting different wood use constitute by far {{the most important factor in}} potential emission reductions. Substitution effects resulting from energetic use of mill residuals and from HWPs have only a subordinated contribution to the total emissions as well as the type of fossil fuel utilized to quantify substitution effects.

Conclusions The observation and perception of REDD+ should not be restricted to sustainable management and reduced impact logging practices in the forest domain but should be extended to the utilization of extracted timber.

When comparing virgin and recycled materials, this means that forest carbon flows are either shown as nil or a net sequestration credit. However, <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> typically account for {{less than half of the}} carbon stored in a forest, with additional stores in below ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soils. Each of these stores may be affected by changes in demand for virgin pulp and paper. In this study the countries likely to provide pulp displaced by moving to recyclate, or used when switching from recyclate were identified for both the UK and China (the largest export market for UK-derived recyclate). Changes in forest carbon stores in each country were then assessed and attributed to the extraction of a unit of timber in each country where demand for pulp and paper was identified as a driver for change. The analysis shows that when switching from virgin to recycled content within the UK and China, no additional biogenic CO emissions are avoided with the exception of Canadian pulp, where the data suggests that forests are being degraded, with associated carbon losses. When switching from recycled to virgin content, net biogenic CO emissions are seen from most relevant countries. In the example of newsprint, this is equivalent to 2 - 23 tonnes CO per tonne of newsprint. The exceptions to this are Chile and Russia, where demand for virgin fibre does not appear to be associated with deforestation.

The EU legislation prohibits the intoduction of illegally <b>harvested</b> <b>wood</b> on the European market, sets up preconditions for the marketing of <b>wood</b> and <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> and defines the requirements applicabe to "monitoring organizations " namely the implementation of legislation, concerning the management and trades in the forestry field...|$|R
40|$|Intensive forest <b>harvesting</b> for {{traditional}} <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> {{and for the}} emerging biomass and biofuel markets {{has the potential to}} decrease soil quality. Site productivity and sustainability will be key issues as timber rotation ages decrease and production increases due to demand. The goal of the international Long-Term Soil Productivity study, with over 100 field locations in North America, is to develop soil quality guidelines across large areas and site gradients with respect to harvesting treatments. Data could be used in conjunction with mappable soil information, such as geology, land form, and soil type to develop risk maps of productivity decline due to intensive harvesting. This study provides a unique opportunity to supply information of long-term impacts across soil types with differing forest management practices. Potential uses of this data will be presented across a site gradient in the Western Gulf Coastal Plain...|$|R
40|$|The future {{agreements}} on the LULUCF sector will probably implement {{the role of}} <b>harvest</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> (HWP) for climate change mitigation. As highlighted by many Authors however, for Italy to quantify the amount of HWP will impose {{a number of issues}} mainly related to the inconsistency of the data provided by the National Institute for Statistic (ISTAT). New data collected by the National Forest and Carbon Inventory (INFC) will probably provide useful information. In the meantime, however, a comparison based on the forest area reported by INFC and data on HWP provided by ISTAT, both scaled at province level, could be proposed. The 2005 was assumed as reference year for both data sources. At this purpose, grouping the 103 Italian provinces in 9 groups mainly based on the 20 administrative regions, the Pearson coefficient of correlation was estimated, for each group, comparing the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT with (i) the forest area, (ii) the plantation area and (iii) the total forest area, including both plantations and forests. Possible outliers were identified estimating the harvest rates per hectare of forest and considering the interquantile range of these values. A linear model was finally applied between the total forest area and the total amount of harvest estimated at regional level. The results highlighted a strong correlation between the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT and the forest area reported by INFC for 13 out of 21 regions. For 5 regions, including Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Umbria and Marche the amount of harvest was only correlated with the area of plantations. No correlation was detected for Toscana region. Based on the harvest rate per hectare, 5 provinces out of 103 were identified as outliers. The amount of harvest reported for 3 of these provinces (Cremona, Mantova and Pavia) was clearly referred to plantations. The analysis of the studentized residuals based on the application of the linear model, highlighted outliers values also for Piemonte region. As in the previous case, the amount of harvest reported for this region was probably partially referred to plantations. We could therefore speculate that for many regions data reported by national statistics as referred to the amount of harvest in forest, were statistically correlated with the forest area detected by INFC. However, for some important regions, such as Piemonte and Lombardia, they were clearly correlated with plantations...|$|R
