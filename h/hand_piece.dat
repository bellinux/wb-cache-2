25|$|Microdebrider: The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving {{device with}} {{continuous}} suction often used during sinus surgery. It {{is made up}} of a cannula or tube, connected to a <b>hand</b> <b>piece,</b> which in turn is connected to a motor with foot control and a suction device. The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.|$|E

50|$|A {{flexible}} bronchoscope {{is longer}} and thinner than a rigid bronchoscope. It contains a fiberoptic system that transmits an {{image from the}} tip of the instrument to an eyepiece or video camera at the opposite end. Using Bowden cables connected to a lever at the <b>hand</b> <b>piece,</b> the tip of the instrument can be oriented, allowing the practitioner to navigate the instrument into individual lobe or segment bronchi. Most flexible bronchoscopes also include a channel for suctioning or instrumentation, but these are significantly smaller than those in a rigid bronchoscope.|$|E

Boury's commissioned work, To Dream Again, which contains four songs from Shakespeare's The Tempest, was given its first performance {{in the summer of}} 2003 at the 100th Anniversary Convention of Sigma Alpha Iota, in Dearborn, Michigan. In 2004, his university commissioned him to create a work in honor of the opening of the Clinton Library in Little Rock and he continues to volunteer in schools and churches to share his music. Boury has composed music for his university's alma mater, as well as for opera and theater events, produced at University of Arkansas at Little Rock. His many art songs and chamber music pieces have been performed regionally, nationally and internationally as well. Robert Boury is known for his beautiful art songs and cycles. His renowned songs are well thought of and are sung by students and professionals nationwide. Boury also composed many solo piano pieces along with piano ensemble works such as two pianos, four <b>hands</b> <b>pieces</b> (Two Beguines, op. 4, Duelin' Pianos, op. 10d) and one piano, eight <b>hands</b> <b>piece</b> (The Mice Will Play, op. 19).|$|R
50|$|The General Electric {{automatic}} toothbrush {{was introduced}} in the early 1960s; it was cordless with rechargeable NiCad batteries and although portable, was rather bulky, {{about the size of a}} two-D-cell flashlight handle.

The GE Automatic Toothbrush came with a charging stand which held the <b>hand</b> <b>piece</b> upright; most units were kept in the charger, which is not the best way to get maximum service life from a NiCad battery. Also, early NiCad batteries tended to have a short lifespan. The batteries were sealed inside the GE device, and the whole unit had to be discarded when the batteries failed.|$|E

30|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a potentially}} serious clinical complication of dental treatments involving forceful injection of air into connective tissue below the dermal layer [1]. Typical incidences are encountered during surgical extraction of teeth, restorative treatment, endodontic treatment, {{and the use}} of air-driven <b>hand</b> <b>pieces</b> [2]. The etiology of subcutaneous emphysema is related to traumatic, iatrogenic, incidental, or pathological events, all of which result from the introduction of gas between the tissue layers [3]. It has been commonly reported that air-driven dental instruments can also cause various degrees of subcutaneous or cervicofacial emphysema.|$|R
50|$|Microblading {{should be}} {{performed}} using aseptic technique, needles must always be sterile and single use, the technician must disinfect {{the area of the}} skin prior to the tattoo service and clinical grade single use associated equipment and consumables are highly recommended (<b>hand</b> <b>piece,</b> skin wipes and saline, micro-brushes, dressing packs etc.) preferably sterile. The most common complications and client dissatisfaction that results from any form of tattooing is misapplication of the pigment, pigment migration and color change. Serious complications are uncommon though it is important to stress that like all forms of tattooing risks associated with Microblading include the transmission of Blood Borne Pathogenic Organisms (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis C Virus) as well as short term or long terms reactions to pigment ingredients. Therefore, it is essential to check that the technician holds appropriate licenses and registrations for the provision of tattoo services as well as inquiring about the standard of training that has been attained by the technician.|$|E
50|$|This {{refers to}} {{temperature-controlled}} radiofrequency energy {{being delivered to}} the anal canal, and is marketed as the SECCA procedure. This procedure aims to create a controlled scarring and stricturing of the anal canal. In theory, {{it is thought that}} radiofrequency induced IAS injury may cause collagen deposition and fibrosis (scarring), resulting in the affected area tightening. Specialized surgical instrument called a radiofrequency handpiece is used. It has 4 needles which enter the IAS and heat up to 85 °C. This causes the water molecules in the tissue to vibrate with subsequent frictional heating. The <b>hand</b> <b>piece</b> is cooled by water and monitors the temperature of the tissues it is applied to for safety. It is thought that the improvement in FI occurs over time as collagen is deposited and the tissues undergo remodeling. The procedure is carried out under local anesthesia (with or without conscious sedation) on an outpatient basis. There appear to be relatively few serious complications.Initial studies of the SECCA procedure have shown promising improvements in quality of life and FI severity scores, however large randomized control trials and systematic reviews are currently lacking.|$|E

5000|$|The Hopewell {{created some}} of the finest craftwork and artwork of the Americas. Most of their works had some {{religious}} significance, and their graves were filled with necklaces, ornate carvings made from bone or wood, decorated ceremonial pottery, ear plugs, and pendants. Some graves were lined with woven mats, mica (a mineral consisting of thin glassy sheets), or stones. The Hopewell produced artwork in a greater variety and with more exotic materials than their predecessors the Adena. Grizzly bear teeth, fresh water pearls, sea shells, sharks' teeth, copper and even small quantities of silver were turned into beautifully crafted pieces. The Hopewell artisans were expert carvers of pipestone, and many of the mortuary mounds are full of exquisitely carved statues and pipes. The Mound of Pipes at Mound City produced over 200 stone smoking pipes depicting animals and birds in well-realized three-dimensional form, and the Tremper Site in Scioto County produced over 130. Some artwork went beyond the ordinary exotic, as Hopewell artists were expert carvers of human bone. A rare mask from Mound City was created using a human skull as a face plate. Hopewell artists created both abstract and realistic portrayals of the human form. One tubular pipe is so realistically portrayed that the model was identified as an achondroplastic (chondrodystropic) dwarf. Many other figurines give details of dress, ornamentation, and hairstyles. An example of their abstract human forms is the [...] "Mica Hand" [...] from the Hopewell Site in Ross County, Ohio.
