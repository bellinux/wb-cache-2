60|$|For the rest, here {{is another}} little incident. We said {{it had been a}} {{disappointment}} to Papa that his little Fritz showed almost no appetite for soldiering, but found other sights more interesting to him than the <b>drill-ground.</b> Sympathize, then, with the earnest Papa, as he returns home one afternoon,--date not given, but to all appearance of that year 1715, when there was such war-rumoring, and marching towards Stralsund;--and found the little Fritz, with Wilhelmina looking over him, strutting about, and assiduously beating a little drum.|$|E
6000|$|When {{our three}} firemen reached the <b>drill-ground</b> the chief was showing his {{recruits}} how to coil several lengths of the hose, {{so as to}} avoid a twist or [...] "kink," [...] which might endanger its bursting when the water was turned suddenly on by the powerful [...] "steamers." [...] He then pointed to the tall empty buildings beside him and ordered his recruits to go into {{the third floor of the}} premises, drag up the hose, and bring the branch to bear on the back rooms, in which fire was supposed to be raging.|$|E
60|$|Regaining {{the main}} road and passing towards the {{northern}} town, which is separated from southern Axim by the fort and the grassy <b>drill-ground,</b> we cast {{a look at a}} heap of rotting cases at last stored under a kind of shed. Though labelled 'Akim' by the ungeographical manufacturer, they contain a board-house, with glass windows and all complete, intended for Axim, and eventually for the District-commissioner, Tákwá. But, with a futility worthy of the futile African, certain authorities at Head-quarters, after buying and landing the proposed bungalow, which probably cost 500l., discovered that they could not afford the expense of sending it to its destination. Consequently it was made over to the white ants, and it has now duly qualified for fuel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Walpole and Company, {{aware of}} that fact, do take some trouble about it; and now, may not we say, PAULLO MAJORA CANAMUS? All through that Summer, 1740,"--while King Friedrich went rushing about, to Strasburg, to Wesel; doing his Herstals and Practicalities, with a light high hand, in almost an {{entertaining}} manner; and intent, still more, on his Voltaires and a Life to the Muses,--"there was, in England, serious heavy tumult of activity, secret and public. In the Dockyards, on the <b>Drill-grounds,</b> what a stir: Camp in the Isle of Wight, not to mention Portsmouth and the Sea-Industries; 6,000 Marines are to be embarked, as well as Land Regiments,--can anybody guess whither? America itself is to furnish 'one Regiment, with Scotch Officers to discipline it,' if they can.|$|R
50|$|Located {{midway between}} the city's old {{downtown}} around Gastown Hastings Street and newer areas uptown around Granville, the park naturally became a centre for public meetings, the most infamous {{one was a}} rally by the Knights of Labour {{which led to the}} Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907, with the Beatty Street Drill Hall, across Beatty Street on the block's northeast flank, serving as a stage and podium. Baseball, cricket and lacrosse teams made use of the field year round. The playing fields also served as military <b>drill-grounds,</b> with the city's first muster being called up for the Boer War using the site for that purpose, as well as for World Wars I and II. The site was also a main site for rallies of demonstrations by the unemployed and labour organizations in the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|The term Communities of Practice (CoPs) {{was coined}} by Lave and Wenger during their {{research}} on apprenticeship from 1988. They considered some studies carried done with participants from very different backgrounds and cultures; {{such as those}} of Maya midwives in Yucatan, Vai and Gola tailors in Liberia, U. S. Navy boatswains’ <b>drill-grounds,</b> butchers of some American supermarkets and among the members of Alcoholics Anonymous Association. The common denominator of these studies, according to Lave and Wenger, is the presence of learning mechanisms not surveyed before by others scholars and not connected with the direct interaction between apprentice and master, but with the participation to a practice shared with other actors such as other apprentices, masters and journey folks. Lave and Wenger have therefore considered learning as something strictly linked to the social practice. They have observed the mechanism, defined as Legitimate Peripheral Participation, according to which the apprentices are considered members of the community, that they call Community of Practice. This mechanism legitimizes the apprentices so they are permitted to share resources and experiences of the Community of Practice and to take part in discussions and to have an equal interaction with senior experts. Based in an academic background, dealing with issues connected to the study of language and social interactions, the CoPs have quickly come into the business world where they are becoming successful serving as support strategies for training by e-learning, Knowledge Management tools and, in general, development perspectives for studies on organizational learning...|$|R
60|$|We {{passed into}} the zone of another army and a hillier country, where the border villages lay more sheltered. Here and there a town and the fields round it gave us {{a glimpse of the}} furious {{industry}} with which France makes and handles material and troops. With her, as with us, the wounded officer of experience goes back to the <b>drill-ground</b> to train the new levies. But it was always the little crowded, defiant villages, and the civil population waiting unweariedly and cheerfully on the unwearied, cheerful army, that went closest to the heart. Take these pictures, caught almost anywhere during a journey: A knot of little children in difficulties with the village water-tap or high-handled pump. A soldier, bearded and fatherly, or young and slim and therefore rather shy of the big girls' chaff, comes forward and lifts the pail or swings the handle. His reward, from the smallest babe swung high in air, or, if he is an older man, pressed against his knees, is a kiss. Then nobody laughs.|$|E
60|$|My {{opinion in}} respect to epic poetry {{is much the same}} as the critic whom Lucien Buonaparte has quoted in his preface. Epic poetry, of the highest class, {{requires}} in the first place an action eminently influential, an action with a grand or sublime train of consequences; it next requires the intervention and guidance of beings superior to man, what the critics I believe call machinery; and, lastly, I think with Dennis, that no subject but a religious one can answer the demand of the soul in the highest class of this species of poetry. Now Tasso's is a religious subject, and in my opinion, a most happy one; but I am confidently of opinion that the movement of Tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject; nor do I think it possible that written in stanzas it should. The celestial movement cannot, I think, be kept up, if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every eight lines. Spenser's stanza is infinitely finer than the ottaca rhima, but even Spenser's will not allow the epic movement as exhibited by Homer, Virgil, and Milton. How noble is the first paragraph of the Aeneid in point of sound, compared with the first stanza of the Jerusalem Delivered! The one winds with the majesty of the Conscript Fathers entering the Senate House in solemn procession; and the other has the pace of a set of recruits shuffling on the <b>drill-ground,</b> and receiving from the adjutant or drill-serjeant the commands to halt at every ten or twenty steps. Farewell.|$|E
60|$|Strange, stony Cagliari. We {{climbed up}} a street like a {{corkscrew}} stairway. And we saw announcements of a children's fancy-dress ball. Cagliari is very steep. Half-way up {{there is a}} strange place called the bastions, a large, level space like a <b>drill-ground</b> with trees, curiously suspended over the town, and sending off a long shoot like a wide viaduct, across above the corkscrew street that comes climbing up. Above this bastion place the town still rises steeply to the Cathedral and the fort. What is so curious is that this terrace or bastion is so large, like some big recreation ground, that it is almost dreary, and one cannot understand its being suspended in mid-air. Down below is the little circle of the harbour. To the left a low, malarial-looking sea plain, with tufts of palm trees and Arab-looking houses. From this runs out the long spit of land towards that black-and-white watch-fort, the white road trailing forth. On the right, most curiously, a long strange spit of sand runs in a causeway far across the shallows of the bay, with the open sea on one hand, and vast, end-of-the-world lagoons on the other. There are peaky, dark mountains beyond this--just as across the vast bay are gloomy hills. It is a strange, strange landscape: as if here the world left off. The bay is vast in itself; and all these curious things happening at its head: this curious, craggy-studded town, like a great stud of house-covered rock jutting {{up out of the}} bay flats: around it on one side the weary, Arab-looking palm-desolated malarial plain, {{and on the other side}} great salt lagoons, dead beyond the sand-bar: these backed again by serried, clustered mountains, suddenly, while away beyond the plain, hills rise to sea again. Land and sea both seem to give out, exhausted, at the bay head: the world's end. And into this world's end starts up Cagliari, and on either side, sudden, serpent-crest hills.|$|E
5000|$|The Taksim Gezi Park {{is located}} at the former site of the Halil Pasha Artillery Barracks, a large {{square-shaped}} military barracks complex with an extensive open, <b>drill-ground,</b> which was constructed in 1806 near the [...] "Frank and Armenian burial grounds", or the former Grand Champs des Morts.|$|E
