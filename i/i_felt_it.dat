5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
25|$|In {{my opinion}} {{the two great}} players were jealous of one another. There were times in the series when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> {{was not so much}} a battle between England and Australia as a battle between Bradman and Hammond.|$|E
25|$|I {{think back}} to Poirot’s last words in the scene before he dies. That second ‘Cher ami’ was for someone other than Hastings. It was for my dear, dear friend Poirot. I was saying goodbye to him as well — and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> with all my heart.|$|E
6000|$|This was a {{proposition}} Strether couldn't contradict. [...] "And yet what other way could I have expressed to her what <b>I</b> <b>felt?</b> <b>It's</b> {{what there was}} most to say about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mistress Affery negatived {{each with}} a shake of her head. 'No, Jeremiah; <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> before. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> up-stairs, and once on the {{staircase}} as I was going from her room to ours in the night--a rustle and a sort of trembling touch behind me.' ...|$|R

25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} and still {{by the end}} of the war, {{considerable}} controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if anyone, was to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to review all the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a 'staff appreciation' of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I 'read it with increasing wonder till at last <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> my duty to convey to the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict'. The account was classified as 'secret' and yet another version was commissioned, the 'Admiralty Narrative'. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty's, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.|$|E
500|$|In March 1996, Collins {{announced}} his departure from Genesis. In a statement, he said, [...] "Having been in Genesis for 25 years, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> {{time to change}} direction in my musical life. For me now, it will be music for movies, some jazz projects, and of course my solo career. I wish the guys in Genesis all the very best in their future. We remain the best of friends." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{a guilty}} pang--in truth, <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> forty times before that tramp had {{traveled}} {{a block from}} my door--but still I resolved to make a show of feeling slandered; so I said: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Malamor <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> awful. <b>It</b> made me {{remember}} the movie Cat People, with that mixture of sensuality and fierceness within a fantasy.|$|R
500|$|Williams {{called his}} {{scene at the}} end of the episode with The Smoking Man one of his {{favorite}} scenes he performed on the show. Rob Bowman was happy with the final product and said, [...] "I dug the script. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a good old-fashioned show, and people who didn't like 'Jose Chung's From Outer Space' would like 'Wetwired' because all the bad boys are back. A good clean steak-and-potatoes type of episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Wood {{received}} an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, as he told Boult, [...] "it was hard to refuse, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{a sudden}} it was kicking off, big time. Everyone started piling in, right in front of me... The only people not {{involved}} were [...] John Lukic, Tony Adams, David O'Leary and me... I went over to break things up... and spotted the cavalry coming over the half-way line, in the shape of O'Leary and Adams. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was my job to head them off at the pass and moved in, instinctively grabbing Adams with one hand and thumping him with the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why are {{you always}} {{knocking}} him about, Dominic?" [...] I asked. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> convinced <b>it</b> was no earthly good--a sheer waste of muscular force.|$|R

500|$|Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi: An old A-list horror film actor whom Ed {{brings back}} into the spotlight. Rick Baker created the {{prosthetic}} makeup designs. Baker did not use extensive make-up applications, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion. For research, Landau watched 25 of Lugosi's films and seven interviews between the years of 1931 and 1956. Landau {{did not want to}} deliver an over-the-top performance. [...] "Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> had to be Lugosi's theatricality, not mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Speechless" [...] after a water balloon {{fight with}} {{children}} in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I hate to say that, because it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be {{good enough for the}} album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity." [...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E
500|$|Paolini said [...] "Brisingr" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} words he thought of for the book's title, as it was the first Ancient Language word that Eragon learned in the series, and it holds a {{particular}} significance for him. Unlike the first two books in the series, Brisingr has a subtitle: The Seven Promises of Eragon Shadeslayer and Saphira Bjartskular. Paolini revealed it in a newsletter at his official website, in which he said that it was added [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> suited the story, and also because, in a way, I still view Brisingr and Book Four as two halves of the same volume; the subtitle is merely the name of the first of these two sections." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pauline," [...] he said, [...] "you send me away easily. Let me {{tell you}} one of the hard {{thoughts}} I have in my mind--one {{of the things that has}} tortured me.

There has been nothing tangible, and yet <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>it.</b> Answer me, honestly. Is this true? Is what I have told you, after all, something of a relief?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it." [...] Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the [...] "most-watched new original series [...] in more than 18 months" [...] according to The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E
500|$|After Bryant and Scott {{departed}} the project, director Philip Kaufman {{tried to}} re-write the story, with the resulting treatment heavily inspired by Olaf Stapledon's books Last and First Men and Star Maker. He later described this version as being [...] "less 'cult-ish' {{and more of}} an adult movie, dealing with sexuality and wonders rather than oddness". He intended this version to feature Spock facing off against a Klingon nemesis, A role for whom Kaufman wanted Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Kaufman explained {{that it would have}} featured the two undergoing a psychedelic experience and summed it up by saying that [...] "I'm sure the fans would have been upset, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> could really open up a new type of science fiction." [...] While Povill had felt that Bryant and Scott's treatment was unsuccessful, he thought that Kaufman's was worse.|$|E
500|$|We {{all know}} that steel making has been {{important}} to south Wales, just as slate making has changed {{the landscape of the}} north. We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, {{averaging}} 18.1 points, 14.3 {{rebounds and}} 2.4 assists per game. Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA {{title in the}} 1954 NBA Finals, making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69. At {{the end of the}} season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: [...] "I had a family growing, and I decided to be with them. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball." [...] Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.|$|E
500|$|Fleming stated he was {{impressed}} by Love's [...] "focus and intensity," [...] especially while recording vocals for one song when Love [...] "literally ripped her clothes off while she sang". [...] "Courtney was amazing", said Fleming. [...] "She was the most gung-ho person I've ever met. She {{was going to make}} the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio. Courtney was like 'Let's go, fuckers', and I loved that." [...] In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was before she even knew Kurt [...] She gave 180%. I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal. They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> really captured what they were.|$|E
500|$|Balukas {{was greatly}} incensed over the {{sanction}} {{and refused to}} pay on principle, turning away offers by others to pay the fine in her stead. Balukas explains that [...] "It wasn’t the $200... pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, {{were the ones who}} decided I should be fined. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors." [...] The sides were at an impasse. Balukas refused to relent and the WPBA refused to lift the sanction and would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid the fine. [...] "Just because she was our premier player doesn't mean she was above the rules," [...] said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Professional Loree Jon Jones in the same interview expressed mixed sentiments: [...] "Her not playing is, I guess, sad," [...] but she reflected that in Balukas's absence, [...] "we've all learned how to win." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby laughed drowsily and {{stretched}} his aching limbs. [...] "I really believe I am, though <b>I</b> scarcely <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> until this moment. What are you sitting up for, Hetty?" ...|$|R
