40|$|Summary. [...] Low-speed {{tests have}} been carried out on a family of three {{single-stage}} compressors of different diameter ratios. The simple blade design tested showed considerable variations of performance as the diameter ratio was decreased from 0. 65 to 0. 35 but most of these variations are predictable by simple means and it is expected that they may be partially avoided by appropriate design methods. It is recommended that low-stagger constant ~ 3 stages of low diameter ratio should be designed on the basis of radial equilibrium after the inlet <b>guide</b> <b>blades.</b> In the interests of minimizing the loss of working range at low diameter ratios, at least the outer half of the blades should be designed as far below nominal conditions as other considerations allow. The performance of such stages is fairly well estimated by integration of the strip performances of the various sections of the blade, though further information is necessary to fully define the work-done characteristic. Evidence is shown that the establishment of radial equilibrium demands an axial distance which increases considerably with decreasing diameter ratio, and it is suggested that conditions upstream of a stator-blade row are influenced by conditions required for radial equilibrium downstream of that row. 1. Introduction. [...] In the application of the gas turbine to the high-speed-aircraft field, where the Overall diameter of the engine, becomes of great importance, designers are continually tempted to increase the air mass flow per unit frontal area of the engine by decreasing the hub diamete...|$|E

Furthermore, when at any section of the passages the water pressure under the vapor pressure a cavitations will occur. In this study, the pressure of flowing water throughout the blade passages were measured at four sections along the passages by using four mercury deflection manometers and conditions of the flowing water were recorded by using a stroboscope and camera. The turbine was operated at 5 different heads with the same <b>guide</b> <b>blade</b> openings. Water pressures at the inlet and outlet turbine were measured by a Bourdon manometer of each.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conventional}} Savonius turbine {{is a good}} {{concept for}} small size wind-renewable energy systems; unfortunately always it has low efficiency. Inspired from the Savonius Blade, this research project designed the diffuser form as compartment between S blade and Tandem Blade of Savonius to produce “jet flow” through narrow gap on the advancing blade in order to rotate more powerful the returning blade. The reason to change the air (wind) by using water as working fluid {{is to increase the}} body force (BF) which works on the blade due to increasing the density of fluid. The new model of Hydrokinetic Cross Flow Vertical Axis Turbine (CROSSVAT) is developed from Savonius S rotor with using Savonius Diffuser Blade (SDB) and moving deflector (<b>guide</b> <b>blade).</b> The function of SDB is to increase the velocity ratio on narrow gap (Rcv) also the drag force on surface of blades.

40|$|Fish {{is one of}} Norway’s main exports, and can {{be shipped}} fresh, frozen or dried. This thesis {{examines}} the freezing of fish in batch tunnels and ways to increase the energy efficiency of this process. A fish freezing plant {{on the west coast}} of Norway was used as a baseline case and measurements were made of the freezing system. Different aspects of this system were simulated, mainly using MATLAB. The focus was on the compressors and the freezing tunnels of an industrial refrigeration system. The compressors and the freezing tunnel fans are the largest consumers of electricity, but they are often not operated at the highest efficiency. An analysis of the compressor operation showed that it was far from optimal, with several compressors often operating at part-load simultaneously. These were screw compressors regulated by slide valves, which provide easy capacity control, but also have low energy efficiency. The refrigeration system had several different sized compressors, and the results showed {{that it was possible to}} run the system with only one compressor at part-load operation. The total coefficient of performance was improved by as much as 29 % for a low production period. A further analysis showed that installing a variable speed drive on one compressor would also improve energy efficiency and make capacity regulation straightforward. The freezing system included five batch freezing tunnels, each of which had a freezing capacity of more than 100 tonnes of pelagic fish. A typical freezing period lasted typically 20 h and decreased the fish temperature to - 18 ◦C or below. The main task was to develop a computer program that could simulate the freezing process and the refrigeration system and locate opportunities for improvement. The air velocities inside the freezing tunnel varied with location, which were pinpointed using the computational fluid dynamics software program Airpak. These velocities were used in freezing time calculations. It was shown that a <b>guide</b> <b>blade</b> installed in the air flow at a critical location improved the air velocity distribution compared with no <b>guide</b> <b>blade.</b> Without the <b>guide</b> <b>blade,</b> the freezing times of the products were between 16 h and 32 h, but with a <b>guide</b> <b>blade</b> they were between 17 h and 21 h, a span of only 4 h. These freezing times were calculated with a modified Plank’s equation. A numerical model was programmed in MATLAB and it was used to simulate the temperatures of the products. The model was a two-dimensional finite difference approximation of the heat conduction equation. The simulation results were compared to measured temperatures, to validate the model. The measured temperatures were also used for validation of another simulation program, programmed in Modelica. The final stage of this research involved testing different alternatives for reduced fan operation. The program for the product model was extended with models for calculating the energy consumption of the air fans and the compressors and using Airpak-simulated velocities. The air fan speed was reduced to 83 %, 67 %, 50 % and 33 % of full air fan speed. This was tested at 5 different points during the freezing period, to see how the freezing times were affected. Full air speed during the freezing period resulted in a total freezing time of 20 h. A reduction in air fan speed to 33 % after 8 h resulted in an increase in total freezing time of 10 hours (47 % longer) but reduced energy consumption to 73. 8 % of the baseline case. An alternative with only 4 h longer freezing time resulted in an energy consumption of 80. 5 % of the baseline case. It was assumed that the fans had variable speed drives. The effect of reduced air inlet temperature was also tested and the results show that this can reduce freezing times. The effect on the total energy consumption was not large and also depends on the rest of the refrigeration system. Issues raised by this thesis are relevant for future research. It is suggested that the main simulation program is expanded by incorporating more detailed models of the refrigeration system. Dynamic operation of the air fans is also a possibility, for example to gradually reduce fan speed with decreasing product heat load.

40|$|The {{diffuser}} inlet width {{is a key}} geometric parameter {{that affects}} submersible pump performance. On the basis of diffuser characteristic curve analyses, diffusers with different inlet widths and the same impeller were equipped to construct a submersible pump model {{through the use of}} AutoCAD software. The performance curves of the submersible pump, with six diffuser inlet widths, were obtained using computational fluid dynamics method. Simultaneously, the simulation results were tested with the experimental method presented in this article. The results show that the optimum value of the inlet width (b 3 [*]=[*] 50 [*]mm) is larger than the experience-based one. With an increase in the inlet width, the optimum operating point of a submersible pump offsets to a larger flow rate. When the <b>guide</b> <b>blade</b> inlet width is approximately 40 – 55 [*]mm, the submersible pump efficiency is relatively high, approximately 75. 9 %– 83. 7 % capacity, and the flow rate is approximately 105 – 135 [*]m 3 /h.

50|$|The origin is debated, but a chainsaw-like tool {{was made}} around 1830 by the German {{orthopaedist}} Bernhard Heine. This instrument, the osteotome, had links {{of a chain}} carrying small cutting teeth with the edges set at an angle; the chain was moved around a <b>guiding</b> <b>blade</b> by turning the handle of a sprocket wheel. As the name implies, this was used to cut bone.The prototype of the chain saw familiar today in the timber industry was pioneered in the late 18th century by two Scottish doctors, John Aitken and James Jeffray, for symphysiotomy and excision of diseased bone respectively. The chain hand saw, a fine serrated link chain which cut on the concave side, was invented around 1783-1785. It was illustrated in Aitken's Principles of Midwifery or Puerperal Medicine (1785) and used by him in his dissecting room. Jeffray claimed to have conceived {{the idea of the}} chain saw independently about that time but it was 1790 before he was able to have it produced. In 1806, Jeffray published Cases of the Excision of Carious Joints by H. Park and P. F. Moreau with Observations by James Jeffray M.D. In this communication he translated Moreau's paper of 1803. Park and Moreau described successful excision of diseased joints, particularly the knee and elbow. Jeffray explained that the chain saw would allow a smaller wound and protect the adjacent neurovascular bundle. While a heroic concept, symphysiotomy had too many complications for most obstetricians but Jeffray's ideas became accepted, especially after the development of anaesthetics. Mechanised versions of the chain saw were developed but in the later 19th Century, it was superseded in surgery by the Gigli twisted wire saw. For much of the 19th century, however, the chain saw was a useful surgical instrument.|$|R
