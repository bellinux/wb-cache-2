5|$|Opabinia regalis is an extinct, stem group {{arthropod}} {{found in}} the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of Opabinia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. Opabinia was a soft-bodied animal of modest size, and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: <b>five</b> <b>eyes,</b> a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. Opabinia probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.|$|E

25|$|The closest links of the U.S. IC {{to other}} foreign {{intelligence}} agencies are to Anglophone countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. There {{is a special}} communications marking that signals that intelligence-related messages can be shared with these four countries. An indication of the United States' close operational cooperation {{is the creation of}} a new message distribution label within the main U.S. military communications network. Previously, the marking of NOFORN (i.e., No Foreign Nationals) required the originator to specify which, if any, non-U.S. countries could receive the information. A new handling caveat, USA/AUS/CAN/GBR/NZL <b>Five</b> <b>Eyes,</b> used primarily on intelligence messages, gives an easier way to indicate that the material can be shared with Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|A novel Boolean Map based Saliency (BMS) {{model is}} proposed. An image is {{characterized}} by a set of binary images, which are generated by randomly thresholding the image’s color channels.
