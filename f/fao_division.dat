Six Watertec 30 and six Watertec 24 machines were shipped over the term of the contract and together with commissioning services, Dando also offered a full training package {{which resulted in the}} setting up of drilling schools {{in each of the three}} provinces of Northern Iraq.

40|$|The {{common octopus}} Octopus vulgarisCuvier, 1797 {{is the most}} fished {{cephalopod}} species along the Spanish coasts. Its catches are highly fluctuating due to the short life cycle of the species and to the annual variability of the recruitment pattern, strongly dependent on the environmental conditions affecting the eggs and paralarvae. This study examines the common octopus fishery, the catch composition, and the main features of the reproductive biology of this species in the Gulf of Alicante (Spanish Eastern coast, Western Mediterranean <b>FAO</b> <b>division</b> 37. 1. 1). The common octopus fishery was studied analysing the monthly landing and effort data by fishing gear from 1994 to 2005. Monthly samplings of the commercial O. vulgarislandings from trawlers and clay pots from January 2004 to December 2005 resulted in the measuring of 1833 specimens to enable analysis of the catch composition, and allowed the biological sampling of 1176 individuals to provide the reproductive parameters of the species {{in the study area}}. The length-weight relationship calculated for the species was BW = 0. 51 * DML 2. 87. The yearly sex ratios (males:females) were 1 : 1 (trawl, 2004), 1 : 0. 74 (trawl, 2005), and 1 : 0. 88 (clay pots, 2005). The size (dorsal mantle length, DML) at maturity of the species in the study area was 9. 67 cm for males and 14. 38 cm for females. The gonadosomatic index reached a peak between April and July for males and in July for females. The Fulton condition index was lower in both sexes between June and September, and for males in November-December, whereas for both sexes the values of the digestive gland index were at their maximum between June and December. The energy allocation between somatic and reproductive growth was investigated and the results suggested that the energy spent on reproduction mainly came from feeding, and not from energy stored in the mantle tissues or in the digestive glan...|$|E

This paper provides and overview of the major components of the proposed FAO Statistical data quality assessment and monitoring framework and the integration of it into the statistical process. Since the early 1990 ’s, the <b>FAO</b> Statistics <b>Division</b> has been developing data quality frameworks and concepts relating to agricultural statistics. The initial work outlined in the paper by Trant (1993), focused on the concepts of accuracy, relevance and timeliness of a statistical estimate. It also discussed the need for sound statistical metadata in order for the user to be able to interpret the statistics. This approach was primarily aimed at national statistical offices and the need to make them accountable for data they publish. More recently, the <b>FAO</b> Statistics <b>Division</b> has begun using a data quality dimensions very similar to that of Eurostat (2000). In addition to the core Eurostat data quality dimensions, a statistical metadata component was included. The statistical metadata component has been consolidated under the Agricultural Bulletin Board on Data Collection, Dissemination and Quality of Statistics project (ABCDQ) which focuses on national agricultural data that comes into the <b>FAO</b> Statistics <b>Division.</b> 2. Data flow and quality After reviewing the earlier work undertaken in FAO, a more comprehensive data quality evaluation and monitoring framework was developed. The approach is based on monitoring data quality at three points in the statistical process (q 1, q 2, and q 3), as well as the change in data quality between points q 1 and q 2 and between points q 2 and q 3 (see figure 1) ...|$|R

Risk management {{is at the heart of}} these farmers' livelihoods. Advisers and researchers working with them need to be familiar with appropriate techniques to confront the burden of the risks and uncertainties which fill their daily lives. Risk analysis in dryland farming, systems sets out guidelines which are intended to cater for the interests of a diversity of potential readers. The introductory chapter sets out a broad philosophical position through a general discussion of risk in dryland farming systems, and gives an overview of the purpose of the work. Chapter 2 contains arguments for the need to consider risk in analysis of dryland farming systems. This need is considered from several perspectives and several different fevers of management from producer through to government. Methods for analysing risk are introduced more formally in the topics covered in Chapter 3. Just how farming systems can be designed with due allowance for the prevalence of risk is addressed in the final Chapter 4. There the discussion is pitched at several levels, ranging from particular projects within particular farming systems, to more general issues m agricultural policy and planning.
