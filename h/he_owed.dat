5|$|Alexander was {{nominated}} to the see of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, {{at a ceremony}} held in Canterbury. <b>He</b> <b>owed</b> his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the Peterborough version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted that Alexander's elevation to the episcopate was done entirely {{for the love of}} Roger.|$|E
5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} very angry when they see it. I cannot {{understand}} why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> so much {{and the whole thing}} is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.|$|E

6000|$|He {{is full of}} {{his idea}} of dignity. It is right for every man to {{preserve}} his dignity. There is a dignity of station, which a man has in trust to preserve; there is a dignity of personal character, which every man by being made man is bound to preserve. But you see Mr. Hastings's idea of dignity has no connection with integrity; it has no connection with honest fame; it has no connection with the reputation which he is bound to preserve. What, my Lords, did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to the Company that had appointed him? Did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to the legislature,--did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to your Lordships, and to the House of Commons, who had appointed him? Did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to himself? to the country that bore him? Did <b>he</b> <b>owe</b> nothing to the world, as to its opinion, to which every public man owes a reputation? What an example was here held out to the Company's servants! ...|$|R
50|$|Don {{has another}} {{flashback}} to Christmas with Anna some years ago. He tells her he has met {{the woman he}} wants to marry, so he needs to divorce Anna. He tells her {{he is going to}} take care of her forever because <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> her his whole life. She declares <b>he</b> <b>owes</b> her nothing.|$|R
5|$|Lynch was a {{one-time}} tax delinquent. In the mid-1980s {{the city of}} Boston placed liens on four properties he owned due to several thousand dollars of unpaid property taxes. <b>He</b> <b>owed</b> $2,000 in overdue taxes {{to the state of}} Massachusetts from 1985 to 1998, and for several years owed $4,000 to the federal IRS.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Augvald {{had several}} daughters, {{including}} two who notably fought alongside him as so-called shield-maidens, or female warriors. He owned and worshipped a sacred cow, which he always kept with him, believing <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> his victories to the cow {{and the power}} of its milk. Augvald was killed during a battle with his rival Ferking, the native king of western Karmøy, with whom his story is interlinked.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the film}} was advertised as being based on Anita King's real cross country trip in a roadster, the film {{actually}} follows the adventures of a man (Victor Moore) trying to win money in a transcontinental car race to pay back debt <b>he</b> <b>owes.</b> <b>He</b> eventually realizes that Grace (Anita King) needs money for her father and intentionally lets her win. The man gets money from an engine patent in the end anyway and that covers what <b>he</b> <b>owes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> his mother 50,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Stigand first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to King Cnut of England (reigned 1016–1035). In that year he was appointed to Cnut's church at Ashingdon, or Assandun, which was dedicated by the reforming bishop Wulfstan of York. Little is known of Stigand's life during Cnut's reign, but {{he must have had}} a place at the royal court, as he witnessed occasional charters. Following Cnut's death Stigand successively served Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot (reigned 1035–1040) and Harthacnut (reigned 1040–1042). After Harthacnut died Stigand became an advisor to Emma of Normandy, Cnut's widow and the mother of Harthacnut and his successor Edward the Confessor. He may have been Emma's chaplain, and it is possible that Stigand was already one of her advisors while Cnut was alive, and that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> his position at Ashingdon to Emma's influence and favour. Because little is known of Stigand's activities before his appointment as a bishop, {{it is difficult to determine}} to whom <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> his position.|$|E

5|$|Swakeleys manor, {{subordinate}} to Ickenham, {{was named after}} Robert Swalcliffe, who owned the manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century. He appears in records as Robert de Swalclyve and Robert de Wykeham, reflecting his ownership of Swakeleys and Wickham Park in Oxfordshire. In 1347, <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> £40 to a money lender, Roger Rikeman, which {{he was unable to}} pay, and so his land in Ickenham was passed by Rikeman in 1350 to John de Charlton.|$|E
5|$|William {{may have}} owed his {{advancement}} in royal service to Geoffrey fitzPeter, a royal judge. In 1197 he granted William a manor at Sutton-at-Hone, Kent, which later {{was supposed to}} become a hospital, but instead eventually became a preceptory for the Knights Hospitaller. From 1197 William {{was responsible for the}} collection of revenues from Geoffrey's lands at Lydford, Devon, and held the office of chief forester of Somerset; it is unclear to whom <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> that position.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} ill, he was imprisoned—after {{struggling}} with debts and haunted {{by the threat of}} ruin and imprisonment all his life—"for a wretched debt of 150 Rdr". The rumour was that a former Customs colleague, E. G. Nobelius, had had his advances to Louise Bellman rejected, and in revenge had sued Bellman for the debt, knowing he was penniless: <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> a total of almost 4,000 Riksdaler. On 11February 1795, he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla Kungsholmsbrogatan. He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone, its location now unknown. The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851, complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{was later}} named Archdeacon of Oxford in the Lincoln diocese, {{sometime}} before 1 October 1151, owing the appointment to Chesney. He {{was also a}} canon of Hereford Cathedral, appearing in that capacity in 1173, but it is unclear when exactly he acquired the position. It is also unclear whether <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> this position to his relative Gilbert Foliot, who was bishop of Hereford from 1148 to 1163, or if he received the canonry after 1163 through royal influence. Foliot served as a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, witnessing three documents for Becket during the period 1162–1164.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{appointed}} to the office of Sheriff of Surrey early in the reign of King Richard I. He was also Sheriff of Kent during Richard's reign, in 1190 as well as one of the Sheriffs of London from 1187 to 1189. Henry was only one of six sheriffs that retained office after the accession of Richard I. <b>He</b> <b>owed</b> his appointments to the influence of William Longchamp, Richard's chancellor. He was also Warden of the Mint in 1191. Henry lost his offices when Longchamp fell from favour in 1192. He died sometime between Michaelmas 1192 and Michaelmas 1193.|$|E
5|$|In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The {{following}} year William Wallace and Andrew Murrey raised forces {{to resist the}} occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Murrey died of wounds after the battle and {{for a short time}} Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 he fell {{into the hands of the}} English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> no allegiance to England.|$|E

5|$|In 1826, Holmboe was {{appointed}} a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University. Some claimed that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> his appointment to Abel's absence, {{as the latter}} was travelling around in Europe at that time. Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include Stereometrie (Stereometry) (1833), Plan- og sfærisk Trigonometrie (Plan and Spherical Trigonometry) (1834), and Lærebog i den høiere Mathematik (Textbook of Advanced Mathematics) (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818).|$|E
5|$|In 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa, Agneta Matthes found {{a letter}} from Maria Eringaard {{requesting}} the child support that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> for their children, which led to Matthes discovering {{that her husband had}} begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, and that he had four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did not tell van Markem that she knew about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that <b>he</b> <b>owed</b> US$32,000,000. In {{addition to the}} unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E
