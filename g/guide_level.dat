A soil at Johnstown Castle under Fallow management gave mean NO 3 -N drainage water concentrations >MAC (maximum admissible concentration, 11. 3 mg/l) in the 10 th, 11 th, 12 th and 13 th years of cultivation. In the 14 t h year this changed as the Fallow treatment showed a mean value MAC. On the same soil, barley receiving 120 kg N/ha fertiliser N, showed variable results - soil drainage water concentrations were MAC in another year; the mean values were the <b>Guide</b> <b>Level.</b> Winter wheat receiving 150 kg N/ha as fertiliser had all soil drainage water concentrations the <b>Guide</b> <b>Level.</b> Cultivating the soil, in order to re-sow grass, produced a large release of organic N via mineralisation and this combined with a small fertiliser N input (50 kg/ha) gave very high concentrations of NO 3 -N in the drainage water. A delay in sowing from June {{to the end of}} September exacerbated this problem. The final phase of experimentation showed very low levels of NO 3 - N in the drainage water which was primarily induced by decreasing fertiliser N input to 200 kg/ha and slurry N input to 50 kg/ha. Five soils, representative of major Irish soils, were subjected to lysimeter trials in a similar manner under grass. In the first experiment the soils received 300 kg/ha fertiliser N plus approximately 120 kg N/ha as pig or cattle slurry. In Years 1, 2, when mean values were pooled over treatments, MAC was breached 2, 3 times by Clonroche; 5, 3 times by Elton, 1, 2 times by Oakpark; 5 times and once by Rathangan soil drainage water. Applying cattle or pig slurry in December with fertiliser N, applied during the growing season, gave the highest number of water samples in breach of MAC. Reducing the fertiliser N to 200 kg/ha and the slurry N to 51 kg/ha drastically lowered the NO 3 -N concentrations in the drainage water to sustainable levels. Cultivation followed by Fallow for 3 months prior to sowing grass gave very high NO 3 -N concentrations in all soil drainage waters. Due to recycling of N via animal excreta, greater leaching of NO 3 - N is likely to occur on grazed grass receiving identical N inputs.

40|$|In the Netherlands, the {{functional}} approach {{described in the}} 2008 European Asphalt Concrete standards was selected, specifying mixtures by their stiffness, fatigue resistance, permanent deformation, moisture sensitivity and limited composition data. The requirements for {{the functional}} specifications {{were based on the}} existing experience with a large number of mixes. Since the introduction of the standards, unexpected developments like improved performance in all functional tests with increasing RAP content, led to questions about the predictive quality of the laboratory determined functional characteristics for field performance and the potential causes of a mis-match between lab and practice. These questions led to a large, long term project in the Netherlands (NL-LAB) in which the functional characteristics are determined in the process of construction projects. They are determined on (I) material mixed and compacted in the lab, (II) mixed in the plant and compacted in the lab and (III) mixed in the plant and compacted in the road. These tests will eventually provide insight in the effect of mixing and compaction. The pavement sections are monitored in time, to allow the link with pavement performance. The sections will be sampled during their service life to see changes occur in their functional properties. For the road industry, that tries to guarantee pavement performance by accurate selection of materials, the possibility of design information based on both laboratory and in situ results would be beneficial. Two mixes for base layers with different mix compositions and amounts of RAP are analysed using formalistic expressions originating from Design <b>Guide</b> <b>Level</b> II for estimation of various performance indicators. This project uses expressions to analyse the differences between the mixes in the three cases described above. It addresses the possibility of utilizing these expressions during preliminary mix design to guide the selection of mix composition parameters towards a desired optimum. Pavement Engineerin...|$|E

This work {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the tritium retention for graphite tiles inside the vacuum vessel and tritium release characteristics in the tritium cleanup operations. JT- 60 U has carried out D-D experiments since July 1991. In the deuterium operations during the first two years, about 1. 7 x 1019 D-D fusion neutrons were produced by D(d,p) T reactions in plasma, which are expected to produce ～ 31 GBq of tritium. The tritium produced is evacuated by a pumping system. A part of tritium is, however, trapped in the graphite tiles. Several sample tiles were removed from the vessel and the retained tritium distribution in the tiles was measured using a liquid scintillator. The results of poloidal distribution showed that the tritium concentration in the divertor tiles was higher than that in the first wall tiles and it peaked in the tiles between two strike points of divertor magnetic lines. Tritium concentration in the exhaust gas from the vessel have also been measured with an ion chamber during the tritium cleanup operations with hydrogen divertor discharges and He-GDC. Total of recovered tritium during the cleanup operations was ～ 7 % of that generated. The results of these measurements showed that the tritium of 16 - 23 GBq still remained in the graphite tiles, which corresponded to about 50 - 70 % of the tritium generated in plasma.

40|$|The {{commercial}} sea kayaking {{sector of}} British Columbia’s tourism industry depends {{entirely on the}} pristine quality of the coastal environment. With more than 70, 000 visitors choosing BC waters for their wilderness kayaking holidays, the potential for anthropogenic impact on the ecosystem is an undeniable reality. This study addressed this concern by examining the actions and behaviours being applied by commercial sea kayak guides while escorting clients through this fragile ecosystem. Through the use of observations, surveys, and interviews a multiple method approach to research enabled this study to capture an in depth understanding of the environmental practices being used by commercial sea kayak guides in British Columbia. Undisclosed participant observations, allowed for the informative observation of seventeen guides to occur while minimizing the possibility of altered subject behaviour; the first guide observations of this kind in BC. This methodological approach was combined with a self-report survey of a larger sample of guides, which allowed {{for the inclusion of}} a greater spectrum of experiences and reported behaviours from active guides. Finally, a number of interviews with various industry professionals provided greater context surrounding actions, behaviours, and decisions made by those who operate in this industry. The seventeen guides observed in this study, along with survey respondents and interviewees, collectively demonstrated a great respect for the wilderness environment and expressed actively trying to manage their associated impacts. However, despite being unintentional, the inconsistent use and misapplication of low impact practices were identified among the studied guiding population. In some cases this resulted in unnecessary human impacts on the environment. Interactions with wildlife and general camp management were identified as areas that displayed common weaknesses among guides. These weaknesses {{came in the form of}} frequent deviations from the best management practices outlined for this activity and endorsed by the related professional organizations. Interviews and survey responses suggested that these differences between the suggested best management practices and the actual practices applied may be a result of misinformed guides or those not educated on the specific environment in which they operated. Supporting this notion, more than 70 % of the guides in this study encouraged the expansion of educational opportunities for current and upcoming guides; particularly in the form of workplace training which can accommodate regionally specific practices. Increasing the awareness of specific practices may result in more consistent use in the field setting. Overall this study concluded that the consistency with which best management practices were being used at a <b>guide</b> <b>level</b> could be increased to further reduce the ecological impact of guided sea kayak adventures in British Columbia. Through increased training and more effective implementation of low impact techniques among commercial guides, it is hoped that the anthropogenic impacts can be minimized, the visitor attraction be maintained, and the overall sustainability of this industry be secured well into the future. kayakingecotourismbest management practiceenvironmentmarine touris...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Evidence from {{laboratory}} studies suggests that air pollution can produce bronchoconstriction and respiratory symptoms in selected subjects, but {{the relevance of}} these findings to exposure to natural pollution is unclear. This study was performed to determine whether air pollution at typical levels found in the UK has demonstrable effects on respiratory function and symptoms in subjects with airways disease. METHODS [...] Seventy five adult patients with diagnoses of asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) were studied for a period of four weeks during which they kept records of their peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates, symptoms (wheeze, dyspnoea, cough, throat and eye irritation), and bronchodilator use. Thirty six patients in whom the provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 was below 12. 25 mumol were classified as reactors. Ambient air pollution was measured with absorption spectroscopy. RESULTS [...] There were modest but significant increases in PEF variability, bronchodilator use, and wheeze with increasing sulphur dioxide levels; bronchodilator use, dyspnoea, eye irritation, and minimum PEF readings were related to ozone levels. In the subgroup of reactors falls in mean and minimum peak flow and increases in wheeze, dyspnoea, and bronchodilator use were associated with increases in levels of both sulphur dioxide and ozone. Some associations were seen with pollution levels on the same day, but for others the pollution effects appeared to be delayed by 24 or 48 hours. Pollution levels did not breach the WHO <b>guide</b> <b>levels</b> {{during the course of the}} study.

40|$|Abstract. Accurate and {{consistent}} segmentation of infant brain MR images {{plays an important}} role in quantifying the early brain development, especially in longitudinal studies. However, due to rapid maturation and myelination of brain tissues in the first year of life, white-gray matter contrast undergoes dramatic changes. In fact, the contrast inverses around 6 months of age, where the white and gray matter tissues are isointense and hence exhibit the lowest contrast, posing significant challenges for segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel longitudinally <b>guided</b> <b>level</b> set method for segmentation of serial infant brain MR images, acquired from 2 weeks up to 1. 5 years of age. The proposed method makes optimal use of T 1, T 2 and the diffusion weighted images for complimentary tissue distribution information to address the difficulty caused by the low contrast. A longitudinally consistent term, which constrains the distance across the serial images within a biologically reasonable range, is employed to obtain temporally consistent segmentation results. The proposed method has been applied on 22 longitudinal infant subjects with promising results. ...|$|R
