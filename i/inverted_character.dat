Upon tuning the gate bias, measurement reveals the presence of two energy gaps in the spectrum.

40|$|And this is {{the final}} paradox: really to {{understand}} the grotesque is to cease to regard it as grotesque. ’ — Geoffrey Harpham, On the Grotesque. Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature (1982) This book, about a writer for whom it always {{remains to be seen}} whether she really is one, opens with some remarks about the presentation of her work as nonsense, as work that did not per se have to be seen or understood but to the contrary could stay in the dark, like the ornaments in hidden places in cathedrals. In 1981, when talking to H. A. Gomperts, F. [Fritzi] Harmsen van Beek described her writing literally as nonsense but she added that she loved to believe that 'it is indeed nonsense but I still do it, simply for the nonsense’. Gomperts replied that nonsense ‘has a slightly unusual meaning' in this case. The emphasis in this book is on the way in which F. Harmsen van Beek has `dis-covered' the nonsense of writing and interpreting; the way I use `dis-cover' here is the same as in Geoffrey Harpham's book On the Grotesque: in a grotesque way - that is, using the capricious, the irregular, the incompatible and the exaggerated - she exposes the inconsistent and hidden meanings of common concepts and wordings, so as to strip them of their impact and thus allows new ways of understanding. She has `dis-covered' concepts like writer, oeuvre, poetics, text and style, which have structured the thinking about literature in the post-war era. In a poetical manner she has undermined the fixed norms and values implicit in common thinking by replacing common wordings with ‘ambiguities’. She referred to her poetical method as a ‘Neerbraak’ (a Dutch neologism which might be translated with the German Abbau). She declared to want to 'move' her readers, but this word also has a slightly unusual meaning for her. In the light of the grotesque Abbau-tradition I studied her poetical texts, in which she explained her method, her poems and stories, as well as their reception. Specifically, I have defined this literary work as an inverted and provocative grotesque artefact in the first chapter of this book. In the first place it means that I have studied F. Harmsen van Beek's poetics and Abbau-method as well as her undermining and `dis-covering' work as options or variations within the grotesque (counter) tradition. This tradition (of which the history, incidentally, is only written in part) has shown remarkable periods in which the grotesque prospered along with long intervals of relative invisibility, as is discussed in chapter II. In the second place my perspective on the work as a grotesque artefact assumes that the attempts made by critics to assimilate this provocative artefact conflicted, owing to an incompatibility of the critic and author's assumptions with respect to the literary work. The analysis in chapter III of the attempts in the critiques to assimilate the literary work of F. Harmsen van Beek between 1965 and 1976 (the period central in this analysis) outlines this conflict with four differing approaches. I have described them as: a one; a one, a; and a approach. In all four cases the assumptions with respect to the literary work were found to be problematic as they considered the work of literature as a coherent structure or text, specifically written to express a coherent meaning. Moreover the assumptions regarding the author as the director of the meaning expressed was also found to be problematic. The attempts to understand the work of F. Harmsen van Beek in terms of what is referred to as a theory of reading failed. This was due to the assumptions regarding the coherence of meaning, in the light of which this work manifested itself as hugely incoherent and as a `hypertrophy' of the separate parts at the cost of the whole. The attempts to understand her poems in terms of a theory of reading were frustrated (as the poet and critic Hans Andreus also concluded) due to a conscious endeavour of the writer to subvert these attempts to find the author's personality in her work. The attempts to understand her in terms of a theory of reading failed due to a lack of psychological and causal coherence and consistency of the plots in her stories. The perpective resulted in the plots and characters seeming only rudimentarily and sketchily outlined and the narrative function seeming derailed. A turning point in the reception of her work seemed to be initiated by the publication of Neerbraak in 1970, when the collection of stories was described as by several famous critics (Fens, Fontijn, De Moor). They highlighted her deviant or style and story form. However, this new approach did not deliver any new results. Paradoxically enough, F. Harmsen van Beek proved not to fit in with the (then new) research on the grotesque either. This was largely a result of the line of thinking that was fundamental to this type of research. As the work of E. M. Beekman (1970) on the grotesque in Paul van Ostaijen's prose for example shows, the research of the sixties and seventies perceived the exclusively as a genre or style. This type of research was more or less designed to analyse the as a means to interpret the of the. It was imbedded in the (then new) discipline of text interpretation, which was autonomist or (as was stated then), which meant that it focused on the ergon - Greek for `work (of art) ' - solely. Due to its historical constraints, method and focus, the research on the grotesque found itself in a remarkably bad position towards its subject. This type of research had the fault that it forced itself to interpret the grotesque work of art. It put aside the characteristic problems of interpretation caused by this art. This was an unfortunate decision, as the meta-analysis in this book shows, for these problems are typical of the inverted relation of grotesque art with contemporary theories of reading, all of which prove to be (implicitly) poetically loaded. Contrary to older research, my book focuses on the relation outlined above and on problems of interpretation, evaluation, categorisation, classification and canonisation. As is explained in my Introduction, a clear distinction should be made between problems of interpretation at the (primary) level of reading (or criticism), and (related) problems of description and definition of the grotesque at the meta-level of literary theory. In the analysis of the writer's poetics in chapter IV, the problem is addressed of why a writer like F. Harmsen van Beek - euphorically read as a poet's poet, yet perceived as a sort of minor writer at the same time - was in the end only given a place in the margins of literature. My analysis shows that one of the reasons may be that her claims about how to be read and understood are far less obvious than normal. Her poetical utterances lack the imperative `Read me. Don't read the other fellows!' which, according to W. H. Auden, is implicit in most poetic explanations. In a way, she solicited for a misunderstanding (that is to say) being understood in ways unfit for her own work but common in her own time. Further research indicates that she claims a different function for art and (narrative) style than the (then new) approach to narrative, which also had a different perspective on the problem of mimesis altogether. In terms of classical narrative theories, F. Harmsen van Beek's work proved to be only more or less interpretation resistant, as is shown in chapter V. To analyse the typically <b>inverted</b> <b>character</b> of this work as such, implies: to show the presentation of das nicht-Vorstellungswürdige (Hans Robert Jauss) in her work. In other words: to analyse what is excluded from the (realistically or symbolically) represented domains of reality, yet is present in the poems and stories of F. Harmsen van Beek. A device used by this writer to represent the hidden is what she refers to as `dubbelzinnigheid' (ambiguousness). Contrary to that of writers in the realistic and symbolic tradition her method is secondary: she adapted their principles in an inverted way. Her grotesque method implies a downward swing in the words of Michael Mikhail Bahktin. To make the downward swing she specifically used the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic ambiguity. In many cases she used the innuendo or the sexual ambiguity. In chapters VI, VII and VII her method is analysed. Her method works as follows: the word's primary referent invites to construct a so-called referential and realistic interpretation (as is usual in our reading tradition), and there may be (as usual) an extra opportunity to transcend the referential in a metaphoric or symbolic-allegoric interpretation. Unique to this work (and to the grotesque) is the existence of a second referent, which is not at first apparent but manifests itself suddenly and induces that typical downward swing of all that is universal and elevated in the first interpretation: the abstract and trans-historical is made concrete and historical, physical, sexual and originally hidden. Thus the second referent, hiding in the well-chosen ambiguity, provokes the switching of reading strategy: readers switch from a referential and realistic interpretation to a hidden and forbidden interpretation. I believe the method, its working and effect to be characteristic for the grotesque aesthetic (counter) tradition and therefore studying the stories and poems of F. Harmsen van Beek under this tradition to be enlightening. Apart from the fact that its method is typically downward oriented (Mikhail Bahktin) and that its effect occurs all of a sudden (plötzlich, in the words of Wolfgang Kayser) and may indeed be experienced as a cognitive itch (Reuven Tsur) : even more essential is the fact that this work thus invites readers to enter the domains of the hidden, the unformed, the humble, the unclean and the forbidden. This work shows the things which are not vorstellungswürdig (in the terms of our representational traditions), yet are represented by means of Harmsen van Beek’s inverted method, though without being exposed as unclean or humble or ugly or something like that. To describe the method as grotesque does not mean that labelling the second - forbidden - interpretation as grotesque is unproblematic, for the work of art represents the experience of reality as defined by Aristotle (this is discussed in chapter VI). For the same reason labelling this work as grotesque is problematic. It seems more reasonable to define the relation between interpretations as grotesque, that is as far as the first interpretation is slightly ridiculous, gross, exaggerated and even a tiny bit laughable in the light of the second, as I have shown in chapters IV en VIII. Using Jury Lotman's terms, I refer to the relation between one artefact and two different aesthetic objects; they are constructed from two radically different aesthetic angles. Reading the work in terms of the aesthetics of the grotesque does not imply constructing a GROTESQUE interpretation. For, paradoxically, `really to understand the grotesque is to cease to regard it as grotesque', as Geoffrey Harpham concluded as well at the end of part I of his book on the grotesque. The conclusion is then that reading the literary work as a representation of the experience of reality (in Aristotelian terms) begins where reading it as a so-called `grotesque' representation of reality ends. This is not to say that the fact that this work is ambiguous and that the second referent is forbidden is of minor importance for an understanding of this work, its workings and its place in the social domain. For the sudden emergence of the second referent provokes the ambiguous, `pornographic' reading, one that cannot gain form without problems: on the one hand because of the unfamiliarity of the readers with (the conventions of) this domain, on the other hand because it is taboo. The fact that this type of reading did not gain form in the reception of this work does not mean that the possibility of this type of reading did not occur to her critics and admirers. It is difficult to legitimize its place in the public domain, to find a function and meaning for this type of reading, as I have pointed out in chapter VIII. The realisation of a second (so-called pornographic) reading within the domain of grotesque literature (that is itself half hidden in the dark) offers a solution for this problem, as this book has hopefully shown. A more general question which poses itself in the context of this project, and which has been posed in recent research on the grotesque, against the background of anthropological research, is the question of the function for (artistic) representation of that which is hidden or in a culture. The problem of the absence of form and the related problem of the taboo and the non-thing, seem to be problems experienced in all cultures and are represented by art (including stories, myths and rituals). The central problem here is that of categorisation and the representation of those issues in a culture that fall in no category or into several simultaneously. The specific question that poses itself in the context of my research, (and which is dealt with in chapter VI) is: is a writer and artists, such as F. Harmsen van Beek, who is a double talent, and who shifts between verbal and pictorial (visual) worlds of representation, predisposed to a specific sensibility for the possibilities and impossibilities of ordering, perceiving and representing? Is she more sensible to the non-things such as anomaly, ambivalence and ambiguity? This subdivision is made by the anthropologist Susan Stewart, who describes sub-classes of non-things. These play a major role in grotesque art. The fact that exactly this type of thing appears abundantly in the work of F. Harmsen van Beek, indicates her perceptive eye for the problems of categorisation. Indicative of her great sensibility for that which falls inside or outside existing categories, is the fact that she devotes great detail in her observation of dust and dirt (see, e. g., Wat knaagt?). She in fact shows a sharp eye for all that falls apart, or is being formed. Writing about all these issues, also about that of categorization, points once again to the direction of a great sensitivity for the problems and implications of categorisation. Even more so, her writing indicates the possibility of recategorization through reformulation. Her appeal to not let ambiguity slip can be regarded as an appeal not to let slip the possibilities of recategorization. F. Harmsen van Beek tends to move not only between the verbal and the pictorial, but also, being the child of two illustrators and authors of children’s books, she moves between the imaginary world of the child and the adult. She is respectively candid and overly lucid: in one instance she is very detailed, the other moment she refuses to make any distinction at all (as demonstrated in the analyses in chapters V and VII). The results of all of this is that F. Harmsen van Beek shows in her stories and poems a dazzling way of moving between the general and the particular, the universal and the personal, the well-known, and the unknown, the rule and the exception, the cause and the effect, the logically thought through, and the aporetic, the aberrant, and the non-serious. Her method is anti-ordering and anti-Aristotelian in this perspective. Her approach functions not only as an artistic method, which, through an inversion of artistic conventions, represents the world; it is also as a critical method; it is a method that is deliberately used against the rules of orderly thinking. This method is employed with the help of the Abbau of meaning (or deconstruction of meaning), placing all kinds of between brackets. Thus she creates a space for reconsiderations that go against accepted norms and expressions. She shares this aspect of deviance with other writers of the grotesque (such as Paul van Ostaijen, Til Brugman, Louis Paul Boon, Gust Gils, Witold Gombrowicz). In this regard, however, it should be noted that the work of F. Harmsen van Beek has no political or political-ideological meaning. A unique feature of F. Harmsen van Beek is the fact that she has especially applied her deconstruction method, although in a very lucid manner, to the world of the homely and the particular. Her Sprachhellhörigkeit (this term is used by Palm with reference to Morgenstern) is also exceptional: in no time at all, she may turn everyday language into puns, that is: into something utterly ambiguous. Her style is exceptional, albeit not completely unique. Just like other authors of grotesque works, she employs a style of writing that sounds like spoken language. (‘She writes with her voice. ’) She forms a part of the narrating tradition that goes back to types of oral narration. The Russian Formalist Boris Ejchenbaum, described this type of narration as skaz. An important aspect of this style is that it seems to be like spontaneously spoken language. It even seems to be a rather primitive style, being everything but refined and, but which is in fact a thoroughly crafted artistic language (the Formalist linguist Victor Vinogradov speaks of an overly crafted language; the poet herself described crafting this language as making ‘a very complicated cryptogram’). One could even speak of a treacherous Abbau of referential and conventional meanings due to the crafting of the language. As a result, the referential function of language is placed between brackets. In principal, the narrative style of F. Harmsen van Beek has a different artistic function than the strong referential, reporting style (darstellend-beschreibend) which forms the basis of so-called representations in literature and in the ‘traditional novel’ (to cite W. J. M Bronzwaer). The function and characteristics of this traditional style stand opposed to the style of F. Harmsen van Beek. This opposition is investigated in chapters VII and VIII. Despite the fact that the work of F. Harmsen van Beek is only slightly referential, her style, apart from being strongly reflective in a tacit way, is characterised especially by direct address (she often directly addresses the one spoken to) and this particular aspect of her style has seduced critics and fans, above all, to see in her work the person. Such a reading flourishes on a dated. In Dutch literature, readings like this are still to be found; readings formed by a non-crystallised vision of literary mimesis (such as has been discussed in chapter VI). As artistic representation, unconventional work such as this reflects rather on itself, than on the writer herself, as has been argued in chapters VII and VIII. Her unserious, mumbling, deliberately arguing narrators stand apart from those forms of that go back to the traditional format of an argument and the written culture: this culture is aimed at the transfer of information and as such should be serious. It seems to me that it was never the ambition of F. Harmsen van Beek to portray herself in, or to write herself into, our written culture. It rather seems to be the case that her work manifests itself as a number of only half legible side remarks placed in the margin of the written culture. When these remarks, rather against their initial purpose as side remarks, are placed in the centre of attention, they seem to contain quite some critique against the basic premises of the written culture. However, because these remarks are not written in the terms of this culture, they are also not quite legible in these terms. Therefore, the work and the writer herself stay more or less hidden. Symptomatic of this self-chosen marginal position, is the problematic aspect of the signature of her work. She rarely signed her work with her full (family) name. She considers the convention of printing the full name of a writer on the cover of books, to symbolize and establish their identity and authorship, as a pretentious act. Her own personal and marginal, although often directed at someone, are not signed, as that little personal note scribbled in the margins of a medieval manuscript (‘Hebben olla vogala’). As far as I know, she has only signed two small parts of her work. In December 1965, she wrote a poem for the Christmas edition of Vrij Nederland, about a ‘strayed kiss’ and this poem was signed with the sentence, ‘Gemaakt door F. Harmsen van Beek / Op een moment dat niemand keek’ [...] ‘Made by F. Harmsen van Beek / at a moment when no one was looking’. (To me, this signature seems rather ironic, because in 1965 ‘everyone’ was looking at her: after all, she was ‘the most discussed topic in literary circles’ as De Moor wrote). The other signature dates from 1992 and is hidden in a small booklet by Frank Linschoten about his garden in Eext, entitled De tuin van Frank Linschoten en Pieter Baak (The Garden of Frank Linschoten and Pieter Baak). In this poem, she addresses the reader, who in 1992 thought that she has since long stopped writing, and whom she (just as she did in other places in her work) addresses as incidental passer-by: traveller, if you should ever hear a cricket cry for help: that’s me F. Harmsen van Beek...|$|E

The accuracy for the iso-orientation conditions was always higher than that for the aniso-orientation conditions. The result is the same regardless whether the target and the flankers can be grouped into a compound word, hence cannot be explained by the word superior effect. Our result suggests two types of flanker effects: The first is a general crowding effect that reduces the visibility of the target whenever a flanker is presented and may result from an early visual mechanism.

Moreover, time frequency analysis showed similar results, indicating that identification levels were associated with object recognition, particularly during processing of a single categorical stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Upright {{flanking}} faces have stronger {{detrimental effects}} on the recognition of upright target face, than inverted flanking faces. One possible explanation for this “flanker- inversion effect” was that the more holistically processed upright flanking faces allowed for more erroneous feature integration. Alternatively, crowding was known to be stronger when target and flankers were more similar. Here we investigate flanker-inversion effect on crowding in Chinese character identification. Five normally-sighted young adults participated. Targets of size 1. 2 ° were presented at 5 ° in the lower visual field. Four flankers with center-to-center distance of 1. 8 ° were presented in the crowded condition. Three types of flankers were used, upright or inverted Chinese and upright Korean characters. The identification contrast thresholds were estimated by QUEST and crowding strength was measured through threshold elevation (TE). Crowding on upright Chinese target was significantly stronger with inverted Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 59 ± 0. 32) than with upright Chinese flankers (TE = 1. 47 ± 0. 29). No inversion effect was observed for inverted Chinese target. Korean flankers produced similar crowding as upright Chinese flankers. Our results go against the similarity rule that predicts upright Chinese flankers would produce stronger crowding for upright Chinese target. Holistic processing preferred for <b>inverted</b> Chinese <b>characters</b> may account for the findings...|$|R

5000|$|Chinese money-suited {{cards are}} {{believed}} to be the oldest ancestor to the Latin suit-system. The money-suit system is based on denominations of currency: Coins, Strings of Coins, Myriads of Strings, and Tens of Myriads. Old Chinese coins had holes in the middle to allow them to be strung together. A string of coins could easily be misinterpreted as a stick to those unfamiliar with them. The Mamluks called their suit of cups Myriads and this may have been due to <b>inverting</b> the Chinese <b>character</b> for myriad (...) [...] The Mamluk suit of swords may also have been inspired by the Chinese numeral for Ten (...) [...] Another clue linking these Chinese, Muslim, and European cards are the ranking of certain suits. In many early Chinese games like Madiao, the suit of coins was in reverse order so that the lower ones beat the higher ones. In the Indo-Persian game of Ganjifa, half the suits were also inverted, including a suit of coins. This was also true for the European games of Tarot and Ombre. The inverting of suits had no purpose in regards to gameplay but was an artifact from the earliest games.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which recognition of Chinese characters influenced same-different matching performance that did not require recognition. In each experimental trial, two partially occluded characters were shown sequentially, and participants decided {{whether or not they were}} the same. The two characters were either both upright or both inverted and mirror-reflected. The participants' Chinese reading fluency spanned the full range, from not knowing any characters to native speakers. The participants who could recognize some characters (defined as readers) were subsequently tested with character recognition in a naming task. Interestingly, although the readers' recognition accuracies well correlated with their years of Chinese language schooling, they were uncorrelated with the matching accuracies in the same-different task with upright characters. The only indication of top-down influence was the readers' higher accuracy in matching upright than <b>inverted</b> and reflected <b>characters.</b> However, the magnitude of this effect was small, to the extent that the average same-different accuracies were comparable for readers and non-readers alike. This small effect was further confirmed with native speakers in China, who should give rise to the largest possible effect. We conclude that top-down influence from character recognition was present but very limited, at least with the task and stimuli used...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNon-pathological, {{spontaneous}} mirror writing, whether complete or partial, {{has long}} been associated with writing with the left hand and attributed {{to the fact that}} abductive writing, which most people find easier, is from right to left when people write with their left hand. However, recent research suggests another explanation: children who do not know the orientation of the letters and digits may apply an implicit right-writing rule which causes them to <b>invert</b> mainly left-oriented <b>characters</b> (e. g., J, 3). But would left-hand writers apply such a rule? The present study examines the relationship between these two explanations of mirror writing and asks whether they coexist in children who write with their left hand. Is the abductive writing explanation specific to mirror writing by left-hand writers and the implicit right-writing rule specific to right-hand writers? A comparison of 59 children who wrote with their left hand and 59 children who wrote with their right hand (matched for age and school experience) provided clear evidence against the abductive-writing explanation and in favour of the right-writing rule for both groups. Therefore, spontaneous mirror writing in typical 5 - to 6 -year-olds {{does not seem to be}} a function of preferred writing hand...|$|R
40|$|Whether face {{perception}} involves domain-specific or domain-general processing is an extensively debated issue. Relative to non-face {{objects and}} alphabetical scripts, Chinese characters {{provide a good}} contrast to faces because of their structural configuration, requirement for high level of visual expertise to literate Chinese people, and unique appearance and identity for each individual stimulus. To examine potential categorical differences in their neural processing, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to blocked face and Chinese character stimuli. Fast adaptation method was applied to better control for the low-level stimulus difference between faces and Chinese characters. Participants were required {{to respond to the}} color of the outer frame in which these stimuli were presented, at either a fast (ISI 650 ms) or slow (ISI 1300 ms) rate, and with an orientation that was either the same or alternated between upright and inverted. Faces elicited a larger and later N 170 relative to characters, but the N 170 was more left-lateralized for characters relative to the faces. Adaptation-by-rate and adaptation-by-orientation effects were observed on the amplitude of N 170, and both were more pronounced for faces relative to <b>characters.</b> <b>Inverted</b> stimuli elicited a later N 170 relative to upright stimuli, without amplitude change, and this inversion effect was more pronounced for faces relative to characters.

The adaptation-by-orientation effect was illustrated by a larger P 1 under the same relative to the alternated orientation condition. Therefore, evidence from the amplitude and th...|$|R
40|$|Os romances Maps, Gifts e Secrets, pertencentes à trilogia Blood {{in the sun}} do escritor somali Nuruddin Farah, apresentam duas camadas narrativas em suas composições: uma dada pelos eventos ficcionais que ocorrem quando os personagens estão despertos e a outra pelos inúmeros sonhos inseridos neles. No espaço da vida de vigília, os protagonistas dessas obras experimentam uma grande imobilidade, estando impossibilitados de alterar a realidade política de seu país, a Somália, e de efetivamente transformar suas próprias vidas. O objetivo deste trabalho é demonstrar que a experiência onírica proporciona, então, uma compensação para a inatividade a que estão condenados. Os sonhos são considerados como lugares especiais de experiência, como cronotopos diferenciados que contestam e invertem o que os personagens vivenciam no mundo dito real. As narrativas oníricas presentes nesses romances operam em dissonância em relação ao restante do que é narrado, oferecendo soluções ficcionais que ainda não parecem possíveis nas outras partes da narração. Dessa forma, o foco da análise se volta para o estudo da estrutura dessas narrativas oníricas, concomitantemente com o procedimento de conferir aos seus signos significados que condigam com o contexto cultural, social e político em que vivem os seus personagens. The novels Maps, Gifts and Secrets, which {{belong to}} the trilogy Blood in the sun by Somali writer Nuruddin Farah, present two {{narrative}} levels: one given by the fictional events that take place when the characters are fully awake and the other by the numerous dreams inserted in them.

40|$|In our {{previous}} paper [18], we introduced the tautological rings {{of the genus}} zero moduli spaces of stable maps to homogeneous spaces X. We showed {{that in the case}} of SL flags, all rational cohomology classes on the stable map spaces are tautological using methods from Hodge theory. The purpose of this note is to indicate a localization proof, in the spirit of Gromov-Witten theory, when X is a projective space. To set the stage, we recall the definition of the tautological rings. The moduli stacks M 0,S(P r,d) parametrize S-pointed, genus 0, degree d stable maps to P r. We use the notation M 0,n(P r,d) when the labeling set is S = { 1, 2, [...] .,n}. These moduli spaces are connected by a complicated system of natural morphisms, which we enumerate below: • forgetful morphisms: π: M 0,S(P r,d) → M 0,T(P r,d) defined for T ⊂ S. • gluing morphisms which produce maps with nodal domains, gl: M 0,S 1 ∪{•}(P r,d 1) ×P rM 0,{⋆}∪S 2 (Pr,d 2) → M 0,S 1 ∪S 2 (Pr,d 1 + d 2). • evaluation morphisms to the target space, evi: M 0,S(P r,d) → P r for all i ∈ S. Definition 1. The genus 0 tautological rings R ⋆ (M 0,n(P r,d)) are the smallest system of subrings of A ⋆ (M 0,n(P r,d)) such that: • The system is closed under pushforwards by the gluing and forgetful morphisms. • All monomials in the evaluation classes ev ⋆ i α where α ∈ A ⋆ (P r) are in the system. The localization theorem in [7] can be used to show that the equivariant Chow rings of M 0,n(P r,d) are tautological after <b>inverting</b> the torus <b>characters.</b> Our goal is to prove the following stronger result, still making use of the torus action. Theorem. All rational Chow classes of M 0,n(P r,d) are tautological. While this result is not surprising, we hope that its proof could be of interest.

First, we make use of a non-generic torus action on P r which fixes one point p and a hyperplane H...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} use which contemporary British playwrights {{make of the}} various conventions and characteristics of the comedy of manners genre [...] particularly characterization, wit, and structure. Chapter I explores these conventions in three Restoration comedies, examining characterization in Etherege 2 ̆ 7 s The Man of Mode, verbal wit in Congreve 2 ̆ 7 s The Way of the World, {{and the structure of}} sexual conflicts in Wycherley 2 ̆ 7 s The Country Wife, through which characters achieve self-definition. ^ Chapter II discusses these characteristics in the works of three contemporary dramatists [...] Alan Ayckbourn, Simon Gray, and Christopher Hampton. While Ayckbourn 2 ̆ 7 s characters in The Norman Conquests are middle-class rather than aristocratic, they nevertheless derive from the same types as Etherege 2 ̆ 7 s. Gray 2 ̆ 7 s dialogue in Butley and Otherwise Engaged employs many of the rhetorical devices found in Congreve 2 ̆ 7 s plays, but Gray 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual protagonists use wit to mask insecurity or to maintain detachment rather than to express self-assurance. Hampton is a satirist like Wycherley, and his characters in The Philanthropist and Treats strive to define themselves against the chaos of contemporary life. They fail, however, whereas Restoration characters usually succeed. The changes these dramatists make are accommodations for twentieth-century audiences and not genuine innovations. ^ Chapters III, IV, and V analyze the innovations, explosions, and inversions in the manners comedies of Joe Orton, Tom Stoppard, and Harold Pinter, respectively. Orton presents contemporary variations of the Restoration character types; and the wit and the sexual conflicts in Entertaining Mr. Sloane, Loot, and What the Butler Saw are also reminiscent of the earlier comedies of manners. Orton, however, uses the shock tactics of black humor to attack conventional attitudes toward sexuality, religion, familial relations, and the law. Stoppard primarily writes comedies of ideas rather than comedies of manners, although the character types and sexual conflicts in Jumpers, Travesties, and Night and Day derive from the Restoration comedies. The character 2 ̆ 7 s debates about philosophy, aesthetics, and journalism reveal Stoppard 2 ̆ 7 s concern for language and effective communication; he explodes the restrictions of conventional dialogue through his use of puns, epigrams, and literary allusions. Pinter writes about characters 2 ̆ 7 attempts to define themselves through their relationships with others. The Lover, The Homecoming, and Old Times all treat characters who are successfully self-assertive. The Collection, with its theme of the impossibility of verification, No Man 2 ̆ 7 s Land, with its rejected proviso, and Betrayal, with its <b>inverted</b> structure and <b>characters</b> who maintain decorum, are, however, inverted comedies of manners. Pinter 2 ̆ 7 s characters often switch roles, moving from Truewit to Witwoud. Their wit is hostile, and they often manipulate others through silence rather than language. ^ These six playwrights demonstrate that the characterization, verbal wit, and structure of traditional manners comedy have not only been adapted to satisfy the tastes of modern audiences but have also been integrated with new, innovative theatrical forms. ...|$|R
