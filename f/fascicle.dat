In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E

25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques {{to examine the}} relationship between muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle in the human quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA was accompanied by a 35.5% increase in the <b>fascicle</b> pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 study, {{conducted}} by Blazevich et al., reiterated and added an extra dimension to Aagaard et al.’s conclusions. Blazevich et al. examined {{the effect of}} 10-week concentric or eccentric knee extension training on architectural properties of the human quadriceps {{with the purpose of}} uncovering the mechanical stimulus involved in architecture adaptation. Both modes of exercise resulted in increased peak concentric and eccentric strength. Concentric training, however, results in higher peak concentric strength. Ultrasonography suggests vastus medialus and vastus lateris muscle fiber length increase similarly following eccentric and concentric training, with the changes occurring abruptly over the first 5 weeks of the training program. Because fiber length was independent of training type, Blazevich et al. believe distance of operation determines the optimal fiber length. This muscle property is important in determining the angle-torque relationship of a muscle. The study supported the pennation angle trends uncovered by Aagaard et al.; in addition, Blazevich et al. concluded that the vastus lateris <b>fascicle</b> angle changes are independent of training type and modulates strongly with volume. This suggests fiber length and pennation angle modifications occur via separate mechanical stimuli, i.e. distance of operation and muscle volume respectively. Furthermore, these angle changes occur over a relatively long time scale as the pennation angle increased until the cessation of the training program at week 10. Blazevich et al. predict the increase in pennation angle seen after eccentric or concentric training allow the pennate muscle to attach more fibers to the associated aponeurosis as well as increase PCSA and AGR. Architectural modifications to pennate muscles shift the position at which the muscle operates on the force-velocity and force-length curves to regions best suited for the muscle’s function. An increase in pennation angle theoretically increases both the PCSA and AGR of a given pennate muscle, allowing the muscle to generate higher forces while operating at higher optimal speeds. An increase to fiber length would allow the muscle to function at longer lengths.|$|E

25|$|In muscle tissue, 10-100 endomysium-sheathed {{muscle fibers}} are {{organized}} into perimysium-wrapped bundles known as <b>fascicles.</b> Each muscle {{is composed of}} a number of <b>fascicles</b> grouped together by a sleeve of connective tissue, known as an epimysium.

The <b>fascicles</b> attach to the aponeuroses and form an angle (the pennation angle) to the load axis of the muscle. If all the <b>fascicles</b> are {{on the same side of}} the tendon, the pennate muscle is called unipennate (Fig. 1A). Examples of this include certain muscles in the hand. If there are <b>fascicles</b> on both sides of the central tendon, the pennate muscle is called bipennate (Fig. 1B). The rectus femoris, a large muscle in the quadriceps, is typical.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which skeletal muscles lengthen and shorten are potentially complex. When the relaxed human gastrocnemius muscle is at its shortest in vivo lengths it falls slack (i. e. it does not exert any passive tension). It has been hypothesised that when the muscle is passively lengthened, slack is progressively taken up, first in some muscle <b>fascicles</b> then in others. Two-dimensional imaging methods suggest that, once the slack is taken up, changes in muscle length are mediated primarily by changes in the lengths of the tendinous components of the muscle. The aims {{of this study were}} to test the hypothesis that there is progressive engagement of relaxed muscle <b>fascicles,</b> and to quantify changes in the length and three-dimensional orientation of muscle <b>fascicles</b> and tendinous structures during passive changes in muscle length. Ultrasound imaging was used to determine the location, in an ultrasound image plane, of the proximal and distal ends of muscle <b>fascicles</b> at 14 sites in the human gastrocnemius muscle as the ankle was rotated passively through its full range. A three-dimensional motion analysis system recorded the location and orientation of the ultrasound image plane and the leg. These data were used to generate dynamic three-dimensional reconstructions of the architecture of the muscle <b>fascicles</b> and aponeuroses. There was considerable variability in the measured muscle lengths at which the slack was taken up in individual muscle <b>fascicles.</b> However, that variability was not much greater than the error associated with the measurement procedure. An analysis of these data which took into account the possible correlations between errors showed that, contrary to our earlier hypothesis, muscle <b>fascicles</b> are not progressively engaged during passive lengthening of the human gastrocnemius. Instead, the slack is taken up nearly simultaneously in all muscle <b>fascicles.</b> Once the muscle is lengthened sufficiently to take up the slack, about half of the subsequent increase in muscle length is due to elongation of the tendinous structures and half is due to elongation of muscle <b>fascicles,</b> at least over the range of muscle-tendon lengths that was investigated (up to ∼ 60 or 70 % of the range of in vivo lengths).

Three continuous groups of the intramesencephalic oculomotor nerve <b>fascicles</b> were distinguished: the caudal, intermediate and rostral. The caudal <b>fascicles,</b> which most likely innervate the superior rectus and the levator palpebrae superioris muscles, extend through the superior cerebellar peduncle just caudal to the red nucleus and close to the lateral lemniscus. The intermediate <b>fascicles,</b> devoted to the medial rectus and the inferior oblique muscles, always pass through the superior cerebellar peduncle, just medial to the caudal part of the red nucleus (60 %), and less frequently (40 %) through the nucleus itself. The rostral oculomotor <b>fascicles,</b> which terminate in the inferior rectus and sphincter pupillae muscles, course medial to the rostral part of the red nucleus. While the rostral and intermediate oculomotor <b>fascicles</b> are supplied only by the medial twigs of the paramedian mesencephalic perforating arteries, the caudal <b>fascicles</b> are also nourished by the lateral branches of the same perforating arteries.

40|$|Key points: The human {{gastrocnemius}} {{muscle is}} slack at its shortest lengths in vivo. We hypothesised {{that when the}} muscle is lengthened slack is taken up progressively, first in some muscle <b>fascicles,</b> then in others. A new, quasi-three-dimensional ultrasound imaging method {{was used to test}} this hypothesis directly. Contrary to our prediction, the slack was taken up nearly simultaneously in muscle <b>fascicles</b> located throughout the gastrocnemius muscle. Dynamic three-dimensional reconstructions indicated that, over the range of lengths that was investigated, passive changes in the length of gastrocnemius muscle-tendon units are due to changes in the length of both muscle <b>fascicles</b> and tendinous structures, in approximately equal measure. Changes in the alignment of muscle <b>fascicles</b> and the curvature of aponeuroses have a negligible contribution to change in muscle length. These findings give insights into how skeletal muscles change their lengths in vivo. The mechanisms by which skeletal muscles lengthen and shorten are potentially complex.
