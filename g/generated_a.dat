40|$|In recent years, the reuse {{of motion}} capture data has become widespread. For example, many methods to {{generate}} new motion by synthesizing plural existing motions has been suggested. We can <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> composite motion such as “Walk while waving a hand ” by using these methods. However, these methods often lose the feature of original data when they <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> new motion. Then, these methods <b>generate</b> <b>an</b> unnatural motion. In this paper, we propose a motion synthesizing method with motion splicing. We <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> new motion {{from the existing}} motion based on relation of master and servant in a composite motion. Our method <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> spliced motion by splicing a human part. We splice five parts that is the lower body, arms, the torso and the head.
