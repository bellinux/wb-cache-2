Key words: <b>edible</b> <b>offals,</b> European Community, quality restrictions, trade, welfare. Traditional barriers to trade implemented by importing countries include tariffs, import quotas, and voluntary export restraints. The different consequences and welfare effects of these forms of protection have been docu-mented in the literature (see, for example, Al-len, Dodge, and Schmitz; Kreinin; Blyth; Caves and Jones). All three have the effect of raising prices in the importing country but differ in the way in which the revenue from the market intervention is distributed. Typically, the rev-enue from a tariff is collected by the govern-ment of the importing country, while the rents generated by an import quota accrue to those who receive licenses to import. In the case of an import quota, the government can capture the rents if the licenses are sold or auctioned. Voluntary export restraints also generate quota rents, but these rents are retained in the ex-porting country through the sale, auction, or grant of the right to export. Another type of trade barrier is the use of qualitative standards to prevent the entry of certain kinds of goods. Examples of this type Peterson is an assistant professor at Texas A&M University; Paggi is an economic analyst for the American Farm Bureau Federation; and Henry is a postdoctoral fellow for CIAT in Cali, Colombia.

Byproducts (<b>edible</b> <b>offal</b> (including variety meats), inedible offal, hides and skins, blood, fats, and tallow) include all parts of a live animal that {{are not part of the}} dressed carcass and constitute about 30 percent of the liveweight of hogs and about 44 percent of the live-weight of cattle. Byproducts from animal slaughter provide raw materials used in phar-maceutical, cosmetic, household, and industrial products. Exports of <b>edible</b> <b>offal</b> also contribute to the value and profitability of the U.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The meat {{obtained}} from trophy hunting, culling and harvesting indigenous game animals {{has been used}} in the past by biltong (traditional dried meat) hunters, local butchers and for export markets. The edible by-products, currently discarded, {{could be used as a}} renewable source of protein in low income communities. Constraints to the utilization of such edible by-products of game meat include lack of recognized food value chains in informal markets, food safety concerns and limited market access to edible by-products from game harvesting operations. METHODS: Participatory risk analysis was used to investigate the feasibility of using <b>edible</b> <b>offal</b> as a source of renewable protein, to address food security issues in poor communities bordering game parks in South Africa. The market outlet for the food value chain selected for investigation, was informal markets in Pongola, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa.

30|$|In the {{evaluation}} of carcass traits of sheep and goats factors such as nutrition, genotype, age, sex, season and other related factors that can affect growth and carcass traits should be considered (Devendra and Burns 1983; Hagos and Melaku 2007). In the current study, the values obtained in body weight change for the different treatment groups were not reflected on the carcass parameter on the corresponding treatment groups. The high dressing percentage observed for T 4 compared with T 3 was due to a relatively high carcass weight and lower empty body weight obtained for T 4. With regard to the <b>edible</b> <b>offals,</b> {{in different parts of}} the country, different proportions of the internal offals including blood are edible and saleable and fetch extra money that could add value to the carcass. Due to differences in test of the offals and eating habits of the people, edible and saleable portions of the offals in one area of a country may not be acceptable in other (Legesse 2001). Among the internal organs, the weight of liver, kidney, spleen, and small intestine were higher for the supplemented groups than the control ones. Betsha (2005) and Moges (2005) also observed significant effect on liver, heart, and kidneys with concentrate supplementation. The high weight of liver of lambs in the supplement group of the current study could be the results of the high level of anti-nutritional compounds such as condensed tannins and the required detoxification processes, which increased the size of the liver (Assefa 2007). Likewise, Hagos and Melaku (2007) also reported an increase in the weight of liver as the supplement diet increased and they suggested that this phenomenon could happen due to the storage of more reserve substances such as glycogen. Gebreyohannes et al. (2003) also reported higher liver weight in Horro sheep fed with sesbania forage compared to those fed maize grain and grass hay.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Jammu district of Jammu and Kashmir State to study the assessment of existing meat handling and hygienic practices among butchers and meat retailers in Jammu District of Jammu and Kashmir. Three slaughter houses of Jammu district situated at Nagrota, Old Rehari and Gujjar Nagar were selected for the study. Ten butchers from each slaughter house were selected. Thirty retail meat shops were selected and from each randomly selected retail meat shop, one meat retailer was selected. Thus, a total of thirty butchers and thirty meat retailers were selected for the study. Data was collected through a well structured interview schedule. The data was coded, classified, tabulated and analyzed using the software; Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS 16. 0). The presentation of data was done to give pertinent, valid and reliable answer to the specific objectives. Frequencies, percentage, mean and standard deviation were worked out for meaningful interpretation. Transport of animal to be slaughtered was not carried out properly. Animal were fatigued and soiled with faecal material and considerations were not given to avoid undue stress that might adversely affect the safety and suitability of meat. There was no standard method of bringing the animal to the floor for slaughter. The animals were slaughtered without restraining them properly and are slaughtered in front of other animals causing great fear in them. Butchers used to bring even more than ten animals at a time and slaughter them one after other, even butchers and other workers moved freely over carcasses without caring for hygienic measures. Animals were slaughtered (by both Halal and Jhatka method) and dressed in unhygienic way. Butchers do not care for preventing the intestine from puncturing during evisceration which leads to contamination of carcass. The <b>edible</b> <b>offal’s</b> pluck (heart, lungs, trachea and esophagus) were pulled out as a unit and these were not hung on a hook instead it was place on floor, similarly paunch (stomach and intestines) were also dropped on floor. Meat retailers apart from selling meat from animals slaughtered at slaughter houses significant proportion of respondents were also slaughtering animals (mostly sheep and goat) at their own retail meat shops. Chicken were exclusively slaughtered at retail meat shops in front of the consumers. Personal hygiene was poorly maintained by meat handlers owing to their illiteracy, unawareness, lack of facilities and nature of work...|$|R
