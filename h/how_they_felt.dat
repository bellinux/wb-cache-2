5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt,</b> they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) - The PSS is {{a widely}} used {{subjective}} tool for measuring stress levels. [...] It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, <b>how</b> stressed <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> after a certain event.

40|$|Studies among adult populations {{show that}} {{estimates}} of how happy one has {{felt in the}} past {{tend to be more}} positive than average happiness as assessed using time sampling techniques. This ‘memory-experience gap’ is attributed to cognitive biases, among which fading affect bias. In this paper we report a study among 352 pupils of a secondary school in the Netherlands. These youngsters reported subsequently: 1) <b>how</b> happy <b>they</b> had <b>felt</b> yesterday, 2) <b>how</b> happy <b>they</b> had <b>felt</b> during the last month, 3) what they had done the previous day and 4) <b>how</b> <b>they</b> had <b>felt</b> during each of these activities. Unlike earlier studies, the average rating of happiness in the last month appeared to be lower than average happiness of the previous day. In accordance with earlier research, the global rating of happiness during the previous day was higher than the average of reported affect during separate activities during that day. A further multilevel analysis suggest that in estimating <b>how</b> <b>they</b> have <b>felt</b> on the whole yesterday, youngsters overestimated short pleasant episodes and underestimated unpleasant episodes, especially when such episodes lasted long...|$|R

Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

Several findings suggest {{this is not the}} case. For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters were asked to describe their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|E

500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a song}} by British singer Alexandra Burke {{from her}} debut studio album Overcome (2009).

The song was released as a promotional single {{in anticipation of the}} re-release of Overcome (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt.</b> In response, Burke asked her aunt why he was letting the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. [...] "The Silence" [...] is an R and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead of talking about them.|$|E
50|$|Myside bias {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} the accuracy of memory recall. In an experiment, widows and widowers rated the intensity of their experienced grief six months and five years after the deaths of their spouses. Participants noted a higher experience of grief at six months rather than at five years. Yet, when the participants were asked after five years <b>how</b> <b>they</b> had <b>felt</b> six months after the death of their significant other, the intensity of grief participants recalled was highly correlated with their current level of grief. Individuals appear to utilize their current emotional states to analyze <b>how</b> <b>they</b> must have <b>felt</b> when experiencing past events. Emotional memories are reconstructed by current emotional states.|$|R

Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On.

The dancers in the video were not instructed to dance in any particular way by Yemi A.D. {{who was in charge of}} the dance choreography; and according to Ruth Hogben, they [...] "wanted an interpretation of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> about the song to be portrayed instead."

500|$|In {{terms of}} social policy, Bowlby advised that parents should be {{supported}} by society as parents are dependent on a greater society for economic provision and [...] "if a community values its children it must cherish its parents". Also [...] "husbandless" [...] mothers of children under 3 should be supported {{to care for the}} child at home rather than the child be left in inadequate care whilst the mother sought work. (It was assumed the mother of the illegitimate child would usually be left with the child). Fathers left with infants or small children on their hands without the mother should be provided with [...] "housekeepers" [...] so that the children could remain at home. Other proposals included the proper payment of foster homes and careful selection of foster carers, and frank, informative discussions with children about their parents and why they ended up in care and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> about it rather than the [...] "least said, soonest mended" [...] approach. The point that children were loyal to and loved even the worst of parents, and needed to have that fact understood non-judgementally, was strongly made.|$|E
500|$|As {{they began}} to play, bassist Adam Clayton {{developed}} a bassline. The part was originally based on the Grandmaster Melle Mel song [...] "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" [...] before Clayton changed to a more trance-like bassline. Vocalist Bono created some melodies and sang over the music. During the album's recording, Bono had become tired of writing in the first-person and he began writing lyrics and singing {{from the perspective of}} different characters. During the writing of [...] "Moment of Surrender", Bono assumed the character of a drug addict having a crisis of faith. The song title was borrowed from the Alcoholics Anonymous term for when an addict admits being [...] "powerless over alcohol" [...] and needs help. Bono had attempted to use the phrase [...] "vision over visibility" [...] in the lyrics of earlier songs; however, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] was the first song where he felt it was appropriate to be used. Eno called Bono's singing in this character as [...] "so heartbreaking agonized and vulnerable", creating a feeling like [...] "a knife to the heart". Lanois contributed by developing the gospel-like chorus. The uneven hi-hat from the drum part stems from Mullen's electronic drum kit malfunctioning during the song's recording. Eno was amazed by each performer's ability to develop and play their part without any instructions or cues. After the song's recording completed, everyone in the studio, including a gathering of production personnel and visitors, was completely silent, and Eno suggested {{it was as if they}} had gone on an [...] "emotional adventure of some kind". He called the song's recording [...] "the most amazing studio experience I've ever had", and he believes the [...] "emotional crescendo" [...] heard in the song properly captures <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> as they improvised the piece. Bono stated [...] "it was a spell and we were in it".|$|E
