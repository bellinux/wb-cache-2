5|$|The {{election}} {{was called for}} 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters {{tried to get him}} to run in the safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35years, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the {{election was}} to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.|$|E
25|$|The talk of {{the town}} is Norman Tebbit's vulgar grand-standing barn-storming {{performance}} on Europe. He savaged Maastricht, poured scorn on monetary union, patronised the PM...and brought the conference (or a good part of it) to its feet roaring for more. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> arms aloft, acknowledging the ovation, Norman the conqueror.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched his}} face, {{and it was}} as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know not}} of whom you speak, madam, {{but if it}} be of Mr. Griffith, <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> just without that cluster of seamen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She can't get to Soldier Boy, and <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> all the time, down in {{the mouth}} and lonesome; and she says will you shake hands with him and comfort him? Everybody does." ...|$|R
500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know what I was getting into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was put in front of the camera, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} with his family, Speer came to Coesfeld to visit Wolters in October 1966. [...] Shortly before Speer's visit, Annemarie Kempf had visited Wolters in Coesfeld {{to ask him}} not to allow his differences with Speer to affect their first meeting. Wolters responded that he and Speer were [...] "too far apart". [...] The visit was quickly marred by Speer's insistence on inviting industrialist [...] to Wolters' home instead of allowing a one-on-one reunion. [...] According to Wolters' son Fritz, his father was furious and hurt by the perceived slight. [...] While the actual meeting was casual and cordial (in addition to the long-promised ham and wine, Wolters turned over all of the accumulated papers from Speer, the censored copy of the Chronik and the remaining balance of DM25,000 in the School Fund Account), Wolters later wrote, [...] "I knew that day of that first still merry reunion that the Spandau friendship was over. [...] As <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> in person, I saw him suddenly quite differently than I had previously." ...|$|E
500|$|The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, {{other musicians}} and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the {{following}} evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal {{abuse of the}} work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote [...] "The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than {{the picture of the}} stage. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end." [...] The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux [...] "at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was [...] "something like a hostile reception" [...] at the first London performance, the final performance in the season [...] "was received with scarcely a sign of opposition". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.|$|E
60|$|Lewis {{tried the}} middle, and <b>'e</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> up to 'is neck, feeling about {{with his foot}} and saying things out loud about Bob Pretty, and other things under 'is breath about Mr. Cutts.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} 'im hard, but <b>'e</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{looking at me}} with his fat baby- face, and I knew he didn't mean any harm; so I {{answered}} 'im perlite and wished 'im good night.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} Abbot, [...] "let his {{garments}} be changed, or rather {{let him be}} carried to the infirmary; for it will prejudice our health, should we hear his narrative while <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> steaming like a rising hoar-frost." ...|$|R
2500|$|Neville Cardus {{recorded}} the scene when Australia crept home by three wickets: [...] "His body still shook from the violent motion. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> like some fine animal baffled at the uselessness of great strength and effort in this world... A companion {{led him to}} the pavilion, and there he fell wearily to a seat." [...] David Frith suggests the truth was somewhat more prosaic. Richardson was the first off the field and had sunk two pints before anyone else had their boots off.|$|E
2500|$|When Wyatt {{and his men}} approached, the two men ran. Stilwell {{may have}} {{stumbled}} or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the Denver Republican, said [...] "I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet." ...|$|E
60|$|It changed. It {{changed as}} a lit house changes when its lights are {{suddenly}} extinguished. His eyes were suddenly {{eyes that were}} fixed, his smile was frozen on his lips, and <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> still. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> very gently swaying.|$|E
6000|$|... [TRUSTAFORD'S laugh, and the rattling, fainter and fainter, of [...] wheels. A spasm seizes on STRANGWAY'S face, as <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> [...] by {{the open}} door, his hand grips his throat; he looks from side [...] to side, as if seeking a way of escape.] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> rooted <b>there,</b> his nether lip {{between his}} teeth, {{his face a}} ghastly white, whilst she ran on.|$|R
6000|$|All porters {{and guards}} touch their hats to him; the station-master rushes {{up and down}} frantically, shouting, [...] "Where are those horse-boxes? Now then, look alive!" [...] for Mark is {{chairman}} of the line, and everybody's friend beside; and as <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> being scraped, <b>he</b> finds time to inquire after every one of the officials by turns, and after their wives, children, and sweethearts beside.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> {{holding her}} hands. His {{eyes seemed to}} be devouring her.|$|E
60|$|While <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{somebody}} {{touched him}} on the shoulder. It was Barton Reeve.|$|E
60|$|While <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> Jimmy Denham {{came along}} the terrace, and stopped beside him.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was just}} there just trying to bite my tongue {{thinking}} that blood was coming out because I was just ... So after he {{had gone through the}} line I followed him out {{into the parking lot of}} the funeral home. I said, 'I want to know why you did what you did to my brother.' And <b>he</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and stared at me. He didn't say, 'What are you talking about?’ you know, or, 'What? I don't know what you're talking about.’ <b>He</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and stared at me.Then I just continued to say, 'I want you to know your secret didn't die in there with my brother. And I want you to remember that I’m out here and that I know.’ And again, <b>he</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and <b>he</b> did not say a word.|$|R
6000|$|One {{morning he}} broke up altogether. And lo! where <b>he</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{remained}} a broomstick standing upright, round which {{the boys had}} built him! ...|$|R
6000|$|Pand. Yonder <b>he</b> <b>stands,</b> poor wretch! <b>there</b> <b>stands</b> <b>he</b> {{with such}} a look, and such a face, and such begging eyes! <b>there</b> <b>he</b> <b>stands,</b> poor prisoner! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> still trembling. Maraton poured him out wine, but {{he swept}} it away.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> certain dread and ominous sounds {{pierced the}} fearful hollow of his ear.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> fidgeting {{about for}} a bit, and then he puts his 'and on my shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|In Gyp's heart {{came the}} same feeling as when <b>he</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> drunk, against the wall--compassion, rather than {{contempt}} of his childishness. And taking his hand she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|KEITH {{gives her}} an intent look, then {{crosses to the}} fire. <b>He</b> [...] <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> a moment, looking down, then turns to the girl, who [...] has crept back to the couch.|$|R
5000|$|McGuffey's New Fourth Eclectic Reader (1866) {{takes this}} poem as {{the topic of}} Lesson LV. After urging the reader to [...] "Utter {{distinctly}} each consonant: terrible, thunders, brave, distant, progress, trust, mangled, burning, bright," [...] it introduces and presents the poem, following it {{with a set of}} questions: [...] "What is this story about? Who was Casabianca? By whose side did <b>he</b> <b>stand</b> in the midst of battle? What happened to his father? What took fire? What did the sailors begin to do? What did the little boy do? Why did <b>he</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> amid so much danger? What became of him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Silently, lost in thought, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{scratching}} his head. Then he began rolling down his sleeves.|$|E
60|$|But while <b>he</b> <b>stood,</b> <b>there</b> came towards him, {{galloping}} madly {{out of the}} battle, {{a solitary}} rider.|$|E
60|$|Thinking of all this, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{for an hour}} {{alone with}} his hands in his trousers' pockets.|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS--[Vaguely.] Nutting--nutting. [He {{stands before}} {{the door to the}} back room in an agony of embarrassed emotion--then he forces himself to a bold decision, pushes open the door and walks in. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there,</b> casts a shy glance at ANNA, whose {{brilliant}} clothes, and, to him, high-toned appearance awe him terribly. He looks about him with pitiful nervousness as if to avoid the appraising look with which she takes in his face, his clothes, etc--his voice seeming to plead for her forbearance.] Anna! ...|$|R
60|$|Explain! That was {{precisely}} {{what he could}} not do. Besides, what {{was the nature of}} the explanation demanded of him? Whilst <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> stricken <b>there,</b> it was the Queen who solved this question.|$|R
60|$|Even as her engulfing arms {{closed around}} {{the spot where}} <b>he</b> had <b>stood,</b> <b>there</b> was a splash and {{splutter}} that drew everyone to the side to watch the little Belgian swim frantically to the docks.|$|R
