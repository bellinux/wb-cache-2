40|$|In our {{globalized world}} public policy making and {{society at large}} face {{challenges}} like climate change and financial crises that are global, shared worldwide and tightly connected with policies across different sectors. Solutions for addressing such highly interconnected challenges in a 'system of systems' world, tend to address only subsystems and so fail to achieve systemic change and anticipate impact and unintended consequences of public action. Pursuing the necessity of informing the policy decision process and proactively sensing possible problems concerning global matters we are proposing a novel computational platform called SYMPHONY that offers a solution for designing and testing policies and regulatory measures. Our aim is to offer policy modellers and policy makers tools that will support them to make decisions which will prevent and mitigate economic and financial crises as well as foster an economically and <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth</b> path...|$|E
40|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{sector of}} the Philippine fishing industry registered the highest growth rate of 12. 5 % in 1977 - 1986. The contribution of aquaculture to the total fish production was equivalent to 24 % in 1986 compared to only 85 in the early 1970 's. In terms of quantity, the mariculture subsector registered the highest growth rate of 10. 2 % in 1982 - 1986, whereas {{in terms of value}} the brackishwater fishpond subsector showed the highest growth rate of 33 %. Meanwhile, freshwater aquaculture production exhibited a negative growth rate due to reduction of activities in Laguna de Bay and the slow expansion in hectarage of the commercial freshwater fishponds. Research by several agencies concentrated heavily on the culture of milkfish (Chanos chanos), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Chinese carps (Aristichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), and sea bass (Lates calcarifer). Innovations in seaweed, oyster, and mussel farming are also discussed. Research directions are presented to assure an <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth</b> in aquaculture with emphasis on countryside development...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{potential}} complementarity between environmental efficiency and labour productivity within growth process in theoretical and empirical terms. Firstly, I analyse the theoretical elements that justify the positive relationship between the two efficiencies. Secondly, through a Structuralist-Keynesian baseline model, I illustrate how this complementarity is a necessary condition to obtain <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> cumulative <b>growth.</b> Finally, I verify this complementarity with a Dynamic Panel analysis for the European countries in the period 1992 - 2012 at macro level and manufacturing sector level...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> {{endogenous}} <b>growth</b> is presented, in which environmental quality {{has a positive}} influence on individual welfare and on the productivity of capital. The effect of different environmental policies on the long-run growth of the economy is studied in the framework of this model. The results establish that an optimal policy which taxes production and subsidises pollution abatement has a favourable effect on environmental quality, and could increase the growth rate if the positive external effects of the environment on the productivity are important. Furthermore, it is shown that this kind of environmental policy is neutral in budgetary terms, i. e. tax receipts are equal to subsidies. Finally, it is demonstrated that a policy based on emission control will only {{have a positive effect on}} the growth rate if the initial level of environmental quality is sufficiently low...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} research was generally aimed at formulating strategies for developing rural toun'sm {{based on the}} concept of <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism. Data were collected using several techniques including site observation, interview, document study, and focus group discussion. Triangulation of data sources was applied to perform validity. Data analysis was based on interactive model (Miles and Huberman, 1984). Research results indicate that in the Karanganyar Regency there are abundant rural tourism attractions ranging from natural, cultural and agricultural potentials. However, there are some constraints including limited knowledge about <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism, lack of tourism stakeholders commitment and discipline, lack of competence of human resources in providing tourism services dealing with rural tourism activities, limited information and promotion on rural tourism products which are developed based on <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism concept, and lack of institution which has strong commitment to develop <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> rural tourism. One of the strategies to develop rural tourism based {{on the concept of}} <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism include developing the competence and capacity of tourism human resources, especially of Berjo Village, dealing with the development of rural tourism which is based on the concept of <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism.

40|$|The term "competitiveness" {{has been}} used in conceptually {{distinct}} ways at the firm, regional and national levels. After primarily reviewing existing concepts at the national level, we introduce a new definition of regional competitiveness adapting definitions used in the academic literature. Specifically, we connect "outcome competitiveness" with new perspectives on a more socially inclusive and <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth</b> path, as envisaged in the WWWforEurope research program, in which 33 European research groups are taking part. Evaluating competitiveness requires both an input assessment (costs, productivity, economic structure, capabilities) and an outcome assessment. We define regional outcome competitiveness as the ability of a region to deliver Beyond GDP goals. For regions in industrialized countries, this ability depends on innovation, education, institutions, social cohesion and ecological ambition. Given this new perspective (of broader Beyond GDP goals), social investments and ecological ambitions should not be considered costs, but rather drivers of competitiveness. This is compatible with a new innovation policy fostering non-technical innovations and a new industrial policy supporting societal goals. Applying this concept to European regions, we show which regions take the "high road" to competitiveness and compare our results with the existing literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- There {{are various}} {{factors such as}} {{negative}} impacts on environment, increasing in fossil fuels prices, limitation of fossil fuel resources which have made many energy and environment experts and politicians move toward the development of a modern structure to secure supply of energy, environment protection. Therefore, most countries have begun to realize that the need for sustainability in energy production and consumption is significantly vital. Therefore, tracking the progress of sustainability is essential. Solar Energy is a clean renewable resource with zero emission. Most of the developed countries are switching over to solar energy as one of the prime renewable energy source. The National Solar Mission is a major initiative of the Government of India and State Governments to promote <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth.</b> It will also constitute a major contribution by India to the global effort {{to meet the challenges of}} climate change. The study is motivated by the need to transform the basis of energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Moreover, regarding the increasing rate of the population, solar energy can play a serious role in sustainability of environmental issues as a renewable energy. The objective of present study is concentrate on role, situation and developing solar energy in India and Iran to recognize th...|$|E
40|$|Declining {{water quality}} in the Chesapeake Bay estuary is in part the result of {{disruptions}} in the hydrological system caused by urban and suburban development throughout its 167 000 km 2 watershed. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful {{for a wide range}} of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km 2 area centered on the Washington - Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth.</b> The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water {{quality in the}} Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application. ...|$|E

40|$|Faced {{with major}} {{challenges}} {{of global climate}} change, declining fossil fuel reserves, and competition between alternative uses of land, the transition to renewable transport fuels {{has been marked by}} new modes of political economic governance and the strategic direction of innovation. In this paper, we compare the different trajectories to the development and uptake of biofuels in Europe, Brazil and the USA. In terms of the timing, direction, and development of biofuels for road transport, the early lead taken by Brazil in sugarcane based ethanol and flex-fuel cars, the USA drive to corn-to-ethanol, and the European domination of biodiesel from rapeseed, manifest significant contrasts at many levels. Adopting a neo-Polanyian ?instituted economic process? approach we argue that the contrasting trajectories exemplify the different modes of politically instituting markets. We analyse the contrasting weight and impact of different drivers in each case (energy security, climate change mitigation, rural economy development, and market opportunity) in the context of diverse initial conditions and resource endowments. We explore the ?politics of markets? that arise from the different modes of instituting markets for <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> economic <b>growth,</b> including the role of NGOs, the scientific controversies over land-use change, and the contrasting political institutions in our case studies. We also place our analysis in the historical perspective of other major carbon energy transitions (charcoal to coal, coal to petrochemicals). In so doing, we explore the idea of the emergence of new modes of governance of contemporary capitalist political economies, and the significance of politically directed innovation. The research is based on an extensive primary research programme of in-depth interviews with strategic players in each of the geographic regions, qualitative institutional analysis, a scenario workshop, and secondary data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} global changes. The rapid growth in urban area isimposing high pressure to land and their resources. With regard to various ecological services of the Hyrcanian ecosystems and the necessity to conserve them, this research aimed to investigate the growth trend of urban areas and their impacts on land suitability of the conservational patches in Korganroud watershed, Guilan Province. First, the undeveloped parts of the watershed were divided into two main ecosystem types of forest and rangeland. Then, for each ecosystem type, required parameters of the CAPS Model (land capability and ecological parameters) were calculated and combined using linear combination approach. In total, 14 different zones with an area o 64, 541 hectare (19 % of the watershed‘s area: 13 % jungle and 6 % rangeland ecosystems) were distinguished as conservational patches. Simulation of the urban growth was done using a Markov-Cellular Automata Urban Change Modeling method called SLEUTH. We designed three different scenarios of historical, managed and <b>ecologically</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>growth</b> for the period of 2008 - 2050. Finally, integration of the results of two approaches was implemented using a loose coupling approach. Results reflect a general trend in decline of patch suitability influenced by type and size of the urban area growth. According to the results, the observed changes in urban growth for the historical scenario provide a development approach different to the changes for the other two scenarios which collectively fall in another approach to development. Thus, conservational suitability of the area can be preserved by changing the development approach and harnessingcurrent trend of the urban area growth...|$|E
