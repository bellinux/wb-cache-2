40|$|The SAMPEX spacecraft, {{successfully}} {{launched in}} July 1992, carried a yo-yo <b>despin</b> <b>system</b> and deployable solar arrays. The despin and solar array mechanisms formed an integral system as the yo-yo cables held the solar array release mechanism in place. The SAMPEX design philosophy was to minimize {{size and weight}} {{through the use of}} a predominantly single string system. The design challenge was to build a system in a limited space, which was reliable with minimal redundancy. This paper covers the design and development of the SAMPEX yo-yo despin and solar array deployment mechanisms. The problems encountered during development and testing will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The method {{developed}} {{for analysis of}} single yo despin systems is a two step process. The first step utilizes the despin equations for a yo or yo-yo system to compute the cable tension force and its point of application on the body throughout the despin process. The second step considers the actual body configuration and treats the force just discussed as a prescribed external force acting {{on the surface of}} the body at the physical location of the <b>despin</b> <b>system.</b> The resulting vehicle coning angle is first computed using a digital computer program for a body with no initial coning prior to despin. Closed form solutions which utilize the previous results are then used to treat the effects of initial conditions...|$|E
40|$|Several boom {{arrangements}} were {{proposed for the}} Hawkeye spacecraft. The design chosen to fly consists of one pair of stem roll-out booms {{and a set of}} telescopic booms. Some of the advantages of choosing this boom configuration were that the booms could be stored in the belt line area, which is near the center of gravity of the spacecraft, and also with the approach the telescopic booms could be extended at the spacecraft's initial spin rate (180 rpm). By being able to extend these booms at the initial spin rate of the spacecraft the need for a <b>despin</b> <b>system</b> was eliminated, thus weight saving to the spacecraft. With the method of storage and extension employed by the telescopic design, the desirable sensor distance from the spacecraft could also be attained...|$|E
50|$|Longer tether {{systems have}} also been used on {{satellite}} missions, both operationally (as yo-yo <b>despin</b> <b>systems)</b> and in missions designed to test tether concepts and dynamics.|$|R
40|$|The {{modifications}} and additions {{made to the}} Flexible Spacecraft Dynamics (FSD) Program are described. The principal {{addition to}} the program was the capability to simulate a single axis gimble platform nadir pointing <b>despin</b> control <b>system.</b> The formulation for the single axis gimble equations of motion is a modification of the formulation. The details of the modifications made to the FSD Program are presented. Modifications to existing subroutines are briefly described and {{a detailed description of}} new subroutines is given. In addition, e program variables in new labelled COMMON blocks are described in detail. A description of new input symbols for the FSD Program is given...|$|R
40|$|Amateur Radio Satellite Corporation (AMSAT) is {{developing}} a satellite designated Phase IV for operation in geosynchronous orbit. Conceptual development of the primary propulsion system and the attitude and velocity control system (AVCS) is described with an approach outlined for hardware selection. A launch opportunity in Ariane will provide insertion into a transfer orbit and spin stabilization. The primary propulsion system, which will provide the orbit insertion burn only, will be designed around a Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) 400 newton engine. Two subsystems will comprise the AVCS, a momentum storage system for countering small external perturbations to maintain attitude control and a reaction control system (RCS) for satellite maneuvering and momentum <b>system</b> <b>despinning.</b> Methods for sizing momentum system components, thrusters and propellant tanks are presented, and preliminary mass property data is generated in examples to demonstrate how parameters of these two systems are interrelated...|$|R
40|$|In {{the primary}} {{experiment}} of the spin stabilized San Marco D/L spacecraft, the drag effects {{on a light}} spherical shell coupled to a relatively massive center body will be measured. To achieve the precise mass property control, the centroids of both the shell and the center body must coincide {{with each other and}} with the center of pressure of the shell. Precise spin balancing is needed for launch and orbital stability, and the deployable antennas need accurate alignment. Corrective measures, developed after the preliminary mass measurements showed flaws in the mass property control, are described in detail. Inertia booms and a yo-yo <b>despin</b> <b>system</b> were developed as add-on units, spin balance measurements about all three geometric axes were used to define weight minimized correction within the outer shell envelope, and boom tip mass differentials were optimized for the most favorable inertia ratio margin achievable within the mission weight constraints. The weight versus orbital lifetime trade-offs were also considered...|$|E
40|$|National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) aims {{to capture}} a Near Earth Orbit (NEO) {{asteroid}} {{or a piece of}} a large asteroid and transport it to the EarthMoon system. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of one of the main control challenges for the first ARM mission concept, namely despinning and three-axis stabilizing the asteroid and spacecraft combination after the ARM spacecraft captures the tumbling NEO asteroid. We first show that control laws, which explicitly use the dynamics of the system in their control law equation, encounter a fundamental limitation due to modeling uncertainties. We show that in the presence of large modeling uncertainties, the resultant disturbance torque for such control laws may well exceed the maximum control torque of the conceptual ARM spacecraft. We then numerically compare the performance of three viable control laws: the robust nonlinear tracking control law, the adaptive nonlinear tracking control law, and the simple derivative plus proportional-derivative linear control strategy. We conclude that under very small mod- eling uncertainties, which can be achieved using online system identification, the robust nonlinear tracking control law guarantees exponential convergence to the fuel-optimal reference trajectory and hence consumes the least fuel. On the other hand, in the presence of large modeling uncertainties, measurement errors, and actuator saturations, the best strategy for stabilizing the asteroid and spacecraft combination is to first <b>despin</b> the <b>system</b> using a derivative (rate damping) linear control law and then stabilize the system in the desired orientation using the simple proportional-derivative linear control law. More-over, the fuel consumed by the conceptual ARM spacecraft using these control strategies is upper bounded by 300 kg for the nominal range of NEO asteroid parameters. We conclude this paper with specific design guidelines for the ARM spacecraft for efficiently stabilizing the tumbling NEO asteroid and spacecraft combination...|$|R
