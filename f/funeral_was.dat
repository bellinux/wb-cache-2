If the <b>funeral</b> <b>was</b> to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the <b>funeral</b> <b>was</b> to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E
