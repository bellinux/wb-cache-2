5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{belongs to the}} order Cetartiodactyla, the order {{containing}} all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It {{is a member of}} the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps and the <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the sperm whale family).|$|E

500|$|Whales have torpedo shaped {{bodies with}} non-flexible necks, limbs {{modified}} into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a large tail fin, and flat heads (with {{the exception of}} monodontids and ziphiids). Whale skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids) and eyes placed {{on the sides of}} its head. Whales range in size from the [...] and [...] <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> to the [...] and [...] blue whale. Overall, they tend to dwarf other cetartiodactyls; the blue whale is the largest creature on earth. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. One exception is with the sperm whale, which has males larger than the females.|$|E

Twenty-t wo species in 12 families of oceanic cephalopods were identified. In pygmy sp erm whales, Enoploteuthis chunii, Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis, and Taonius pavo {{were the primary}} prey in the diet, while E. chunii, Histioteuthis miranda, and T. pavo {{were the most important}} prey items ingested by <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Although the primary p rey items these two species ingested were very similar, each item comprised a different proportion for each whale species. A similarity test demonstrated a significant difference in prey composition, and SIMPER analysis showed that E. chunii was ranked first and contributed 37. 1 % to the average dissimilarity between pygmy and <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> fed on much larger T. pavo compared to those ingested by <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> while <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> ingested more H. miranda than did pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> These results support the view that pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live seaward of the continental shelf and that <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live more in coastal waters.

40|$|<b>Dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are {{distributed}} throughout deep waters {{and along the}} continental slopes of the North Pacific and other ocean basins (Caldwell and Caldwell 1989; Ross 1984). This species was only recognized as being distinct from the pygmy <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> in 1966 (Handley, 1966), and early records for the two species are confounded. Along the U. S. west coast, no at-sea sightings of this species have been reported; however, this may be partially a reflection of their pelagic distribution, small body size and cryptic behavior. A few sightings of animals identified only as Kogia sp. have been reported (Figure 1), {{and some of these}} may have been <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> At least five <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> stranded in California between 1967 and 2000 (Roest 1970; Jones 1981; J.

It is unclear whether records of <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are so rare because they are not regular inhabitants of this region, or merely because of their cryptic habits and offshore distribution.

500|$|The {{traditional}} {{view has}} been that Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) arose from more primitive whales early in the Oligocene period, and that the super-family Physeteroidea, which contains the sperm whale, <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> and pygmy sperm whale, diverged from other toothed whales soon after that, over [...] From 1993 to 1996, molecular phylogenetics analyses by Milinkovitch and colleagues, based on comparing the genes of various modern whales, suggested that the sperm whales are {{more closely related to}} the baleen whales than they are to other toothed whales, which would have meant that Odontoceti were not monophyletic; in other words, it did not consist of a single ancestral toothed whale species and all its descendants. However, more recent studies, based on various combinations of comparative anatomy and molecular phylogenetics, criticised Milinkovitch's analysis on technical grounds and reaffirmed that the Odontoceti are monophyletic.|$|E
500|$|Whales are {{creatures of}} the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their {{adaptation}} to life underwater that {{they are unable to}} survive on land. Whales range in size from the [...] and [...] <b>dwarf</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> to the [...] and [...] blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth designed for catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of [...] "smell", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey.|$|E
