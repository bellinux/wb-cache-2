25|$|On , the art {{historian}} {{took over as}} Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This {{proved to be a}} highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's interwar career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved. Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General Alexandru Mustață, could not speak any German. Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet Minister of Education in spring 1917. Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer I. A. Bassarabescu into his Police apparatus, obtaining his release from German internment and appointing him <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>division.</b> Reportedly, he did the same for philosopher Mircea Florian, who became his Carol I Foundation subordinate.|$|E

500|$|Foreseeing an {{expanded}} role for science in World War II, which the United States {{had not yet}} joined, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) on June 27, 1940, with Vannevar Bush as its chairman. James B. Conant, the President [...] of Harvard, was appointed <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> B, which was responsible for bombs, fuels, gases and chemicals. He appointed Kistiakowsky to head its Section A-1, which was concerned with explosives. In June 1941, the NDRC was absorbed into the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Bush became Chairman of the OSRD, Conant succeeded him as Chairman of the NDRC, and Kistiakowsky became head of Section B.

500|$|Edward Latessa, {{professor}} and <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> {{of criminal justice}} at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may {{think that they are}} getting something out of the performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation. [...] "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. [...] "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Now that's a 'breakout' hit: The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1940, with World War II already {{raging in}} Europe, Vannevar Bush, the {{director}} of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, recruited Conant to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), although he remained president of Harvard. Bush envisaged the NDRC as bringing scientists together to [...] ""conduct research for the creation and improvement of instrumentalities, methods and materials of warfare." [...] Although the United States had not yet entered the war, Conant was not alone in his conviction that Nazi Germany had to be stopped, and that the United States would inevitably become embroiled in the conflict. The immediate task, as Conant saw it, was therefore to organize American science for war. He became head of the NDRC's Division B, the division responsible for bombs, fuels, gases and chemicals. On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as its director. Conant succeeded Bush as Chairman of the NDRC, which was subsumed into the OSRD. Roger Adams, a contemporary of Conant's at Harvard in the 1910s, succeeded him as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> B. Conant became the driving force of the NDRC on personnel and policy matters. The NDRC would work {{hand in hand with the}} Army and Navy's research efforts, supplementing rather than supplanting them. It was specifically charged with investigating nuclear fission.|$|E
40|$|Ernest as {{a person}} In my talk I will give several {{examples}} to illustrate the most endearing characteristics of Ernest’s personality. Here I mention just one particular incidence. There was a meeting <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>divisions</b> <b>of</b> the Institute of Physiology to discuss some questions of interdepartmental organization of the Institute. This meeting coincided with one convened by the cleaners and maintenance workers of the Institute. For most <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divisions</b> the decision as to which meeting to attend {{was not a problem}} and all apart from Ernest attended the meeting <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>divisions.</b> Ernest’s choice was quite unexpected; he attended the meeting of the cleaners and maintenance workers. At the time, this choice seemed quite inappropriate, but with hindsight {{it became clear that the}} meeting Ernest attended was much more important for the smooth running of the Institute, then that <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>Divisions.</b> Such unconventional and original decisions were also reflected in Ernest Gutmann’s work, where he was attracted to the study of problems that were not necessarily fashionable, but attracted his attention by their uniqueness.

2500|$|In 1952, Zel'dovich {{began work}} in the field of {{elementary}} particles and their transformations. He predicted the beta decay of a pi meson. Together with S. Gershtein he noticed the analogy between the weak and electromagnetic interactions, and in 1960, he predicted the muon catalysis (more precisely, the muon-catalysed dt-fusion) phenomenon. In 1977 Zel'dovich together with Fyodor Shapiro was awarded the Kurchatov Medal, the highest award in nuclear physics of the USSR. The citation was [...] "for prediction of characteristics of ultracold neutrons, their detection and investigation". He was elected academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences on 20 June 1958.

2500|$|In October 1940, MI5 moved offices from {{unlikely}} temporary premises at Wormwood Scrubs Prison to {{the even}} less likely Blenheim Palace. At a top-level meeting at that venue in November Archer criticised Brigadier Harker, recently appointed {{acting director of}} MI5, for incompetence. Harker, who had previously been her <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>division,</b> then dismissed her. Concerning this Guy Liddell, director of counter-espionage, wrote of Harker [...] "but for his incompetence, the situation would never have arisen" [...] but he also thought that Archer had [...] "unfortunately gone too far". Shortly afterwards David Petrie was appointed as the next director general and Harker was made his deputy – indeed Andrew's view is that Harker's dismissal of Archer probably contributed to Harker being put out to grass. For {{the rest of the}} war MI5 employed no other women as officers although several did work at this level of seniority.|$|E
