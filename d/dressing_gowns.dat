5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, 1842, after {{exhausting}} {{his final}} appeal, Colt {{was sentenced to}} death by hanging and remanded to New York City's infamous prison, the Tombs. His sentence was to be carried out on November 14, 1842. Colt asked that he be allowed to marry Caroline Henshaw on the morning of his hanging. While imprisoned, Colt lived luxuriously in his prison cell, receiving daily visits from friends and family, smoking Cuban cigars, sleeping in an actual bed instead of a mound of straw and wearing silk <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> inside and a seal skin overcoat for his daily walks in the prison yard. [...] His cell contained the latest novels, a gilded bird cage with a canary and fresh flowers brought to him every day by Henshaw. [...] He dined on meals from local hotels such as quail on toast, game pates, reed birds, and ortolans. [...] Several attempts were made to break him out of the prison by dressing him in women's clothing but all these efforts were foiled. [...] A doctor was hired who claimed he could resuscitate Colt from the hanging, providing the body did not remain suspended long, as he believed Colt's neck to be of such thickness that strangulation would be impossible. [...] Colt's friends put the doctor up in the Shakespeare Hotel {{on the morning of the}} scheduled hanging and planned to bring the body there from the Tombs for resuscitation.|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna and her {{supporting}} dancers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory {{were dressed}} as old women in fluffy <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> with dollar signs and curling pins in their hair. Singing the song {{with a strong}} mid-western accent, they got up and revealed a frivolish pink dress underneath their gown, in which they danced around. On some dates Madonna replaced the words [...] "experience has made me rich" [...] with [...] "experience has made me a bitch". After singing, she produced dollar bills out of her corsage and threw {{them up in the}} air for the audience to catch. Two different performances were taped and released on video, Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. During the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from American Life, [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". But [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] were later dropped from the show. Hence [...] "Material Girl" [...] was transferred as the closing song of the military segment of the show, and was re-arranged as an electric guitar version. Madonna wore military themed clothes and sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone and playing an electric guitar. The backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens.|$|E

2500|$|After 1912, {{with the}} {{development}} of the Art Deco style, Charvet, along with fashion designer Paul Poiret, started to commission art work from the French painter Raoul Dufy, the [...] "granddaddy of modem chic", through the French weaver Bianchini-Férier. Some of the first were related to the war, such as Les Alliés or the Victory Rooster (Figure, left). This was followed by more silk squares, woven silk fabrics for vests, and printed ramie fabrics for <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> and shirts. Some famous customers of the period were fashion designer Coco Chanel and the Maharadjah of Patiala who once placed a single order of 86 dozen shirts.|$|E
2500|$|Of course, {{much of this}} is untrue, or a gross exaggeration. Men's formal {{clothing}} {{may have}} been less colourful {{than it was in the}} previous century, but brilliant waistcoats and cummerbunds provided a touch of color, and smoking jackets and <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> were often of rich Oriental brocades. This phenomenon was the result of the growing textile manufacturing sector, developing mass production processes, and increasing attempts to market fashion to men. [...] Corsets stressed a woman's sexuality, exaggerating hips and bust by contrast with a tiny waist. Women's evening gowns bared the shoulders and the tops of the breasts. The jersey dresses of the 1880s may have covered the body, but the stretchy novel fabric fit the body like a glove.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 {{a box of}} {{documents}} and letters concerning the Titanic sinking belonging to the Duff-Gordons was rediscovered at the London office of Veale Wasbrough Vizards, the legal firm that merged with Tweedies, which had represented the couple. Among the papers was an inventory of the possessions Lucy Duff Gordon had lost, the total value listed as £3,208 3s 6d. One letter detailed what she wore when leaving the ship: two <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> [...] "for warmth", a muff, and her [...] "motor hat". (A faded grey silk kimono with typical Fortuny style black cord edging, for some time {{thought to have been}} worn by her that night, is now understood to have belonged to her daughter Esme, Countess of Halsbury, as its distinctive print dates the item to post World War I.) [...] An apron said to have been worn by Francatelli can be seen at the Maritime Museum in Liverpool, and her life-jacket was sold, along with correspondence about her experiences in the disaster, at Christie's auction house, London, in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Charvet was {{considered}} to produce [...] "the finest cravats in the world", with either conservative designs or “decidedly original” patterns, such as postage-stamps (See below) or much more “modernist” patterns. At an exhibition called [...] "L'art de la soie" [...] held at the Musée Galliera in Paris in 1927, Charvet presented <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> and neckties in matching patterns, together with pyjamas, shirts and handherchieves. The company developed a practice of sending merchandises to its customers for approval, allowing them to select some or none and return the rest, subsequently {{referred to as the}} Charvet method. It conceived a range of free-form bold printed tie patterns which gained wide popularity in the USA. [...] "Its chic was in their unfussy, nonchalant bearing. To the delight of their many admirers, the Charvets' open settings facilitated blending with all kind of fancy suits [...] The original Charvet prints became the first, and regrettably almost the last, bold figured necktie to symbolize upper-class taste". Some such bold Charvet Art Deco ties which had belonged to John Ringling are on display at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. These patterns, for which charvet became a generic name, [...] "foreshadowed" [...] the colorful designs which became popular after the war. The company also produced beach linen robes with patterns up to two feet in diameter.|$|E

(Catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the {{electric}} bell by the fireplace.) What are you shewing off that bell for?

Wasn't I a little idiot not--to know that you'd make for a place like this and dig a hole and stay in it, and let the world go hang?" ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Ives {{wasted no}} time in the interval, and he fairly ran out into the office. Miss Lucretia Penniman was in town, and would attend the mass meeting. Now, indeed, {{it was to be a}} mass meeting. Away flew the tidings, broadcast, and people threw off their carpet {{slippers}} and <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns,</b> and some who had gone to bed got up again. Mr. Dodd heard it, and changed his shoes three times, and his intentions three times three. Should he go, or should he not? Already he heard in imagination the first distant note of the populace, and he was not of the metal to defend a Bastille or a Louvre for his royal master with the last drop of his blood.|$|E
60|$|In {{the clutch}} of Chitterlow and the Incalculable, Kipps came round {{to the house}} in Fenchurch Street and was there made to {{participate}} in the midday meal. He came to the house, forgetting certain confidences, and was reminded of the existence of a Mrs. Chitterlow (with the finest completely untrained Contralto voice in England) by her appearance. She had an air of being older than Chitterlow, although probably she wasn't, and her hair was a reddish brown, streaked with gold. She was dressed in one of those complaisant garments that are <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> or tea gowns or bathing wraps or rather original evening robes according to the exigencies of the moment--from the first Kipps was aware that she possessed a warm and rounded neck, and her well-moulded arms came and vanished from the sleeves--and she had large, expressive brown eyes that he discovered ever and again fixed in an enigmatical manner upon his own.|$|E
6000|$|In his matter also Thackeray is realistic, {{reflecting}} not {{the pride}} and pomp of war, which are largely delusions, but its brutality and barbarism, {{which are all}} too real; painting generals and leaders, not as the newspaper heroes to whom we are accustomed, but as moved by intrigues, petty jealousies, and selfish ambitions; showing us the great Duke of Marlborough not as the military hero, the idol of war-crazed multitudes, but as without personal honor, and governed by despicable avarice. In a word, Thackeray gives us the [...] "back stairs" [...] view of war, which is, as a rule, totally neglected in our histories. When he deals with the literary men of the period, he uses the same frank realism, showing us Steele and Addison and other leaders, not with halos about their heads, as popular authors, but in slippers and <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns,</b> smoking a pipe in their own rooms, or else growing tipsy and hilarious in the taverns,--just as they appeared in daily life. Both in style and in matter, therefore, Esmond deserves to rank as probably the best historical novel in our language.|$|E

50|$|Silk: Silk <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> {{are popular}} {{because of their}} look and feel, but can be {{relatively}} expensive. Silk robes are very thin and lightweight, and are not particularly suited to wet situations because they lack the surface area and polarity necessary to absorb water. However, silk <b>dressing</b> <b>gowns</b> are the traditional choice, since they are not worn after bathing.|$|E
