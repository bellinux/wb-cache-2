40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a method is {{presented}} to fair the limit surface of a subdivision algorithm around an extraordinary point. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the subdivision matrix determine the continuity {{and shape of the}} limit surface. The dominant, sub-dominant and subsub-dominant <b>eigenvalues</b> <b>should</b> satisfy linear and quadratic equality- and inequality-constraints to guarantee continuous normal and bounded curvature globally. The remaining eigenvalues need only satisfy linear inequality-constraints. In general, except for the dominant eigenvalue, all eigenvalues can be used to optimize the shape of the limit surface with our method. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of differentiable eigenvalues and eigenvectors {{for a general}} matrix is addressed. The eigenspace which contains differentiable eigenvectors is determined and computed by using the concept of subspace intersection {{in conjunction with the}} singular value decomposition algorithm. The differentiable eigenvectors associated with repeated <b>eigenvalues</b> <b>should</b> be simultaneously the eigenvectors of the general matrix and its corresponding sensitivity matrix. Furthermore, the derivatives for differentiable eigenvectors associated with repeated eigenvalues can be computed using higher order derivatives of the matrix, whereas the corresponding eigenvalue derivatives are the eigenvalues of the sensitivity matrix...|$|R

40|$|The reanalysis of non-self-adjoint dynamic {{models is}} {{computationally}} very expensive in design optimization applications. This paper describes several approximations {{that can be}} applied to eigenvalues of non-hermitian matrices to reduce that computational cost. Approximations based on eigenvalue derivatives, generalized Rayleigh quotient and the trace theorem are presented and their accuracy and computational cost are estimated. The accuracy and cost estimates are verified by applying the approximations to random matrices and matrices arising in flutter analysis of compressor blades. Recommendations are made for selection of the best approximation when the derivatives are available and when they are not. In particular, it is concluded that the quadratic approximation for <b>eigenvalues</b> <b>should</b> never be used as higher order approximations are always more accurate as well as more efficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} polynomial for {{a chain of}} dipole–dipole coupled two-level atoms with nearest-neighbour and next-nearest-neighbour interactions is developed {{for the study of}} eigenvalues and eigenvectors for single-photon excitations. Such a system is mathematically equivalent to an XX spin chain in an external magnetic field. We find the exact form of the polynomial in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind that is valid for an arbitrary number of atoms and coupling strengths. We then propose a technique for expressing the roots of the polynomial as a power series in the coupling constants. The general properties of the solutions are also explored, to shed some light on the general properties that the exact, analytic form of the energy <b>eigenvalues</b> <b>should</b> have. A method for deriving the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian is also outlined...|$|R
