5|$|Taylor v. Illinois, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> hurts the defense's case.

5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances <b>if</b> <b>that</b> object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E

To his credit, Eckersley fielded every reporters' question after the game, mostly blaming himself. Years later, he recalled, [...] "Somebody said that the Dodgers knew I threw a backdoor slider on 3 - 2. I don’t know <b>if</b> <b>that’s</b> true or not. I didn’t get to 3 - 2 <b>that</b> often, but <b>if</b> <b>that’s</b> what the guy told him Gibson, <b>if</b> <b>that’s</b> what he had on his mind, good for him.

The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E

5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable <b>if</b> <b>that</b> person then causes death or injury {{to a third}} party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as <b>if</b> <b>that</b> reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E

Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player <b>if</b> <b>that</b> player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E

5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} some {{significant}} changes to its campaign {{over the course}} of its development.

Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the Seleukid faction, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
