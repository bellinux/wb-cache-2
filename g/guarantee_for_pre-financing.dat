40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the way in which {{municipalities}} receive funding from the European Union and assesses the impact of the funds on the municipal budget. Through the analysis of source materials, interviews with relevant officials, who process project applications and my own opinion, I have defined problems which the municipalities have to solve during the preparation and implementation of certain projects in the practical part of thesis. Small municipalities cannot effectively draw money from European funds {{due to the lack of}} human capital, low number of grant titles, red tape, small use of the principles of cooperation between the private and public sectors, and last but not least the need <b>for</b> <b>pre-financing</b> the projects. Grant recipient must participate roughly ten percent of the total cost in financing the project. Although this number may seem small, many municipalities must take the co-financing commercial loans, whose withdrawal is reflected mainly in the capital budget. Interest on loans burdens the municipal budget, the municipality debts and worsen financial health indicator of the municipality. However most projects would have not been realized without the help from European funds. Grants from the European Union significantly contribute to the development of the municipality...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} provide seamless communications in mobile wireless networks. The goal of seamless communication is to provide disruption free service to a mobile user. A disruption in service could occur due to active handoffs (handoffs during an active connection). Existing protocols either provide total <b>guarantee</b> <b>for</b> disruption free service incurring heavy network bandwidth usage (multicast based approach), or do not provide any <b>guarantee</b> <b>for</b> disruption free service (forwarding approach). There are many user applications {{that do not require}} a "total" <b>guarantee</b> <b>for</b> disruption free service but would also not tolerate very frequent disruptions. This paper proposes a novel staggered multicast approach which provides a probabilistic <b>guarantee</b> <b>for</b> disruption free service. The main advantage of the staggered multicast approach is that it exploits the performance guarantees provided by the multicast approach and also provides the much required savings in the static network bandwidth. The proble...|$|R
