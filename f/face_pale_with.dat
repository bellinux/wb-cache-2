60|$|He found Bartley {{seated at}} the window, with a wet towel round his head, and his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> headache.|$|E
60|$|Clarke {{turned as}} he heard her step and looked {{straight}} {{into a pair of}} dark, scornful eyes and a <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger.|$|E
60|$|M. de Rivarol was {{compelled}} to swallow his fury, though it choked him. The jubilation among his officers had been such {{that he could not}} continue as he had begun. Yet his eyes were malevolent, his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger.|$|E
5000|$|They were {{generally}} depicted as birds with {{the heads of}} maidens, <b>faces</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> hunger and long claws on their hands. Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness. Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Ovid described them as human-vultures.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor smiled grimly, {{while the}} Patrician's thin <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger.|$|R
60|$|With clenched teeth, and <b>faces</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> {{rage and}} anxiety, the party rode on past {{the site of}} the huts, {{scattered}} round which were the bodies of several of the murdered peons. They halted not until they drew rein, and leapt off {{in front of the house}} itself.|$|R
60|$|This {{might also}} be irony; and Francis thought it so; but the tones were so soft and conciliating, that with a <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> his emotions, he ventured to look up and met the eye of Marian, fixed on him in an {{expression}} that changed his death-like hue into the color of vermillion.|$|E
60|$|After {{they had}} gone Burt took his rifle and strolled off into the forest. Then the girl appeared. Her hair was down, her <b>face</b> <b>pale,</b> <b>with</b> dark shadows. She asked for water to wash her face. Wilson pointed to the brook, and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean scarf from his pack and carried them to her.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind me, and then, for an instant, I heard him talking in a low voice of {{concentrated}} passion to his wife. This gross breach of hospitality had evidently hit upon his tenderest point. I am no eavesdropper, so I walked out on to the lawn. Presently I heard a hurried step behind me, and there was the lady, her <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> excitement, and her eyes red with tears.|$|E
60|$|She {{repeated}} the sentence, <b>with</b> her <b>face</b> very <b>pale,</b> <b>with</b> her dear hand cold and trembling in mine.|$|R
60|$|And {{when the}} crowd had passed noisily along, leaving behind it a trail of torn finery, of {{glittering}} tinsel and of scarlet berries, when the boom of the big drum and the grating noise of the brass trumpets had somewhat died away, wan <b>faces,</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anxiety, would peer from out the darkness, and nervous hands would grasp with trembling fingers the small bundles of poor belongings tied up hastily in view of flight.|$|R
6000|$|Medeia shrank and trembled, and her <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> fear; and Aietes {{knew that}} she was guilty, and whispered, ‘If they win the fleece, you die!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|The Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> passion. [...] "Am I to believe," [...] he said, [...] "that you are {{the cause}} of this great evil that has come upon me? and that {{you are the}} wicked {{creature}} who has again started this old man upon his career of pipe-playing? What have I ever done to you that you should have condemned me for years and years to echo back the notes of those wretched pipes?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{memory of}} the other father who had left his {{children}} in the night, never to return, made Mr. Bhaer hold his own boy close, and, for a minute, hide his face in Robby's curly hair. Emil laid his head down on his arms, Franz, went to {{put his hand on}} his uncle's shoulder, his boyish <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> sympathy and sorrow, and the others sat so still that the soft rustle of the falling leaves outside was distinctly heard.|$|E
6000|$|As Dolly {{stood before}} her brother, pouring out her words with {{glittering}} eyes, impetuous voice, and <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> passionate emotion, he was scared; for as his scattered wits returned to him, {{he felt that}} he had been playing with edge tools, and had cut and slashed in rather a promiscuous manner. Dazed and dizzy, he sat staring at the excited figure before him, forgetting the indignity he had received, the mistake he had made, the damage he had done, in simple wonder at the revolutions going on under his astonished eyes. When Dolly stopped for breath, he muttered with a contrite look,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The lieutenant's <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger, {{and he made}} {{a motion}} as if to strike the impudent boy, but one of his companions said, in a warning whisper: ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the moment}} that Magdalen Crawford's {{haunting}} eyes had looked straight into his for one fleeting second, an unnamable thrill of pain and pleasure stirred his heart, a thrill so strong and sudden and passionate that his <b>face</b> <b>paled</b> <b>with</b> emotion; the room seemed to swim before his eyes in a mist out of which gleamed that wonderful face with its mesmeric, darkly radiant eyes, burning their way into deeps and abysses of his soul hitherto unknown to him.|$|R
6000|$|Sam's <b>face</b> was <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> {{apprehension}} {{that something}} had happened to Peter; but, he said, [...] "How dat be, Massa Tom, with Sam in the next room all the time?" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were both}} silent. Miss Mayfield glanced at Jeff under {{the corners of}} her lashes. He was leaning against a tree, absorbed in thought. Accustomed to look upon him as a {{pleasing}} picturesque object, quite fresh, original, and characteristic, she was somewhat disturbed to find that to-day he presented certain other qualities which clearly did not agree with her preconceived ideas of his condition. He had abandoned his usual large top-boots for low shoes, and she could not help noticing that his feet were small and slender as were his hands, albeit browned by exposure. His ruddy color was gone too, and his <b>face,</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> sorrow and experience, had a new expression. His buttoned-up coat and white collar, so unlike his usual self, also had its suggestions--which Miss Mayfield was at first inclined to resent. Women are quick to notice and augur more or less wisely from these small details. Nevertheless, she began in quite another tone.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Caryll observed--and be {{it known}} {{that he had the}} very shrewdest eye for a woman, as became one of the race from which on his mother's side he sprang--that she was {{middling}} tall, chastely slender, having, as he judged from her high waist, a fine, clean length of limb. All this he observed and approved, and prayed for a glimpse of the face which her silken hood obscured and screened from his desiring gaze. She raised it at that moment--raised it in a timid, frightened fashion, as one who looks fearfully about to see that she is not remarked--and Mr. Caryll had a glimpse of an oval <b>face,</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> a warm pallor--like the pallor of the peach, he thought, and touched, like the peach, with a faint hint of pink in either cheek. A pair of eyes, large, brown, and gentle as a saint's, met his, and Mr. Caryll realized that she was beautiful and that it might be good to look into those eyes at closer quarters.|$|E
60|$|By degrees, {{however, the}} reports grew stronger, and more frequent, {{and at last}} a barge, laden with {{numerous}} chaldrons of the best Wallsend, brought up the positive intelligence {{that several of the}} arches of the old bridge were stopped, and that preparations were actually in progress for constructing the new one. What an excitement was visible in the old tap-room on that memorable night! Each man looked into his neighbour’s <b>face,</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> alarm and astonishment, and read therein an echo of the sentiments which filled his own breast. The oldest heaver present proved to demonstration, that the moment the piers were removed, all the water in the Thames would run clean off, and leave a dry gully in its place. What was to become of the coal-barges—of the trade of Scotland-yard—of the very existence of its population? The tailor shook his head more sagely than usual, and grimly pointing to a knife on the table, bid them wait and see what happened. He said nothing—not he; but if the Lord Mayor didn’t fall a victim to popular indignation, why he would be rather astonished; that was all.|$|E
6000|$|YANK--[Clenching his fists, his <b>face</b> growing <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> rage as if {{the skin}} in the window were a {{personal}} insult.] Trowin' it up in my face! Christ! I'll fix her! ...|$|R
60|$|Fifteen {{minutes later}} Thurston {{took his place}} behind the boulder, and, because the light was clearer now, he could dimly see the man {{swinging}} a heavy hammer, against the rock. He knew that the miscreant, whose business was to prevent the possibility of such accidents, need only start a few more keys, which he would probably do when the dam was clear of men, and many thousand dollars' worth of property {{and the result of}} months of labor would be swallowed by the river. His <b>face</b> <b>paled</b> <b>with</b> fierce anger when he recognized this fact.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Faces</b> so <b>pale,</b> <b>with</b> wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet; Draw close, but speak not. Phantoms, welcome, {{divine and}} tender! Invisible to the rest, {{henceforth}} become my companions; Follow me ever! desert me not, while I live! ...|$|R
6000|$|MICH. (holding up his hand). A moment! I have {{something}} to say. (Approaches VERA; speaks very slowly.) Vera Sabouroff, have you forgotten your brother? (Pauses to see effect; VERA starts.) Have you forgotten that young <b>face,</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> famine; those young limbs twisted with torture; the iron chains they made him walk in? What week of liberty did they give him? What pity did they show him for a day? (VERA falls in a chair.) Oh! you could talk glibly enough then of vengeance, glibly enough of liberty. When {{you said you would}} come to Moscow, your old father caught you by the knees and begged you not to leave him childless and alone.[26] I seem to hear his cries still ringing in my ears, but you were as deaf to him as the rocks on the roadside; as chill and cold as the snow on the hill. You left your father that night, and three weeks after he died of a broken heart. You wrote to me to follow you here. I did so; first because I loved you; but you soon cured me of that; whatever gentle feeling, whatever pity, whatever humanity, was in my heart you withered up and destroyed, as the canker worm eats the corn, and the plague kills the child. You bade me cast out love from my breast as a vile thing, you turned my hand to iron, and my heart to stone; you told me to live for freedom and for revenge. I have done so; but you, what have you done? ...|$|E
60|$|You {{know very}} well that in those times there flourished divers evil old women who, under the name of Witches, spread great {{disorder}} through the land, and inflicted various dismal tortures upon Christian men; sticking pins and needles into them when they least expected it, and causing them to walk in the air with their feet upwards, to the great terror of their wives and families, who were naturally very much disconcerted when the master of the house unexpectedly came home, knocking at the door with his heels and combing his hair on the scraper. These were their commonest pranks, but they every day played a hundred others, of which none were less objectionable, and many were much more so, being improper besides; the result was that vengeance was denounced against all old women, with whom even the king himself had no sympathy (as he certainly ought to have had), for with his own most Gracious hand he penned a most Gracious consignment of them to everlasting wrath, and devised most Gracious means for their confusion and slaughter, in virtue whereof scarcely a day passed but one witch at the least was most graciously hanged, drowned, or roasted in some part of his dominions. Still the press teemed with strange and terrible news from the North or the South, or the East or the West, relative to witches and their unhappy victims in some corner of the country, and the Public's hair stood on end to that degree that it lifted its hat off its head, and made its <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> terror.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was taking}} high {{ground in the}} commencement; and, as the man had his cue, and {{delivered}} his message with great distinctness and steadiness, {{the effect on the}} dependants of the household was very evident. Sir Reginald's face flushed, while Sir Gervaise bit his lip; Bluewater played with the hilt of his sword, very indifferent to all that was passing; while Atwood and the surgeons shrugged their shoulders and smiled. The first of these persons well knew that Tom had no shadow of a claim to the title he had been in so much haste to assume, however, and he hoped that the feebleness of his rights in all particulars, was represented by the mixed feebleness and impudence connected with this message. Determined not to be bullied from his present purpose, therefore, he turned to the servant and sent him back with a second message, that did not fail of its object. The man was directed to inform his master, that Sir Reginald Wychecombe was in possession of facts that, in his opinion, justified the course he was taking, and if [...] "Mr. Thomas Wychecombe" [...] did not choose to appear, in order to look after his own interests, he should proceed without him. This brought Tom into the room, his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> uncertainty, rather than with grief, and his mind agitated with such apprehensions as are apt to beset even the most wicked, when they take their first important step in evil. He bowed, however, to the company with an air that he intended to represent the manner of a well-bred man acknowledging his duties to respected guests.|$|E
60|$|More {{was true}} {{than he would}} allow her to credit and when the little Soeur de Charite found a few minutes for visiting her patient's wound, her bright <b>face</b> was <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> horror and her eyes red with weeping.|$|R
6000|$|Kea's <b>face</b> grew <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> terror. [...] "You are," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{can see it}} rise. The bubbles are bursting; the steam's crackling. It {{always does}} so before it begins to flow out upon {{the slopes of the}} mountain." ...|$|R
60|$|She started erect, and {{he could}} see her <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> glow <b>with</b> joy.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing in Rome helps your fancy {{to a more}} {{vigorous}} backward flight than to lounge {{on a sunny day}} over the railing which guards the great central researches. It [...] "says" [...] more things to you than you can repeat to see the past, the ancient world, as you stand there, bodily turned up with the spade and transformed from an immaterial, inaccessible fact of time into a matter of soils and surfaces. The pleasure is the same--in kind--as what you enjoy of Pompeii, and the pain the same. It wasn't here, however, that I found my compensation for forfeiting the spectacle on the Corso, but in a little church {{at the end of the}} narrow byway which diverges up the Palatine from just beside the Arch of Titus. This byway leads you between high walls, then takes a bend and introduces you to a long row of rusty, dusty little pictures of the stations of the cross. Beyond these stands a small church with a front so modest that you hardly recognise it till you see the leather curtain. I never see a leather curtain without lifting it; it is sure to cover a constituted scene of some sort--good, bad or indifferent. The scene this time was meagre--whitewash and tarnished candlesticks and mouldy muslin flowers being its principal features. I shouldn't have remained if I hadn't been struck with the attitude of the single worshipper--a young priest kneeling before one of the sidealtars, who, as I entered, lifted his head and gave me a sidelong look so charged with the languor of devotion that he immediately became an object of interest. He was visiting each of the altars in turn and kissing the balustrade beneath them. He was alone in the church, and indeed in the whole region. There were no beggars even at the door; they were plying their trade on the skirts of the Carnival. In the entirely deserted place he alone knelt for religion, and as I sat respectfully by it seemed to me I could hear in the perfect silence the far-away uproar of the maskers. It was my late impression of these frivolous people, I suppose, joined with the extraordinary gravity of the young priest's face- -his pious fatigue, his droning prayer and his isolation--that gave me just then and there a supreme vision of the religious passion, its privations and resignations and exhaustions and its terribly small share of amusement. He was young and strong and evidently of not too refined a fibre to enjoy the Carnival; but, planted there with his <b>face</b> <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> fasting and his knees stiff with praying, he seemed so stern a satire on it and on the crazy thousands who were preferring it to his way, that I half expected to see some heavenly portent out of a monastic legend come down and confirm his choice. Yet I confess that though I wasn't enamoured of the Carnival myself, his seemed a grim preference and this forswearing of the world a terrible game--a gaining one only if your zeal never falters; a hard fight when it does. In such an hour, to a stout young fellow like the hero of my anecdote, the smell of incense must seem horribly stale and the muslin flowers and gilt candlesticks to figure no great bribe. And it wouldn't have helped him much to think that not so very far away, just beyond the Forum, in the Corso, there was sport for the million, and for nothing. I doubt on the other hand whether my young priest had thought of this. He had made himself a temple out of the very elements of his innocence, and his prayers followed each other too fast for the tempter to slip in a whisper. And so, as I say, I found a solider fact of human nature than the love of coriandoli.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Searle seized my arm {{and glared}} at me; his <b>pale</b> <b>face</b> <b>paler</b> still <b>with</b> the horror of my suggestion, his great eyes of alarm glowing and his strange red hair erect and quivering. [...] "A valid claim!" [...] he shouted. [...] "Let him try it--let him bring it into court!" ...|$|R
60|$|But he {{was looking}} unheeding at the music. Then {{suddenly}} the piccolo broke forth, wild, shrill, brilliant. He was playing Mozart. The child's <b>face</b> went <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> anger at the sound. She turned, and went out, closing both doors behind her to shut out the noise.|$|R
60|$|Sudden {{and silent}} as a phantom Mrs. Bodiham appeared, gliding noiselessly across the room. Above her black dress her <b>face</b> was <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> an opaque whiteness, {{her eyes were}} pale as water in a glass, and her strawy hair was almost colourless. She held a large {{envelope}} in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you be silent!" [...] {{he hissed}} through his teeth, his <b>face</b> deadly <b>pale</b> now <b>with</b> a passion of wrath {{at least as}} fierce as hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was a close}} shave, Jacques," [...] Ralph said smiling, {{though his}} <b>face</b> was <b>pale</b> <b>with</b> the sudden excitement. [...] "I did not see it until too late to give you warning. It was just the {{fraction}} of a second, and even as I jumped I thought he would strike your neck before my boot came on him." ...|$|R
