5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (<b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke).</b> Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b> Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Strokes can be {{classified}} into two major categories: ischemic and <b>hemorrhagic.</b> Ischemic <b>strokes</b> are caused by interruption of the blood supply to the brain, while <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes</b> result from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as [...] "hemorrhagic transformation." [...] It is unknown how many <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes</b> actually start as ischemic strokes.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two types}} of strokes: ischemic stroke and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b> An ischemic stroke happens when a person’s artery, which {{supplies}} blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a thrombus, or the blood clot can travel from somewhere else in the blood system that is called an embolus. A <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and is very serious. The most common causes of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure hypertension, and an aneurysm.|$|E

Arterio-venous malformations are much more frequently encountered than aneurysms, cavernous malformations and other non structural causes. Modem imagery allows to diagnose {{the cause of the}} hemorrhage with a good security and the management is based on the association of neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology and radiosurgery. These cases must be handled in specialized tertiary care hospital where these three modalities of treatment are available 24 hours/day...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to neurological impairment, <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes</b> usually cause specific symptoms (for instance, subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes a severe headache {{known as a}} thunderclap headache) or reveal evidence of a previous head injury.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes</b> {{may occur}} on the {{background}} of alterations to the {{blood vessels in the}} brain, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|R
25|$|Loss of consciousness, headache, and {{vomiting}} usually occur {{more often in}} <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain.|$|E
25|$|Other {{weight loss}} drugs {{have also been}} {{associated}} with medical complications, such as fatal pulmonary hypertension and heart valve damage due to Redux and Fen-phen, and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> due phenylpropanolamine.

25|$|The term brain {{attack was}} {{introduced}} for use to underline the acute nature of stroke {{according to the}} American Stroke Association, who since 1990 have used the term, and is used colloquially to refer to both ischemic as well as <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2013 {{approximately}} 6.9 {{million people}} had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million {{people had a}} <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b> In 2015 there were about 42.4million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% {{in the developed world}} and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b> About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old.|$|E
25|$|Hemorrhagic strokes are {{classified}} {{based on their}} underlying pathology. Some causes of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> are hypertensive hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, ruptured AV fistula, transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug induced bleeding. They result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding hematoma or hematomas. In addition, the pressure {{may lead to a}} loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting infarction, and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and vasculature. Inflammation contributes to the secondary brain injury after hemorrhage.|$|E

50|$|Stroke is {{different}} in children and newborns {{than it is in}} adults.

30|$|This is in {{accordance}} with many old and recent studies (Grau et al. 2001; Hatano 1973). Hypertension has also {{been described as the}} most commonly identified risk factor for both ischemic and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes</b> in studies from Egypt and other Arab countries (El Tallawy et al. 2015; Essa et al. 2011; El Sayed et al. 1999).|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of March 5, 2006, Puckett {{suffered}} a massive <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> at the home he shared with Olson. He underwent emergency surgery that day to relieve pressure on his brain; however, the surgery failed, and his former teammates and coaches were notified the following morning that the end was near. Many, including 1991 teammates Shane Mack and Kent Hrbek, flew to Phoenix to be at his bedside during his final hours along with his two children Kirby Jr. and Catherine. His fiancee never left his side. Puckett died on March 6, just 8 days from his 46th birthday, shortly after being disconnected from life support.|$|E
25|$|Prior to his {{election}} as pope in 2005, Ratzinger {{had hoped to}} retire—on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)—and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke,</b> which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but he recovered completely. This was never officially made public—the official news was that Ratzinger had fallen and struck his head against a radiator—but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Olmert was re-elected to the Knesset (he {{had earlier}} served eight terms), {{and became a}} cabinet {{minister}} and acting prime minister {{in the government of}} Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. On 4 January 2006, after Sharon suffered a severe <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke,</b> Olmert began exercising the powers of the office of Prime Minister. Olmert led Kadima to a victory in the March 2006 elections (just two months after Sharon had suffered his stroke), and continued on as Acting Prime Minister. On 14 April, two weeks after the election, Sharon was declared permanently incapacitated, allowing Olmert to legally become Interim Prime Minister. Less than a month later, on 4 May, Olmert and his new, post-election government were approved by the Knesset, thus Olmert officially became prime minister of Israel.|$|E
50|$|Because dilated {{perivascular}} {{spaces are}} so closely correlated with cerebrovascular disease, {{there is much}} current research on their use as a diagnostic tool. In {{a recent study of}} 31 subjects, abnormal dilation, along with irregular CSF pulsation, were correlated with those subjects having three or more risk factors for strokes. Therefore, perivascular spaces are a possible novel biomarker for <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hypertension is an {{important}} risk factor for brain infarction and hemorrhage. Approximately 85% of strokes are due to infarction and the remainder are due to hemorrhage, either intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of stroke rises progressively with increasing blood pressure levels, particularly systolic blood pressure in individuals >65 years. Treatment of hypertension convincingly decreases the incidence of both ischemic and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|R
30|$|Our {{study had}} several limitations. The {{sample size was}} small which generates {{imprecision}} in some estimates. The study population included both ischemic and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes.</b> We did not differentiate types of strokes according to TOAST criteria. In addition, we excluded patients with aphasia because this might limit the generalization of our findings. Moreover, the socioeconomic factors and education {{were not included in}} the analysis.|$|R
25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel {{on one side of the}} body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke</b> and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
2500|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} middle-aged populations {{generally}} find {{the relationship between}} alcohol intake {{and the risk of}} stroke to be either U- or J-shaped. [...] There may be very different effects of alcohol based on the type of stroke studied. [...] The predominant form of stroke in Western cultures is ischemic, whereas non-western cultures have more <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b> In contrast to the beneficial effect of alcohol on ischemic stroke, consumption of more than 2 drinks per day increases the risk of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke.</b> [...] The National Stroke Association estimates this higher amount of alcohol increases stroke risk by 50%. [...] "For stroke, the observed relationship between alcohol consumption and risk in a given population depends on the proportion of strokes that are hemorrhagic. Light-to-moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke which is likely to be, in part, causal. <b>Hemorrhagic</b> <b>stroke,</b> on the other hand, displays a loglinear relationship with alcohol intake." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{microwave}} frequency based differential technique is investigated {{to detect and}} differentiate between the two primary kinds of brain strokes namely ischemic and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes.</b> A compact unidirectional antenna with wideband operation is designed to build a portable system for this purpose.

An adult human head phantom is modeled with a stroke block in one side while the other half is healthy. Two antennas are placed in front of the two halves of human head. The reflection phases of the stroked head side antenna is collected and compared with those of normal side. From this comparison, the existence of stroked cells can be identified. Moreover, antennas facing the <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>strokes</b> exhibits higher phase difference than those of ischemic strokes, which can be clearly noted from the best matched second resonance. This compact diagnostic system is validated with results received from various tests involving different stroke sizes and shapes...|$|R
