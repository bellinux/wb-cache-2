25|$|Speed sensors: A {{speed sensor}} {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, or a toothed wheel and an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E
25|$|To provide {{high voltage}} for the spark {{from the low}} voltage batteries, a 'tickler' was used, which was {{essentially}} a larger version of the once widespread electric buzzer. With this apparatus, the direct current passes through an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> which pulls open a pair of contact points, interrupting the current; the magnetic field collapses, the spring-loaded points close again, the circuit is reestablished, and the cycle repeats rapidly. The rapidly collapsing magnetic field, however, induces a high voltage across the coil which can only relieve itself by arcing across the contact points; while {{in the case of}} the buzzer this is a problem as it causes the points to oxidize and/or weld together, {{in the case of the}} ignition system this becomes the source of the high voltage to operate the spark plugs.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{the optical}} Michelson–Morley experiment, its {{electrodynamic}} equivalent was also conducted, the Trouton–Noble experiment. By {{that it should}} be demonstrated that a moving condenser must be subjected to a torque. In addition, the Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace intended to measure some consequences of length contraction in the laboratory frame, for example the assumption that it would lead to birefringence. Though all of those experiments led to negative results. (The Trouton–Rankine experiment conducted in 1908 also gave a negative result when measuring the influence of length contraction on an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil.)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|A {{magnetic}} micro robot is {{a microscopic}} magnet that {{is controlled by}} a system of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> that generate a magnetic field to manipulate the magnetic robot. A major chal-lenge for manipulating multiple magnets at microscale is that the applied field affects the entire workspace, {{making it difficult to}} address individual magnets. In this paper, we propose a sys-tem where <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> are close to the magnets being manipulated to exploit spatial non-uniformities in the magnetic field. Our model considers the magnetic field generated by the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> and the magnetic fields present from neigh-boring magnetic robots to generate the desired force on each magnet. This approach is demonstrated on a macroscopic, one-dimensional system with two magnets controlled by two electro-magnets using visual feedback control. Additionally, simulation results for a linear system with three magnets and three electro-magnets are shown. While demonstrated at the macroscale, our results suggest that our methods can be extended for microscale manipulation, where it is advantageous to control multiple iden-tical magnets with global fields...|$|R

Using GPS and gyroscopes as sensors for determining attitude will also be evaluated. The attitude control system will use <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> and permanent magnets as actuators, forming {{what are known as}} magnetorquers.
