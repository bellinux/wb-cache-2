5|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes asymptotic freedom: as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as color confinement: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of <b>hadronization</b> occurs before quarks, formed in a high energy collision, are able to interact in any other way. The only exception is the top quark, which may decay before it hadronizes.|$|E

From this point on, the parton is in the low momentum transfer, long-distance regime in which non-perturbative effects become important. The most dominant of these effects is <b>hadronization,</b> which converts partons into observable hadrons. No exact theory for <b>hadronization</b> is known but there are two successful models for parameterization.|$|E

In particle detectors, jets are observed rather than quarks, whose existence must be inferred. The models and approximation schemes and their predicted jet <b>hadronization,</b> or fragmentation, have been extensively compared with measurement {{in a number of}} high energy particle physics experiments, e.g. TASSO, OPAL and H1.|$|E
50|$|The scale {{at which}} partons {{are given to}} the <b>hadronization</b> is fixed by the Shower Monte Carlo program. <b>Hadronization</b> models {{typically}} start at some predefined scale of their own. This can cause significant issue if not set up properly within the Shower Monte Carlo. Common choices of Shower Monte Carlo are PYTHIA and HERWIG.

50|$|His {{theory of}} {{collective}} quantum {{fields and the}} <b>Hadronization</b> of Quark Theories are prototypes for numerous developments {{in the theory of}} condensed matter, nuclear and elementary particle physics.|$|E
50|$|In {{particle}} physics, <b>hadronization</b> (or hadronisation) is {{the process}} of the formation of hadrons out of quarks and gluons. This occurs after high-energy collisions in a particle collider in which quarks or gluons are created. Due to colour confinement, these cannot exist individually. In the Standard Model they combine with quarks and antiquarks spontaneously created from the vacuum to form hadrons. The QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) of the <b>hadronization</b> process are not yet fully understood, but are modeled and parameterized in a number of phenomenological studies, including the Lund string model and in various long-range QCD approximation schemes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hadronization</b> also {{occurred}} {{shortly after the}} Big Bang when the quark-gluon plasma cooled to the temperature below which free quarks and gluons cannot exist (about 170 MeV). The quarks and gluons then combined into hadrons.|$|E
50|$|The bare partons that do {{not exist}} in nature (they are {{confined}} inside the hadrons) must be so to say dressed so that they form the known hadrons or mesons. They are made in two steps: parton shower and <b>hadronization.</b>|$|E
50|$|R-hadrons are {{possible}} when a colored (in {{the sense of}} QCD) supersymmetric particle (e.g., a gluino or a squark) has a mean lifetime longer than the typical <b>hadronization</b> time scale, and so QCD bound states are formed with ordinary partons (quarks and gluons), in analogy with the ordinary hadrons.|$|E
50|$|Parton showers {{simulations}} are of use in computational {{particle physics}} either in automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay or event generators, and {{are particularly important}} in LHC phenomenology, where they are usually explored using Monte Carlo simulation. The scale at which partons are given to <b>hadronization</b> is fixed by the Shower Monte Carlo program. Common choices of Shower Monte Carlo are PYTHIA and HERWIG.|$|E
5000|$|Energy loss: if the <b>hadronization</b> of the gluino has {{produced}} a charged R-hadron, it will lose energy by ionization when traversing the detector material. The specific energy loss (dE/dx) follows the Bethe-Bloch formula and depends on the mass and the charge (as well as the momentum) of the particle, making a striking difference between a R-hadron and the background of ordinary particles produced normally in [...] collisions.|$|E
50|$|String {{fragmentation}} {{is one of}} the parton fragmentation models used in the PYTHIA/Jetset and UCLA event generators, {{and explains}} many features of <b>hadronization</b> quite well. In particular, the model predicts that in addition to the particle jets formed along the original paths of two separating quarks, there will be a spray of hadrons produced between the jets by the string itself - which is precisely what is observed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{particle}} physics, the Lund string {{model is}} a phenomenological model of <b>hadronization.</b> It treats all but the highest-energy gluons as field lines, which are attracted to each other due to the gluon self-interaction and so form a narrow tube (or string) of strong color field. (Compared to electric or magnetic field lines, which are spread out because the carrier of the electromagnetic force, the photon, does not interact with itself.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, as two color {{charges are}} separated, {{at some point}} it becomes energetically {{favorable}} for a new quark-antiquark pair to appear, rather than extending the tube further. As a result of this, when quarks are produced in particle accelerators, instead of seeing the individual quarks in detectors, scientists see [...] "jets" [...] of many color-neutral particles (mesons and baryons), clustered together. This process is called <b>hadronization,</b> fragmentation, or string breaking.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} the {{formation}} of quark-gluon plasma lasts little longer than the time the light takes to pass through the volume occupied by the atomic nucleus used to produce the ultra-high pressure and temperature in the highly-energetic collision. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called <b>hadronization.</b> The extremely limited duration of the plasma makes it challenging (difficult) to study free quarks in quark-gluon plasma.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of high-energy hadron collisions, quarks and gluons are collectively called partons. The jets {{emerging}} from the collisions originally consist of partons, which quickly combine to form hadrons, a process called <b>hadronization.</b> Only the resulting hadrons can be directly observed. The hot, dense medium produced in the collisions is also composed of partons; it {{is known as a}} quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this realm, the laws of physics that apply are those of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).|$|E
5000|$|Perturbative QCD {{calculations}} {{may have}} colored partons {{in the final}} state, but only the colorless hadrons they ultimately produce are observed experimentally. Thus, to describe what is observed in a detector {{as a result of}} a given process, all outgoing colored partons must first undergo parton showering and then combination of the produced partons into hadrons. The terms fragmentation and <b>hadronization</b> are often used interchangeably in the literature to describe soft QCD radiation, formation of hadrons, or both processes together.|$|E
50|$|Rafelski’s current {{research}} interests center around {{investigation of the}} vacuum structure of QCD and QED {{in the presence of}} strong fields; study of the QCD vacuum structure and deconfinement with strange particle production in deconfined quark-gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions; the formation of matter out of quark-gluon plasma in the <b>hadronization</b> process, also in the early Universe; the ascent of ultrashort laser light pulses as a new tool in this domain of physics. He has also contributed to the physics of table top Muon-catalyzed fusion, antimatter formation and annihilation, and artificial intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|A jet is {{a narrow}} cone of hadrons and other {{particles}} {{produced by the}} <b>hadronization</b> of a quark or gluon in a particle physics or heavy ion experiment. Particles carrying a color charge, such as quarks, cannot exist in free form because of [...] QCD confinement which only allows for colorless states. When an object containing color charge fragments, each fragment carries {{away some of the}} color charge. In order to obey confinement, these fragments create other colored objects around them to form colorless objects. The ensemble of these objects is called a jet. Jets are measured in particle detectors and studied {{in order to determine the}} properties of the original quarks.|$|E
50|$|The work of Koch, Muller, Rafelski {{predicts that}} in a quark-gluon plasma <b>hadronization</b> process the {{enhancement}} for each particle species increases with the strangeness content of the particle. The enhancements for particles carrying one, two and three strange or antistrange quarks were measured and this effect was demonstrated by the CERN WA97 experiment {{in time for the}} CERN announcement in 2000 of a possible quark-gluon plasma formation in its experiments. These results were elaborated by the successor collaboration NA57 as shown in figure. The gradual rise of the enhancement {{as a function of the}} variable representing the amount of nuclear matter participating in the collisions, and thus as function of the geometric centrality of nuclear collision strongly favors the quark-gluon plasma source over normal matter reactions.|$|E
5000|$|In a hot QCD medium, {{when the}} {{temperature}} is raised well beyond the Hagedorn temperature, the [...] and its excitations are expected to melt. This {{is one of the}} predicted signals of the formation of the quark-gluon plasma. Heavy-ion experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron and at BNL's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have studied this phenomenon without a conclusive outcome as of 2009. This is due to the requirement that the disappearance of [...] mesons is evaluated with respect to the baseline provided by the total production of all charm quark-containing subatomic particles, and because it is widely expected that some [...] are produced and/or destroyed at time of QGP <b>hadronization.</b> Thus, there is uncertainty in the prevailing conditions at the initial collisions.|$|E
50|$|High-energy nucleus-nucleus {{collisions}} make {{it possible}} to study the properties of the QGP medium through the observed changes in the jet fragmentation functions as compared to the unquenched case. According to QCD, high-momentum partons produced in the initial stage of a nucleus-nucleus collision will undergo multiple interactions inside the collision region prior to <b>hadronization.</b> In these interactions, the energy of the partons is reduced through collisional energy loss and medium-induced gluon radiation, the latter being the dominant mechanism in a QGP. The effect of jet quenching in QGP is the main motivation for studying jets as well as high-momentum particle spectra and particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions. Accurate jet reconstruction will allow measurements of the jet fragmentation functions and consequently the degree of quenching and therefore provide insight on the properties of the hot dense QGP medium created in the collisions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{particularly}} striking {{feature of}} these events, which were first observed at DESY and studied {{in great detail}} by experiments at the LEP collider, is their consistency with the Lund string model. The model indicates that [...] "strings" [...] of low-energy gluons will form most strongly between the quarks and the high-energy gluons, and that the [...] "breaking" [...] of these strings into new quark-antiquark pairs (part of the <b>hadronization</b> process) will result in some [...] "stray" [...] hadrons between the jets (and in the same plane). Since the quark-gluon interaction is stronger than the quark-quark interaction, such hadrons will be observed much less frequently between the two quark jets. As a result, the model predicts that stray hadrons will not appear {{between two of the}} jets, but will appear between each of them and the third. This is precisely what is observed.|$|E
50|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons.

50|$|Traditional {{topic of}} YerPhI is the {{development}} of new particle detectors. Wide spark chambers and transition radiation detectors are examples of the experimental techniques developed and implemented in YerPhI. During the last years groups of scientists from Yerevan Physics Institute have actively participated in intermediate and high energy physics experiments abroad (JLAB, DESY, CERN-LHC, MAX-lab, MAMI), exploring the meson and nucleon structures, electromagnetic interactions of the nucleon, quark-hadron duality, short range nucleon-nucleon correlations, quark <b>hadronization</b> in nuclear medium, physics beyond standard model, Higgs boson searches, quark-gluon plasma, fission and fragmentation of nuclei and hypernuclei and many other topics, as well as constructing experimental hardware and develop the software for data acquisition and analysis.The theoretical department assure major achievements in the following areas: B-meson physics, QCD and Related Phenomenology, Neutrino physics, Quantum Field Theory, String/M-theory, Integrable Models, Statistical physics, Condensed Matter and Quantum Information. These results are internationally recognized and highly cited.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of these particles by scattering and decay provided {{a key to}} new fundamental quantum theories. Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne'eman brought some order to mesons and baryons, the most numerous classes of particles, by classifying them according to certain qualities. It began with what Gell-Mann {{referred to as the}} [...] "Eightfold Way", but proceeding into several different [...] "octets" [...] and [...] "decuplets" [...] which could predict new particles, most famously the , which was detected at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964, and which gave rise to the quark model of hadron composition. While the quark model at first seemed inadequate to describe strong nuclear forces, allowing the temporary rise of competing theories such as the S-matrix theory, the establishment of quantum chromodynamics in the 1970s finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles (...) [...] It postulated the fundamental strong interaction, experienced by quarks and mediated by gluons. These particles were proposed as a building material for hadrons (see <b>hadronization).</b> This theory is unusual because individual (free) quarks cannot be observed (see color confinement), unlike the situation with composite atoms where electrons and nuclei can be isolated by transferring ionization energy to the atom.|$|E
5000|$|This is only {{possible}} {{due to a}} new process, the gluon fusion, as shown by Rafelski and Müller in 1981. The top section of the figure shows gluon fusion in form of Feynman diagrams: gluons are the wavy lines; strange quarks are the solid lines; time runs from left to right. The bottom section is the process where the heavier quark pair arises from the lighter pair of quarks shown as dashed lines. The gluon fusion process occurs almost ten {{times faster than the}} quark based strangeness process, and allows achievement of the high thermal yield where the quark based process would fail to do so during the duration of the [...] "micro-bang". The gluon collisions here are occurring within the thermal matter phase and are thus different from the high energy processes that can ensue {{in the early stages of}} the collisions when the nuclei crash into each other. The heavier, charm and bottom quarks are produced there dominantly. The study in relativistic nuclear (heavy ion) collisions of charmed and soon also bottom hadronic particle production beside strangeness will provide complementary and important confirmation of the mechanisms of formation, evolution and <b>hadronization</b> of quark gluon plasma.|$|E
5000|$|To explain {{each part}} of the terminology, [...] "scattering" [...] refers to the lepton (electron, muon, etc.) being deflected. Measuring the angles of {{deflection}} gives information {{about the nature of the}} process. [...] "Inelastic" [...] means that the target absorbs some kinetic energy. In fact, at the very high energies of leptons used, the target is [...] "shattered" [...] and emits many new particles. These particles are hadrons and, to oversimplify greatly, the process is interpreted as a constituent quark of the target being [...] "knocked out" [...] of the target hadron, and due to quark confinement the quarks are not actually observed but instead produce the observable particles by <b>hadronization.</b> The [...] "deep" [...] refers to the high energy of the lepton, which gives it a very short wavelength and hence the ability to probe distances that are small compared with the size of the target hadron, so it can probe [...] "deep inside" [...] the hadron. Also, note that in the perturbative approximation it is a high-energy photon emitted from the lepton and absorbed by the target hadron which transfers energy to one of its constituent quarks, as in the adjacent diagram.|$|E
5000|$|When a proton {{encounters}} its antiparticle (and more generally, if any {{species of}} baryon encounters the corresponding antibaryon), {{the reaction is}} {{not as simple as}} electron-positron annihilation. Unlike an electron, a proton is a composite particle consisting of three [...] "valence quarks" [...] and an indeterminate number of [...] "sea quarks" [...] bound by gluons. Thus, when a proton encounters an antiproton, one of its quarks, usually a constituent valence quark, may annihilate with an antiquark (which more rarely could be a sea quark) to produce a gluon, after which the gluon together with the remaining quarks, antiquarks and gluons will undergo a complex process of rearrangement (called <b>hadronization</b> or fragmentation) into a number of mesons, (mostly pions and kaons), which will share the total energy and momentum. The newly created mesons are unstable, and unless they encounter and interact with some other material, they will decay in a series of reactions that ultimately produce only gamma rays, electrons, positrons, and neutrinos. This type of reaction will occur between any baryon (particle consisting of three quarks) and any antibaryon consisting of three antiquarks, one of which corresponds to a quark in the baryon. (This reaction is unlikely if at least one among the baryon and anti-baryon is exotic enough that they share no constituent quark flavors.) Antiprotons can and do annihilate with neutrons, and likewise antineutrons can annihilate with protons, as discussed below.|$|E
