30|$|Using non-equilibrium Green’s {{function}} {{method and}} density functional theory, we study {{the effect of}} line structural defects on the electron transport of zigzag molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) nanoribbons. Here, {{the various types of}} non-stoichiometric line defects greatly affect the <b>electron</b> <b>conductance</b> of MoS 2 nanoribbons. Although such defects would be lead to the electron scattering, they can increase the transmission of charge carriers by creating new channels. In addition, the presence of S bridge defect in the zigzag MoS 2 nanoribbon leads to more the transmission of charge carriers in comparison with the Mo–Mo bond defect. Also, we find that the different atomic orbitals and their bonding structure at the edge affect the <b>electron</b> <b>conductance</b> of MoS 2 nanoribbons. Moreover, we calculate the spin-dependent transport of MoS 2 nanoribbons and showed that the spin polarization increases at the non-zigzag edges and remains even {{in the presence of the}} defect.
