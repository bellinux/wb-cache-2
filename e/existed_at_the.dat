5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E

North of the river, the trunkline terminated at the junction with Michigan Avenue (then M-39, now the unsigned M-143).|$|E
5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
5|$|There existed a {{hierarchy}} of pay between types of auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry. One recent estimate {{is that in the}} time of Augustus, the annual pay structure was: eques alaris (gregalis) 263 denarii, eques cohortalis 225, and cohors infantryman 188. The same differentials (of about 20% between grades) seem to have <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of Domitian (r. 81-96). However, Goldsworthy points out that the common assumption that rates of pay were universal across provinces and units is unproven. Pay may have varied according to the origin of the unit.|$|E
5|$|Although a ferry {{had almost}} {{certainly}} <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing {{them to make a}} very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.|$|E

5|$|During the war, another {{battalion}} with {{a similar}} designation, the 2/10th Battalion, was raised {{as part of the}} all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Although many members of the Militia volunteered to join the 2nd AIF, the units of the 2nd AIF were considered separate from those of the Militia and many <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time. Recruited from South Australians, the 2/10th was raised in mid-October 1939 and formed part of the 18th Brigade that was initially assigned to the 6th Division before being transferred to the 7th. Over {{the course of the war}} it served in the United Kingdom, North Africa, New Guinea and Borneo before being disbanded in December 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history. A locomotive's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and when {{that could not be}} contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, climbers {{found three}} {{buildings}} open {{on one side}} on Licancabur. They {{were built in the}} pirca style, where stones are fitted together without mortar. A woodpile was found between two of the buildings, which were described as two dwellings and a fireplace. Wood was also scattered around its crater. With the summit's panoramic view, which includes Calama and pass routes from Argentina, Licancabur may have been a watchtower for the Atacamenos. Its watchtower function may have been coordinated with fortresses in the area such as Lasana, Turi and a settlement identified in 1955 at Quebrada de Chaxas (northwest of the volcano). The settlement at Licancabur had a central courtyard, surrounded by buildings, and ceramics found there resemble these of Pukará de Quitor and Toconao Oriente. A tambo reportedly <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> volcano.|$|E

5|$|In late July 1943, No.1 Wing's {{headquarters}} was disbanded to make {{it easier}} to deploy the Spitfire squadrons to different areas as the need arose. Under the new command arrangements, the squadrons reported directly to the North-Western Area's headquarters for administrative purposes and No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters controlled all fighter operations. This change also aimed to end the confusion which <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time between whether the wing leader or senior ground controller in the fighter sector headquarters was responsible for directing the Spitfires during battle. No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was redesignated No.1 Wing on 25September when Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey assumed command from Caldwell, who had been appointed No.2 Operational Training Unit's chief flying instructor. The headquarters' role remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore City College {{football}} program {{began in the}} mid-1870s, and has won more than 20 MSA A-Conference and MPSSAA championships in its history. The Knights primarily competed against are colleges and universities throughout the 1880s and 1890s because few secondary schools <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. The program began competing against other high schools {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, and has held since 1941 the record for the longest streak of games played without a loss in MSA and MPSSAA history. The Knights played 54 consecutive games without a loss between 1934–1941. Harry Lawrence, who guided the Knights to a 38-game undefeated streak between 1936 and 1940 (including 35wins, threeties, and four MSA championships), remains City College's most successful head football coach.|$|E
5|$|The Kettle Creek Path {{used by the}} Native Americans {{historically}} {{linked the}} Cowanesque River with the West Branch Susquehanna River via Kettle Creek. It is possible that Native Americans camped on the creek while hunting and fishing in the area. An Indian village <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the creek until it was destroyed by the military in 1763. In 1784, at the Treaty at Fort Stanwick, much of Pennsylvania's Northern Tier, including the Kettle Creek watershed, was purchased from the Iroquois, Delaware, and Wyandott for $7000. The Indians retained hunting rights in the area until 1804.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} West Virginia has 55 counties. Fifty of them <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time of the}} Wheeling Convention in 1861, prior to which West Virginia {{was part of the}} Commonwealth of Virginia. The {{remaining}} five (Grant, Mineral, Lincoln, Summers, and Mingo) were formed within the state after its admission to the United States on June 20, 1863. At that time, Berkeley County and Jefferson County, the two easternmost counties of West Virginia, refused to recognize their inclusion in the state. In March 1866, the United States Congress passed a joint mandate assenting to their inclusion.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was well}} {{developed}} by this time, and was reached through three gates positioned across the wider estate, called Nethergate, Redgate and Dernegate. The castle itself had four stone towers protecting {{the entrance to}} the inner bailey and the keep, called Auditorstower, Maidenstower, Constabletower and Oxfordtower. Elizabeth built a chamber for her own use at the castle between 1346-7. A substantial water-garden, forming part of the moat to the east, <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> castle during this period; it may have included a fountain and probably had a geometric form, possibly similar to the garden at nearby St Benet's Abbey in Norfolk. Vineyards and orchards surrounded the property. The castle's three parks continued in active use, and, as part of the local rearing programme, the local deer were moved between them as the animals grew older.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
