5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), meanwhile, is {{producing}} his own wine, called Donaghy Estate Sparkling Wine. He and Liz taste it, {{and realize that}} it is practically undrinkable. This leaves Jack with the problem of disposing with the wine. He decides to market it to hip-hop producer Ridikolous (LL Cool J), {{and at the same time}} patch up things between Tracy and Ridikolous, who was not allowed into one of Tracy's parties. Jack and Ridikolous <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting,</b> resulting in the wine becoming the corporate sponsor of the Source Awards, which is being produced by Ridikolous. To further mend things with Tracy, Jack proposes to let Tracy host the award show. This backfires when Tracy refuses to host it in fear that he will get shot, but Jack still sees it as the only way to work things out with Ridikolous.|$|E
5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> at his loft late at night.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of March 12, elements of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division were dropped off at designated landing zones around Phuoc An. Initially about 100 South Vietnamese helicopters participated in the operation, and 81 fighter-bombers were deployed to strike at North Vietnamese positions to cover the landings. At 3:10pm, Phu took off in his Cessna U-17 to direct the operation over the skies of Ban Me Thuot. As he approached the battlefield, Phu phoned the South Vietnamese units at Hoa Binh airfield to notify them that an operation was underway, and he encouraged the soldiers {{to hold on to}} their positions. On the morning of March 13, another 145 helicopters were used to complete {{the first phase of the}} operation with the entire 44th Infantry Regiment, the last soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment, and the 232nd Artillery Battalion dropped off at various points in Nong Trai, Phuoc An and along Highway 21. At the completion of the landing operation, Phu returned to Pleiku to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Thieu, during which they discussed the sudden appearance of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|After Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her father figure. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his daughter. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting,</b> deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked Black Rock, Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go {{to the heart of the}} Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E

A writer in the Oregonian said the fountain [...] "is an abstraction of a mountain waterfall". Local architect Marcy McInelly said [...] "they were the first full realization of a theory about reflecting forces of nature but not mimicking natural forms.

500|$|After {{negotiations}} completed, Kassar called Howard Scott Warshaw on July 27, 1982 {{to commission}} him as developer {{of the video}} game. Kassar informed him that Spielberg asked for Warshaw specifically and that development needed {{to be completed by}} September 1 to meet a production schedule for the Christmas holiday. Though Warshaw had spent more than a year working on consecutive development schedules for games (seven months working on Yars' Revenge and then six months on Raiders of the Lost Ark), he accepted the offer based on the challenge of completing a game in a short time frame and at Spielberg's request. Warshaw considered it an opportunity to develop an innovative Atari 2600 game based on a movie he enjoyed, [...] "provided we reach the right arrangement". Kassar reportedly offered Warshaw [...] and an all-expenses-paid vacation to Hawaii in compensation. Kassar then told him to arrive at the San Jose Airport a few days later to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Spielberg.|$|E

Gefion {{thereafter}} joined the autumn maneuvers, which lasted until 22 September. She then returned to Kiel for periodic repairs. After this work was completed in December, Gefion {{was assigned to the}} newly formed II Division of the East Asia Squadron. The Division was commanded by Prince Heinrich, the brother of Wilhelm II, who flew his flag in the re-built armored cruiser [...] The protected cruiser Kaiserin Augusta was the third ship in the division. On 15 December, the three ships left Germany, Wilhelm II having instructed their crews, [...] "Should anyone seek to hinder you in the proper exercise of our legitimate rights, go for them with a mailed fist." [...] The division was bound for the newly conquered base at Tsingtau in the Kiautschou Bay concession. They arrived on 5 May 1898 and met the rest of the squadron, which was commanded by Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Otto von Diederichs.|$|E

500|$|Academic {{papers at}} ISMB were {{traditionally}} {{presented in a}} single track. Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on protein secondary structure prediction, sequence analysis and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively. As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks including multiple proceedings tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. Christopher Rawlings (head of Computational and Systems Biology at Rothamsted Research and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people who wanted to keep it more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t." [...] As the number of submitted proceedings papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012. ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by AAAI Press. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal Bioinformatics. The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.|$|E
500|$|Lisa visits Smithers, {{owner of}} the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection, and asks for help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974. Lisa bikes to Lovell's house and plays one of the doll's phrases over the intercom. The gate {{immediately}} opens. Lisa and Lovell decide {{to create a new}} talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it might hurt the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, as kids, and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them that it is just the same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was able to get through to at least one little girl.|$|E

Although sections of the recording—presented in evidence on April 27—are unintelligible, Blanton can twice be heard mentioning the phrase [...] "plan a bomb" [...] or [...] "plan the bomb". Most crucially, Blanton can also be heard describing his not being with Miss Vaughn, but at a meeting with other Ku Klux Klansmen on a bridge above the Cahaba River two nights before the bombing, adding: [...] "You've got to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> to plan a bomb." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 10 minutes North of Lafayette lies Prophet Rock, the {{landmark}} where the Prophet Tenskwatawa, the half brother of Tecumseh, stood watch encouraging the local Shawnee Native Americans {{to fight against}} the encamped army forces of William Henry Harrison in the Battle Of Tippecanoe in 1811. Tenskwatawa was a spiritual leader, but not a military man. His brother was out of town as the U.S. Army forces marched North, with hopes to destroy Prophetstown. Tenskwatawa had sought to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Harrison to discuss how to avoid going to war. In the evening before the war, he sought a spiritual vision that led him to believe the assignation of Harrison must be done. Early in the morning of November 6, the warriors attacked Harrison's militia and war ensued. The warriors fell weak in supplies against the militia, and succumbed. Prophetstown was taken over where the militia stole supplies and burnt it down. The rock from where Tenskwatawa still stands over the battlefield, though now covered with much taller trees. You can access the rock by either scaling it from the small parking lot immediately in front or hiking the ridge line that leads to the top.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} part of the tour, Rod had been {{contacted}} by American singer, songwriter and record producer Dan Hartman's office asking that Dan <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with Wendy and Rod.

[...] Dan came down to the Tribeca loft, met Wendy and Rod, and a month later he and Rod were working on the production of the Metal Priestess mini-LP. The band needed more product but another album was premature, partly because Capitol Records was now making overtures for the next one. Bruce at Stiff was ready to release it and that summer Metal Priestess was recorded at Dan's private studio off his schoolhouse turned home and studio in Connecticut and released early that fall.

It was originally set {{to be the first}} of her two-album recording deal with her new label, Universal Records. After a couple of push-backs, Stay Alive was finally released on November 19, 2011. In choosing such title for the album, she explained, [...] "It's like some people are saying that I'm gone [...] So I’m here to say that I’m still here and staying alive." [...] She called the album [...] "special" [...] {{due to the fact that}} she contributed from its musical production to the cover art design." [...] Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being called [...] "futuristic and edgy" [...] by critics who also predicted that it [...] "may set new trends in Filipino music," [...] tagging Nina as the new [...] "dance diva." [...] Philippine Entertainment Portal praised the album, stating [...] "Stay Alive is a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist and determination to be a better performer." [...] "Dance" [...] was released on October 6, 2011 as the lead single from the album. Nina explained, [...] "The carrier single is a dance song for it to be different from my previous albums." [...] The song is described as [...] "an upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Its music video was released on December 9, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes while performing a dance routine. Due to lack of promotion, the song failed to achieve commercial success. On January 30, 2012, [...] "However Much Love" [...] was released as a radio-only pre-Valentine single. The song was critically acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal. It also performed well commercially, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. On February 13, she staged a pre-Valentine concert entitled Update Your Status... at the Music Museum, which supported the album. In the same month, she expressed disappointment with the album's lack of promotion, saying [...] " [...] always <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting,</b> but no actions are initiated. They give us schedules that are not really followed. When it's already okay, then they cancel it." [...] On April 14, she staged another concert at the Music Museum, entitled Timeless: Tribute to a Diva, which was dedicated to late pop diva Whitney Houston.
