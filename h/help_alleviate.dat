5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E

5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> this problem.|$|E
5|$|Tubman's {{friends and}} {{supporters}} {{from the days}} of abolition, meanwhile, raised funds to support her. One admirer, Sarah Hopkins Bradford, wrote an authorized biography entitled Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman. The 132-page volume was published in 1869, and brought Tubman some US$1,200 in revenue. Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, the book nevertheless remains an important source of information and perspective on Tubman's life. Bradford released another volume in 1886 called Harriet, the Moses of her People, which presented a less caustic view of slavery and the South. It, too, was published as a way to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> Tubman's poverty.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the council}} {{announced}} that a park and ride facility would be developed next to the M32 to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> congestion in the city centre. The project was expected to create 1,500 parking spaces and cost £191 million. In 2015, construction began on a bus-only junction between junctions 1 and 2, on land partly allocated to the Stapleton Allotments and near the Stoke Park estate. The project {{is part of the}} North Fringe to Hengrove MetroBus rapid transit route package, and involves creating new slip roads, a connecting route to Stoke Lane and a new bridge over the M32 to be completed by mid-2016. The bridge was lifted into place in June, which required closing the M32 to all traffic.|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|Montreal {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the Northeast Division in 1998–99 and missed the playoffs. Their 75 points was the lowest total in a full season in 40 years. The season concluded with rumours of the team being sold and relocated {{if it did not}} receive government subsidies to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> pressures from Quebec's tax system and the record-low value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports. Montreal missed the playoffs again the next two seasons, and annual losses of $10–$12million and a desire to focus on its core brewing business led Molson to put the franchise up for sale in the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|Route 58 {{originates}} as an {{alignment of}} State Highway Route 25-A, designated in 1939 as a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 25 from Jersey City to Clifton Avenue in Newark. The route was designated {{to cross through}} Kearny and Harrison, crossing the Passaic at the Bridge Street Bridge in Harrison. From there, it continued along, intersecting with State Highway Route 21 and Clifton Avenue. In 1949, a new bridge for the four-lane road was constructed, this bridge was named after William Stickel, an engineer from Essex County. That year, the New Jersey State Highway Department proposed {{construction of a new}} freeway to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> traffic on the State Highway Route 10 corridor, designated as the Essex Freeway from the New Jersey Turnpike in Hudson County westward to U.S. Route 46 in Morris County.|$|E

5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping incidents and minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in {{from as far away}} as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.|$|E
5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of human skin into blood cells, which may <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank.

5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E

5|$|When {{brought into}} service {{during the final}} years of World War II, the Iowa-class battleships were {{assigned}} to operate in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. By this point in the war, aircraft carriers had displaced battleships as the primary striking arm of both the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result of this shift in tactics, U.S. fast battleships of all classes were relegated to the secondary role of carrier escorts and assigned to the Fast Carrier Task Force to provide anti-aircraft screening for U.S. aircraft carriers and perform shore bombardment. Three were recalled to service in the 1950s with the outbreak of the Korean War, and provided naval artillery support for U.N. forces for the entire duration of the war before being returned to mothballs in 1955 after hostilities ceased. In 1968, to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> U.S. air losses over North Vietnam, New Jersey was summoned to Vietnam, but was decommissioned a year after arriving.

5|$|With {{the area}} having a {{generally}} low density and lacking transit-oriented development, the Metrorail {{was designed as}} a park and ride system, with the idea being that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute {{the rest of the way}} into the city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large parking garages, such as Dadeland North and South stations, located at the southern end of the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars. Earlington Heights, located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to Interstate 95 and the Airport Expressway, has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders. However, that is now used by the county due to the station's low ridership, with only 95 vehicle spaces currently available. The successful Dadeland garages are at or over capacity, with two of Metrorail's proposed extensions, the West Kendall Corridor and South Link, intended to <b>help</b> <b>alleviate</b> them. The two northernmost stations, which are located near the Palmetto Expressway, Palmetto and Okeechobee, appeal to Broward County commuters with nearly 2,000 combined spaces. Additionally, the proposed North Corridor to the Broward/Miami-Dade county line would have included five park and ride facilities totaling 2,650 spaces. In the late 1990s, the plan was to potentially even continue the Metrorail line into Broward County along 27th Avenue (University Drive), ending at Broward Boulevard near Broward Mall in Plantation.|$|E
