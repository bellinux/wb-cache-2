500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s <b>hand!</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hold that}} the {{darkness}} has over her does not disappear when she escapes and the Tombs are brought {{down in an}} earthquake by the nameless ones. She contemplates killing Ged, blaming him for her pain, but eventually learns to accept her guilt over her actions, realizing that though {{she had no choice}} in her actions as a priestess, she now has a choice to move away from them; but this [...] "freedom is a heavy load". Le Guin ends the novel with the reassuring sentence [...] "Gravely she walked beside [...] up the white streets of Havnor, holding his <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child coming home", suggesting that she has been successful in finding new connections in her life. The conclusion of the novel represents the successful end of a quest that Ged undertook as a mature wizard, part of the story arc that traces his character development across the first three Earthsea books; thus The Tombs of Atuan has been described as part of Ged's coming-of-age as well.|$|E
2500|$|There {{would be}} various {{recurring}} acts {{involved in the}} stories, one {{of which would be}} that an off-stage doorbell will sound and Jerry would announce in a exaggerated voice, [...] "The Doorbell! [...] I'll get it!" [...] When he would answer the door, it would usually be someone bringing in something that would be tied in with the situation at <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cake, a bunch of flowers or brownies or things of a similar variety.|$|E
50|$|Because she {{had large}} thick <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man's ("The Bizarro Jerry").|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Wii Remote can {{be played}} with two <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gamepad.|$|R
60|$|MORRIS. A spry fellow, your friend. He {{slipped through}} my <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shadow.|$|R
2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
2500|$|In Visser's modification, the Acetone box was {{extended}} {{with a large}} flat board holding 12 printed circuit boards of approximately 4×4 inches, with the copper traces intertwining like forks. The copper traces formed the touch surfaces for the sounds generated by the Acetone box. Each touch pad was sensed by an electronic circuit driving high-speed Siemens computer relays he found in surplus shops. These were connected to the drum and percussion sounds of the rhythm box. [...] Although it was a crude way of playing electronic drum sounds by <b>hand</b> (<b>like</b> <b>a</b> percussionist playing bongos and congas), it worked and added a [...] "human feel". Visser's approach enabled drummers to have new type of virtuosity (e.g., rolls on electronic bass drums could be played with sticks). The unit was used in Frans Peters' studio in radio city Hilversum, Netherlands.|$|E
60|$|He leant his angular elbow far {{across the}} table, {{and put up}} his large loose <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flap to his ear.|$|E
60|$|Creech pointed {{carefully}} with bent <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Indian, and Lucy either {{could not}} get the direction or see far enough.|$|R
60|$|The {{man called}} Gogol, who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels, {{suddenly}} {{threw up his}} <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyway," [...] said Hatherleigh, {{escaping}} from our <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> intellectual frog, [...] "Semitic or not, I've got {{no use for}} decency." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall {{be pleased}} with his acquaintance," [...] said Marks, {{thrusting}} out a long, thin <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> raven's claw. [...] "Mr. Haley, I believe?" ...|$|E
60|$|But he did {{not speak}} a word. He {{remained}} motionless for a long moment, his eyes pale and steady, his right <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> claw.|$|E
6000|$|Giving {{herself up}} for lost, Mrs Jo turned and {{presented}} her <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tea-tray, submitting {{to have it}} heartily shaken, as the matron said, with somewhat alarming hospitality: ...|$|E
60|$|She huddled over folded <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> temple virgin {{shivering}} on {{her knees}} before the thin warmth of a brazier. She could not answer.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Durbeyfield {{clapped her}} <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child. Then she looked down, then stared again. Could she be deceived {{as to the}} meaning of this? ...|$|R
60|$|Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old {{man smiled}} faintly, put out his <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sightless man, and dropped, a {{senseless}} heap, to the floor.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} head from her arms and dried her eyes {{with the back of}} her <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child. A kinder note than he had {{intended}} went into his voice.|$|E
60|$|Teresa's first fear of him vanished. She {{took him}} by the <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child, and led him downstairs to his rooms. He stood silently {{watching}} her, while she lit the candles.|$|E
60|$|The figure stepped {{forth and}} waved its <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dumb person. It was arrayed like a pilgrim, the hood lowered over the face, but Dick, in an instant, {{recognised}} Sir Daniel.|$|E
60|$|The captain rose and, {{putting on}} his cap—mostly over one eye—put out his <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blind man for the door, and blundered out into the street.|$|R
60|$|Evidently {{this was}} too much for Dick Gale's father, and he gazed at his wife in sheer {{speechless}} astonishment. Dick's sister clapped her <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little child.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} with a low cry, {{wringing}} his <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child {{in a fit of}} impotent terror. But the girl in front of him never flinched.|$|R
60|$|Get off the mark, on {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scalded cat, and your public is at a loss. It simply raises its eyebrows, and can't make out what you're talking about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait! Wait a minute," [...] said Ferris, {{waving his}} <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man tormented by a passing pain. [...] "I {{am trying to}} think. What you say is.... I cannot imagine it!" ...|$|E
60|$|The hard, weather-beaten {{features}} of the scout began to work, and when she had ended, he dropped his chin to his <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man musing profoundly {{on the nature of}} the proposal.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've had {{a heavenly}} little nap," [...] he said, rubbing {{his eyes with}} {{the backs of his}} <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child. [...] "Good Lord! That's not their step!" ...|$|R
60|$|Whilst {{some were}} stealing, and she remonstrating, the Duke clapped his <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> caliph. The curtain {{at the end}} of the {{apartment}} was immediately withdrawn, and the ball-room stood revealed.|$|R
60|$|It was Dan Baxter who was {{shouting}} at them. The former bully of Putnam Hall {{stood at the}} stern rail of the Flyaway and was using his <b>hands</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trumpet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{say that}} to my maister," [...] remarked the driver. [...] "He be a big man wi' a ter'bly bad temper and a <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> leg o' mutton. Hold up, will ye!" ...|$|E
60|$|But Paul {{remained}} for several moments, confronting in silence the clamors {{of the mob}} beyond, and waving his solitary <b>hand,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> disdainful tomahawk, towards the surrounding eminences, also covered with the affrighted inhabitants.|$|E
60|$|VENABLES. Very much. But he puzzles me a little. You Scots, Mrs. Shand, {{are such}} a mixture of the {{practical}} and the emotional that you escape out of an Englishman's <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trout.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Bobo," [...] {{he called}} to his stout little friend, who was near, [...] "lend <b>a</b> <b>'and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good fellow. This brute won't stand still. Give us a leg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'And</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Phoenix, for {{its power}} of {{springing}} {{from the ashes}} of its faults and vices, and soaring up anew into the sky!' said Martin. 'Well, Mark. Let us hope so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, missus; anon, anon, missus!" [...] quoth he to an {{imaginary}} landlady inside, and twisting under Amyas's <b>hand</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eel, {{vanished into the}} house, while Frank got the hot-headed youth away.|$|R
