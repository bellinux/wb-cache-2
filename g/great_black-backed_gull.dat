5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> all breed on the island, and numerous migratory {{species have been}} recorded.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch {{a bird in}} flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

[...] Between Kajaani and Oulujärvi are the smaller lakes of Sokajärvi and Paltajärvi, which are frozen during winter. Paltajärvi stands between the Kajaani River and Oulujärvi. The Kajaani and Vuolijoki rivers are noted for their fishing. Cuckoo Island (Käkisaari) lies on Oulu lake to the {{northwest}} {{of the town and}} features residential houses and about 150 summer cottages and holiday apartments, and Caterpillar Island (Toukka) lies {{in the eastern part of}} the lake.

The tails of all but three species are rounded; the exceptions being Sabine's gull and swallow-tailed gulls, which have forked tails, and Ross's gull, which has a wedge-shaped tail. Gulls have moderately long legs, especially when compared to the similar terns, with fully webbed feet. The bill is generally heavy and slightly hooked, with the larger species having stouter bills than the smaller species. The bill colour is often yellow with a red spot for the larger white-headed species and red, dark red or black in the smaller species.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull,</b> furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E

50|$|St Margaret's Island is a {{sensitive}} conservation site {{because of the}} birds that nest in its cliffs: cormorants (the largest population of this species in Wales, constituting 3% of the total British population), guillemots, razorbills, shags, kittiwakes, <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls,</b> lesser <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls,</b> herring gulls, puffins and, more recently, gannets. The island is vegetated with sea beet, sea mayweed and rank grass.|$|R
50|$|Migratory birds: Due {{to there}} being a {{geographic}} point of interest for the migratory birds, we can watch species like the Eurasian spoonbill, Cory's shearwater, <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull,</b> terns, Ciconiiformes and less frequent species.|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} gull and one species of petrel breed on White Island. They are <b>Great</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gull</b> (Larus marinus), Lesser Black-backed Gull (L fuscus), Herring Gull (L argentatus), Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and the Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis).|$|E
50|$|Predators of {{eggs and}} nestlings include the <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> and American herring gull, common ravens, ermine, and red fox. Predation at sea is {{insignificant}} though large sharks and seals may rarely snatch a gannet out at sea.|$|E
50|$|The Wick of Gossabrough attracts many birds, of {{note here}} in {{particular}} are the <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls.</b> In {{the first decade of}} the 20th century, it was documented that herring populations had declined.

50|$|Like most <b>gulls,</b> <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> are {{opportunistic}} feeders, apex predators, and {{are very}} curious. They will investigate any small organism they encounter and will readily eat almost anything that they can swallow. They get much of their dietary energy from scavenging, with refuse, most provided directly by humans, locally comprising {{more than half of}} their diet. The proliferation of garbage or refuse dumps has become a major attractant to this and all other non-specialized gull species in its range. However, apparently, in attempt to observe how much time they spend foraging at refuse dumps in Massachusetts, <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> were only observed actively foraging 19% of their time there, eating less garbage than other common gulls, and spent most of their time roosting or loafing.|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} {{presently}} uninhabited, {{but there is}} a hunting lodge and an unmanned lighthouse. Wildlife includes fallow deer and a great variety of birds including ospreys, hobby, oystercatchers and <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls.</b> The horizon of Djurö consists only of water, except in southern direction where Kinnekulle is visible.|$|R
50|$|The coastal {{habitats}} support bird-life {{including the}} <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus marinus) and stonechat (Saxicola torquata), while the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), dipper (Cinclus cinclus), sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) {{can be found}} in the woodland areas.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} lack of {{mobility}} on land, Manx shearwaters are vulnerable to attack by large gulls, such as the <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull,</b> and great skua. Birds of prey such as the peregrine falcon and golden eagle are also recorded as killing adult birds.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> was {{harvested}} for its feathers, {{which were}} used in the hat-making trade, and this species was extirpated from large parts of its range {{as a result of this}} exploitation. Today, however, its adaptability to human presence and the use of urban environments as artificial nesting sites has resulted in the <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> rapidly increasing in number and range. It is now a widespread and abundant species in its range and its numbers have increased to such high levels in some areas that it is often seen as a pest species, especially near airports where it risks collisions with airplanes, and in some coastal areas where it sometimes outcompetes or hunts rarer seabirds, such as Atlantic puffins, possibly resulting in conservationist intervention. The increase and expansion of great black-backed gulls has been attributed to increasing winter fishery activities in the North Sea. Although there are no known major threats to the <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull,</b> high levels of toxic pollutants, which are ingested with contaminated prey, are often found in individuals and eggs, reducing reproductive success. Breeding is also interrupted by human disturbance, which can lead to eggs being abandoned, leaving them vulnerable to exposure and predation.|$|E
50|$|Two to four eggs, usually three, {{are laid}} {{on the ground or}} cliff ledges in colonies, and are defended vigorously by this large gull. The eggs are a dark blotched, olive colour.

5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of <b>great</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus marinus) and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of lesser <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|R
