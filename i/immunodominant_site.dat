50|$|The <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> for DQ2.5 is on α2-gliadin. The {{site is a}} {{protease}} resistant 33mer {{that has}} 6 overlapping DQ2.5 restricted epitopes. This creates very strong binding of T-cells for DQ2.5-33mer complexes. DQ2.5 binds gliadin, but the binding is sensitive to deamidation caused by tissue transglutaminase. In almost all case the highest affinity sites of gluten are derived by deamidation. The HLA DQB1*0202 and its linked DQA1* alleles (the DQ2.2 haplotype) do not produce the α5 subunit. While the DQ2.2 heterodimer cannot effectively present α-2 gliadin, it can present other gliadins. In at least 1% of coeliacs DQ2.2 confers adaptive immunity to gliadin permitting coeliac disease.|$|E

We have previously shown that glycoprotein B (gB) is a major target recognized by HSV-specific CTLs in C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) and BALB/c (H- 2 d) mice but not in CBA/J (H- 2 k) mice (L. A. Witmer, K. L. Rosenthal, F. L. Graham, H. M. Friedman, A. Yee, and D. C. Johnson, J. Gen. Virol. 71 : 387 - 396, 1990). In this report, we utilize adenovirus vectors expressing gB with various deletions to localize an <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> in gB, recognized by H- 2 b-restricted anti-HSV CTLs, to a region between residues 462 and 594. Overlapping peptides spanning this region were synthesized and used to further localize the <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> to residues 489 to 515, a region highly conserved in HSV type 1 (HSV- 1) and HSV- 2 strains. The 11 -amino-acid peptide was apparently associated exclusively with the Kb major histocompatibility complex gene product and not the Db gene product.

Two 24 -mer synthetic peptides derived from <b>immunodominant</b> <b>sites</b> on the HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 transmembrane proteins were used separately, in combination (env 1 / 2), and in combination with recombinant p 24 (p 24 /env) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Positive reactions with env- 1 were found in 150 out of 150 (100 %) samples from Dutch AIDS patients, 60 out of 60 (100 %) samples from Dutch homosexual men obtained 1 year after HIV- 1 -antibody seroconversion, 29 out of 30 (96. 7 %) samples from these men obtained {{at the time of}} HIV- 1 -antibody seroconversion, 40 out of 41 (97. 6 %) samples from East Africans with AIDS-related symptoms, and three out of 29 (10. 3 %) samples from West Africans with HIV- 2 infection (including a sample from an individual infected with both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2). Positive reactions with env- 2 in these study populations were 11 out of 150 (7. 3 %), nine out of 60 (15 %), none out of 30 (0 %), 25 out of 41 (60. 9 %) and 29 out of 29 (100 %), respectively. In the samples with dual reactivity, true versus cross-reactivity could generally be differentiated on the basis of large differences in optical density values in the respective assays. All samples reacted positively with p 24 /env; 308 out of 310 (99. 3 %) were positive in the env 1 / 2 assay. Four East African samples that had negative or only weakly positive reactions with env- 1 showed a noticeably stronger reaction with variant peptides derived from Central African isolate sequences. In all samples from HIV- 1 -infected Dutch homosexual men, the strongest signal was detected using the env- 1 peptide sequence, which is derived from European and American isolates.

40|$|Well {{understood}} are {{the adaptive}} and dramatic neutralizing homosubtypic antibody responses to hypervariable, <b>immunodominant</b> <b>sites</b> of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of individual influenza strains. These define influenza subtypes and vaccines modelled upon their HA and NA antigens provide seasonal neutralizing antibody protection against subsequent {{exposure to the}} strain and its close relatives, but give little if any protection against antigenically drifted or shifted strains. Contrasting to {{this is a different}} form of acquired antibody response, called heterosubtypic immunity. This provides a more seasoned adaptive antibody response to immune-recessive epitopes that are highly-conserved amongst strains. Although, such responses are of lower individual amplitudes than seasonal mechanisms they are active across influenza subtypes, and may give pre-emptive protection against new strains yet to emerge. Heterosubtypic immunities have been well studied in animals, but surprisingly there is minimal evidence for this type of antibody immunity in humans. Thus championed is the notion that seasoned humoral responses can through repeated exposure to sites widely conserved across different strains, cumulatively provide humans with a level of broad protection against emergent novel strains, such as H 5 N 1, that is not afforded by seasonal humoral responses...|$|R

This analysis has revealed evidence for the duplication of a T cell recognition site within the region 202 - 221.

In addition, we provide evidence that a site on the influenza hemagglutinin recognized by neutralizing antibody directly overlaps with an epitope recognized by class I MHC- restricted CTL...|$|E
40|$|To {{approach}} the mechanism that determines Ir gene-controlled {{high or low}} responsiveness to whole proteins, such as sperm whale myoglobin (SWMb), we compared the repertoires {{of high and low}} responder haplotype- restricted T cells for different myoglobin epitopes by limiting dilution frequency analysis. Poisson analysis was performed using long- term limiting dilution cell lines of (B 10. BR [low] X B 10. D 2 [high]) F 1 T cells maintained on high or low responder APCs. The cell lines were tested with SWMb peptides and fragments for T cell repertoire fine specificities and Ia restrictions. The frequency of SWMb-specific F 1 T cells responsive on B 10. BR (H- 2 k) APCs was 2. 5 - 3. 6 -fold lower than on B 10. D 2 (H- 2 d) APCs. Strikingly, all of the H- 2 k-restricted T cells used I-Ek as a restriction element, whereas both I-Ad- and I-Ed-restricted T cells were found among the H- 2 d-restricted lines. The I-Ad-restricted T cells were dominant, and the majority was specific for the synthetic peptide 102 - 118. T cells specific for peptide 132 - 146, dominant in association with I-Ed, were less frequent. However, no detectable H- 2 k- restricted T cells were specific for either of these peptides, but instead they were specific for fragment 1 - 55 or peptide 59 - 80. Fragment 1 - 55 also stimulated a similar number of H- 2 d-restricted T cells. Therefore, the low response of F 1 T cells on H- 2 k-presenting cells {{may be due to the}} failure to see myoglobin plus I-Ak, in particular the <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> around Glu 109, in contrast to the dominant response of high responder mice (both H- 2 d and H- 2 s) focused on the I-A molecule and the site around residue Glu 109. The I-E- low responder B 10 strain also failed to respond to peptide 102 - 118, supporting the idea that the low responder status results from a limited repertoire lacking response to 102 - 118 plus I-A. In those strains that respond to the <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> 102 - 118, the frequency of T cells in the repertoire specific for this site was always considerably greater than that for other sites. These results suggest that there is an important difference between immunodominant epitopes and minor epitopes and that Ir gene-controlled low responsiveness to a natural whole protein may be due primarily to the failure to respond to a single <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site,</b> even though a number of other epitopes can be recognized...|$|E

The C-terminal regions of these proteins are semiconserved. Few major differences were found when the predicted secondary structures for PAO and PAK pilins were compared.

40|$|The {{expressed}} T cell repertoire to many proteins {{has been}} found to be focused onto alimited number of discrete <b>immunodominant</b> <b>sites</b> rather than broadly directed at all segments of an antigen. The phenomenon has also been shown to occur for noneukaryotic proteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (1), staphylococcal nuclease (2), and R-galactosidase (3), that are unrelated to self proteins of the mouse. There appear to be several factors that influence the expressed repertoire to a particular protein. The most clearly demonstrable influence is the MHC, and this appears to be the basis of Ir gene effects, where differences in T cell responsiveness to protein antigens occur between different strains ofmice. Three major mechanisms have been suggested by which MHC-linked genes may influence immune responsiveness (4). Evidence has been obtained for a determinant selection mechanism by the demonstration of direct binding ofimmunodominant peptides to class II MHC restriction molecules that can present the peptide but not to class II MHC molecules that do not present the peptide (5, 6). There is also some evidence for MHC-encoded molecules limiting the expressed repertoire ofT cell clones during thymic development (holein-the-repertoir...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{immune system}} has evolved to respond vigorously to microbial infection but to ignore self-antigens.

Mice inoculated with chimeric L 1 -CCR 5 particles generated autoantibodies that bound to native mouse CCR 5, inhibited binding of its ligand RANTES, and blocked HIV- 1 infection of an indicator cell line expressing a human-mouse CCR 5 chimera.

40|$|The spike (S) {{glycoprotein}} {{of severe}} acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates the receptor interaction and immune recognition {{and is considered}} a major target for vaccine design. However, its antigenic and immunogenic properties remain to be elucidated. In this study, we immunized mice with full-length S protein (FL-S) or its extracellular domain (EC-S) expressed by recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells. We found that the immunized mice developed high titers of anti-S antibodies with potent neutralizing activities against SARS pseudoviruses constructed with the S proteins of Tor 2, GD 03 T 13, and SZ 3, the representative strains of 2002 to 2003 and 2003 to 2004 human SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV, respectively. These data suggest that the recombinant baculovirus-expressed S protein vaccines possess excellent immunogenicity, thereby inducing highly potent neutralizing responses against human and animal SARS-CoV variants. The antigenic structure of the S protein was characterized by a panel of 38 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) isolated from the immunized mice. The epitopes of most anti-S MAbs (32 of 38) were localized within the S 1 domain, and those of the remaining 6 MAbs were mapped to the S 2 domain. Among the anti-S 1 MAbs, 17 MAbs targeted the N-terminal region (amino acids [aa] 12 to 327), 9 MAbs recognized the receptor-binding domain (RBD; aa 318 to 510), and 6 MAbs reacted with the C-terminal region of S 1 domain that contains the major <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> (aa 528 to 635). Strikingly, all of the RBD-specific MAbs had potent neutralizing activity, 6 of which efficiently blocked the receptor binding, confirming that the RBD contains the main neutralizing epitopes and that blockage of the receptor association is the major mechanism of SARS-CoV neutralization. Five MAbs specific for the S 1 N-terminal region exhibited moderate neutralizing activity, but none of the MAbs reacting with the S 2 domain and the major <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> in S 1 showed neutralizing activity. All of the neutralizing MAbs recognize conformational epitopes.

40|$|Four {{cardinal}} immune disorders {{interacting with}} each other may promote the progressive T cell depletion and immunosuppression characterizing AIDS. Immune activation of HIV- 1 infected T 4 cells leads to virus release and premature cell death. Both virus release with its resulting viral load and dead cells {{are the source of}} gp 120 stimulus. Anergy of non-infected CD 4 cells, resulting in cytokine dysregulation may be promoted by impairing the CD 4 -MHC interaction during CD 4 cell activation either directly through the SLWDQ pentapeptide identity with the CD 4 molecule and the CD 4 binding region or through a gp 120 -induced autoimmune reaction to CD 4. Overproduction of IFNα, the known antiproliferative and cytolytic cytokine may promote in a paracrine manner to neighbouring cells the immunosuppression generated by the lack of IL 2 secretion following CD 4 cell anergy. Apoptosis of activated non infected T cells could be induced by effector components of the sutoimmune reaction (CTL, Lymphotoxins or Abs?) directed towards the 2 consensus gp 120 sequence identity/similarity (INCTR and FYCNST) shared with the APO/Fas molecule. These two sequences are known as <b>immunodominant</b> <b>sites</b> of the gp 120.

CBA/Ca mice were able to mount a neutralizing ab response to IMUT 4 infection and molecular recognition sites were established by sequencing of the HA genes of monoclonal antibody (mAb) -selected laboratory variants of wild-type X 31 virus (HA 1 131, 145, 155, and 196).

40|$|Severe {{structural}} constraints in the hepatitis A virus (HAV) capsid {{have been}} suggested {{as the reason for}} the lack of emergence of new serotypes in spite of the occurrence of complex distributions of mutants or quasispecies. Analysis of the HAV mutant spectra under immune pressure by the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) K 34 C 8 (<b>immunodominant</b> <b>site)</b> and H 7 C 27 (glycophorin binding site) has revealed different evolutionary dynamics. Populations composed of complex ensembles of mutants with very low fitness or single dominant mutants with high fitness permit the acquisition of resistance to each of the MAbs, respectively.

A clear negative selection of those replacements affecting the residues encoded by rare codons of the capsid surface has been detected through the present quasispecies analysis, confirming a certain beneficial role of such clusters.

Both Th- 1 and Th- 2 effector CD 4 + T cells recognized a single <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> on this protein, implying that the differentiation of memory CD 4 + T cells along the Th- 1 or Th- 2 effector pathway was independent of the epitope specificity of the T cells.

A homologous region of 495 bp corresponding to the C-terminus end of the 1 D gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. This study described three lineages, viz.

The Ethiopian isolates clustered as part of topotype I, the East African topotype. Two clades (based on < 12 % nucleotide difference) A and B were identified within the East African isolates, with clade A being further classified into three significant branches, A 1 (80 % bootstrap support), A 2 (89 % bootstrap support) and A 3 (94 % bootstrap support).

Five competition groups of MAbs were identified. Groups I and II did not compete with each other. Group III competed with both groups I and II. Group IV did not compete with group I, II, or III.

Minor differences in antibody response against the previously defined antigenic subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac were also detected, with subsite Ab being the most antigenic in both TGEV- and PRCV-immune sows. These findings suggest that antigenic site A on S protein, involved in virus neutralization, is the <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> in pregnant sows that confer lactogenic protection. They also validate, in experiments with secretory antibodies, the antigenic maps made with murine monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, this antigenic site should be considered for vaccine or diagnostic development...|$|E
40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) is {{a recently}} emerged infectious disease {{caused by a}} novel strain of coronavirus. Examination of the immune responses of patients who have recovered from SARS should provide important information for design of a safe and effective vaccine. We determined the continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent SARS patients through biopanning with a vast M 13 phage display dodecapeptide library. These epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments, one {{on each of the}} structural proteins spike and nucleocapsid and the nonstructural proteins 3 a, 9 b, and nsp 3. Immunoassays found that most of the patients who had recovered from SARS developed complementary antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike S 2 protein, indicating that this is an <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> on the viral envelope comprising the spike, matrix, and small envelope glycoproteins. These S 2 -targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize the coronavirus, indicating that they provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from the viral infection. These results suggest that the SARS coronavirus might have an antigenic profile distinct from those of other human or animal coronaviruses. Due to the tested safety and protective effects of the convalescent-phase serological antibodies, identification of their complementary antigens may enable the design of an epitope-based vaccine to prevent potential antibody-mediated immunuopathology...|$|E
40|$|The lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from Rhizobium trifolii ANU 843 {{and several}} {{transposon}} (Tn 5) symbiotic mutants derived from ANU 843 were isolated and partially characterized. The mutant strains {{are unable to}} induce normal root hair curling (Hac- phenotype) or nodulation (Nod-phenotype) in clover plants. The LPSs from the parent and mutants are very similar in composition. Analysis by PAGE shows that the LPSs consist of higher and lower molecular weight forms. The higher molecular weight form of the LPSs exists in several aggregation states when PAGE is done in 0. 1 % SDS but collapses into a single band when PAGE is done in 0. 5 % SDS. Mild acid hydrolysis of all the LPSs releases two polysaccharides, PS 1 and PS 2. Immunoblots of the PAGE gels and enzyme linked immunosorbant assay inhibition assays show that the PS 1 fractions contain the <b>immunodominant</b> <b>sites</b> of the LPSs and that these sites {{are present in the}} higher molecular weight form of the LPSs. All the PS 1 fractions contain methylated sugars, 2 -amino- 2, 6 -dideoxyhexose, heptose, glucuronic acid, and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonic acid (KDO). All the PS 2 fractions contain galacturonic acid, mannose, galactose, and KDO. The PS 2 fractions have a molecular weight of about 700. The KDO is present at the reducing end of both the PS 1 and the PS 2 fractions. The PS 1 and PS 2 fractions from the mutants contain more glucose than these fractions from the parent. The LPS from a deletion mutant contains less acyl groups than the other LPSs. Immunoblots of the LPSs show that the parent and nod A mutant LPSs contain an additional antigenic band which is not observed in the other LPSs...|$|R
40|$|Epitopes {{involved}} in a protective immune response to Hendra virus (HeV) (Henipavirus, Paramxyoviridae) were investigated by generating five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the virus attachment protein (G) of HeV (HeV G) and sequencing of the G gene of groups of neutralization-escape variants selected with each mAb. Amino acid substitutions occurred at eight distinct sites on HeV G. Relationships between these sites were investigated in binding and neutralization assays using heterologous combinations of variants and mAbs. The sites were also mapped to a proposed structural model for the attachment proteins of Paramyxoviridae. Their specific locations {{and the nature of}} their interactions with the mAb panel provided the first functional evidence that HeV G in fact resembled the proposed structure. Four sites (aa 183 – 185, 417, 447 and 570) contributed to a major discontinuous epitope, on the base of the globular head, that was similar to <b>immunodominant</b> virus neutralization <b>sites</b> found in other paramyxoviruses. Amino acid similarity between HeV and Nipah virus was relatively highly conserved at these sites but decreased significantly at the other sites identified in this study. These included another discontinuous epitope on the base of the head region defined by sites aa 289 and 324 and well separated epitopes {{on the top of the}} head at sites aa 191 – 195 and 385 – 356. The latter epitope corresponded to <b>immunodominant</b> neutralization <b>sites</b> found in Rinderpest virus and Measles virus...|$|R
40|$|The T cell {{response}} to sperm whale myoglobin in the H- 2 d haplotype {{has been shown}} to be largely focused on a limited region around glutamic acid 109 recognized in association with I-Ad. T cell clones 9. 27 and 1. 2 have been previously (4, 5) shown to reflect this specificity and MHC restriction. In this study we have used a panel of synthetic peptides from the region 102 - 118 of myoglobin to characterize the specificities of these representative clones. The segment from 106 - 118 was found to represent a consensus region for recognition by both clones. However, we saw significant differences between clones in the hierarchy of responsiveness to peptides within the panel. In as much as the peptide and the I-Ad molecule remain constant, these differences derive from differences in how each T cell receptor interacts with the antigen. This peptide segment is an amphipathic alpha helix in native myoglobin, meaning that one side is hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. It is one of the prototype cases that led us to find that amphipathic helices constitute the majority of <b>immunodominant</b> <b>sites</b> recognized by helper T cells (1). It is likely that the peptide will refold into an amphipathic helix stabilized by the interface at the surface of the presenting cell. When such secondary conformation is considered, these data are consistent with a model of multiple T cell specificities arising from multiple views of a single antigen conformation at a single Ia-binding site and do not require postulation of multiple conformations or binding sites. Additionally, the finding of distinct specificities suggests that the immunodominance of this site depends not on the dominance of a single clone, but on the focusing of a polyclonal response on a single region of the molecule in association with I-Ad. The immunodominance of this particular region of the protein may thus depend on intrinsic features of the site, such as potential to form an amphipathic helix, as well as extrinsic factors such as binding properties of the I-A molecule...|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} {{in a major}} discontinuous site (site D) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of serotype C has been evaluated with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Isolates representing the major evolutionary sublines previously defined for serotype C were compared. Extensive variation, {{comparable to that of}} continuous epitopes within the hypervariable <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> A (the VP 1 G-H loop), was found. The amino acid sequences of the complete capsids of three antigenically highly divergent FMDVs (C 1 Haute Loire-Fr/ 69, C 5 Argentina/ 69, and C 3 Argentina/ 85) have been determined and compared with the corresponding sequences previously determined for seven additional type C viruses. Differences in antigenicity are due to a very limited number of substitutions of surface amino acids accessible to antibodies and located within antigenic sites previously identified on FMDV. A significant number of residues at these positions were also replaced in monoclonal antibody escape mutants. Depending on the variants compared, replacements within site A or at site D, or at both sites, contributed significantly to their antigenic differences. Examples of divergence mediated by a few amino acid replacements were found among FMDVs of Europe and South America. The results suggest that within a serotype of FMDV, antigenically highly divergent viruses can arise in the field by very limited sequence variation at exposed key residues of each of several antigenic sites...|$|E
40|$|Hemagglutinin (HA) is the {{principal}} antigen, present on the viral surface. It is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. In this paper, we have carried out studies on human hemagglutinin protein from H 5 N 1 strain with homologous hemagglutinin from non-human sources of H 5 N 1 strains. In all strains, part of the antigenic site (128 - 141) predicted by computer program “Antigenic”, corresponds to <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> Sa of H 1 subtype. In AAF 02304 strain, A 156 →S 156 mutation lies at the antigenic subsite of site 2 that corresponds to site B in the H 3 subtype. In some strains of non-human origins, there are mutations at the antigenic sites. Interestingly, in AAY 56367 strain mutation L 138 →H 138 lies at the receptor binding site, which also overlaps the antigenic site. Therefore, this amino acid substitution may influence both the specificity of receptor recognition and antibody binding. Seven potential glycosylation sites in human HA and in some strains of non-human sources have been predicted by computer program, Scan Prosite. In some strains of HA from non-human sources because of mutation, an additional glycosylation site appeared at the antigenic site. Therefore in these strains the oligosaccharides will mask the surface of HA as well as antigenic site. Hence these strains will not be recognized by host immune system...|$|E
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) isolate C- 1 -Barcelona (or C-S 30) {{includes}} four replacements within its <b>immunodominant</b> <b>site</b> (GH loop, residues 136 - 150 of capsid protein VP 1, YTTSTRGDLAHVTAT), relative to reference strain C-S 8 cl (YTASAR-GDLAHLTTT). Although {{one of the}} mutations in C-S 30 ((147) Leu [...] > Val) {{is known to be}} detrimental for antibody recognition, reactivity of this isolate with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4 C 4, raised against FMDV C- 1 -Brescia (GH loop: YTASTRGDLAHLTAT), was indistinguishable from those of strains C-S 8 cl or C- 1 -Brescia. A structural interpretation for these somewhat striking findings is available, based on the observation that 15 -residue peptides reproducing the C-S 30 and C-S 8 cl GH loops adopt very similar, quasi-circular, conformations in crystal complexes with 4 C 4. Nevertheless, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) kinetic analyses of the interactions between these peptides and three anti-GH loop mAbs have now revealed that the linear C-S 30 peptides were less antigenic in solution than their C-S 8 cl and C- 1 -Brescia counterparts. We have, therefore, tried to modulate peptide antigenicity in solution by cyclization. Functional SPR and structural two dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (2 D-H- 1 NMR) studies of both linear and cyclic peptide antigens are discussed here. Conformation seems to have an important role in peptide antigenicity, even when continuous (i. e. linear) antigenic sites are involved...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} seven {{neutralizing}} monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) directed against type A 12 {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} was used to generate neutralization-resistant variants. Both plaque reduction neutralization and microneutralization assays showed that the variants were no longer neutralized by the nMAbs used to generate them, {{although some of the}} variants still reacted with the nMAbs at high antibody concentrations. Results of cross-neutralization studies by both plaque reduction neutralization and microneutralization assays suggested the presence of at least one <b>immunodominant</b> antigenic <b>site</b> on the surface of type A 12 foot-and-mouth disease virus, along with evidence of a second antigenic site on the viral surface. Two of the variants had reduced virulence in tissue culture as evidenced by their inability to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and a marked reduction in virus-induced cellular morphological alterations. Nucleotide sequencing of the variant genomes placed three epitopes of the major antigenic site on VP 1 and the fourth epitope on VP 3 and VP 1. The one epitope of the minor site appears to reside only on VP 1...|$|R
40|$|Influenza virus {{hemagglutinin}} {{consists of}} a highly variable and immunodominant head domain and a more conserved but im-munosubdominant stalk domain. We introduced seven N-linked glycosylation sites in the hemagglutinin head domain to shield the <b>immunodominant</b> antigenic <b>sites.</b> The hyperglycosylated hemagglutinin enhanced stalk-directed seroreactivity while damp-ening the head response in immunized mice. Upon influenza virus challenge, mice vaccinated with the hyperglycosylated hemag-glutinin were better protected against morbidity and mortality than mice receiving the wild-type hemagglutinin. Currently, most influenza virus vaccines consist of a combina-tion {{of three or four}} seasonal virus strains predicted to circu-late in the following season. Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase are the most abundant viral glycoproteins {{on the surface of the}} virus. Antibodies elicited by conventional vac-cines target primarily the immunodominant globular head do-main of HA (1 – 3). These antibodies generally bind four antigenic sites proximal to the receptor binding site (4, 5), and they neutral-ize the virus by obstructing its binding to the receptor on the cell surface. The antigenic regions are highly variable, and current vaccines therefore offer limited protection against drifted strain...|$|R
40|$|Identification of a {{hepatitis}} A virus (HA V) receptor {{is important}} for understanding HA V tissue tropism and replication sites and {{in the design of}} vaccines and antiviral therapy. The attachment of HA V to cultured cell lines was evaluated: Calcium-dependent specific attachment of four HAV strains to permissive cells occurred, whereas binding to nonpermissive cells did not. Investigation of HAV antigenic variant strains (neutralization escape mutants) demonstrated identical attachment properties with neutralization-susceptible strains, suggesting that the immu-nodominant neutralization antigenic site of HAVis not directly involved in cell attachment. Unlike foot-and-mouth-disease virus, a related picornavirus, RGD peptides (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) were unable to interfere with HAV attachment. These studies demonstrate that HA V has a calcium-dependent receptor on cultured cell lines and suggest that the H;AV binding region does not involve an RGD sequence or the HAV <b>immunodominant</b> neutraliza-tion <b>site.</b> Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a hepatotrophic member of the enterovirus genus within the picornavirus family [I, 2]. It can be grown in several primate and human cell lines, al...|$|R
