5|$|Baird {{was given}} {{additional}} responsibilities as Minister responsible for Children on February 8, 2001. His department <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for child services {{early in the}} year, amid {{a significant increase in}} provincial demand. In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40–45% cuts in provincial child-care programs. Baird initially {{declined to comment on the}} document's contents, but rejected its proposals in early 2002.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure {{that would have allowed}} collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in {{education}} were {{a hallmark of}} Wetherby's term as governor. Over {{the course of his}} administration, he <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> to education by $20million. He called for the creation of an educational television network and initiated the state's first publicly funded bookmobile program. He supported the 1954 Minimum Foundation Program, an amendment to the state constitution that allowed funding to be allocated to school districts based upon need rather than number of pupils.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{foundation}} launched Elizabeth Street Capital, an initiative with Bank of America, {{with an initial}} investment of $10 million in capital to provide women entrepreneurs with access to low-cost loans, mentoring support and networking opportunities. In April 2016, Bank of America <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for the program to $20 million for loans in 2016 and 2017. The initiative, originally named for {{the location of the}} first Tory Burch boutique, is now known as the Tory Burch Foundation Capital program.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{the city}} has {{improved}} infrastructure, is more diversified, has gained a national reputation in medical fields, and has invested in the arts. Cleveland is generally considered an example of revitalization. The city's goals include additional neighborhood revitalization and <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for public education. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Cleveland was chosen to host the 2014 Gay Games, the fourth city in the United States to host this international event. On July 8, 2014, it was announced that Cleveland was chosen to be the host city of the 2016 Republican National Convention.|$|E

The plan is funded by the $3 billion from the 2008 Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> from the participating jurisdictions. The plan includes rebuilding much of its infrastructure for improved safety. The NTSB had recommended replacing Metrorail's oldest series of railcars as not crashworthy, and the spending plan would replace those cars.|$|E
5|$|The first {{legislative}} session of Breathitt's administration {{was a disappointment}} to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176million bond issue to <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services. Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip mining regulations, and improving benefits for teachers.|$|E
5|$|Willis renewed {{his call}} for an income tax repeal in the 1946 {{legislative}} session, but Democrats opposed the repeal and Republicans were split on the issue. The proposal failed {{by a vote of}} 36–60. Accomplishments of the session included better mine safety laws and stronger concealed weapons laws, and <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for black education. The war's end had brought additional revenue sources, and even with an expanded budget, the state experienced an $18 million surplus by the end of Willis's term.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Carroll <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> {{for public}} {{education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|During the 1974 {{legislative}} session, Ford {{proposed a}} six-year study of coal liquefaction and gasification {{in response to}} the 1973 oil crisis. He also <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax. He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities. As {{a result of the}} sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Kentucky {{had one of}} {{the highest}} dropout rates in the nation, and ranked second only to Arkansas in the number of one-room schools. Fewer than half of the state's high school {{graduates}} attended college. Many teachers educated in Kentucky sought higher salaries available in other states. Combs' biennial budget, passed by the General Assembly in 1960, used money from the new sales tax to increase school funds by fifty percent and establish the state community college system (now the Kentucky Community and Technical College System). It also <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for free textbooks by more than $3million and allocated another $2million to vocational education. It allocated over $5million to the state universities for new buildings and another $10.5million to fund completion of the Albert B. Chandler Hospital, a facility at the University of Kentucky named in honor of Combs' political foe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> of the ailing French film industry. Berri's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E

The following day, twelve disaster recovery centers were opened in the affected counties for residents to apply for federal funding. On September9, two more disaster recovery centers were opened for residents in south Texas. Later that day, $831,593.28 (1999USD) in disaster housing grants was distributed to affected residents. On September15, roughly 10,200 people applied for disaster loans, amounting to $3.1million (1999USD). A total of 167 also received crisis intervention from FEMA. In Corpus Christi, winds and rain covered the city in debris and brush, costing $200,000 (1999USD) for clean-up.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the General Assembly to pass {{an increase in the}} motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state sales tax from three percent to five percent. Nunn's budget focused on <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for <b>increased</b> <b>funding</b> for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E
