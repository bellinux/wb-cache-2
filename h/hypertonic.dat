5|$|Cerebral edema, if {{associated}} with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous mannitol and <b>hypertonic</b> saline (3%) are used—as {{in some other}} forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with <b>hypertonic</b> saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. <b>Hypertonic</b> saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypertonic</b> Saline with σ=1 {{has been}} of {{interest}} since early 1980s. <b>Hypertonic</b> Saline which contains sodium chloride works in regulating ICP, intravascular volume and cardiac output without causing significant diuresis, but there are theoretical side effects ranging from neurological complications to subdural hematoma. <b>Hypertonic</b> saline solution has been choice of neuro critical care {{for the past few}} years. <b>Hypertonic</b> Saline solution used varies and could be 3%, 7.5%, 10%, or 24.3% saline solution. When <b>Hypertonic</b> Solution is administered, the dosage is 2 g/kg.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of a protruding belly can visually indicate a <b>hypertonic</b> psoas, which pulls the spine forward while pushing the abdominal contents outward.|$|E
25|$|Volume {{expanders}} {{may either}} be isotonic, hypotonic, or <b>hypertonic.</b> Hypotonic fluids are not generally recommended in children {{due to increased}} risk of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} and physico-chemical nature (lipid, protein, carbohydrate) {{of the meal}} will also influence the gastric emptying of the food multiphase system. Fatty foods and <b>hypertonic</b> solutions empty slowly.|$|E
25|$|Tightness of the psoas {{can result}} in spasms or lower back pain by {{compressing}} the lumbar discs. A <b>hypertonic</b> and inflamed psoas can lead to irritation and entrapment of the ilioinguinal and the iliohypogastric nerves, resulting in a sensation of heat or water running {{down the front of}} the thigh.|$|E
25|$|Dehydration from {{prolonged}} exposure to <b>hypertonic</b> salt water—or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam {{in the lungs}} that restricts breathing—can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning. Hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a life vest.|$|E
25|$|Aerosolized {{medications}} that help loosen secretions include dornase alfa and <b>hypertonic</b> saline. Dornase is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down DNA in the sputum, thus decreasing its viscosity. Denufosol, an investigational drug, opens an alternative chloride channel, helping to liquefy mucus. Whether inhaled corticosteroids are useful is unclear, but stopping inhaled corticosteroid therapy is safe. There is weak evidence that corticosteroid treatment may cause harm by interfering with growth.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{high-volume}} {{intravenous fluids}} {{were given to}} people who had poor perfusion due to trauma. This is still appropriate in cases with isolated extremity trauma, thermal trauma, or head injuries. In general, however, giving lots of fluids appears to {{increase the risk of}} death. Current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries, allowing mild hypotension to persist. Targets include a mean arterial pressure of 60mmHg, a systolic blood pressure of 70–90mmHg, or the re-establishment of peripheral pulses and adequate ability to think. <b>Hypertonic</b> saline has been studied and found to be of little difference from normal saline.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} several {{different}} chemicals {{have been used}} to induce referred pain including bradykinin, substance P, capsaicin, and serotonin. However, before any of these substances became widespread in their use a solution of <b>hypertonic</b> saline was used instead. Through various experiments it was determined that there were multiple factors that correlated with saline administration such as infusion rate, saline concentration, pressure, and amount of saline used. The mechanism by which the saline induces a local and referred pain pair is unknown. Some researchers have commented that it could be due to osmotic differences, however that is not verified.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} popular {{approaches}} are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard hypodermic needle and gene gun delivery. Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using <b>hypertonic</b> solutions of saline or sucrose. Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections {{are treated with}} {{antibiotics}} which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes, the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Inhaled <b>hypertonic</b> saline and salbutamol may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation are important, especially in the young. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy have some short-term benefit, but long-term effects are unclear. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world. Lung problems are responsible for death in 80% of people with cystic fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy, or {{cerebral palsy}} where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are <b>hypertonic</b> and have what is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gamma-Aminobutyric acid properly, leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E
25|$|Treatment usually {{involves}} resuscitation with intravenous fluid therapy, usually {{a combination of}} isotonic fluids and <b>hypertonic</b> saline or a colloidal solution such as hetastarch, and emergency surgery. The stomach is initially decompressed by passing a stomach tube, or if that is not possible, trocars can be passed through the skin into the stomach to remove the gas, alternatively the trocars may be inserted directly into the stomach following anaesthesia {{in order to reduce}} the chances of infection. During surgery, the stomach is placed back into its correct position, the abdomen is examined for any devitalized tissue (especially the stomach and spleen). A partial gastrectomy may be necessary if there is any necrosis of the stomach wall.|$|E
25|$|While nasal {{irrigation}} can {{be carried}} out using ordinary tap water, this is potentially unsafe and can be uncomfortable because it irritates the mucous membranes. Therefore, an isotonic or <b>hypertonic</b> salt water solution is normally used, i.e. water with enough salt to match the tonicity of the body cells and blood. For the same reason, lukewarm water is preferred over cold water, which in addition to irritating nasal membranes can also exaggerate the gag reflex during irrigation. Use of distilled, sterile or previously boiled and cooled water over ordinary tap water is advised. A small amount of baking soda is sometimes employed as a buffering agent to neutralize the pH of the irrigating solution.|$|E
25|$|Intramuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (IMES) of muscle tissue {{has been used}} in various experimental and clinical settings. The advantage to using an IMES system over a standard such as <b>hypertonic</b> saline is that IMES can be turned on and off. This allows the researcher to exert a much higher degree of control and precision in terms of the stimulus and the measurement of the response. The method is easier to carry out than the injection method as it does not require special training in how it should be used. The frequency of the electrical pulse can also be controlled. For most studies a frequency of about 10Hz is needed to stimulate both local and referred pain.|$|E
25|$|In the hospital, {{the blood}} {{pressure}} can be artificially increased {{in order to increase}} CPP, increase perfusion, oxygenate tissues, remove wastes, and thereby lessen swelling. Since hypertension is the body's way of forcing blood into the brain, medical professionals do not normally interfere with it when it is found in a patient with a head injury. When it is necessary to decrease cerebral blood flow, MAP can be lowered using common antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers. If there is an intact blood–brain barrier, osmotherapy may be carried out by administering IV mannitol to create a <b>hypertonic</b> solution within the blood to draw water out of the neurons. This helps to reduce the fluid within the intracranial space; however, prolonged administration may lead to increase in ICP.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with grade I or II encephalopathy, enteral feeding should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition {{should be used}} only if enteral feeding is contraindicated as it {{increases the risk of}} infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases the kidneys' ammonia production, potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in {{patients with}} acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and <b>hypertonic</b> glucose administered as needed.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Weed and McKibben, {{biomedical}} {{researchers at}} Johns Hopkins Medical School, {{were the first}} ones to document the use and effect of osmotically active substances on brain mass. While studying transfer of salt solutions from blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), they first noted that concentrated sodium chloride intravenous (IV) injection led to collapse of the thecal sac which prevented them from withdrawing CSF from the lumbar cistern. In order to further study the effect, they conducted lab experiments on anesthetized cats which underwent craniotomy. They observed changes to the convexity of cat's brain upon IV injection, specifically, they noted that <b>Hypertonic</b> Saline IV injection resulted in maximum shrinkage of the brain in 15-30 mins, while administration of hypotonic solutions resulted in protrusion and rupture of the brain tissue. By 1927, use of osmotic agents in IV delivery became official.|$|E
25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This <b>hypertonic</b> fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{support is}} {{essential}} to maintain blood pressure, often {{with the help of}} colloids or <b>hypertonic</b> saline. NSAIDs are commonly given to reduce systemic inflammation. However, they decrease the levels of certain prostaglandins that normally promote healing of the intestinal mucosa, which subsequently increases the amount of endotoxin absorbed. To counteract this, NSAIDs are sometimes administered with a lidocaine drip, which appears to reduce this particular negative effect. Flunixin may be used for this purpose at a dose lower than that used for analgesia, so can be safely given to a colicky horse without risking masking signs that the horse requires surgery. Other drugs that bind endotoxin, such as polymyxin B and Bio-Sponge, are also often used. Polymixin B prevents endotoxin from binding to inflammatory cells, but is potentially nephrotoxic, so should be used with caution in horses with azotemia, especially neonatal foals. Plasma may also be given with the intent of neutralizing endotoxin.|$|E
2500|$|Severe {{hyponatremia}} {{or severe}} symptoms (confusion, convulsions, or coma): consider <b>hypertonic</b> saline (3%) 1–2 ml/kg IV in 3–4 h. <b>Hypertonic</b> saline may [...] {{lead to a}} rapid dilute diuresis and fall in the serum sodium. It {{should not be used}} in those with an expanded extracellular fluid volume.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, osmotherapy is {{the only}} way to reduce {{cerebral}} edema, and <b>hypertonic</b> saline appears to be better than other osmotic agents. [...] According to some researchers, glycerol can be best administered as a basal treatment whereas mannitol can be administered to control sudden rises in ICP. Compared to mannitol, there's evidence that the improvement in ICP, cerebral blood flow, and CPP due to administration of <b>hypertonic</b> saline lasts longer. In addition, <b>hypertonic</b> saline also shows significant effect in improving blood rheology such as hematocrit and shear rate at the level of the internal carotid artery (ICA).|$|E

2500|$|Jim Peters in the {{marathon}} of the 1954 Commonwealth Games [...] staggered and collapsed several times, {{and though he}} had a five-kilometre (three-mile) lead, failed to finish. Though it was formerly believed that {{this was due to}} severe dehydration, more recent research suggests it was the combined effects upon the brain of hyperthermia, <b>hypertonic</b> hypernatraemia associated with dehydration, and possibly hypoglycaemia.|$|E
2500|$|Sea {{water is}} <b>hypertonic</b> {{relative}} to blood, so water diffuses from blood {{into the water}} in the alveoli, and the electrolytes diffuse into the blood, leading to hypovolemia, [...] haemoconcentration and hypernatremia. The laboratory blood tests may show these shifts, which may be diagnostically useful. In animal experiments the thicker blood requires more work from the heart leading to cardiac arrest in 8 to 10 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|According to its advocates, nasal {{irrigation}} promotes good sinus and nasal health. Patients {{with chronic}} sinusitis including symptoms of facial pain, headache, halitosis, cough, anterior rhinorrhea (watery discharge) and nasal congestion are reported often to find nasal irrigation to provide relief. In published studies, [...] "daily <b>hypertonic</b> saline nasal irrigation improves sinus-related quality of life, decreases symptoms, and decreases medication use {{in patients with}} frequent sinusitis", and irrigation is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for chronic sinonasal symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of {{flecainide}} cardiac toxicity involves {{increasing the}} excretion of flecainide, blocking its {{effects in the}} heart, and (rarely) institution of cardiovascular support to avoid impending lethal arrhythmias. [...] Modalities that have had success include administration of a beta-sympathomimetic agent, and administration of a sodium load(often {{in the form of}} <b>hypertonic</b> sodium bicarbonate). [...] Placing the individual on cardiopulmonary bypass support may be necessary in order to temporarily remove the need for a beating heart and to increase blood flow to the liver.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the process}} is secret, the general method for making yeast extract on a {{commercial}} scale is to add salt to a suspension of yeast, making the solution <b>hypertonic,</b> {{which leads to the}} cells shrivelling up; this triggers [...] "autolysis", in which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are sieved out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free glutamic acids, which are analogous to monosodium glutamate.|$|E
2500|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy {{is by far}} the most common type, occurring in 70% to 80% of all cases. Moreover, spastic CP accompanies one of the other types in 30% of all cases. People with this type are <b>hypertonic</b> and have a neuromuscular condition stemming from damage to the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex that affects the nervous system's ability to receive gamma amino butyric acid in the area(s) affected by the disability. Spastic CP is further classified by topography dependent on the region of the body affected; these include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Osmotic agents work by {{primarily}} {{affecting the}} blood brain barrier. [...] It's {{very important that}} the osmotic agents cannot cross the blood brain barrier because the main idea is to use osmotic agents to increase plasma osmolarity and cause an osmotic gradient to cause water from brain cells to flow into the plasma. Once the equilibrium is reached, both the ICP and intracellular volume return to their initial normal conditions. [...] An ideal osmotic agent would be characterized by its inertness, relative non-toxicity and complete exclusion from brain entry. Thus, osmotic agents with reflection coefficient (σ) closer to 1 (0= freely permeable, 1= completely impermeable) is preferred as it is not likely to exhibit any rebound effects such as cerebral edema and ICP elevations upon withdrawal. Commonly used osmotic agents are urea, glycerol, mannitol and <b>Hypertonic</b> Saline. Dosage of osmotic agent administration is referred to as grams per person's body mass (g/ kg).|$|E
