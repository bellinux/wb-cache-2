40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this work}} is to find good designs for <b>high-speed</b> induction <b>machines.</b> Special {{attention is paid to}} rotors suitable for these machines. Another goal is to find supply voltage waveforms appropriate for a <b>high-speed</b> induction <b>machine</b> with a solid rotor. In order to design good <b>high-speed</b> <b>machines,</b> modeling is modified and verified. A laminated rotor made for high speeds was tested on a 65  kW 30600 1 /min compressor drive. Two squirrel cage solid steel rotors were tested on a 60  kW 60000 1 /min <b>high-speed</b> <b>machine.</b> In both cases, the rotors were compared against a commercially used copper coated solid steel rotor. The results showed that the laminated construction with a cage should be used whenever possible. At higher speeds, a well-designed squirrel cage solid steel rotor would be better than a copper coated solid steel rotor. The copper coated rotor is preferred at very high speeds. Pulse amplitude modulation and pulse width modulation are techniques used to adjust the supply voltage of electric machines. The feasibility of these modulation types for supplying <b>high-speed</b> induction <b>machines</b> was tested. The results show that pulse amplitude modulation is the best choice for a high-speed induction motor drive. For the <b>high-speed</b> <b>machines</b> considered, the 3 D effects made the 2 D modeling of the electromagnetic properties difficult. Two modifications to the current modeling software were made. In the first modification, the end ring inductance was calculated with a separate 2 D FEM model. In the other modification, the flux fringing in the air gap region was also modeled with a separate 2 D FEM model. A discrepancy between electromagnetic loss calculated and electromagnetic loss measured was noticed. The measurements show circulatory currents flowing in the parallel paths of a stator winding of a <b>high-speed</b> <b>machine.</b> These currents produce extra power loss not modeled in the calculations. It is shown that taking circulatory currents into account, the model provides results close to the measured ones. Thus, the model can be used for the designing and optimization of <b>high-speed</b> <b>machines.</b> Genetic optimization software was used to derive the optimal parameters for a squirrel cage solid steel rotor. General topology suitable for a <b>high-speed</b> induction <b>machine</b> was also studied by using optimization. The results show that both the positioning and the volume of conductors in the rotor are important. Considering the electromagnetic performance, the choice between a laminated and a solid rotor core material is less significant for a <b>high-speed</b> induction <b>machine.</b> reviewe...|$|R

It is clear that in these machines energy should be used efficiently. In this dissertation {{the aim is to}} improve the design process of <b>high-speed</b> electrical <b>machines</b> especially from the mechanical engineering perspective in order to achieve more reliable and efficient machines. The design process of <b>high-speed</b> <b>machines</b> is challenging due to high demands and several interactions between different engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical and energy engineering.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{emphasis on}} energy efficiency {{is starting to}} yield results in the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; however, the effort is still far from sufficient. Therefore, new technical solutions that will enhance the efficiency of power generation systems are required to maintain the sustainable growth rate, without spoiling the environment. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is only possible with new low-carbon technologies, which enable high efficiencies. The role of the rotating electrical machine development is significant in the reduction of global emissions. A high proportion of the produced and consumed electrical energy is related to electrical machines. One of the technical solutions that enables high system efficiency on both the energy production and consumption sides is <b>high-speed</b> electrical <b>machines.</b> This type of electrical machines has a high system overall efficiency, a small footprint, and a high power density compared with conventional <b>machines.</b> Therefore, <b>high-speed</b> electrical <b>machines</b> are favoured by the manufacturers producing, for example, microturbines, compressors, gas compression applications, and air blowers. <b>High-speed</b> <b>machine</b> technology is challenging from the design point of view, {{and a lot of}} research is in progress both in academia and industry regarding the solution development.
