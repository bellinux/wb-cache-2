5|$|Cucurbits are {{susceptible}} to diseases such as bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.), <b>fusarium</b> wilt (<b>Fusarium</b> spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as <b>Fusarium</b> causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from <b>Fusarium</b> venenatum.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; <b>Fusarium</b> yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera <b>Fusarium,</b> Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, <b>Fusarium,</b> and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
25|$|Lastly, nixtamalization {{significantly}} reduces (by 90–94%) mycotoxins {{produced by}} <b>Fusarium</b> verticillioides and <b>Fusarium</b> proliferatum, molds that commonly infect maize and the toxins {{of which are}} putative carcinogens.|$|E

25|$|Voriconazole, (trade name Vfend) is a {{triazole}} antifungal medication used {{to treat}} and prevent invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and <b>Fusarium</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Basil {{suffers from}} several plant {{pathogens}} that can ruin the crop and reduce yield. <b>Fusarium</b> wilt is a soil-borne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants. Seedlings may {{be killed by}} Pythium damping off.|$|E
25|$|Infection by Philippine {{downy mildew}} {{results in a}} lack of viable {{reproductive}} structures and often earlier death. In addition, the infected plant {{is more likely to}} be infected by a secondary pathogen, such as a species of Pythium, Helminthosporium, or <b>Fusarium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Copper {{and copper}} alloy {{surfaces}} have demonstrated a die-off of Aspergillus spp., <b>Fusarium</b> spp., Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans fungal spores. Hence, {{the potential to}} help {{prevent the spread of}} fungi that cause human infections by using copper alloys (instead of non-antifungal metals) in air conditioning systems is worthy of further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{pathogens}} infect sugarcane, such as sugarcane grassy shoot disease {{caused by}} Phytoplasma, whiptail disease or sugarcane smut, pokkah boeng caused by <b>Fusarium</b> moniliforme, Xanthomonas axonopodis bacteria causes Gumming Disease, and red rot disease caused by Colletotrichum falcatum. Viral diseases affecting sugarcane include sugarcane mosaic virus, maize streak virus, and sugarcane yellow leaf virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{antifungal}} {{efficacy of}} copper {{was compared to}} aluminium on the following organisms that can cause human infections: Aspergillus spp., <b>Fusarium</b> spp., Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. An increased die-off of fungal spores was found on copper surfaces compared with aluminium. Aspergillus niger growth occurred on the aluminium coupons; growth was inhibited on and around copper coupons.|$|E
25|$|Fumonisins – Crop corn can {{be easily}} {{contaminated}} by the fungi <b>Fusarium</b> moniliforme, and its Fumonisin B1 will cause Leukoencephalomalacia (LEM) in horses, Pulmonary edema syndrome (PES) in pigs, liver cancer in rats and Esophageal cancer in humans. For human and animal health, both the FDA and the EC have regulated the content levels of toxins in food and animal feed.|$|E
25|$|Proximal enteritis, {{also known}} as {{anterior}} enteritis or duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ), is inflammation of the duodenum and upper jejunum. It is potentially caused by infectious organisms, such as Salmonella and Clostridial species, but other possible contributing factors include <b>Fusarium</b> infection or high concentrate diets. The inflammation of the intestine leads to large secretions of electrolytes and fluid into its lumen, and thus large amounts of gastric reflux, leading to dehydration and occasionally shock.|$|E
25|$|In coastal New England, this {{evidence}} is weaker. Certain fungal pathogens of S. alterniflora were found {{more frequently in}} sites of die-off. These pathogens have varying degrees of virulence, {{and there is some}} evidence of association with species of <b>Fusarium</b> and areas of die-off. However, although the association suggests a partial causal link, particularly in stress-predisposed plants, strong evidence is lacking to suggest that such fungal pathogens are a major cause of die-off in New England (Elmer 2013).|$|E
25|$|The major {{breeding}} objectives include high grain yield, good quality, {{disease and}} insect resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including mineral, moisture and heat tolerance. The major diseases in temperate environments include the following, {{arranged in a}} rough order of their significance from cooler to warmer climates: eyespot, Stagonospora nodorum blotch (also known as glume blotch), yellow or stripe rust, powdery mildew, Septoria tritici blotch (sometimes known as leaf blotch), brown or leaf rust, <b>Fusarium</b> head blight, tan spot and stem rust. In tropical areas, spot blotch (also known as Helminthosporium leaf blight) is also important.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, taxol was {{discovered}} {{as a natural}} product in a newly described endophytic fungus living in the yew tree. It has since been reported {{in a number of}} other endophytic fungi, including Nodulisporium sylviforme, Alternaria taxi, Cladosporium cladosporioides MD2, Metarhizium anisopliae, Aspergillus candidus MD3, Mucor rouxianus sp., Chaetomella raphigera, Phyllosticta tabernaemontanae, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis pauciseta, Phyllosticta citricarpa, Podocarpus, <b>Fusarium</b> solani, Pestalotiopsis terminaliae, Pestalotiopsis breviseta, Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat., Gliocladium sp., Alternaria alternata var. monosporus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Nigrospora sp., Pestalotiopsis versicolor, and Taxomyces andreanae. However, there has been contradictory evidence for its production by endophytes, with other studies finding independent production is unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Phytoestrogens mainly {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} {{substituted}} natural phenolic compounds: the coumestans, prenylflavonoids and isoflavones are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in soy and red clover. Lignans have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids. Mycoestrogens have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of <b>Fusarium,</b> especially common on cereal grains, but also occurring elsewhere, e.g. on various forages. Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens, these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic.|$|E
25|$|Trichothecenes – sourced from Cephalosporium, <b>Fusarium,</b> Myrothecium, Stachybotrys and Trichoderma. The toxins {{are usually}} found in molded maize, wheat, corn, peanuts and rice, or animal feed of hay and straw. Four trichothecenes, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON) {{have been most}} commonly encountered by humans and animals. The consequences of oral intake of, or dermal exposure to, the toxins will result in Alimentary toxic aleukia, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and/or skin irritation. In 1993, the FDA issued a document for the content limits of DON in food and animal feed at an advisory level. In 2003, US published a patent that is very promising for farmers to produce a trichothecene-resistant crop.|$|E
25|$|Rhamnolipids {{have long}} been {{reported}} to have antimicrobial properties. They {{have been shown to}} have activity against a range of bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.5µg/mL to 32µg/mL. Activity against several fungi such as <b>Fusarium</b> solani and Penicillium funiculosum have also been observed with MICs of 75µg/mL and 16µg/mL respectively. Rhamnolipids have been suggested as antimicrobials able to remove Bordetella bronchiseptica biofilms. The mode of killing has been shown to result from intercalation of rhamnolipids into the cell membrane causing pores to form which result in cell lysis, at least in the case of Bacillus subtilis. The anti-microbial action of rhamnolipids may provide a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by excluding other microorganisms from the colonised niche. Furthermore, rhamnolipids have been shown to have anti-viral and zoosporicidal activities. The antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids may confer a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in niche colonisation as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a soil bacterium, as well as competing with other bacteria in the cystic fibrosis lung.|$|E

500|$|In cultivation, {{these plants}} have been {{described}} as [...] "remarkably free from pests and diseases". Two significant insect pests are aphids on young shoots, buds and flowers, and root mealybugs which attack below soil level. Stems and roots can be rotted by diseases caused by fungi and similar organisms; these include infections by species of <b>Fusarium</b> (a fungus), and Phytophthora and Pythium (both water moulds). Approved chemical treatments can be used in the case of insect attack or these diseases.|$|E
500|$|Paxillus involutus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} {{with a number}} of coniferous and deciduous tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialised nutrient requirements and a relatively broad host specificity, it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs. There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where P.involutus was cultivated on the root exudate of red pine (Pinus resinosa), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum. Seedlings inoculated with P.involutus also showed increased resistance to <b>Fusarium.</b> Thus P.involutus [...] may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot. Paxillus involutus also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against heavy metal toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of cadmium and zinc to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits ectomycorrhiza formation in seedlings, colonization with P.involutus decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal cell walls, as well as accumulating in the vacuolar compartments. Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to copper or cadmium drastically increase production of a metallothionein—a low molecular weight protein that binds metals.|$|E
500|$|Fungi, {{bacteria}} and viruses attack cacti, {{the first two}} particularly when plants are over-watered. <b>Fusarium</b> rot can gain entry through a wound and cause rotting accompanied by red-violet mold. [...] "Helminosporium rot" [...] is caused by Bipolaris cactivora (syn. Helminosporium cactivorum); Phytophthora species also cause similar rotting in cacti. Fungicides may be of limited value in combating these diseases. Several viruses {{have been found in}} cacti, including cactus virus X. These appear to cause only limited visible symptoms, such as chlorotic (pale green) spots and mosaic effects (streaks and patches of paler color). However, in an Agave species, cactus virus X has been shown to reduce growth, particularly when the roots are dry. There are no treatments for virus diseases.|$|E
500|$|A {{well known}} {{occurrence}} of disease susceptibility in crops lacking diversity concerns the 'Gros Michel', a seedless banana that saw world marketing in the 1940s. [...] As the market demand became high {{for this particular}} cultivar, growers and farmers began to use the Gros Michel banana almost exclusively. [...] Genetically, these bananas are clones, {{and because of this}} lack of genetic diversity, are all susceptible to a single fungus, <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum (Panama disease); large areas of the crop were destroyed by the fungus in the 1950s. 'Gros Michel' has been replaced by the current main banana on the market, the 'Cavendish', which in turn is (2015) at risk of total loss to a strain of the same fungus, 'Tropical Race 4'.|$|E
500|$|A common {{mushroom}} of deciduous and coniferous {{woods and}} grassy areas {{in late summer}} and autumn, Paxillus involutus forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with {{a broad range of}} tree species. These benefit from the symbiosis as the fungus reduces their intake of [...] heavy metals and increases resistance to pathogens such as <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum. Previously considered edible and eaten widely in Eastern and Central Europe, it has since been found to be dangerously poisonous, {{responsible for the death of}} German mycologist Julius Schäffer in 1944. It had been recognised as causing gastric upsets when eaten raw, but was more recently found to cause potentially fatal autoimmune hemolysis, even in those who had consumed the mushroom for years without any other ill effects. An antigen in the mushroom triggers the immune system to attack red blood cells. Serious and potentially fatal complications include acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relative}} humidity {{in the center}} of origin of cumin is rather low. High {{relative humidity}} (i.e. wet years) favours fungal diseases. Cumin is especially sensitive to Alternaria blight and <b>Fusarium</b> wilt. Early-sown crops exhibit stronger disease effects than late sown crops. The most important disease is <b>Fusarium</b> wilt, resulting in yield losses up to 80%. <b>Fusarium</b> is seed- or soil-borne and it requires distinct soil temperatures for development of epidemics. Inadequate fertilization might favour <b>Fusarium</b> epidemics. [...] Cumin blight (Alternaria) appears in the form of dark brown spots on leaves and stems. When the weather is cloudy after flowering, the incidence of the disease is increased. Another, but less important, disease is powdery mildew. Incidence of powdery mildew in early development can cause drastic yield losses because no seeds are formed. Later in development, powdery mildew causes discoloured, small seeds.|$|E
