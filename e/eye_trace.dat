40|$|This paper {{describes}} a software framework and analysis tool {{to support the}} collection and analysis of eye movement and perceptual feedback data {{for a variety of}} diagnostic imaging modalities. The framework allows the rapid creation of experiment software that can display a collection of medical images of a particular modality, capture <b>eye</b> <b>trace</b> data, and record marks added to an image by the observer, together with their final decision. There are also a number of visualisation techniques for the display of <b>eye</b> <b>trace</b> information. The analysis tool supports the comparison of individual eye traces for a particular observer or traces from multiple observers for a particular image. Saccade and fixation data can be visualised, with user control of fixation identification functions and properties. Observer markings are displayed, and predefined regions of interest are supported. The software also supports some interactive and multi-image modalities. The analysis tool includes a novel visualisation of scan paths across multi-image modalities. Using an exploded 3 D view of a stack of MRI scan sections, an observer's scan path can be shown traversing between images, in addition to inspecting them...|$|E

40|$|Asthenopia is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} different symptoms {{associated with the use}} of the eyes, such as pain, blurred vision, diplopia, headaches. Asthenopia is most often reported in association with near vision. Children with asthenopia complain of such symptoms particularly when reading and writing. Asthenopia is often divided into two main categories: refractive including refractive errors and anisometropia, and muscular, comprising strabismus and convergence insufficiency. Asthenopia due to accommodative problems has in the present studies been regarded as muscular asthenopia. In paper I the prevalence of asthenopia, refractive errors and binocular disorders was determined in a representative population of 216 Swedish schoolchildren aged 6 15 years. The prevalence of asthenopia was 23. 1 %. The prevalence of hypermetropia and myopia changed with age, while astigmatism, convergence ability and strabismus did not. Accommodative insufficiency was more common in the older schoolchildren. Asthenopia was related to uncorrected visual acuity and refractive errors, and to accommodative insufficiency. Paper II described the orthoptic and ophthalmological findings in a group of 120 schoolchildren with asthenopia. The effect of asthenopia treatment was also evaluated. The most frequently occurring findings related to asthenopia were refractive errors, heterophoria and accommodative insufficiency. With appropriate treatment with glasses, prism or orthoptic exercises for 3 6 months, 112 out of the 120 children (93 %) became asymptomatic. In paper III 49 schoolchildren with asthenopia due to accommodative insufficiency were assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the grade of asthenopia was correlated with the degree of accommodative deficiency. The aim was to investigate if VAS grading of the asthenopic symptoms could be used as an instrument to indicate the level of improvement of accommodative insufficiency after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of asthenopic symptoms as graded with the VAS scale was observed, and the improvement in accommodation was also significant. However, there was no correlation between VAS values and the accommodation before and after treatment, and VAS values can only give a general impression of the level of accommodative ability in asthenopia (p < 0. 001). Paper IV described how accommodative insufficiency influenced reading performance. Twelve children with asthenopia due to accommodative insufficiency were examined. Reading eye movements were recorded before and after treatment of asthenopia, using the IR corneal reflection technique, Orbit <b>Eye</b> <b>trace</b> System. Large variations in reading patterns were found. Despite successful accommodative treatment (p < 0. 001), no correlation was found to the different eye movement parameters that could suggest that reading velocity was improved...|$|E

Twenty-eight test-takers’ <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> on 24 banked gap-fill items (on six tasks) were analysed according to seven on-line eye-tracking measures representing overall, text and task processing. Variation in processing was related to test-takers’ level of performance on the tasks overall. In particular, as hypothesised, lower-scoring students exerted more cognitive effort on local reading and lower-level cognitive processing in contrast to test-takers who attained higher scores. The findings of different cognitive processes associated with variation in scores illuminate the construct measured by banked gap-fill items, and therefore have implications for test design and the validity of score interpretations...|$|R

We select 15 emotional film clips of 3 categories (positive, neutral and negative). The EEG signals and eye tracking data of five participants are recorded, simultaneously, while watching these videos. We extract emotion-relevant features from EEG signals and <b>eye</b> <b>tracing</b> data of 12 experiments {{and build a}} fusion model to improve the performance of emotion recognition. The best average accuracies based on EEG signals and eye tracking data are 71. 77 % and 58. 90 %, respectively. We also achieve average accuracies of 73. 59 % and 72. 98 % for feature level fusion strategy and decision level fusion strategy, respectively. These results show that both feature level fusion and decision level fusion combining EEG signals and eye tracking data can improve the performance of emotion recognition model. I...|$|R
50|$|Fogo was {{the second}} island in the {{archipelago}} to be populated, after Santiago (then São Tiago). Initially, the island's cash crop was cotton, picked by slaves from Angola. A fiery eruption in 1688 caused {{a majority of the}} inhabitants to leave for nearby Brava, another of the Cape Verdean islands. From 1785 on, whaling ships from Brockton and New Bedford, Massachusetts (United States) came to replenish their ships and recruit crews. The departure of these Americanos marks the beginning of the Cape Verdean diaspora. Not everyone left Fogo, however. In 1870, the eccentric Count of Montrond (France) stopped on the island en route to Brazil, or so he thought. He stayed, and brought with him the vines that kicked off wine production in the caldera. Many of the inhabitants of Chã, with their light skin, blond hair, and blue <b>eyes,</b> <b>trace</b> their ancestry back to the biologically prolific Count.|$|R

40|$|How can we improve learner drivers’ visual skills? Much {{research}} has demonstrated that learner drivers have an impoverished spread of search during driving and that this is partly due to lack of knowledge of where and when to look, rather than simply an issue of cognitive load. Several training interventions have tried to improve scanning in these drivers with limited success. We propose that exposing drivers to examples of good and bad scanning behaviour may prove to be a useful tool in training visual search. The success of this approach, however, requires drivers to be able to distinguish between examples of good and bad scanning. To this end, two studies were undertaken where video clips of simulated driving with an overlaid <b>eye</b> movement <b>trace</b> were presented to participants who had to judge whether the eye movements were that of a learner driver or a driving instructor. Overall, participants found this discrimination task very difficult. However, the findings suggested that novice and learner drivers were able to correctly classify those <b>eye</b> movement <b>traces</b> of other learner drivers better than chance. It was also demonstrated that the ability to distinguish between the eye movements of learner drivers and driving instructors improved as the number of objective {{differences between the two groups}} increased across specific scenarios (as determined by frame-by-frame analysis using a priori categories). The results suggest that, under certain situations, drivers can extract information about the appropriateness of a particular scanning strategy just by watching a video of the <b>eye</b> movement <b>trace.</b> The implications for training interventions are discussed...|$|R
