25|$|The {{technology}} so {{reduced the}} cost of production, that it meant that A.B.C. could sell its product for less than its competitors, the traditional fermentation method bakers. The downward impact on prices of A.B.C. moving into a market could be <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> immediately. For example, in 1866 Australia, A.B.C.'s lower prices forced other bakers to reduce theirs in turn, by between 8 and 17 percent.|$|E
25|$|Two {{sorts of}} {{opposition}} to the law emerged. One was from nonsectarian private schools, such as the Hill Military Academy, which were primarily concerned {{with the loss of}} their revenue. This loss was <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> immediately, as parents began withdrawing their children from private schools in the belief that these would soon cease to exist. The other was from religious private schools, such as those run by the Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, which were concerned about the right of parents {{to send their children to}} parochial schools.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, Ruskin {{returned}} to some literature and themes {{that had been}} among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about Walter Scott, Byron and Wordsworth in Fiction, Fair and Foul (1880) and {{returned to}} meteorological observations in his lectures, The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century (1884), describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's Storm-Cloud {{has been seen as}} foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ruskin’s prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> completely out of sympathy.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the poor roads, the 30th Division's breakout attempts were also hampered by the German 116th Panzer Division. The only potent unit left for commitment against the Allied Rhine crossings in the north, the 116th began moving south from the Dutch-German border on 25 March against what the Germans considered their most dangerous threat, the U.S. 9th Army. The enemy armored unit began making its presence <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> immediately, {{and by the end}} of 26 March the combination of the panzer division and the rough terrain had conspired to sharply limit the 30th Division's forward progress. With the 79th Infantry Division meeting fierce resistance to the south, General Simpson's only recourse was to commit some of his forces waiting on the west bank of the Rhine. Late on 26 March, the 8th Armored Division began moving into the bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{spread to}} other cities, towns, and villages. Level of the rebel activities varied greatly across Lithuania and the uprising was less organized, more spontaneous and chaotic. Men joined the uprising even though they {{never heard of the}} LAF or organized resistance in Kaunas. In most areas the rebels followed the pattern set in Kaunas and Vilnius: take control of local institutions (most importantly, the police) and secure other strategic objects. The rebels also arrested Soviet activists, freed political prisoners, and hoisted the Lithuanian flags. Lack of guns and ammunition was <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> everywhere; the main way to obtain guns was to disarm surrendered Soviet troops. Most active rebels were in the districts of Švenčionys, Mažeikiai, Panevėžys, and Utena. In some areas, like Šiauliai, there were no noticeable rebel activities. Once Germans entered a settlement they would disarm the rebels. However, some local institutions (police, various committees) de facto established by the rebels were later legalized de jure.|$|E
500|$|The final {{margin of}} victory of eight seconds was the closest in the Tour's history. LeMond's [...] average speed for the stage 21 time trial was, at that time, the fastest in Tour history. Since then, only the 1994 and 2015 prologues and David Zabriskie's 2005 time trial {{performance}} have been faster. The press immediately labeled LeMond's come-from-behind triumph as, [...] "the most astonishing victory in Tour de France history," [...] and while LeMond admitted that it <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> [...] "too good to be true," [...] he personally rated it as [...] "much more satisfying" [...] than his first overall Tour win in 1986.|$|E

500|$|During free {{practice}} on Friday and Saturday, it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren {{who set the}} pace, closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions, Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning. Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice, trailing Vettel by 0.465 seconds, {{twice as much as}} in previous races. However, he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session. Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa putting in the most consistently fast lap times, 0.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton. With high temperatures, tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that [...] "it <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> as though I was sliding around the track with the tyres melting".|$|E
2500|$|Pattie Boyd {{invoked the}} {{designer}} in a 2007 Daily Mail interview, when speaking {{of her and}} her then-husband George Harrison's darker days: [...] "at times I <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> suicidal.

2500|$|Cedric Bixler took {{responsibility}} for the breakup, saying repeatedly in interviews that he <b>felt</b> <b>almost</b> as if At the Drive-In was holding him back and that he didn't want his music to be confined to punk or hardcore — that it should encompass many genres and be even more progressive, alternative, and [...] "against-the-grain." [...] Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez had stated that they wanted their next album to sound like Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, while the other members were intent on progressing in a more alternative rock direction.|$|E

2500|$|In 1914, the Public Schools Officers' Training Corps annual {{camp was}} held at Tidworth Pennings, near Salisbury Plain. Lord Kitchener was to review the cadets, but the imminence of the war kept him elsewhere, and Smith-Dorrien was sent instead. He {{surprised}} the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a Bermudian cadet who was present) [...] "that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and {{that the loss of}} life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated.

Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was HIV positive. Michael later said: [...] "It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too. I couldn't go through it with my family because I didn't know how {{to share it with}} them – they didn't even know I was gay." [...] In 1993, Feleppa died of an AIDS-related brain haemorrhage. Michael's single, [...] "Jesus to a Child", is a tribute to Feleppa (Michael consistently dedicated it to him before performing it live), as is his album Older (1996). In 2008, speaking about the loss of his partner Feleppa, Michael said: [...] "It was a terribly depressing time. It took about three years to grieve, then after that I lost my mother.
