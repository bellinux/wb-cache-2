40|$|Oil {{and natural}} gas are {{important}} energy supply around the world. The <b>exploring,</b> <b>drilling,</b> transportation, and processing in oil-gas regions can release abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To understand the atmospheric behaviors of VOCs in such region, the fifty-six VOCs designed as the photochemical precursors by the United State Environmental Protection Agency were continuously measured {{for an entire year}} (September 2014 –August 2015) by a set of on-line monitor system at an oil-gas station in northwest China. The VOC concentrations in this study were 1 – 50 times higher than those measured in many other urban and industrial regions. The VOC compositions were also different from other studies with alkanes contributing up to 87. 5  % of the total VOCs in this study. According to the propylene-equivalent concentration and maximum incremental reactivity method, alkanes were identified as the most important VOC groups to the ozone formation potential. The photochemical reaction, meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and wind speed) and boundary layer height were found to influence the temporal variations of VOCs at different time scales. The positive matrix factorization analysis showed that the natural gas, fuel evaporation, combustion sources, oil refining process, and asphalt contributed 62. 6  %, 21. 5  %, 10. 9  %, 3. 8  %, and 1. 3  %, respectively to the total VOCs on the annual average. Clear temporal variations differed from one source to another was observed, due to their differences in source emission strength and the influence of meteorological parameters. Potential source contribution function and contribution weighted trajectory models based on backward trajectories indicated that five identified sources had similar geographic origins. Raster analysis based on CWT analysis indicated that the local emissions contributed 48. 4  %– 74. 6  % to the VOCs. This research filled the gaps in understanding the VOCs in the oil-gas field region, where exhibited different source emission behaviors compared with the urban/industrial regions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue {{to extreme}} poison, strong corrosion, and complex {{precipitation}} and deposition of H 2 S in the reservoir, {{it is very}} difficult and risky to investigate and <b>explore</b> <b>drilling,</b> completion, production and gas transportation. In the course of production of fractured gas reservoir with high H 2 S content, formation pressure falls continually, which lead to decline of solubility of sulfur particles in gas phase. Sulfur particles which dissolve in gas phase originally in the formation should precipitate from gas phase after running up to saturation state and deposit at pore space and throat, sequentially resulting in formation porosity and permeability reduction. At present, the researches of sulfur deposition are mainly focused on the conventional gas reservoirs and sulfur deposition in the near wellbore region is generally estimated using Roberts' model. However, most of the gas reservoirs with high-content H 2 S are fractured gas reservoirs, classical damage model is no longer applicable to fractured gas reservoirs with high H 2 S content. In the present study, a sulfur deposition damage model is established. The refined model, based on non-Darcy flow, takes into consideration the effects of sulfur deposition, variation in gas properties and fracture. In addition, the effect of gas well production rate on formation permeability is also studied. The results show that formation permeability decreases with fracture aperture and gas well production rate increasing. The bigger gas well production rate is, the quicker sulfur precipitates. The sulfur deposition of fractured gas reservoir with high-content H 2 S is mainly in the near wellbore zone, and the fracture aperture has {{a significant impact on the}} formation permeability in the near wellbore zone...|$|R

The 2010 Macondo blowout accident in the Gulf of Mexico was an eye-opener for many oil and gas operators and oilfield service companies; thus, making early kick detection technology research one of the top industry agendas. However, only limited {{progress has been made in}} detection technologies that focus on downhole parameters due to the complexity of offshore drilling operations that is increasingly shifting towards the deepwater. Therefore, the current paper experimentally <b>explores</b> downhole <b>drilling</b> parameters for kick indication during drilling. The study utilizes a fully instrumented laboratory scale drilling rig coupled with an air injection and surface monitoring systems. This study observed a sudden jump in bottomhole pressure, increased volume of the return fluid, decreased density of the return fluid, reduced rate of penetration, and increased rotary speed as indicators of kick. The most significant new finding, which is also validated with field reports, is the dampening effects of the drilling vibrations due to kick. Frequency analysis of the axial bit–rock displacements/vibrations confirms the changes of frequencies due to kick induction during drilling. Coupling this important finding with dynamic drilling models, the response of the drilling system at surface (e.g. standpipe, choke pressures, etc.) indicating this change can be predicted.|$|R
