500|$|Politics {{is present}} as an {{underlying}} theme in Spook Country {{to a greater}} extent than in any of the author's previous novels. The novel can be read as an exploration of the fear, uncertainty and pervasive paranoia of an America riven by the unending and divisive Iraq War. Although he had avoided overtly political themes in his previous work out of a distaste for didacticism, Gibson found that in the Bush era, politics had [...] "jacked itself up to my level of weirdness". Of the climate in Washington, D.C. during that period, he disclosed in a 2007 interview that [...] "I like the sheer sort of neo-Stalinist <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality.</b> That's what makes it work. It's interesting." [...] Mike Duffy in Scotland on Sunday characterized the novel as a [...] "startling, effective guidebook to post-9/11 America"; Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times elaborated, proposing that it was [...] "arguably the first example of the post-post-9/11 novel, whose characters are tired of being pushed around by forces larger than they are – bureaucracy, history and, always, technology – and are at long last ready to start pushing back".|$|E
2500|$|Some critics accused Baudrillard {{of instant}} revisionism; {{a denial of}} the {{physical}} action of the conflict (which was related to his <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> in general). Consequently, Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism, cynical scepticism, and Berkelian idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin (in his book Baudrillard and the Media) have argued that Baudrillard was {{more concerned with the}} West's technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests, and what that means for the present possibility of war. Merrin argued that Baudrillard was not denying that something had happened, but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral [...] "atrocity masquerading as a war".

2500|$|Leal and Irene Guenther both quote Arturo Uslar-Pietri, who {{described}} [...] "man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts. A poetic prediction or a poetic <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality.</b> What {{for lack of}} another name could be called a magical realism." [...] It {{is worth noting that}} Pietri, in presenting his term for this literary tendency, always kept its definition open by means of a language more lyrical and evocative than strictly critical, as in this 1948 statement. When academic critics attempted to define magical realism with scholarly exactitude, they discovered that it was more powerful than precise. Critics, frustrated by their inability to pin down the term's meaning, have urged its complete abandonment. Yet in Pietri's vague, ample usage, magical realism was wildly successful in summarizing for many readers their perception of much Latin American fiction; this fact suggests that the term has its uses, so long as it is not expected to function with the precision expected of technical, scholarly terminology.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not mean}} that all mad {{delusions}} are as concrete as this, though some are more concrete. Believing your own body is glass is a more daring <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> than believing a tree is a glass lamp {{at the top of}} a pole. But all true delusions have in them this unalterable assertion--that what is not is. The difference between us and the maniac is not about how things look or how things ought to look, but about what they self-evidently are. The lunatic does not say that he ought to be King; Perkin Warbeck might say that. He says he is King. The lunatic does not say he is as wise as Shakespeare; Bernard Shaw might say that. The lunatic says he is Shakespeare. The lunatic does not say he is divine in the same sense as Christ; Mr. R.J. Campbell would say that. The lunatic says he is Christ. In all cases the difference is a difference about what is there; not a difference touching what should be done about it.|$|E

50|$|World War I pushed many {{contemporary}} artists to adopt extremist viewpoints. The apocalyptic and dramatic visions, the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> {{the loss of}} trust towards one's fellow man, in his historical responsibility, scepticism towards knowledge, towards the expansion of technology and industry, towards modern forms of society, the pursuit of new worlds and new values, all contributed to an ambivalent and complex new situation.|$|E

60|$|A third mark {{of almost}} all mystical metaphysics is the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> Time. This is an outcome <b>of</b> the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> division; if all is one, the {{distinction}} of past and future must be illusory. We have seen this doctrine prominent in Parmenides; and among moderns it is fundamental in the systems of Spinoza and Hegel.|$|R
50|$|The author {{depicts a}} two-class society in this novel. The whole system {{is based on}} prejudices both groups of people have against each other. Christopher also shows what happens when {{something}} is seen as perfect and thus making people overlook their own mistakes. This <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> and prejudices are creating a social order {{in which people are}} happy on their own, showing no interest in others. The author wants to make the reader to question seemingly perfect conditions instead of accept them without a second thought.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} only {{released}} {{in a small}} number of theaters and quickly released to video on demand. It was released on DVD on September 18, 2012. It received poor reviews with The New York Times saying [...] "there is the inkling of a strong, interesting idea here, about how some versions of modern religion are predicated on the systematic <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> but Salvation Boulevard is itself too loosely tethered to the actual world to make the point with the necessary vigor or acuity". Rotten Tomatoes reported only a 21% favorable rating.|$|E
5000|$|This intense hold on {{tradition}} is most evident while Brave Orchid desperately attempts to reunite Moon Orchid with her husband. Brave Orchid {{is willing to}} overstep any social code {{to get them back}} together. When Moon Orchid tells her that it is against the law for men in the U.S. to have more than one wife, Brave Orchid responds by saying “The law doesn’t matter.” [...] Such blatant <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> proves how strongly Brave Orchid is attached to upholding Chinese moral standards. She refuses to assimilate to an American code of behavior.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 5th century BCE, some of the {{components}} of a scientific tradition were already heavily established, even before Plato, who was an important contributor to this emerging tradition, thanks to the development of deductive reasoning, as propounded by his student, Aristotle. In Protagoras (318d-f), Plato mentioned the teaching of arithmetic, astronomy and geometry in schools. The philosophical ideas of this time were mostly freed from the constraints of everyday phenomena and common sense. This <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality</b> as we experience it reached an extreme in Parmenides who argued that the world is one and that change and subdivision do not exist.|$|E

5000|$|Madhyamaka {{is seen by}} Chokden as {{removing}} the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes {{the fault of the}} <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>Reality.</b> Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization. Therefore for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways. Sakya Chokden held that this view was more in concordance with Vajrayana teachings and Tantras. Perhaps his most controversial view was that Ultimate reality or Primordial Mind is an impermanent phenomenon and that this is supported by Yogacara, Sutra and Tantra.|$|E

First staged during the Vietnam War era, the musical seems more relevant than ever as it takes precise aim at the sunny outlook that comes from near-psychotic <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality.</b> The review praises the cast: [...] "The cast does a great job... Individually, Kathleen White as Ruby is deliciously comic, with expressions and physical comedies that recall Lucille Ball... Chrysten Peddie as Joan has the tough dame attitude down cold. She’s got a warm presence, is a great dancer and has a strong voice." ...|$|E

50|$|Later Sakyas such as Gorampa (1429-1489) and Sakya Chokden (1428-1507) {{would develop}} and defend Sakya anti-realism, {{and they are}} seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita's philosophy. Sakya Chokden also critiqued Tsongkhapa's {{interpretation}} of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa's Shentong. In his Definite ascertainment of the middle way, Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa's view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language. Sakya Chokden's philosophy attempted to reconcile {{the views of the}} Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth.

The emotional reaction {{depends upon the}} disturbance to the patient's major adaptations to {{life as well as}} the meaning of the organ to the patient. Fear of isolation and rejection by others may be more terrifying than fear of death. Emotional reactions include regression with marked dependency, anxiety, depression, hostility and, if severe, paranoid states, hypochondriasis, denial, counterphobic behaviour, obsessive-compulsive reactions and schizophrenic reactions. Management basically involves early establishment of a positive doctor-patient relationship. In such a relationship the physican should educate his patient, undercut guilt, accept transient regression and expression of anger, set limits on counterphobic behaviour, either support or gently question <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>reality,</b> and support, without being overly sympathetic, a depressed patient. The nurse, social worker, psychiatrist and the patient's family may be valuable members of the therapy team. Disfigurements of various body areas pose individual problems of management...|$|E
