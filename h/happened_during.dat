5|$|Had Eisenhower {{postponed}} the invasion, {{the next}} available period {{with the right}} combination of tides (but without the desirable full moon) was two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. As it <b>happened,</b> <b>during</b> this period the invaders would have encountered a major storm lasting four days, between 19 and 22 June, that would have made the initial landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E

5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of as {{he felt he was}} mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> the meeting.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2010, {{the front}} façade of the building, made of rare green tonalite, was {{severely}} damaged by students who threw granite rocks {{removed from a}} nearby pavement at the building's main entrance. The incident <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> a large student protest against the proposed law on the introduction of mini jobs that would curb student work and changes to scholarship policy. Repairs to the building were estimated at 27,000 euros.|$|E
5|$|Some conversations, due {{to their}} private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> his meeting with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh {{the way he did}} in the novel. Ottaviani also wove the story Marsh tells about the Mastodon from several {{different}} versions of the legend.|$|E

5|$|There were {{experimental}} test operations {{set up to}} see if {{the idea}} was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in the nineteenth-century to operate such a system. Another disadvantage was the possibility of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures – which often <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> storms. The nineteenth-century idea to replace the existing steam fire engines with electric ones was ahead of its time and never moved forward.|$|E
5|$|These units linked {{up several}} times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> Operation Anaconda the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the Shah-i-Kot {{mountains}} of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen {{as one of the}} heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E

50|$|Recording {{sessions}} are {{seen by some}} writing center scholars as a viable method of data gathering that answers critiques {{from the likes of}} Stephen North about the lack of research regarding what <b>happens</b> <b>during</b> tutoring sessions. To accomplish this, writing center directors using this method explicitly study what <b>happens</b> <b>during</b> a tutoring session using audio or video tapes and analyzing the transcripts.|$|R

5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff fans would be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|In South America, dire wolves {{have been}} dated younger than 17,000 YBP and {{reported}} from only three localities: Muaco in Falcón state, Venezuela; Talara Province in Peru; and Tarija Department in Bolivia. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America {{because of the}} favorable cool, dry, and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical rain forest.|$|E

5|$|Lord Cave {{resigned}} on 28 March 1928 due to ill health, {{and died}} the day after. His replacement was Lord Hailsham, {{who was appointed}} by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928. Hailsham's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted barely a year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities (many politicians considered {{that if he had}} not accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he would likely have become Prime Minister) he was not a particularly innovative Lord Chancellor. For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> his time in charge.|$|E
5|$|The reigning champion, La Diabólica left CMLL to join rival Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) on April 5, 2003 which forced CMLL {{to vacate}} the championship. This <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> {{a time of}} very low {{activity}} in CMLL's female division, which meant the title was inactive {{for over two years}} before CMLL held a tournament for the title starting on September 9, 2005. CMLL held a nine-woman torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine the two finalists that would face off the next week in a best two-out-of-three falls match. Dark Angel and Marcela survived the match and met on September 16, 2005 with Marcela winning the match and her first CMLL World Women's Championship.|$|E
5|$|A {{close link}} {{existed between the}} ruler and the Sangha (Buddhist priesthood) since the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the country. This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani's reign. The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions. This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect, but {{by the middle of}} the 1st century BC, the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a close link to the ruling of the country. By the end of the 3rd century AD, the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler. Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government, as <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> the reign of Lanjatissa. Even Valagamba's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara, and he succeeded only after a reconciliation was affected. Some rulers patronized only one sect, but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects. Despite this, religious establishments were often plundered during times of internal strife by the rulers themselves, such as during the reigns of Dathopatissa I (639–650) and Kashyapa II (650–659).|$|E
