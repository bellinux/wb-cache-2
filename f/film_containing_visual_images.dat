5000|$|A reading path is a {{term used}} by George Kress in Literacy in the New Media Age (2003). According to Kress, a {{professor}} of English Education at the University of London, a reading path {{is the way that}} the text, or text plus other features, can determine or order the way that we read it. In a linear, written text, the reader makes sense of the text according to the arrangement of the words, both grammatically and syntactically. In such a reading path, there is a sequential time to the text. In contrast, with non-linear text, such as the text found when reading a computer screen, where text is often combined with visual elements, the reading path is non-linear and non-sequential. Kress suggests that reading paths that <b>contain</b> <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> are more open to interpretation and the reader's construction of meaning.

40|$|A crucial step in image {{compression}} is {{the evaluation of}} its performance, and more precisely available ways to measure the quality of compressed images. In this paper, a machine learning expert, providing a quality score is proposed. This quality measure {{is based on a}} learned classification process in order to respect that of human observers. The proposed method namely Machine Learning-based Image Quality Measurment (MLIQM) first classifies the quality using multi Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification according to the quality scale recommended by the ITU. This quality scale contains 5 ranks ordered from 1 (the worst quality) to 5 (the best quality). To evaluate the quality of images, a feature vector <b>containing</b> <b>visual</b> attributes describing <b>images</b> content is constructed. Then, a classification process is performed to provide the final quality class of the considered image. Finally, once a quality class is associated to the considered image, a specific SVM regression is performed to score its quality. Obtained results are compared to the one obtained applying classical Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) algorithms to judge the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|In The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative, author H. Porter Abbott defines {{narrative}} as “the representation {{of an event}} or a series of events” (13). Given this broad definition, narrative events can be represented {{in a number of}} ways, as seen in different storytelling mediums like literature, film, television, paintings, video games, or even daily oral storytelling. Narrative {{is the way in which}} one communicates a story. In literature, writers must use text and the placement of text on a page or a screen in order to convey a series of events. Writers can utilize narrators in literature in a number of ways, such as using a third-person omniscient narrator in order to present a character’s thoughts, feelings, and actions throughout a novel or a short story, or using word placement, details, and punctuation in order to imply a length of time. Unlike literature, <b>films</b> <b>contain</b> audio and <b>visuals</b> that can be utilized by filmmakers in order to tell their stories. While the medium of film may use some of the same devices as literature, such as various styles of narrators, imagery, or metaphors, films perform and present these devices differently than literature does. 1 While literature presents the setting of the story through text and word-based imagery, films present the setting through <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> and sounds, displaying images of New York in order to communicate that location to the audience, or incorporating sounds of a busy cityscape in order to imply that a scene takes place in or near a busy city area. The way in which each storytelling medium is structured is different, and this allows for differing ways of presenting content to audiences...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} content {{management}} of multimedia data types (e. g., image, video, graphics) {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{with the development of}} advanced multimedia applications.

We propose two abstract languages on the basis of description logics: one for describing knowledge of the object and schema layers, and the other, more expressive, for making queries. Queries can refer to the form dimension (i. e., information of the Feature and Content Layer) or to the content dimension (i. e., information of the Object L [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} GCC companies' use of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> to interplay modernity and globalism with tradition, Islam and local culture. The {{analysis}} aims to bring attention to the way that businesses in the GCC use <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> to engage with or influence debates in their societies concerning the tension between modernity, globalisation and traditional values in the Arab-Islamic world. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is critical and discursive and based on a close reading of the <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> reported in the 2005 annual reports of companies listed on GCC stock markets. Findings – The analysis suggests that GCC companies on many occasions used <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> to depict and represent {{the possibility of a}} successful profitable, modern and global business that is also sympathetic to tradition and operates within the framework of Islamic principles. Originality/value – While <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> are increasingly used in companies' annual reports they have been largely ignored in accounting research. Furthermore, when this research manifests, it has been concerned with investigating Anglo-American and Western contexts. This paper instead emphasises the significance of researching the use of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> in a variety of contexts and locations. It critically and contextually explores the use of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> in a largely unexplored, non-Western and a significantly Islamic context.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we focus on}} face appearance-based biometrics. The cheap and readily {{available}} hardware used to acquire data, their non-invasiveness and the ease of employing them from a distance and without the awareness of the user, {{are just some of}} the reasons why these continue to be of great practical interest. However, a number of research challenges remain. Specifically, face biometrics have traditionally focused on images acquired in the visible light spectrum and these are greatly affected by such extrinsic factors such as the illumination, camera angle (or, equivalently, head pose) and occlusion. In practice, the effects of changing pose are usually least problematic and can oftentimes be overcome by acquiring data over a time period, e. g., by tracking a face in a surveillance video. Consequently, image sequence or image set matching has recently gained a lot of attention in the literature [137 – 139] and is the paradigm adopted in this chapter as well. In other words, we assume that the training image set for each individual contains some variability in pose, but is not obtained in scripted conditions or in controlled illumination. In contrast, illumination is much more difficult to deal with: the illumination setup is in most cases not practical to control and its physics is difficult to accurately model. Thermal spectrum imagery is useful in this regard as it is virtually insensitive to illumination changes, as illustrated in Fig. 6. 1. On the other hand, it lacks much of the individual, discriminating facial detail <b>contained</b> in <b>visual</b> <b>images.</b> In this sense, the two modalities can be seen as complementing each other. The key idea behind the system presented in this chapter is that robustness to extreme illumination changes can be achieved by fusing the two. This paradigm will further prove useful when we consider the difficulty of recognition in the presence of occlusion caused by prescription glasses...|$|R
