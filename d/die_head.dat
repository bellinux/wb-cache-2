25|$|In April 1889 Hartness {{moved to}} Springfield, Vermont {{to become the}} {{superintendent}} at the struggling Jones and Lamson (J) Machine Company. He used his creative energy to revitalize the company. Here he found his chance to manufacture the flat-turret lathe, which increased efficiency and productivity and was especially well adapted to the burgeoning automobile industry. The flat turret lathe improved upon earlier turret lathes via greater rigidity, allowing higher precision, higher speeds and feeds, and longer cuts. Hartness also developed an array of highly advanced tooling to complement the lathe, including improved roller bar feed and <b>die</b> <b>head</b> designs. All of these advantages allowed better parts to be made faster, and thus less expensively, which made the lathe highly desirable to manufacturers. This time, Hartness was prepared to defend his interest in his patent. He arranged with J to receive a $100 royalty on each machine.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} main types of thread rolling, {{named after the}} {{configuration}} of the dies: flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, and planetary dies. The flat die system has two flat dies. The bottom one is held stationary and the other slides. The blank is placed {{on one end of the}} stationary die and then the moving die slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll between the two dies forming the threads. Before the moving die reaches the end of its stroke the blank rolls off the stationary die in a finished form. The two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to [...] in diameter and [...] in length. There are two types of three-die processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads. This type of process is commonly employed on turret lathes and screw machines. The second type takes the form of a self-opening <b>die</b> <b>head.</b> This type is more common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2 threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up to [...] in diameter.|$|E

50|$|In operation, {{there are}} usually four {{moveable}} chasers that cut the thread then {{back away from the}} work to permit rapid removal of the tool. The lower picture at the right shows four sets of chasers. Each set of chasers is designed to cut a different thread. One set of chasers would be used at a time, each chaser is inserted into the <b>die</b> <b>head</b> (in the correct order) and the <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is closed bringing the chasers down to their cutting position.

50|$|Unlike on a lathe, single-point {{threading}} {{is rarely}} if ever performed; {{it is too}} time-consuming for the short cycle times that are typical of screw machines. A self-releasing <b>die</b> <b>head</b> can rapidly cut or roll-form threads on outside diameters. A non-releasing tap holder with a tap can quickly cut inside diameters but it requires single spindle machines to reverse into high speed {{in order for the}} tap to be removed from the work.

5000|$|Between 1800 and 1840, on the machine-screw side, {{it became}} common {{practice}} to build {{all of the}} relevant screw-cutting machine elements into engine lathes, so the term [...] "screw-cutting lathe" [...] ceased to stand in contradistinction to other metalworking lathe types as a [...] "special" [...] kind of lathe. Meanwhile, on the wood-screw side, hardware manufacturers had developed for their own in-house use the first fully automatic automated special-purpose machine tools for the making of screws. The 1760-1840 development arc was a tremendous technological advance, but later advancements would make screws even cheaper and more prevalent yet again. These began in the 1840s with the adaptation of the engine lathe with a turret-head toolholder to create the turret lathe. This development greatly reduced the time, effort, and skill needed from the machine operator to produce each machine screw. Single-pointing was forgone in favor of <b>die</b> <b>head</b> cutting for such medium- and high-volume repetitive production. Then, in the 1870s, the turret lathe's part-cutting cycle (sequence of movements) was automated by being put under cam control, in a way very similar to how music boxes and player pianos can play a tune automatically. According to Rolt (1965), {{the first person to}} develop such a machine was Christopher Miner Spencer, a New England inventor. [...] may have contemporarily independently invented a machine similar to Spencer's. However, the wood-screw-making machines of the 1840s and 1850s factory production machine tools as opposed to small-machine-shop machine tools, such as those developed by Cullen Whipple of the New England Screw Company and Thomas J. Sloan of the American Screw Company, had anticipated the machines of Spencer and Vander Woerd in various ways, albeit approaching the problem of automated screw production from a different commercial angle. All of the above machine tools (i.e., screw-cutting lathes; suitably equipped engine lathes and bench lathes; turret lathes; turret-lathe-derived screw machines; and wood-screw-factory screw machines) were sometimes called [...] "screw machines" [...] during this era (logically enough, given that they were machines tailored to screw making). The nomenclatural evolution whereby the term [...] "screw machine" [...] is often used more narrowly than that is discussed above.|$|E
30|$|After {{performing}} the preliminary round of experiments, {{it has been}} found that three factors (pushing zone temperature, dimmer speed, <b>die</b> <b>head</b> temperature) are the significant factors among the all five factors, namely feeding zone temperature, melting zone temperature, pushing zone temperature, dimmer speed, and <b>die</b> <b>head</b> temperature as, deduced from the ANOVA results tabulated in Table  4.|$|E

30|$|The {{manufacture}} of HDPE pipes of 32  mm outer diameter involves an extrusion process for extruding a hollow pipe using blow molding technique. The elements required for extrusion process are the extruding machine setup and PolyEthylene (PE) granules. The selected {{material for the}} pipe (PE granules) is first heated in the mixer machine. After attaining the required temperature, it is manually fed into the extruder machine through a feeder. Here, the material enters into the long barrel of the machine where the material is fed all through the process through the feeding zone, melts in the melting zone and is pushed into the <b>die</b> <b>head</b> in the pushing zone. Here, the barrel {{is divided into three}} zones to maintain equal material flow rate throughout the process. For this purpose, a rotating screw is fixed inside the barrel (which would be almost the size of the barrel). This screw pushes the material from the feeder to the <b>die</b> <b>head.</b> The <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is fixed, based on the diameter of the pipe required. At this <b>die</b> <b>head,</b> pressurized air is sent in between the material for attaining hollow shape. The pipe coming out of the <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is cooled using cooling water supply for the solidification purpose. Proper cooling temperature should be maintained for the solidification and smooth finish of the pipe at the <b>die</b> <b>head.</b> The pipe coming out of <b>die</b> <b>head</b> is first sent into the cooling tank and then it is pulled by the take-off machine. The speed of the take-off machine is set based on the required pipe thickness. This pipe will be further sent for pressure testing to test the withstanding pressure. HDPE plastic pipes are mainly used for transportation of water {{from one place to another}} place. Hence, these pipes undergo tremendous pressure by water. Higher withstanding pressure is supposed to result in a better condition of the pipe. Therefore, the withstanding pressure should be set the higher the better.|$|E
30|$|From S/N ratio graph  1 of Fig.  7, it is deduced that {{at level}} 4 the pushing zone {{temperature}} at 166  °C is significant {{and the greater}} the S/N ratio, the greater is the significance. From S/N ratio graph  2 of Fig.  8, the dimmer speed at level 5, i.e., 8  rpm, is significant and from S/N ratio graph  3 of Fig.  9, <b>die</b> <b>head</b> temperature at level 2, i.e., 192  °C, is significant. From S/N ratio graph  4 of Fig.  10, the interactions between pushing zone temperature at 166  °C and dimmer speed at 8  rpm are significant. From graph  5 of Fig.  11, the interaction between pushing zone temperature at 166  °C and <b>die</b> <b>head</b> temperature at 192  °C is significant.|$|E
30|$|Further {{investigations}} {{are made to}} these three factors by increasing the levels of each factor from two to five and the same procedure is repeated by taking modified orthogonal array. The pushing zone temperature, dimmer speed, <b>die</b> <b>head</b> temperature in the extrusion process again correlated significantly to the quality characteristic. This research concentrated on parameter design developed by Dr. Taguchi to calculate the S/N ratio. After all the quality values were converted to S/N ratios, the consequent analysis was conducted using the statistic estimation to estimate S/N ratios under different parameter-level combinations. The highest value of S/N ratio was conformed to be the optimum parameter-level combination, because it had the minimum variance. After Taguchi’s S/N analysis and the following experiments, the combination of A 4, B 5 and C 2 {{was chosen as the}} optimum factor level which was as follows: pushing zone temperature 166  °C, dimmer speed 08  rpm, and <b>die</b> <b>head</b> temperature 192  °C.|$|E
