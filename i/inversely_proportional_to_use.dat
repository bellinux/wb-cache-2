40|$|Production {{of cement}} based {{rainwater}} harvesting tanks {{in developing countries}} differs from the situation in industrialised nations, with low aggregate quality, negligible labour costs relative to material cost and use of unreinforced mortar in tension. The present paper details an experimental programme undertaken on mortars made with representative materials to determine their tensile performance. It appears that in lean mortars a synthesised sand, containing 20 wt-% kaolin clay (representative of local sands, often used in construction in Africa) gives higher strengths than clay free (standard) sand, while {{the same level of}} montmorillonite lowers the strength for rich or lean mortars. Economic modelling indicates that, for bending loading (maximum stress <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> thickness squared), <b>using</b> kaolin contaminated sand is preferable <b>to</b> <b>using</b> standard sand. However, the montmorillonite contaminated sand must cost around 2 / 3 less than the imported sand to become competitive. For membrane loading (maximum stress <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> thickness), kaolin contaminated sand is preferable only when it is considerably cheaper than standard sand, and montmorillonite contaminated sand is never preferable in practical situations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn our study, {{which we}} {{carried out with}} a group of primary-school {{children}} aged between six and nine, we were interested in how musical language is shaped through group improvisations. Narrative dimensions of improvisation were studied through activities of Orff-Schulwerk, the specific music-movement education approach which, apart from music activities, puts great emphasis on development of social competences. The research was designed as a phenomenological case study. The findings show that, contrary to Orff-Schulwerk premises, children had yet to learn musical language and how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. It also turned out that teacher's expectations regarding the use of non-verbal communication are <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the successful <b>use</b> of musical language. In line with Orff-Schulwerk's principles, rhythm proved to be the primary musical language parameter, as it was through rhythm that children first reached the sensations of others and reflectively depicted events from everyday life...|$|R
50|$|In the {{alternating}} current system, a transformer was used between the (relatively) high voltage distribution {{system and the}} customer loads. Lamps and small motors could still be operated at some convenient low voltage, but the transformer would allow power to be transmitted at much higher voltages, say, ten {{times that of the}} loads. For a given quantity of power transmitted, the wire cross-sectional area would be <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the voltage <b>used.</b> Alternatively, the allowable length of a circuit, given a wire size and allowable voltage drop, would increase approximately as the square of the distribution voltage. This meant that fewer, larger generating plants could serve the load in a given area. Large loads, such as industrial motors or converters for electric railway power, could be served by the same distribution network that fed lighting, by using a transformer with a suitable secondary voltage.|$|R
40|$|Highly oscillatory {{integrals}} of {{the form}} I(f) =∫_ 0 ^∞ dx f(x) e^i ω g(x) arise in various problems in dynamics, image analysis, optics, and other fields of physics and mathematics. Conventional approximation methods for such highly oscillatory integrals tend to give huge errors as frequency (ω) →∞. Over years, various {{attempts have been made}} to get over this flaw by considering alternative quadrature methods for integration. One such method was developed by Filon in 1928, which Iserles et al. have recently extended. Using this method, Iserles et al. show that as ω→∞, the error decreases further as the error is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> ω. We <b>use</b> methods developed by Iserles' group, along with others like Newton-Cotes, Clenshaw-Curtis and Levin's methods with the aid of Mathematica. Our aim is to find a systematic way of calculating highly oscillatory integrals. In particular, our focus is on the oscillatory integrals that came up in earlier study of vacuum energy by Dr. Stephen Fulling...|$|R
40|$|Mechanically {{stimulating}} cell-seeded scaffolds by flow-perfusion is {{one approach}} utilized for developing clinically applicable bone graft substitutes. A key challenge is determining {{the magnitude of}} stimuli to apply that enhances cell differentiation but minimizes cell detachment from the scaffold. In this study, we employed a combined computational modeling and experimental approach to examine how the scaffold mean pore size influences cell attachment morphology and subsequently impacts upon cell deformation and detachment when subjected to fluid-flow. Cell detachment from osteoblast-seeded collagen-GAG scaffolds was evaluated experimentally {{across a range of}} scaffold pore sizes subjected to different flow rates and exposure times in a perfusion bioreactor. Cell detachment was found <b>to</b> be <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> flow rate and <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> pore size. <b>Using</b> this data, a theoretical model was derived that accurately predicted cell detachment as a function of mean shear stress, mean pore size, and time. Computational modeling of cell deformation in response to fluid flow showed the percentage of cells exceeding a critical threshold of deformation correlated with cell detachment experimentally and the majority of these cells were of a bridging morphology (cells stretched across pores). These findings will help researchers optimize the mean pore size of scaffolds and perfusion bioreactor operating conditions to manage cell detachment when mechanically simulating cells via flow perfusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{believed}} that restenosis following coronary interventions {{is the result of}} endothelial denudation that leads to thrombus formation, vascular remodeling, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that low power red laser light (LPRLL) irradiation enhances endothelial cell growth in vitro and in vivo and reduces restenosis in a small animal model. The present study investigated the effectiveness of intravascular LPRLL therapy in the reduction of restenosis following stenting in a porcine model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stents were placed in the right coronary artery of domestic cross-bred pigs. After stent deployment, an additional inflation was performed with the laser-balloon. In group I (n = 18) no LPRLL was used; group II (n = 10) received LPRLL dosage of 10 mW for 1 minute; group III (n = 10) received LPRLL dosage of 34 mW for 1 minute. Quantitative coronary analysis of the stented vessel was performed before, immediately after stenting, and at 6 weeks. The pigs were sacrificed and histologic and planimetric analysis conducted. At 6 weeks, minimal luminal stent diameter was significantly narrower in the control group compared to the higher dose group (p < 0. 05), late loss correlated <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> the dose <b>used</b> (r = 0. 9; p < 0. 03), these results were confirmed by morphometric analysis. Neointimal area was also significantly decreased in the higher dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular LPRLL contributes to reduction of angiographic restenosis and hyperplastic reaction in this animal model and seems to be dose dependent. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} common offset, common midpoint (CMP) and borehole vertical (VRP) ground-penetrating radar profiles {{close to the}} margin of Falljökull, a small, steep temperate valley glacier situated in southeast Iceland. Velocity analysis of CMP and VRP surveys provided a four-layered velocity model. This model was verified by comparison between the depths of englacial reflectors and water channels seen in borehole video, and {{from the depths of}} boreholes drilled to the bed. In the absence of sediment within the glacier ice, radar velocity is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> water content. <b>Using</b> mixture models developed by Paren and Looyenga, the variation of water content with depth was determined from the radar velocity profile. At the glacier surface the calculated water content is 0. 23 − 0. 34 % (velocity 0. 166 m ns− 1), which rises sharply to 3. 0 − 4. 1 % (velocity 0. 149 m ns− 1) at 28 m depth, interpreted to be the level of the piezometric surface. Below the piezometric surface the water content drops slowly to 2. 4 − 3. 3 % (velocity 0. 152 m ns− 1) until ∼ 102 m depth where it falls to 0. 09 − 0. 14 % (velocity 0. 167 m ns− 1). The water content of the ice then remains low to the glacier bed at about 112 m. These results suggest storage of a substantial volume of water within the glacier ice, which has significant implications for glacier hydrology, ice rheology and interpretations of both radar and seismic survey...|$|R
5000|$|Oversampling DACs or interpolating DACs {{such as the}} delta-sigma DAC, use a pulse density {{conversion}} technique. The oversampling technique {{allows for}} the use of a lower resolution DAC internally. A simple 1-bit DAC is often chosen because the oversampled result is inherently linear. The DAC is driven with a pulse-density modulated signal, created {{with the use of a}} low-pass filter, step nonlinearity (the actual 1-bit DAC), and negative feedback loop, in a technique called delta-sigma modulation. This results in an effective high-pass filter acting on the quantization (signal processing) noise, thus steering this noise out of the low frequencies of interest into the megahertz frequencies of little interest, which is called noise shaping. The quantization noise at these high frequencies is removed or greatly attenuated by use of an analog low-pass filter at the output (sometimes a simple RC low-pass circuit is sufficient). Most very high resolution DACs (greater than 16 bits) are of this type due to its high linearity and low cost. Higher oversampling rates can relax the specifications of the output low-pass filter and enable further suppression of quantization noise. Speeds of greater than 100 thousand samples per second (for example, 192 kHz) and resolutions of 24 bits are attainable with delta-sigma DACs. A short comparison with pulse-width modulation shows that a 1-bit DAC with a simple first-order integrator would have to run at 3 THz (which is physically unrealizable) to achieve 24 meaningful bits of resolution, requiring a higher-order low-pass filter in the noise-shaping loop. A single integrator is a low-pass filter with a frequency response <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> frequency and <b>using</b> one such integrator in the noise-shaping loop is a first order delta-sigma modulator. Multiple higher order topologies (such as MASH) are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> achieve higher degrees of noise-shaping with a stable topology.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{carried out a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the attenuation properties of the Earth´s crust of the Iberia-Morocco region (IMR). I have investigated the crustal attenuation {{by means of the}} quality factor Q, which is <b>inversely</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> attenuation, <b>using</b> both earthquakes and noise-derived measurements. In order to fulfill the thesis objectives a large dataset including earthquake waveforms and seismic noise records has been used. Three different traditional earthquake methods have been implemented to estimate Q in the IMR: the two-station (TS) method, the coda normalization (CN) method and the spectral amplitude decay (SAD) method. For the estimation of Q, these approaches measure the spectral amplitude of the Lg wave (direct and coda) of regional events. Among all the methods evaluated, the TS method allows imaging the spatial variation of the Lg wave attenuation in the Iberian Peninsula whereas the CN and the SAD methods only estimate average attenuation values as well as its frequency dependence. For the Iberian Peninsula, high Lg Q values are observed in the stable Iberian Massif in western Iberia, while lower values are mainly found in the Pyrenean Range and in eastern and southern Iberia. For Morocco, the CN and the SAD methods produce similar results, indicating that the Lg Q models are robust to differences in the methodologies. The frequency-dependent Q estimates represent an average attenuation across a broad region of different structural domains and correlate well with areas of moderate seismicity. Additionally, I have studied the Lg propagation efficiency across the IMR. Results reflect an inefficient or even blocked propagation across the Gulf of Cádiz and for most paths crossing the western Alboran basin. The continental crust of the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco shows efficient Lg propagation. I have also investigated the potential of using ambient noise measurements to retrieve information about the anelastic structure of the Earth´s crust. Since noise preprocessing techniques modify the amplitude of the recovered empirical Green function of the medium, additional tests have to be done in order to verify the reliability of the attenuation results obtained. In this regard, I have carefully examined the influence of the distribution of noise sources and receivers on Q estimates. Azimuthally and spatially averaged Q values derived from noise recordings were further compared with earthquake attenuation measurements. Results reveal that the average Q estimates are in concordance with previous long-period surface-wave measurements from earthquakes in {{the central part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. Accurate Q estimates are also found in Morocco. I would like to emphasize that this thesis presents new contributions and improvements to the knowledge of the attenuation structure of the IMR. The first regional map that images the lateral variation of the Lg Q has been estimated for the Iberian Peninsula improving the spatial resolution of earlier studies.
