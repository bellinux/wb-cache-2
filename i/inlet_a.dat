25|$|The English {{attacked}} and bombarded {{a small wooden}} fort in the sand dunes; the Spanish there fired only a few shots and fled.

It sat on a strip of sand, separated from the mainland by a band of water, which entered into the <b>inlet.</b> <b>A</b> French Huguenot Nicholas Borgoignon, who had been taken prisoner by the Spanish six years before was found in a boat and agreed to guide the English to the Spanish settlement.|$|E
25|$|Many traditions survive {{from this}} period {{concerning}} figures such as Waitai and Moki II who at different times both lived at Pukekura pa. One {{of the best known}} concerns Tarewai who is difficult to place chronologically but was of Kai Tahu descent. He gained possession of Pukekura, was in conflict with Kati Mamoe at Papanui Inlet and made a famous escape back into Pukekura by a cliff still known as Tarewai's Leap. There had been an argument about Kati Mamoe fishing rights on Papanui <b>Inlet.</b> <b>A</b> particularly fine, talismanic, whale bone fishook of the 18th century was found there and is now in the Otago Museum.|$|E
25|$|Union forces {{continued}} to increase troop presence, and on March 31, 1862, General David Hunter reported that there were fourteen hundred troops on Edisto Island, South Carolina. Hunter had recently replaced Thomas W. Sherman {{in charge of the}} district, which he called the Southern Expedition and was based at Port Royal. Brigadier General Henry Benham devised a plan to strike at Charleston. Confederate General John C. Pemberton had abandoned the mouth of the Stono River, allowing Union forces to land on James Island, South Carolina. Benham's plan was to send one division under Brigadier General Isaac Stevens to Sol Legare Island, South Carolina by way of Stono <b>Inlet.</b> <b>A</b> second division under Brigadier General Horatio Wright would disembark from Edisto Island to Johns Island, across it and on to James Island. In May 1862, Union forces on the island came from 13 units: First Massachusetts Cavalry, Third Rhode Island Infantry, Captain Hamilton's Battery of Artillery, Third New Hampshire Infantry, 45th Pennsylvania Infantry, 55th Pennsylvania Infantry, 76th Pennsylvania Infantry, 97th Pennsylvania Infantry, 6th Connecticut Infantry, 7th Connecticut Infantry, 46th New York Infantry, 47th New York Infantry, and Colonel Small's Engineers. The 55th Pennsylvania was the only regiment to remain when the troops disembarked on June 2 on Hunter's campaign to attack Charlston which failed when the Confederate won a victory in the Battle of Secessionville on nearby James Island on June 16.|$|E

500|$|Several {{locations}} received significant physical impacts. On Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, Bonnie's erosion {{caused an}} inlet to migrate further south. On {{the northern end}} of the <b>inlet,</b> <b>a</b> large sand bar developed, partially due to the storm moving offshore sand. Dune sediments were lost during the storm, exposing boardwalk piling. Similarly, on Topsail Beach, North Carolina, the storm breached 27 sand dunes, destroying 60% of the dune line. Sediment from storm washover measured [...] thick behind the beach. Sections of many eroded dunes were re-built using truck loads of sand. Strong waves ran through the foundation of two stilted homes, both of which were later reinforced to compensate for the lost sand.|$|E

They also say that about these mountains dwell the strange-looking Troglodytes. The Lixites claim that they can run faster than horses. Taking Lixite interpreters with us we sailed alongside the desert in a southerly direction for two days, then towards the rising sun for one more day. We then found {{at the far end of}} an <b>inlet</b> <b>a</b> little island five stades in circumference. We named it Cerne (Some scholars identify Kerne with the Island of Herne (23°50’N) on the coast of the Sahara) and left settlers there. judging by our journey we reckoned that it must be opposite Carthage, since we had to sail the same distance from Carthage to the Pillars of Hercules as from the Pillars of Hercules to Cerne." ...|$|E
2500|$|The boiler resembled two {{elongated}} marine Yarrow boilers, placed end to end. Both had {{the usual}} Yarrow arrangement {{of a central}} large steam drum above two separated water drums, linked by four rows of slightly curved tubes. The upper drum was shared, but the lower water drums were separate. The rearward [...] "firebox" [...] area was wide and spanned the frames, placing the water drums at {{the limits of the}} loading gauge. The forward [...] "boiler" [...] region was narrow-set, with its water drums placed between the frames. Although the outer casings were of similar width, the tube banks for the forward section were much closer. The space outboard of the tubes formed a pair of exhaust flues leading forwards. A large space outside these flue walls but inside the boiler casing was used as an air duct from the air <b>inlet,</b> <b>a</b> crude rectangular slot beneath the smokebox door, which had the effect of both pre-heating the combustion air and of cooling the outer casing to prevent overheating. Longitudinal superheater tubes were placed in the central space between the steam generating tubes. The third area forwards contained superheater headers, the regulators and the smokebox, but no deliberate heating surface. The external boiler casing remained at much the same width throughout, giving an overall triangular, but curved, appearance. The lower edge of each section stepped upwards, and was obvious externally.|$|E
