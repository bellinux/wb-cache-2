Unlike the winning field-sequential color system by CBS, the line sequential CTI system was all-electronic with no color scanning disk, and fully compatible with existing black and white receivers. Unlike the <b>dot</b> <b>sequential</b> RCA system, it used only one scanning tube in the camera and one picture tube in the receiver. CTI's camera used three lenses, behind which were mounted red, blue, and green color filters that produced three images side by side on a single scanning tube. At the receiver, the three images were received on three separate areas of a picture tube, each area treated with different phosphorescent compounds that glowed in red, blue, or green. Superimposing lenses were used to merge the separate images into a single color image on a rear projection screen in the television set.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{majority}} of the power consumption of a high-throughput LDPC decoder is spent on memory. Unlike in a gen-eral-purpose processor, the memory access in an LDPC decoder is deterministic and the access window is short. We {{take advantage of the}} unique memory access characteristic to design a non-refresh eDRAM that holds data for the necessary access window, and fur-ther improve its access time by trading off the excess retention time. The resulting 3 T eDRAM cell is designed to balance wordline cou-pling to reliably retain data for a fast access. We integrate 32 5 x 210 non-refresh eDRAM arrays in a row-parallel LDPC decoder suit-able for the IEEE 802. 11 ad standard. Memory refresh is eliminated and random access is replaced with a simple <b>sequential</b> <b>addressing.</b> With row merging and dual-frame processing, the 1. 6 mm 2 65 nm LDPC decoder chip achieves a peak throughput of 9 Gb/s at 89. 5 pJ/b, of which only 21 % is spent on eDRAMs. With voltage and frequency scaling, the power consumption of the LDPC decoder is reduced to 37. 7 mW for a 1. 5 Gb/s throughput at 35. 6 pJ/b.

In achieving these goals, a significant sacrifice {{has been made}} in DRAM’s operational complexity. To realize good performance, systems must properly manage the significant number of structural and timing restrictions of the DRAM devices. DRAM’s use is further complicated in many-core systems where the memory interface is shared among multiple cores/threads competing for memory bandwidth. The use of the “Page-mode ” feature of DRAM devices can mitigate many DRAM constraints. Current open-page policies attempt to garner the highest level of page hits. In an effort to achieve this, such greedy schemes map <b>sequential</b> <b>address</b> sequences to a single DRAM resource. This non-uniform resource usage pattern introduces high levels of conflict when multiple workloads in a many-core system map to the same set of resources. In this paper we present a scheme that provides a careful balance between the benefits (increased performance and decreased power), and the detractors (unfairness) of page-mode accesses. In our Minimalist approach, we target“just enough ” page-mode accesses to garner page-mode benefits, avoiding system unfairness.

As a result, we propose an efficient discontinuity prefetching scheme that can be effectively combined with traditional <b>sequential</b> prefetching to <b>address</b> all forms of instruction cache misses.

As a solution, we propose a scheme that does not install prefetches into the L 2 cache unless they are proven to be useful. Overall, we demonstrate that the combination of our proposed schemes is successful in reducing the instruction miss rate to only 10 %- 16 % of the original miss rate and results in a 1. 08 X- 1. 37 X performance improvement for the applications studied. ...|$|R
