25|$|Using depth electrodes, {{the local}} <b>field</b> <b>potential</b> gives {{a measure of}} a neural {{population}} in a sphere with a radius of 0.5–3mm around {{the tip of the}} electrode. With a sufficiently high sampling rate (more than about 10kHz), depth electrodes can also measure action potentials. In which case the spatial resolution is down to individual neurons, and the field of view of an individual electrode is approximately 0.05-0.35mm.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have checked}} the BOLD signal against both signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local <b>field</b> <b>potential,</b> which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons. In humans, electrodes can be implanted only {{in patients who}} need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship {{at least for the}} auditory cortex and the primary visual cortex. Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the pulvinar nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei. In the rat brain, single-whisker touch has been shown to elicit BOLD signals from the somatosensory cortex.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} neurons can also {{generate}} oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up (constructive interference). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which {{gives rise to}} large-amplitude oscillations of the local <b>field</b> <b>potential.</b> These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far {{too small to be}} picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of large-scale oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page). Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory interneurons {{play an important role in}} producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.|$|E
40|$|Local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> (LFPs) are {{a common}} measure of the {{neuronal}} population activity. However, their origins are not yet fully understood. A recent in vitro study has shown that even single spikes emitted by an interneuron can trigger detectable unitary <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> in extracel-lular medium [1]. Their contributions can be addition-ally amplified due to strong spatial correlations in interneuronal firing [2]. Nevertheless, inhibitory activity in vivo is strongly correlated with the excitatory poten-tials leading to effective cancellations of generated <b>field</b> <b>potentials.</b> As a result, the unitary <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> induced by interneuronal spikes {{can not be separated}} from background activity.

40|$|To {{investigate}} possible cross-modal {{reorganization of}} the primary auditory cortex (field A 1) in congenitally deaf cats, after years of auditory deprivation, multiunit activity and local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> were recorded in lightly anesthetized animals and compared with responses obtained in hearing cats. Local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> were also used for current source-density analyses. For visual stimulation, phase-reversal gratings of three to five different spatial frequencies and three to five different orientations were presented {{at the point of}} central vision. Peripheral visual field was tested using hand-held stimuli (light bar-shaped stimulus of different orientations, moved in different directions and flashed) typically used for neurophysiological characterization of visual fields. From 200 multiunit recordings, no response to visual stimuli could be found in A 1 of any of the investigated animals. Using the current source-density analysis of local <b>field</b> <b>potentials,</b> no local generators of <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> could be found within A 1, despite of the presence of small local <b>field</b> <b>potentials.</b> No multiunit responses to somatosensory stimulation (whiskers, face, pinna, head, neck, all paws, back, tail) could be obtained.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is aimed at}} characterizing the development of ON and OFF visually evoked responses in the rat superior colliculus from postnatal day 13 (P 13) to postnatal day 25. Depth profiles of <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> reveal that ON and OFF long latency biphasic <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> are already present when collicular cells are first responsive to light (P 13).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between changes in functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and neuronal activity remains controversial. Data collected during awake neurosurgical procedures for the treatment of epilepsy provided a rare opportunity to examine this relationship in human temporal association cortex. We obtained {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} blood oxygen dependent signals, single neuronal activity and local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> from 8 to 300 Hz at 13 temporal cortical sites, from nine subjects, during paired associate learning and control measures. The relation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal and the electrophysiologic parameters was assessed in two ways: colocalization between significant changes in these signals on the same paired associate-control comparisons and multiple linear regressions of the electrophysiologic measures on the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal, across all tasks. Significant colocalization was present between increased functional magnetic resonance imaging signals and increased local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> power in the 50 – 250 Hz range. Local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> power greater than 100 Hz was also a significant regressor for the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal, establishing this local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> frequency range as a neuronal correlate of the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. There was a trend for a relation between power in some low frequency local <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> frequencies and the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal, for 8 – 15 Hz increases in the colocalization analysis and 16 – 23 Hz in the multiple linear regression analysis.

Cluster analysis of spatially distributed inhibitory field events let us separate events generated by interneurones terminating on distinct zones of somato-dendritic axis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} differences in the effects of presynaptic inhibition of transmission from group II muscle afferents to neurones in the dorsal horn and in the intermediate zone and the consequences of these differences for reflex actions of group II afferents upon α-motoneurones. The degree of presynaptic inhibition was estimated from the degree of depression of monosynaptic components of population EPSPs (<b>field</b> <b>potentials)</b> evoked by group II muscle afferents in deeply anaesthetized cats. The decrease in the area of <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> was considerably larger and longer lasting in the intermediate zone, where they were often obliterated, than in the dorsal horn, where they were reduced to about two-thirds. Presynaptic inhibition of <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> evoked by other afferents at the same locations was much weaker. Intracellular records from α-motoneurones revealed that short latency EPSPs and IPSPs evoked from group II afferents are considerably reduced by conditioning stimuli that effectively depress intermediate zone <b>field</b> <b>potentials</b> of group II origin. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that strong presynaptic inhibition of transmission to intermediate zone interneurones allows a selective depression of disynaptic actions of group II muscle afferents on α- and γ-motoneurones, mediated by these interneurones, and favours polysynaptic actions of these afferents...|$|R
