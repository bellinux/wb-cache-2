5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E

5|$|Como died in {{his sleep}} on May 12, 2001, {{at his home in}} Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could not agree on their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will and it became a matter for the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward's Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, Roselle are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta (Palm Beach County), Florida.|$|E
5|$|Voracious and {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, the blotchy swellshark {{is known}} to consume numerous types of fishes and invertebrates, including an unusually high diversity of cartilaginous fishes. Like other Cephaloscyllium species, {{it is capable of}} rapidly inflating its body as a defense against predators. This species is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs two at a time. There is no well-defined breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. The eggs hatch after approximately one year. The blotchy swellshark is harmless and fares well in captivity. It is caught as bycatch in commercial bottom trawls, though its population does not seem to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> fishing activity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of quartz to {{represent}} the iris of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the quartz iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost her left eye, though {{the presence of an}} iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E

5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of their trial she {{remained}} calm, complaining through her lawyers alleged disrespect for the flag while it was being produced as evidence. She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> mental instability while committing the deed. On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet {{at the beginning of the}} hearing, but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to Biologist in June 2001, British teacher and Chartered Biologist Paul Spiring speculated that Merrick might <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> a {{combination}} of the two syndromes. This hypothesis was reported by Robert Matthews, a correspondent for The Sunday Telegraph. The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled The Curse of The Elephant Man that was produced for the Discovery Health Channel by Natural History New Zealand. During 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a BBC appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took DNA samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition. During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA that was extracted from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that Charles Darwin might <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> Chagas disease {{as a result}} of a bite of the so-called great black bug of the Pampas (vinchuca) (see Charles Darwin's illness). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of the Voyage of the Beagle as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the Andes near Mendoza. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near Valparaiso, but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of symptoms, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at Westminster Abbey by using modern PCR techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's curator.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{also has}} a history of success in ice hockey {{including}} four State Championships (1947, 1953, 1955, 1963), three second-place finishes, and three third-place finishes in 22 State Tournament appearances. Johnson was the only Twin Cities high school to win the Minnesota high school boys' hockey tournament for the first 25 years. Herb Brooks, who coached the Miracle on Ice gold medal winning team, played on the school's 1955 state championship winning team. Brooks' number five jersey was retired following his death in 2003. During the 1950s students shoveled off parts of Lake Phalen because there were no enclosed ice arenas. Most of the bantam hockey team players from the East Side attend either Johnson or Hill-Murray School. During the 1950s and 1960s Johnson was considered a feeder school for the University of Minnesota's ice hockey team. Recently the school's teams <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> lack of enrollment in the sports teams. Johnson is along with Como Park the only Saint Paul City Conference school to field a hockey team.|$|E
5|$|The 3D version opened Friday, August 25, 2017, across 371 theaters (or 463 3D auditoriums), earning $552,773 in {{its opening}} weekend, {{averaging}} $1,490 per screen; this {{was considered an}} amount lower than what other '80's and '90's re-releases earned in their respective opening weekends such as Top Gun ($1.9 million, which also played in IMAX), Raiders of the Lost Ark ($1.6 million), {{as well as more}} high-profile reissues of Titanic, The Lion King and Jurassic Park over the last several years. During its opening weekend, Titanic 3D grossed $17.3 million in 2,674 theaters, averaging $6,464 in April 2012. While not major contributing factors, the release performance of the film is thought to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> coinciding with Hurricane Harvey, which eased moviegoing admissions {{in many parts of the}} country, the much anticipated boxing fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor, the season 7 finale of Game of Thrones, and by Cameron's decision to release his original 1991 theatrical cut instead of the widely popular extended edition, and his controversial comments regarding the Wonder Woman film.|$|E

5|$|Born in Kirkheaton, Hirst first {{achieved}} {{success for}} Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting {{developed at the}} expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball swing in the air after he released it. He {{was one of the first}} bowlers to control the swing of the ball; batsmen found it very difficult to counter this method and Hirst's bowling was subsequently far more successful. From 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against Leicestershire—still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015—and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire and he may <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> playing in Australia where playing conditions did not suit him.|$|E
5|$|In 1519 and 1520, {{before the}} arrival of the Spanish in the region, a number of {{epidemics}} swept through southern Guatemala. At {{the same time as the}} Spanish were occupied with the overthrow of the Aztec empire, a devastating plague struck the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche, and the city of Q'umarkaj, capital of the K'iche', may also <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> the same epidemic. It is likely that the same combination of smallpox and a pulmonary plague swept across the entire Guatemalan Highlands. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% of the population of the highlands perished. Population levels in the Guatemalan Highlands did not recover to their pre-conquest levels until the middle of the 20th century. In 1666 pestilence or murine typhus swept through what is now the department of Huehuetenango. Smallpox was reported in San Pedro Saloma, in 1795. At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.|$|E
5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E
