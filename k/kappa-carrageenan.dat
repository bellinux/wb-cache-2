A succinate diester spacer {{was used to}} covalently couple AZT onto <b>kappa-carrageenan,</b> resulting in a tripartite prodrug. Two methods (UV and radioactive counting) are described and validated to determine the AZT loading onto the <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> carrier.

A threshold of AZT loaded onto the <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> was required to achieve this synergistic effect. Such kappa-carrageenan-AZT conjugates could be of great therapeutic interest because these conjugates, which contain a low AZT concentration, present improved anti-HIV activities relative to free AZT.

40|$|Complexes of {{polyelectrolyte}} gels with oppositely charged surfactants form ordered polymer matrices {{with unique}} structure properties, {{which can be}} used in a wide range of medical, chemical and physical applications. Ordered matrices made of natural components are of special interest for medical and biological purposes. In the present study, self-organised complexes of native iota- and <b>kappa-carrageenans</b> formed with oppositely charged cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are prepared and structurally characterised using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Starting from the molar ratio CPC/(charge of carrrageenan) of 0. 2, the carrageenan gel shrinks and ordered motifs in its internal structure are formed. The internal order in the sample is reflected by the Bragg peaks in the scattering patterns which permit to compute periodicity and characteristic sizes of the ordered regions. Moreover, strong central scattering appears and the calculated fractal dimensions indicate that these regions are organised in well defined clusters. The periodicity of the ordered motifs computed from the Bragg peaks in the scattering patterns corresponds to the width of the surfactant bilayer (about 4. 0 nm) for all the complexes. The crystallite size ranges from 25 nm to 40 nm depending on the type of carrageenan and on the amount of CPC. A model of the ordered fragments is proposed whereby the carrageenan/surfactant bilayers are regularly packed at the walls of hollow cylindric clusters with the outer radius of about 8 nm and height 40 nm. More detailed ab initio models indicate that these particles are formed by bent worm-like substructures with the cross-section coinciding to the thickness of the carrageenan/CPC bilayer.

Drug release was assessed in vitro by a standardized paddle-dissolution test and in vivo by a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in dogs. Mean dissolution time (MDT) was 78. 2 +/- 3. 5 h from MCC pellets (1301 +/- 301 microm) and 6. 1 +/- 0. 7 min from <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> pellets (966 +/- 136 microm). In contrast to <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> pellets, MCC pellets did not disintegrate and showed a diffusion-controlled drug release. In line with the in vitro findings, the darunavir peak plasma levels and exposure after the administration of a 300 mg dose were more than 60 -fold higher when formulated with <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> pellets when compared with MCC pellets, and 10 -fold higher after co-administration with 10 mg/kg of ritonavir. The relative bioavailability of darunavir versus the reference tablet (F(rel)) was 155 % with <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> pellets and 2 % with MCC pellets without ritonavir, while 78 % and 9 %, respectively, in presence of ritonavir.

40|$|International audienceThe carrageenan-induced {{stabilization}} and gelation of ultra-high-temperature-treated milk was studied during long storage. Severe heating (causing increased protein denaturation), lowering of the pH, {{or the use}} of <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> (instead of <b>kappa-carrageenan)</b> led to excessive gelation. It is suggested that the balance between carrageenan-carrageenan interactions and carrageenan-protein interactions determines the gel strength. If the interactions between carrageenan and proteins are decreased, more carrageenan is available for carrageenan-carrageenan interactions, leading to a stronger gel. This is the case if <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> is used instead of <b>kappa-carrageenan</b> because the former forms weaker interactions with proteins than the latter. Also, heating and pH influence the attachment of whey proteins to the casein micelle surface, hindering the attachment of carrageenan to the casein proteins. Upon storage, gel strength increased. Particle size and rheology measurements indicated that upon storage, tenuous carrageenan-protein aggregates are formed.
