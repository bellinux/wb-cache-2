5|$|In 1206 William was {{in charge}} of the naval forces in the Cinque Ports and {{commanded}} the fleet that invaded Poitou. Whether he accompanied the fleet or stayed in England after it sailed is unclear; according to two historians– F. W. Brooks and R. W. Powell– it is more likely he stayed. From 1206 until 1215 he was effectively commander of King John's navy, and helped to develop Portsmouth as a royal dockyard. In 1208 William was put in charge of ensuring that no ships sailed without royal permission. That year he also oversaw the naval preparations made by the Cinque Ports. The purpose of these preparations is unknown; the Annals of Dunstable ascribe to John a desire to oppress the Cinque Ports. During May 1208 a royal order was issued that William's deputies in all the seaports should seize any ships in the ports that were from foreign countries, excluding Denmark, Norway and other countries that did not oppose John's diplomatic efforts. A gap in the governmental records does not allow a <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of William's activities for the next years, until 1212, when William is shown performing many of the same duties as earlier. He {{was in charge}} of repair of some ships and the construction of a large new ship, named the Deulabenit, owned by the king. William was also responsible for impressing privately owned merchant ships into royal service. These ships were used in the naval action of the Battle of Damme at Zwyn in 1213, when a fleet under William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, destroyed a substantial French naval force and sacked the town of Damme.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to model the {{distribution}} of galaxies with a fractal pattern was made by Luciano Pietronero and his team in 1987, and a more <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of the universe’s large-scale structure emerged over the following decade, {{as the number of}} cataloged galaxies grew larger. Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite fractal aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a fractal dimension of about 2. The fractal dimension of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the fractal dimension for a fractal surface is between 2 and 3. The ultimate significance of this result is not immediately apparent, but it seems to indicate that both randomness and hierarchal structuring are at work on the scale of galaxy clusters and larger.|$|E
25|$|Seismologists can use {{the arrival}} times of seismic waves in reverse to image the {{interior}} of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances {{led to the development of}} a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of {{the interior of the}} Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.|$|E
25|$|In its mature version, Vico's {{conception}} of sensus communis {{is defined by}} him as “judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race”. Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon and Grotius. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, {{is to find the}} common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss Natural Law, improving upon Grotius, John Selden, and Pufendorf who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them. This is comparable to both Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws, as well as much later Hegelian historicism, both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.|$|E

25|$|The University of Ottawa’s co-op {{program is}} {{available}} {{for a wide range}} of programs for undergraduate students. Co-operative programs are offered in English and in French for certain programs. There are various programs offered in the following faculties: arts, social sciences, engineering, science and law. The faculty of arts offers the option of co-op for the following programs: communications, lettres Français, English, environmental studies, geography, history, and translation, along with the option of combining two programs in cases where a student is completing a joint honours program (i.e. sociology and communications). The faculty of social sciences offers co-op options for the following programs: anthropology, sociology, human rights, conflict studies, economics, political science, international development and globalization, public policy, and public administration. In the faculties of arts and social sciences, work terms usually begin in the second summer of a student’s studies (where a student is done second year and entering third) with the exception of the translation program where the first work term begins the summer before a student’s fourth year. Each program offers specific conditions that a student must meet in order to participate in his or her placement. For the science and engineering faculties, the co-op programs offered are: chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, software engineering, other various engineering programs, biomedical science, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, earth sciences, physics, environmental science, statistics, and other various science programs. All the engineering programs offered at the University of Ottawa begin during the summer before a student’s third year. However, the science faculty’s programs offer different starting points for the different programs mentioned above. The University of Ottawa’s co-op’s page offers a more <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> on these starting points. The faculty of law offers a co-op program for civil law in French. The requirements consist of the same general requirements for acceptance and maintaining a position in the program.|$|E

500|$|The {{surviving}} police {{files on}} the Whitechapel murders allow a <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of investigative procedure in the Victorian era. A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced, and either examined more closely or {{eliminated from the}} inquiry. Modern police work follows the same pattern. More than 2,000 people were interviewed, [...] "upwards of 300" [...] people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.|$|E
500|$|On 16 July 2015, a {{group of}} Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers began {{meetings}} to study the feasibility of raising the ship from the ocean floor and recovering the remains of crewmembers entombed in the wreckage.

In May 2016, the wreckage was surveyed using digital technology, giving a more <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> and confirming the earlier identification. The resulting video revealed many details such as the chrysanthemum crest on the bow, the massive propeller, and the detached main gun turret. The nine-minute video of this survey is being shown at the Yamato Museum in Kure.|$|E
500|$|Although Mr. Dooley {{would become}} {{famous for his}} {{commentary}} on national affairs, the columns of the first years were generally more local in scope. Through the lips of Dooley, Dunne built a <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of Bridgeport, a vibrant community with its own idiosyncrasies and with important local figures. According to historian Charles Fanning, this made Bridgeport [...] "the most solidly realized ethnic neighborhood in nineteenth-century American literature". In the first year, {{less than half of}} the columns were political in nature, but this proportion increased as Dunne used Dooley as a weapon for reform of the corrupt city council; according to Dunne's biographer, Elmer Ellis, [...] "over the eight years from 1892 to 1900 there was no single force for improvement more important than the Dooley essays". Dunne depicted Bridgeport as a community whose Irish nature is on the verge of dissolution as other ethnic groups move in, an evolution to which Dooley reacts in various ways ranging from resignation to near-panic.|$|E

500|$|Minority Report is {{a futuristic}} film which portrays {{elements}} of a both dystopian and utopian future. The movie renders a much more <b>detailed</b> <b>view</b> of its future world than the book, and contains new technologies not in Dick's story. From a stylistic standpoint, Minority Report resembles Spielberg's previous film A.I., but also incorporates elements of film noir. Spielberg said that he [...] "wanted to give the movie a noir feel. So I threw myself a film festival. Asphalt Jungle. Key Largo. The Maltese Falcon." [...] The picture was deliberately overlit, and the negative was bleach-bypassed during post-production. The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son's kidnapping at the pool {{is the only one}} shot in [...] "normal" [...] color. Bleach-bypassing gave the film a distinctive look; it desaturated the film's colors, {{to the point that it}} nearly resembles a black-and-white movie, yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture. The color was reduced by [...] "about 40%" [...] to achieve the [...] "washed-out" [...] appearance. Elvis Mitchell, formerly of The New York Times, commented that [...] "he picture looks as if it were shot on chrome, caught on the fleeing bumper of a late '70s car." ...|$|E

2500|$|A more <b>detailed</b> <b>view,</b> {{popularized by}} R.

The Ford GPW abbreviation actually meant G for government use, P to designate its [...] wheelbase and W to indicate its Willys-Overland designed engine. Ermey suggests that soldiers at the time were so impressed with the new vehicles that they informally named it after Eugene the Jeep, a character in the Thimble Theatre comic strip and cartoons created by E. C. Segar, as early as mid-March 1936. Eugene the Jeep was Popeye's [...] "jungle pet" [...] and was [...] "small, able to move between dimensions and could solve seemingly impossible problems." ...|$|E
