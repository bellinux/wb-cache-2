5|$|German {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in North America in the mid-seventeenth century. They were particularly attracted by William Penn's promise {{of religious freedom}} in the colony of Pennsylvania, {{and came to the}} Philadelphia region in significant numbers. By 1683, the German population was large enough to form communities such as Germantown (now a neighborhood in Philadelphia). Many of these immigrants brought with them their Lutheran faith and formed congregations <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> homeland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Houston began playing <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> arena, the Toyota Center, and redesigned their uniforms and logo, as long-time coach Tomjanovich resigned after {{being diagnosed with}} bladder cancer, {{and was replaced by}} Jeff Van Gundy. The Rockets finished the regular season with a record of 45–37, and earned their first playoff berth since 1999, but the Lakers again handed the Rockets a loss in the first round.|$|E

5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E

5|$|After {{the attackers}} crossed the Norwegian {{coastline}} at 3:40pm, two Beaufighters from No.144 and No.489 Squadrons detached {{themselves from the}} main force and pressed ahead as outriders. The two 'outriders' crossed Førde Fjord near where the German ships had been sighted that morning. At 3:50pm they sent Milson a radio message stating {{that they could not}} see the ships. The 'outriders' then turned to the east and overflew the town of Førde before searching the next fjord to the north; during their flight near Førde Fjord they did not spot the German warships <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> position. Meanwhile, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were scrambled from Herdla at 3:50pm and ordered to attack the Dallachy Wing and its escorts.|$|E
5|$|After their modernization, both ships {{participated in}} the normal {{activities}} of the fleet, including fleet problem exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after {{the beginning of the}} Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor sank Arizona in a tremendous explosion and slightly damaged Pennsylvania, which was in dry dock at the time.

5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> homeland.|$|E
5|$|Bryn Terfel {{started off}} with a short speech and {{introduced}} the Wales Millennium Centre singers and dancers, who in hard hats and donkey jackets sang and danced {{the story of the}} construction of the building. They were later joined by all 322 participants in a chorus, including Gwyn Hughes Jones, Bryn Terfel and Dennis O'Neill sang a duet from Pearl Fishers. Diversions performed a new ballet based on one of Alun Hoddinott's works. The Welsh National Opera performed the final scene of Beethoven's Fidelio <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> home. The evening ranged across all musical types from popular to classical.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{distributed}} worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 {{are distributed}} across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly {{is native to}} the Americas, but {{in the nineteenth century}} or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.|$|E

NBC president Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also turned on the game, which was expected to be exciting, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>New</b> York area homes. The Buffalo Bills–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a network doubleheader, was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> guise.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E
