In her enlightening article, full of witty insights, she argues that the notion “Balkan” belongs equally to history and to imagination.

40|$|Response to Townsend et al. | Korf {{radiological}} {{findings indicate}} disease {{that is currently}} present, whereas incidental genomic findings indicate disease that may some day be present. In fact, some of the radiological incidental findings do not diagnose disease; some are false positives {{that could lead to}} unnecessary invasive procedures. The time to discuss such incidental findings in radiology is when the clinician receives the radiology report, and is able to interpret the report in light of the patient’s clinical status, personality, and life experience. I posit that {{the same is true for}} genomic incidental findings, recognizing that the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations apply to a very narrow list of highly penetrant, well-annotated, and medically actionable findings. Townsend et al. 1 also raised the point that the working group did not seek input from consumers (patients). This possibility was considered, but it was difficult to know who actually speaks for the general public on this issue. We ultimately decided to begin the discussion with input from scientific and medical experts, realizing that the recommendations would serve as a reference point for many perspectives. Townsend et al. 1 suggest that the recommendations be withdrawn and revised. I do not believe that they should be withdrawn, but as we stated in the report, I anticipate that they will be refined and revised in response to additional input and evidence. I especially agree with them that further research on patient perspectives and decision making should be encouraged. The working group felt, however, that genome sequencing <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> now and that some statement was needed to provide a guideline to laboratories and clinicians actively struggling with this question. I hope that the recommendations will come to be seen in that light...|$|E

40|$|Nigeria {{can become}} {{a major force in}} Africa and indeed the world, if proper {{policies}} and structures are in place to entrench good reading culture. The rising population of reluctant readers in this age of information explosion is disturbing. Chinelo (2010) in The Nation Newspaper of May 27 th noted that no society can develop more than the knowledge base of its citizens. He decried the dying culture of reading among children as leaders of tomorrow. This is the pathetic state of the Nigerian society. It is either Nigerians are not reading or if they do, do so reluctantly. Nigeria as a society is composed of the partially-literate, aliterate, and literate avid readers. The partially literates can neither read nor write but have acquired informal education. The literate avid readers are highly motivated individuals who take delight in reading. They read with passion and for pleasure. They naturally love and enjoy reading. Aliterates however, can read but refuse to read and if they read, do so reluctantly. They are uncommitted and occasionally motivated to do so. They lack enthusiasm for reading and always have reasons why they would not read. Aliteracy <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and we cannot run away from this fact. In most Nigerian schools, youths or students are hardly seen around reading except for reasons of test, examination or homework. They are not easily given to reading for the love of doing so. Instead most engage in group discussions or gossip, cracking of jokes, indoor games e. g. cards, cludo, chest etc during free periods. They also use break periods to play football and other outdoor games. Furthermore, students who have access to computers and internet facilities prefer to browse, chat, send email, sms, facebook, yahoo messanger, play computer games. While at home students most times play football, watch Television entertainment programmes such as drama, films, comedies, listening to music, watch dancing competitions and so on in the absence of house hold chores. Occasionally we see isolated cases of students engaged in reading as a recreation. Something must be wrong somewhere A few years back the situation was different. It used to be a thing of pride to be seen reading. Today even the few people who have the advantage of having books to read do not read. There are more than enough activities competing for the little available time to students. In the past, there were more students who took on reading as a hobby than today. A famous quote by Mark Twain states it best: “The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can’t read them. 2 ̆ 2 The purpose of education is to give students every advantage at making a good life for themselves, and one way is {{to take advantage of the}} richness and benefits of reading (The Mark Twain Circle of New York, 1998) ...|$|E

Young, feisty and marginal, the attendance list named participants in alphabetical order and therefore without hierarchy (there were those who would have described such a list as 2 ̆ 2 promiscuous 2 ̆ 2 in its nineteenth-century meaning, of an undiscriminating mixture, even though students 2 ̆ 7 names were marked by the letter 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2). The names on the list now dazzle: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Herma Hill Kay, Janet Benshoof, Carol Bellamy. Five men were there in solidarity and out of shared interests: among them Jack Getman, who would have a distinguished career in labor law, and Leo Kanowitz, who had already written the only monograph on the subject: Women and the Law.
