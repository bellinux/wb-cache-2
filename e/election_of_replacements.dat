50|$|By {{a longstanding}} tradition, the {{dismissal}} of a Patriarch of Jerusalem and the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a <b>replacement</b> requires the approval or recognition of the governments in the regions of the Patriarchate's authority - presently, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Jordan. Jordan had recognized the dismissal by June 2005. Ireneos continued to be recognized by Israel as the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem until December 2007, and Israel continued to invite him to official government functions. As of 20 December 2007, the governments of Jordan and the Palestinian Authority and Israel all now recognise Theophilos III as Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem.|$|R

50|$|In {{the year}} of the Orpington by-election, the Liberals almost succeeded in {{capturing}} Blackpool North, West Derbyshire and Chippenham from the Conservatives and Leicester North East from Labour. Grimond's dynamic and principled leadership proved attractive to many young aspiring politicians, including John Pardoe and three future party leaders, David Steel, Paddy Ashdown and Sir Menzies Campbell. He appealed to all wings of the party and was especially popular with the Young Liberals. In 1967, having led the party through three general elections, he made way for a younger leader, the charismatic Jeremy Thorpe. In 1976, when Thorpe was forced to resign because of a scandal, Grimond stepped in as caretaker leader until the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a <b>replacement,</b> David Steel.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} {{reached by}} the Holy Synod of Jerusalem of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre was made final on May 6, 2005 by a two-thirds vote of that body. As far as the Church leaders were concerned, Irenaios ceased to be Patriarch from that point. On 24 May 2005 a special pan-Orthodox Conference was convened in Constantinople (Istanbul) to review {{the decisions of the}} Holy Synod of Jerusalem. The pan-Orthodox Conference under the presidency of the Ecumenical Patriarch voted overwhelmingly to confirm the decision of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulcher and to strike Irenaios' name from the diptychs. On 30 May, the Synod of Jerusalem chose Metropolitan Cornelius of Petra to serve as locum tenens pending the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a <b>replacement</b> for Irenaios.|$|R

50|$|However {{according}} to British political theory {{the assembly of}} Irish MPs in Dublin did not constitute a valid parliament and was subsequently declared illegal. Under British theory, legal government remained vested in His Majesty's Government in Westminster, and its Irish executive, under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland based in Dublin Castle. In 1920 the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was enacted, which created in 1921 two Irish parliaments; one for Northern Ireland in Belfast and one for Southern Ireland, which was called to assemble in Royal College of Science in Dublin. The uncontested elections in Southern Ireland produced the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, though when the new house was called to assemble, only four MPs turned up. The rest assembled as the illegal Second Dáil. Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Westminster parliament passed the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 which provided for dissolution of the Parliament of Southern Ireland and the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a <b>replacement</b> parliament to which the Provisional Government would be responsible.|$|R

Already in 1862, Mocioni, Șaguna, and Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi had managed to obtain Franz Joseph's sympathy on this issue. He wrote about this victory in Telegraful Român of Transylvania and Concordia of Bukovina, persuading [...] "right-believing Romanians" [...] {{not to participate in}} the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a Rajačić <b>replacement.</b> Nevertheless, Mocioni was disappointed with Șaguna, who did not back his plan for creating a new bishopric at Temeschwar.

50|$|The patriarchate was {{recently}} {{involved in a}} significant controversy. Patriarch Irenaios, elected in 2001, was deposed, on decisions of the Holy Synod of Jerusalem, {{in the aftermath of}} a scandal involving the sale of church land in East Jerusalem to Israeli investors. The move enraged many Eastern Orthodox Palestinian members, since the land was in an area that most Palestinians hoped would someday become part of a Palestinian state. On May 24, 2005 a special Pan-Orthodox Synod was convened in Constantinople (İstanbul) to review the decisions of the Holy Synod of Jerusalem. The Pan-Orthodox Synod under the presidency of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, voted overwhelmingly to confirm the decision of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre and to strike Irenaios' name from the diptychs, and on May 30, Jerusalem's Holy Synod chose Metropolitan Cornelius of Petra to serve as locum tenens pending the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a <b>replacement</b> for Irenaios. On August 22, 2005, the Holy Synod of the Church of Jerusalem unanimously elected Theophilos, the former Archbishop of Tabor, as the 141st Patriarch of Jerusalem.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{findings}} of the report and Masuzoe's admission, public discontent continued to rise {{in the first half of}} June 2016, with at least 70 per cent of Tokyo residents seeking his resignation. Masuzoe lost the support of his former backers, the LDP and Komeito parties, as they feared negative consequences in the national House <b>of</b> Councillors <b>election</b> to be held on 10 July and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election the following year. On the afternoon of 15 June 2016, a no-confidence motion jointly submitted by all parties, including the LDP and Komeito, was to be voted upon in the Metropolitan Assembly. Despite publicly stating his refusal to step down the previous day, citing more time for public consideration, Masuzoe ultimately submitted his resignation effective 21 June to assembly president Shigeo Kawai on the morning of 15 June 2016. Another reason Masuzoe gave for seeking to delay his resignation was the pending Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil, which he was scheduled to attend as the representative of Tokyo, the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics. If the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> his <b>replacement</b> is held in July 2016, then the subsequent election will happen in July 2020, in the middle of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.|$|R
50|$|During the American Civil War, Tift was a Captain in the Confederate States Navy supply department. Tift built gunboats for the Confederate {{navy and}} {{supplied}} the Rebel army with beef and hardtack produced by his factories at Albany and at nearby Palmyra in Lee County. After the war ended, {{he was elected}} to the 40th United States Congress as a U.S. Representative with the Democratic Party and served from July 25, 1868, until March 3, 1869. He was not permitted to qualify for re-election in 1868 and unsuccessfully contested the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> his <b>replacement,</b> Richard H. Whiteley. After his congressional service, Tift worked in various businesses. He served as a delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1877. He died in Albany on November 21, 1891 and was buried in that city's Oakview Cemetery. Tift County, Georgia, was named in his honor but in March 2013 the Georgia Legislature voted to adopt a resolution written by Edd Dorminey of Tifton, Georgia naming Tift County after its founder (and Nelson Tift's nephew), Henry Harding (H.H.) Tift. Because H.H. Tift was living in 1905 when Tift County was founded, the county could not be named after him. Wanting the county to honor the Tifts, the delegates chose Nelson Tift as he was deceased.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of foreign aid on {{governance}} in order to extend the debate on foreign aid and to verify common positions from Moyo’s ‘Dead Aid’, Collier’s ‘Bottom Billion’ and Eubank’s ‘Somaliland’. The empirical evidence is based on updated data from 52 African countries for the period 1996 – 2010. An endogeneity robust instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares empirical strategy is employed. The findings reveal that development assistance deteriorates economic (regulation quality and government effectiveness) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance, but has an insignificant effect on political (political stability, voice and accountability) governance. While, these findings are broadly in accordance with Moyo and Collier on weak governance, they neither confirm the Eubank position on political governance nor the Asongu stance on the aid-corruption nexus in a debate with Okada and Samreth. The use of foreign aid as an instrument to influence the <b>election</b> and <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> political leaders in Africa may have insignificant results. It is time to solve the second tragedy of foreign aid and that economists and policy makers start rethinking the models and theories on which foreign aid is used to influence economic, institutional and political governance in recipient countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stiff {{frame was}} the {{important}} structural member in construction <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> closure segment for prestressed concrete cable-stayed bridges. To establish the design calculation method {{of it and}} reveal its variation of internal forces with construction stages <b>of</b> <b>replacement,</b> some configurations and its working process of stiff frame was introduced. Based on construction stage analysis <b>of</b> <b>replacement,</b> calculation methods <b>of</b> its strength and stability were given. Through FEM results, influence of stiff frame to structural dynamic property and global stability of whole bridge were described. Analysis results showed, it was appropriate to consider each section steel of stiff frame as eccentric compression member. During construction, the transversal global property of stiff frame and the security of its link with main girder must be valued. Construction results also proved, the theoretical calculation method could reflect the actual structural state of stiff frame, and its result was conservative. Analysis on stiff frame was an important part <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> closure segment, and could provide ways and references for construction control <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> closure segment...|$|R
