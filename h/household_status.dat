40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the question, “does market work improve women's <b>household</b> <b>status</b> in rural China?” using survey data {{of men and}} women working in Township and Village Enterprises in rural Jiangsu and Shandong. This paper measures <b>household</b> <b>status</b> by domestic labor time, responsibility for domestic tasks, and household decision-making control. It finds that women have lower <b>household</b> <b>status</b> than men, using these three indicators. Based upon regression results, this paper concludes that for women market wages reduce domestic work time and responsibility for domestic tasks but market hours do not. The nature of bargaining warrants further research since the evidence that financial resources contribute to increased household decision-making control is mixed. Should employment opportunities for women increase with China's membership in the WTO, improvements in women's <b>household</b> <b>status</b> will depend upon their wages and the gender wage gap.

30|$|In {{addition}} to residential areas, <b>household</b> registration <b>status</b> {{can also be}} used to determine urban/rural areas. This study used residential area to distinguish rural from urban for two main reasons. First, migrants from rural to urban areas differ systematically from the left-behind, and their concepts of marriage and childbearing may change because of their urban experiences. Thus, merging them with those who remain in rural areas may not be appropriate. Second, defining urban/rural according to household registration can bring ambiguities in the operationalization because the husband and wife may each have a different <b>household</b> registration <b>status.</b> For couples living in two separate places, especially people who have been divorced, we only have information from the individual answering the questionnaire, which makes it difficult to operationalize. In order to test sensitivity, we also repeated the analysis by using <b>household</b> registration <b>status</b> to distinguish rural from urban and found that the results are consistent.|$|R

40|$|Spousal-residence {{separation}} {{has become}} a serious social problem in China since the Cultural Revolution. Apart from housing shortages, the government's migration control, through the restriction on urban-household registration, is a main contributor to the separation. Based on the microdata of the 1987 National Population Survey, {{we find that the}} variation in spousal-residence separation among Chinese young couples in the mid- 1980 s is well explained by personal and household factors within a multivariate model. The separations were aggravated by migrations for the reasons of employment or education. Although marriage migrations reduced the number of separations, those who had been married {{for a short period of}} time (particularly newlyweds) were more prone to be separated. It is ironic that the higher a person's level of education, the greater the tendency for them to suffer the pain of spousal-residence separation. <b>Household</b> <b>status</b> could also be a very important factor: the lower the <b>household</b> <b>status</b> of a married individual, the more likely that he (or she) would be separated from their spouse...|$|E

We find that, despite increased labor market participation, women’s <b>household</b> <b>status</b> remains acutely depressed. Women laborers, with access to productive assets, however, are effectively reworking gender relations within and outside the household.
