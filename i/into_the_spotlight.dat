After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight,</b> but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} gangster movies of the period.
