5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} {{close to}} Dudley and he, with her blessing {{and on her}} prompting, pursued his suit <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{in an atmosphere of}} diplomatic intrigue. His wife's and his father's shadows haunted his prospects. His efforts leading nowhere, in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth would have none of that and everything remained as it was.|$|E
5|$|Still {{struggling}} with writer's block, Irving traveled to Germany, settling in Dresden {{in the winter}} of 1822. Here he dazzled the royal family and attached himself to Mrs. Amelia Foster, an American living in Dresden with her five children. Irving was particularly attracted to Mrs. Foster's 18-year-old daughter Emily and vied in frustration <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Emily finally refused his offer of marriage in the spring of 1823.|$|E
5|$|When {{she was old}} enough, she {{attended}} social events and soon met a young Jewish man. He asked her father <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage, and the father agreed {{on the condition that}} the man take out life insurance. While Emilia was planning the wedding, her fiancé attended doctor's appointments as part of the insurance underwriting process. There he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and told {{that he did not have}} long to live. The wedding was cancelled, and Baeyertz suffered a breakdown and ill health as a result.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay!" [...] she wailed in an {{extremity}} of terror. Yet {{she rose}} and went towards the door sideways, <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were outstretched in supplication to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'For {{you are a}} good man,' she said; {{looking into}} his face with a smile, which was rather serious <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> <b>'And</b> I do believe have been a better friend to me to-night than ever I have had in all my life.' ...|$|R
50|$|From {{surviving}} copies {{it can be}} deduced that {{apart from}} the actual oak frame there were two other painted on frames, {{one of which was}} lettered with gothic inscription to the top, while a faux stone parapet provided support <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> to rest upon.|$|R
5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Mary was courted by Duke Philip of Bavaria {{from late}} 1539, {{but he was}} Lutheran and his suit <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> was unsuccessful. Over 1539, the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, {{negotiated}} a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry the Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister Anne was agreed. When the king saw Anne {{for the first time}} in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.|$|E
60|$|With that hearty commendation, {{her father}} left her, {{to see that}} all was safe, and Abby found that another sort of courage was needed to support her through the next half-hour of trial; <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were badly burned, {{and each of the}} {{excellent}} relatives suggested a different remedy.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are already}} here."

5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
25|$|The schoolteacher's {{friendship}} with Eva {{leads to a}} visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} at court, Dmitry met Marina Mniszech, {{daughter}} of the Polish nobleman Jerzy Mniszech. Dmitry and Marina fell in love; asking her father <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{the young man was}} promised it in return for granting the Mniszechs full rights to the Russian towns of Pskov, Novgorod, Smolensk, and Novhorod-Siverskyi upon his ascension.|$|E
60|$|Then {{with quick}} {{impulsive}} movements {{she ran to}} the gate; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> sought impatiently in the dark for the primitive catch which held it to. A large and rusty bolt! she pulled at it--clumsily, <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were trembling. At last the gate flew open; she was out in the woods, peering into the moonlit thicket, listening for that most welcome sound, the footsteps of the man she loved.|$|R
60|$|His hand {{tightened}} {{upon the}} rope that steadies one upon {{the stairs of}} stone. He was <b>for</b> kissing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and did not.|$|R
60|$|But his deepest penitence, his tenderest gratitude, rose to Fan, whom {{care and}} love had marvelously refined. He {{was able to}} forget her {{careless}} speech and to look quite through her untidy ways to the golden, good heart which beat beneath her unlovely gowns. Nothing was too hard, too menial, <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and <b>her</b> smile warmed his midnight sick-room like sunshine.|$|R
25|$|According to {{scholars}} like Tirmidhī and Ḥārith b. Hishām, however, {{all of a}} woman's body is awrah, including her face, hands, and even fingernails. There is a dispensation though that allows a woman to expose her face and hands, e.g. when asking <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage, {{because it is the}} centre of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Joplin became {{engaged to}} Peter de Blanc {{in the fall}} of 1965. She had begun a {{relationship}} with him toward the end of her first stint in San Francisco. Now living in New York where he worked with IBM computers, he visited her to ask her father <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage. Joplin and her mother began planning the wedding. De Blanc, who traveled frequently, ended the engagement soon afterward.|$|E
25|$|In her youth, she was {{abducted}} by Theseus. A competition between her suitors <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage sees Menelaus emerge victorious. An oath sworn beforehand {{by all the}} suitors (known as the Oath of Tyndareus) requires them to provide military assistance {{in the case of}} her abduction; this oath culminates in the Trojan War. When she marries Menelaus she is still very young; whether her subsequent involvement with Paris is an abduction or a seduction is ambiguous.|$|E
50|$|Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir (born 11 November 1990) is {{a female}} Muslim American collegiate {{basketball}} player for the University of Memphis. She began playing varsity basketball {{in high school}} when she was an eighth grader and played for five years. She is notable for playing basketball while being completely covered showing no skin, except <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and while wearing a hijab - a head-dress for Muslim women.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Grant {{subsided}} with <b>her</b> knitting, <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> {{were never}} idle; Tom tilted {{his chair back}} against the wall and picked his teeth with his pen-knife; Dick got out a little pot of grease, to make the boots water-tight; and Harry sat down at the small table to look over his accounts, with an important air,--for every one occupied this room, and the work was done in the out-kitchen behind.|$|R

25|$|In Wall, Tristan {{sees the}} star fall and vows to {{retrieve}} it for {{the object of his}} infatuation, Victoria, in return <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she had left for him, which instantly takes the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He promptly chains her to take her home to Victoria.|$|E
25|$|The film follows Tristan, a {{young man}} from the fictional town of Wall. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his girlfriend Victoria, in return <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in marriage.

25|$|On 27 June 1960, Kohl married Hannelore Renner, {{after he}} had already asked <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in {{marriage}} in 1953, delaying the ceremony until he was financially stable. Both {{had known each other}} since 1948, when they met in a dancing class. They had two sons, Walter Kohl (born 1963) and Peter Kohl (born 1965). Hannelore Kohl had studied languages and spoke fluent French and English; during her husband's political career, she was an important adviser to him, especially on world affairs. She was a steadfast advocate of German reunification even before it seemed feasible, and of NATO and Germany's alliance with the United States.|$|E
25|$|King Janamejaya's {{ancestor}} Shantanu, {{the king}} of Hastinapura, has a short-lived marriage with the goddess Ganga and has a son, Devavrata (later to be called Bhishma, a great warrior), who becomes the heir apparent. Many years later, when King Shantanu goes hunting, he sees Satyavati, {{the daughter of the}} chief of fisherman, and asks her father <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death. To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is not sure about the prince's children honouring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, John {{reached out}} to make alliances. Donald Nicol lists some of them: the emirs of Sinope and Karaman, and the Christian kings of Georgia. His brother and {{successor}} David {{is thought to have}} commissioned Michael Aligheri—and possibly the questionable Ludovico da Bologna—to travel to Western Europe in 1460 searching for friends and allies. But the most powerful and reliable ally of the Emperors of Trebizond was the ruler of the Aq Qoyunlu (or White Sheep Turkomen), Uzun Hasan. The grandson of a princess of the Grand Komnenoi, Uzun Hasan had made the Aq Qoyunlu into the most powerful tribe of Turkmen by defeating their rivals the Black Sheep; he had heard of the beauty of the Emperor John's daughter Theodora Komnene (or Despina Khatun), and in return <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> Uzun Hasan pledged himself to protect her home city with his men, his money, and his person.|$|E
50|$|Three {{works are}} {{confidently}} attributed but know only from copies. Portrait of Isabella of Portugal dates to his 1428 visit to Portugal for Philip {{to draw up}} a preliminary marriage agreement with the daughter of John I of Portugal. From surviving copies it can be deduced that apart from the actual oak frame there were two other 'painted on' frames, one of which was lettered with gothic inscription to the top, while a faux stone parapet provided support <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> to rest upon.|$|R
