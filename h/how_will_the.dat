500|$|Stone {{addressed}} how {{the writers}} kept Todd on the OLTL canvas, stating, [...] "Characters {{as dangerous as}} Todd go up in flames on soaps. You can see little coffins on their eyelids, leaving only one question: <b>how</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> fiend get whacked?" [...] Stone said that [...] "Todd was this close to being offed, but Howarth made that choice laughable. Rampaging through fictional Llanview, he injected ambiguity into the bluntest dialogue, his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor" [...] and [...] "transformed Todd into a soul-wrenched Lucifer, his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee, his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt." [...] She added, [...] "Even the ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal. No soap would jettison such gold and electricity—a figure simultaneously furious, ironic, melancholy, and horny." ...|$|E
500|$|This factor {{also worked}} in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, {{she was also}} aware of many obstacles, the {{foremost}} being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave {{it would be a}} severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Yorke, the son of the Earl of Hardwicke, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made. The Jewish Chronicle announced its [...] "most poignant grief" [...] at the prospect, and cryptically added, [...] "If the flame seize on the cedars, how will fare the hyssop on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, <b>how</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> minnows escape," [...] demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage. The quotation, originally from the Babylonian Talmud, can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions.|$|E

2500|$|Israel was {{concerned}} over the dropout rate, {{and suggested that}} Soviet emigres be flown directly to Israel from the Soviet Union or Romania. Israel argued that it needed highly skilled and well-educated Soviet Jewish immigrants for its survival. In addition to contributing to the country's economic development, Soviet immigration was also seen as a counterweight to the high fertility rate among Israeli-Arabs. In addition, Israel {{was concerned}} that the dropout rate could result in immigration being banned once again. The Ministry of Immigrant Absorption's position was that [...] "it could jeopardize the whole program if Jews supposedly going to Israel all wind up in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. <b>How</b> <b>will</b> <b>the</b> Soviets explain to their own people that it's just Jews who are allowed to emigrate to the U.S.?" ...|$|E

To this day, debate and reaction to the novels and films continues on web forums (including Mugglenet's Chamber of Secrets community and TLC's Leaky Lounge).|$|E
