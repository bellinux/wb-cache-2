5|$|Band Hero also {{introduced}} an updated {{revision of the}} drum kit that shipped with Guitar Hero World Tour. Many changes were made to address weight and size concerns that made assembly difficult, and the stand's crossbar {{was moved to the}} bottom to improve leg room and allow the bass pedal to be supported by it. The cymbals were changed to a circular shape from the previous triangular design, and the sensitivity of the drums themselves were adjusted. An in-game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported. In the United States, the new controller was, for a limited time, exclusive to the game and instrument bundles of Band Hero on Wii. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the controller were released at a later date; Band Hero bundles for these platforms in the U.S. included the World Tour <b>drum</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E
25|$|Green Day: Rock Band allows {{players to}} perform {{simulated}} rock music by providing {{up to four}} players {{with the ability to}} play three different controllers modeled after music instruments: a guitar controller for lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay, a <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> and a microphone for vocals. Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes. For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and pushing the controller's strum bar. For drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. The game supports harmonies as introduced in , allowing multiple singers to perform the vocal portion. Harmonies will be added to the six songs already available as downloadable content for the game when played in Green Day: Rock Band.|$|E
500|$|No {{plans have}} been {{announced}} for special bundled versions of Guitar Hero: Metallica with the instrument controllers within North America, though Activision does plan to release Metallica-branded faceplates for existing instrument controllers {{as well as a}} double-bass pedal attachment for the <b>drum</b> <b>controller.</b> [...] Guitar Hero: Metallica will also support the wireless microphones from Lips through a future title patch. A European-exclusive bundle includes the game, wireless guitar controller, and Metallica faceplate.|$|E
50|$|These {{versions}} feature {{guitar and}} <b>drum</b> <b>controllers</b> with extra frets and pads, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Drum</b> <b>controllers,</b> {{such as the}} Roland V-Drums, {{are often}} built {{in the form of}} an {{acoustic}} drum kit. The unit's sound module is mounted to the left.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} some higher-level {{messages}} corresponding to advanced program parameters, such as modulation, envelopes and 3D spatialization of voices, {{as well as}} instrument-specific messages for guitar, wind, and <b>drum</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R
500|$|World Tour {{adjusts the}} {{tracks in the}} game {{to account for the}} {{instrument}} controller being used. For example, sections of the lead guitar track that are designed to be played on the new World Tour controller's touchpad can be played by tapping the frets on older controllers without strumming. When using Rock Bands <b>drum</b> <b>controller,</b> which has one fewer percussion pad than the World Tour unit and lacks velocity sensitivity, two of the lanes on the [...] "World Tour" [...] drum board merge, reducing the note track to four drum pads and bass pedal, and no armored notes are presented.|$|E
500|$|Four new {{instrument}} peripherals modeled after {{those used by}} the Beatles members were introduced alongside the game: a Rickenbacker 325 guitar, a Gretsch Duo Jet guitar, a Höfner bass and a Ludwig drum set. These instrument controllers function similarly to the controllers designed for Rock Band 2, with most alterations being purely aesthetic. A [...] "Limited Edition" [...] bundle of the game includes one Höfner bass guitar controller, one Ludwig-branded <b>drum</b> <b>controller,</b> a microphone, a microphone stand and Beatles-themed postcards. A second, less expensive bundle configuration contains peripherals first introduced with the original Rock Band game; this bundle does not contain a mic stand or postcards. The game was also released as a SingStar bundle with two microphones, and finally as a standalone release. The Rickenbacker and Gretsch guitar peripherals are sold separately.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero World Tour {{introduced}} {{drums and}} vocal tracks {{in addition to}} lead and bass guitar. [...] Drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks; the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line. [...] Certain note gems, when using a <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> that is velocity-sensitive, are [...] "armored", requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points. [...] Vocal tracks are played similar to games such as Karaoke Revolution where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points. Guitar Hero 5 allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments.|$|E
500|$|The Wii {{version of}} the game {{features}} a special [...] "Mii Freestyle" [...] mode that allows players to use their Miis as their characters as they improvise songs via the guitar and <b>drum</b> <b>controllers</b> or using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other <b>drum</b> <b>controllers,</b> the Power Gig: Rise of the SixString AirStrike drum kit {{does not}} feature {{discrete}} drum pads. Instead, it simulates drum hit via motion-tracking of the drum sticks. Like Rock Band kits, the Power Gig: Rise of the SixString AirStrike drum kit {{is set up}} for four drum pads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} buttons {{included on}} all <b>drum</b> <b>controllers</b> are:*PlayStation 2/3: a PS/home button, d-pad, Start, Select and face buttons ( [...] , , [...] and [...] )*Wii: Wii controllers forgo these buttons; the Wii remote's own buttons {{are used in}} their stead.*Xbox 360: a Guide button, d-pad, Start, Back and face buttons (A, B, X and Y) ...|$|R
500|$|Users {{encountered}} several {{technical issues}} with the instrument controllers upon release of the game. [...] Most often cited was the <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> failing to register drum hits by the player. [...] Some users have also found that, despite the assurance of instrument compatibility, the PlayStation 3 World Tour drum kit does not work with Rock Band 2, however the 1.1 patch for Rock Band 2 on PS3 has fixed this issue. [...] Users have {{also noted that the}} wireless guitar strum bar may fail after a few hours of playing. [...] Activision has acknowledged that drum sets from earlier manufacturing processes may be prone to these errors, and have set up several support threads on their Guitar Hero forums to address the issue and assist users in equipment replacement.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica {{features}} a [...] "full band" [...] mode similar to Guitar Hero World Tour {{that allows for}} up to four players to play lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. Players can play alone or with others both locally and online in competitive and cooperative game modes. In any mode, players attempt to match notes on instrument controllers as indicated by scrolling notes on-screen in order to score points and prevent the song from ending in failure. To match notes, lead and bass guitar players hold down fret buttons while strumming on the controller, drum players strike the matching drum pads on the <b>drum</b> <b>controller,</b> and vocalists attempt to match pitch with the song. Songs can be played in a Career mode in both single player and band modes {{to work through the}} song list below, or players may play any song using the game's Quickplay feature.|$|E
500|$|As with Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 {{supports}} the playing of lead and bass guitar through guitar controllers, drums through a <b>drum</b> <b>controller,</b> and vocals through a microphone. Players can also play {{in groups of}} up to four local or remote players to form a band, co-operatively playing through a song. Whereas in World Tour, a band could only have one of each instrument, Guitar Hero 5 allows players to arrange for any combination of instruments, including all four players on the same instrument if they so choose. While playing in a band, Star Power is now tracked separately for each player, as opposed to collectively for the band as in World Tour. A new play mechanic called [...] "Band Moments" [...] will require {{all members of the}} band to play sections of a song successfully to gain rewards, both in a temporary scoring multiplier and visual effects on screen. The Band Revival meter will appear when a player fails out of the song, requiring the other band members to play well as a group together in order to bring the failed player back into the game. Failing to do so will end the song prematurely.|$|E
50|$|Various rhythm game {{peripherals}} {{are available}} for the PlayStation 3, including guitar <b>controllers,</b> <b>drum</b> kit <b>controllers,</b> microphones, DJ turntables, and a keyboard controller. Most of these peripherals were produced for one of three franchises: Guitar Hero, Rock Band and SingStar.|$|R
50|$|Roland Octapad is a {{range of}} MIDI {{electronic}} <b>drum</b> percussion <b>controllers</b> produced by the Roland Corporation.|$|R
50|$|Rhythm game {{accessories}} are often required to play rhythm games available for various consoles, {{such as the}} PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. These include dance pads, guitar <b>controllers,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>controllers,</b> microphones and turntable controllers. With the exception of microphones, these controllers can generally be used to control any game (rhythm or otherwise), but have limited inputs, making them impractical for most games.|$|R
500|$|The Beatles: Rock Band allows {{players to}} perform {{simulated}} rock music by providing {{up to six}} players {{with the ability to}} play three different controllers modeled after music instruments (a guitar controller for lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay, a <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> and up to three microphones for vocals). Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes. For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and pushing the controller's strum bar; for drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. A [...] "Lefty" [...] mode allows left-handed people to play, by switching which colour the beats are given. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. For songs with multi-part vocals, players need only to stay in tone with the lead singer to score points and keep their performance meter up, but players earn additional scoring bonuses when they successfully complete phrases in harmony.|$|E
500|$|World Tour {{features}} a wireless six-piece drum kit, with a bass drum pedal and five velocity-sensitive drum pads, which Activision has stated provide the [...] "most realistic drum experience ever {{in a video}} game". Generally, the pads represent the snare drum (red), the tom-tom drum (blue), the floor tom (green), the hi-hat cymbal (yellow), and the crash cymbal (orange), however, {{they can be used}} for other percussion instruments depending on the song. The bass drum is represented by a purple, horizontal line on the highway, which players must the drum pedal to hit. The drum kit was designed with help from John Devacka, the developer of [...] MTV Drumscape, and developed key patents used for most modern music games that are now owned by Activision. [...] Special note gems on the drum track, representing accent notes, are [...] "armored", requiring the player to strike the corresponding drum head harder in order to break the armor and score more points. [...] During song creation, the velocity sensitivity feature of the drum pad allows players to alter the sounds made by the drums. The drum set also has a MIDI input port in the back, allowing users to connect a compatible MIDI drum kit to play in the game. The Wii version of the <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> includes a slot for the Wii Remote to fit into, enabling it to become wireless, much like the guitar controller introduced for the Wii version of Guitar Hero III.|$|E
2500|$|The drum set for Rock Band {{features}} four rubber drum {{pads and}} a bass pedal. The pads have colored rings {{around the edges}} that correspond to the colored notes on-screen. These pads generally represent a snare drum (red), hi-hat/tom tom (yellow), ride cymbal/tom (blue), and crash cymbals/floor tom (green), though some songs may use the pads for other percussion instruments. [...] The pedal represents the bass drum (orange), with on-screen notes represented as orange horizontal lines across the on-screen drum track. To use the <b>drum</b> <b>controller,</b> players must strike the pads with drum sticks and press the bass pedal to match the scrolling notes on-screen. Drummers can improvise in special [...] "freestyle drum fill" [...] sections of songs, indicated by the on-screen columns for each note turning a solid color. The four pads will commonly change functionality to represent other drums, depending on the requirements of a song. The default pad order can be reversed using the [...] "Lefty Mode" [...] option in the game. The legs of the drum peripheral can adjust in height or be detached if the player wishes to place it on a table-top. The <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> also features standard controller buttons {{in the middle of}} the peripheral for navigating in-game menus. Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill. The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter, [...] "velocity sensitive" [...] drum pads, a reinforced bass pedal, wireless capabilities, and compatibility with separately sold cymbals. ION Audio has also produced a premium drum kit that includes cymbals and can be upgraded with a drum brain to be used as an electronic drum kit.|$|E
50|$|The {{controller}} {{connects to}} the PS3 wirelessly via a USB dongle. In order to facilitate syncing between the dongle and the controller, each has a sync button. The dongle also features a 2-port USB hub, allowing additional peripherals {{to be connected to}} the PS3 system. Unlike guitar and <b>drum</b> <b>controllers,</b> the Wii version does not connect via the Wii remote, and instead connects via a USB dongle.|$|R
50|$|Rock Revolution is a {{music video}} game {{developed}} by Zoë Mode and HB Studios {{and published by}} Konami. It was first revealed on May 15, 2008, and released on October 15, 2008 for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. As with similar titles, the game uses various controllers to simulate the performance of rock music, primarily using guitar and <b>drum</b> <b>controllers</b> on its Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.|$|R
50|$|On the Wii version, players instead use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as air instrumentsplaying {{the songs}} by {{performing}} specific gestures and movements. Guitar and <b>drum</b> <b>controllers</b> for the Wii are not usable with the game. The DS version utilizes the touch screen and microphone, utilizing gestured movements for guitar play, playing a virtual drumkit on the touch screen {{itself with the}} stylus for drums, and the systems internal microphone for vocals.|$|R
2500|$|At launch, Mad Catz {{handled the}} global production, sales, and {{promotion}} of the retail game, while Harmonix handled the digital content and sales. Mad Catz developed updated guitar and drum controllers for Rock Band 4; the company noted that while it {{did not want to}} [...] "reinvent the wheel", the controllers still featured technical improvements, such as reduced wireless latency and a more sensitive tilt sensor on the guitar. Guitars feature switches that have much longer lifetimes compared to previous controllers, while the <b>drum</b> <b>controller</b> included reinforced pads to prevent damage to the sensor, and includes a double-bass kick setup out of the box. The drum kit can be expanded with an optional set of three hit-sensitive pads that act as cymbals, which allow the player to use the game's [...] "Pro Drum" [...] mode as introduced in Rock Band 3; in this mode, certain gems will be marked as cymbal hits instead of drum hits, requiring the player to make that distinction to score points. The microphone had also been redesigned, and is able to sample at a higher rate to help with the vocal improvisation sections. [...] At PAX East, a special Penny Arcade-themed guitar with artwork of Gabe was made available as a limited edition exclusive.|$|E
