40|$|The genetic {{dissection}} {{of quantitative}} traits, or endophenotypes, usually involves genetic linkage or association analysis in pedigrees and subsequent fine mapping association {{analysis in the}} population. The ascertainment procedure for quantitative traits often results in unequal variance of observations. For example, some phenotypes may be clinically measured whilst others are from self-reports, or phenotypes may be the average of multiple measures but {{with the number of}} measurements varying. The resulting heterogeneity of variance poses no real problem for analysis, {{as long as it is}} properly modelled and thereby taken into account. However, if statistical significance is determined using an empirical permutation procedure, it is not obvious what the units of sampling are. We investigated a number of permutation approaches in a simulation study of an association analysis between a quantitative trait and a single nucleotide polymorphism. Our simulations were designed such that we knew the true p-value of the test statistics. A number of permutation methods were compared from the regression of true on empirical p-values and the precision of the empirical p-values. We show that the best procedure involves an <b>implicit</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the original data for the effects in the mode...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{findings}} from the literature imply {{that the value of}} a QALY varies depending on the concentration or dispersion of that QALY over treated individuals. Given that funding decisions are currently made under either the assumption of distributive-neutrality or some combination of explicit decision criteria and <b>implicit</b> <b>adjustment</b> for distributional concerns, it is likely that substantial social welfare gains are available if distributional objectives could be more accurately reflected in funding decisions. This paper considers three alternative approaches to explicitly adjust for distributional concerns with regard to the concentration or dispersion of individual health gains. Including non-health arguments in the objective function by `weighting' QALYs for distributional effects or imposing differential funding thresholds for interventions with different distributional effects might be considered first- and second-best solutions, and would likely deliver the greatest social welfare gains. However, there is some doubt that first- or second-best solutions would be: (i) feasible given current data gaps; and (ii) politically acceptable. Rather, a simple and transparent approach is suggested wherein the sponsors of interventions that deliver health gains that are of questionable `welfare-significance' for the treated individual would be required to provide decision-makers with an estimate of willingness to pay for the QALYs in question and would only be eligible for funding in the event that the positive net present value criterion is met.

40|$|Inconsistencies {{can arise}} in ocean {{circulation}} models when {{part of the}} physical processes responsible for vertical mixing is described in the usual differential form and part is formulated as adjustment processes. Examples for the latter class are explicit convective adjustment and Kraus–Turner type models of the surface mixed layer. <b>Implicit</b> convective <b>adjustment</b> as well as various representations of interior-ocean mixing are normally described in differential form. All these schemes mix density, with a mixing intensity that itself depends on stratification. This requires that information concerning static stability is passed through the individual mixing routines in a consistent sequence. It is shown that inconsistencies can arise when coupling a Kraus–Turner type model of wind-induced mixing with both a standard <b>implicit</b> convective <b>adjustment</b> {{as well as with}} an isopycnal mixing scheme. This leads to considerably overestimated mixed layer depths, for example, by hundreds of meters in the subpolar North Atlantic. The problem is eliminated first by ensuring that dissipation of potential energy during convection is included in the mixing scheme, even when considering wind-induced turbulence only, and second, by either calling the mixed layer routine before the differential vertical mixing scheme or tapering the vertical diffusivities to zero within the surface mixed layer...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} adaptive changes of eye-hand coordination during a visuomotor rotation task. Young adults made aiming movements to targets on a horizontal plane, while {{looking at the}} rotated feedback (cursor) of hand movements on a monitor. To vary the task difficulty, three rotation angles (30 °, 75 °, and 150 °) were tested in three groups. All groups shortened hand movement time and trajectory length with practice. However, control strategies used were different among groups. The 30 ° group used proportionately more <b>implicit</b> <b>adjustments</b> of hand movements than other groups. The 75 ° group used more on-line feedback control, whereas the 150 ° group used explicit strategic adjustments. Regarding eye-hand coordination, timing of gaze shift to the target was gradually changed with practice from the late to early phase of hand movements in all groups, indicating an emerging gaze-anchoring behavior. Gaze locations prior to the gaze anchoring were also modified with practice from the cursor vicinity to an area between the starting position and the target. Reflecting various task difficulties, these changes occurred fastest in the 30 ° group, followed by the 75 ° group. The 150 ° group persisted in gazing at the cursor vicinity. These {{results suggest that the}} function of gaze control during visuomotor adaptation changes from a reactive control for exploring the relation between cursor and hand movements to a predictive control for guiding the hand to the task goal. That gaze-anchoring behavior emerged in all groups despite various control strategies indicates a generality of this adaptive pattern for eye-hand coordination in goal-directed actions...|$|R
40|$|The author {{highlights}} the extremely salutatory effect the Boskin Commission {{has had on}} international price statistics, promoting open discussion of price measurement issues, engendering dialogue between statistical agencies and users, and encouraging research. Less positive in the author'sview has been the Boskin Commission’s popularization of “guestimates,” through its widely cited 1. 1 percentage points CPI bias figure. The author also argues that the Commission ignored the possibility that quality improvements could actually produce a net downward bias to CPI components because the <b>implicit</b> quality <b>adjustments</b> inherent in the BLS procedures may over-adjust. He {{points out that the}} motivation for the appointment of the Boskin Commision was highly political, namely a desire to reduce Social Security expenditures by indexing benefits to a lower rate of increase than the CPI.

40|$|This talk {{proposes that}} a central {{function}} of many emotions is to configure and reconfigure the relational positions {{of two or}} more social agents with respect to some intentional object. This process of relation alignment can proceed at two levels (often in parallel). At one level, there is <b>implicit</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the unfolding transaction on a moment-by-moment basis. At the second level, there is a more strategic presentation of a relational stance oriented to anticipated reactions from the other (and from the material environment). I contrast this relational approach to emotion with the appraisal account which sees emotions simply as reactions to apprehended relational meaning. In my view, appraisal often emerges {{as a consequence of the}} adoption of a relational stance rather than as its original cause. This distinction is illustrated with apparently anomalous examples of emotions such as embarrassment and guilt. Brian Parkinson lectures in social psychology at Oxford University, UK. His research focuses on how other people affect our emotions and on how our emotions affect other people. Current projects include investigations of relations and dissociations between explicit and implicit registration of emotion information (as part of the EC sponsored HUMAINE network of excellence), and of the role of social referencing in adult risk perceptions (funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, UK).

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 In the {{mountains}} of the Western US, shifts in the timing and magnitude of snow water equivalent (SWE) {{over the past century}} are well documented and attributed to climate warming, but the magnitude of sensitivity depends on elevation. We modeled the spatial distribution of SWE and its sensitivity to climate warming in the 1500 km² Upper Deschutes River Basin, Oregon, with a spatially distributed snowpack energy balance model forced by a gridded meteorological dataset. The forcing data, gridded at a spatial scale of 1 / 16 °, were downscaled to a 100 m spatial-scale digital elevation model using two sets of temperature lapse rates, with and without bias-correction applied prior to downscaling. The bias-correction method adjusted the spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation in the 1 / 16 ° gridded data to match 30 arcsecond Parameter Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) climate data. During production, the 1 / 16 ° temperature data was adjusted for the effect of elevation using a spatially uniform and temporally constant 6. 5 °C km⁻¹ lapse rate, whereas PRISM adjusts temperature for the effect of elevation using spatially and temporally variable lapse rates that are computed directly from regional weather station data. Thus, bias-correction implicitly adjusted the lapse rates in the 1 / 16 ° gridded data to match measured lapse rates. To test the effect of this <b>implicit</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the input data lapse rates vs. adjusting the lapse rates during downscaling, the 30 arcsecond bias-corrected data and 1 / 16 o original data were each downscaled with 1) a spatially uniform and temporally constant 6. 5 °C km⁻¹ lapse rate, and 2) with monthly varying lapse rates computed from PRISM. Precipitation was downscaled with the same method for each case. This procedure produced four sets of 100 m spatial scale data used as input to the snow model. Model parameters that control empirical estimates of incoming irradiance and the partitioning of precipitation into rain and snow were estimated independently with each dataset to optimize the agreement between modeled and observed SWE. We then modeled the sensitivity (percent change) of basin SWE in response to + 2 °C and + 4 °C warming with each of the four downscaled datasets and their respective optimized parameters. Pre-calibration, modeled SWE for the historical climate period differed depending on bias correction and choice of downscaling lapse rates. Post-calibration, modeled SWE for the historical climate period did not differ depending on choice of lapse rates but substantial differences emerged between modeled SWE with the original and bias-corrected forcing data. Inter-forcing dataset differences in modeled SWE during the historical period were largely controlled by differences in estimates of longwave irradiance and temperature between datasets. For the warming scenarios, the SWE sensitivity differed significantly at all elevations between the bias-corrected and original data, but (as in the post-calibration historical period) did not depend on choice of lapse rates. At low to mid elevations, climate change impacts on snow were largely controlled by temperature-driven shifts from snowfall to rainfall, while at high elevations, precipitation variability controlled SWE sensitivity. With just a 2 °C increase in temperature, peak snow accumulation occurred 20 - 30 days earlier and was 20 - 60 % smaller, the length of the snow covered season decreased up to 50 days, and winter rainfall increased by 20 - 60 %. With a 4 °C increase, the shifts in timing were roughly doubled and the declines in snow and snowfall increased up to 80 %. A 10 % increase in precipitation had a negligible impact on basin-integrated declines, indicating that future precipitation variability has little chance of offsetting regional climate warming impacts on snow in the Oregon Cascades. These results highlight the challenges of modeling SWE in data sparse regions, the importance of bias correcting gridded meteorological forcing datasets for hydrologic modeling applications in regions of complex topography, and the strong temperature dependence of snow in the Oregon Cascades...|$|E
40|$|A moderated {{process model}} is {{presented}} {{that attempts to}} explain the consistency between implicit and explicit indicators {{as a function of}} awareness, i. e. the degree to which persons become aware of their <b>implicit</b> attitude, and <b>adjustment,</b> i. e. {{the degree to which they}} adjust for the explicit response. In two experiments on attitudes of West Germans toward East Germans and Turks, a number of dispositional moderators pertaining to awareness and adjustment were tested. Concerning moderators affecting awareness, no reliable first-order effects were found for Private Self-Consciousness or Attitudinal Self-Knowledge. However, Attitude Importance generated the expected effect. Concerning moderators influencing adjustment, consistent effects were obtained for Motivation to Control Prejudiced Reactions. Social Desirability and Self-Monitoring did not moderate the implicit–explicit relationship in the expected direction. Some evidence was found for a second-order moderator effect between awareness and adjustment, suggesting that adjustment effects may be more pronounced under conditions of high awareness.

30|$|As regards GTAP’s {{macroeconomic}} closures, {{two approaches}} are available. First, {{the current account}} can be fixed. This assumes that the external balance is determined entirely by domestic investment–savings dynamics. When trade policy shocks result in unbalanced changes in imports and exports, the original trade balance is then restored by <b>implicit</b> exchange rate <b>adjustments.</b> Alternatively, the current account can be allowed {{to adjust to the}} trade shock. The choice of macroeconomic closure can also have significant implications for the model outcomes. 5 We necessarily adopt the closure where the current account adjusts; this reflects the active role of FDI in our model. In other words, due to the flexibility of current account, in order to make sure that net exports and the sum of net savings and net factor income equal each other, investment can move from one country to another, {{to keep up with the}} movements in trade. This is also the reason why the tariff and NTB shocks that affect trade can also affect investment.|$|R
