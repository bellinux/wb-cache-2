John Anderson's independent candidacy, aimed at eliciting support from liberals, was also seen as hurting Carter more than Reagan, especially in such reliably Democratic states such as Massachusetts and New York.|$|E

We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.'

500|$|Ideasthesia (alternative {{spelling}} ideaesthesia) {{is defined}} as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes [...] The main reason for introducing the notion of ideasthesia was the empirical evidence indicating that the related term synesthesia (i.e. union of senses) suggests incorrect explanation of a set of phenomena traditionally covered by this heading. Syn-aesthesis denoting [...] "co-perceiving", implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level. However, according to others, most phenomena that have inadvertently been linked to synesthesia in fact are induced by the semantic representations i.e., the meaning of the stimulus rather than by its sensory properties, as would be implied by the term synesthesia. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both inducer and concurrent are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the concurrent is of sensory nature while inducer is semantic. Research on ideasthesia bears important implications for solving the mystery of human conscious experience, which according to ideasthesia, is grounded <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> activate concepts.|$|E

Animating the character in her male disguise as [...] "Ping" [...] offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn. In order to solve this unique dilemma, Henn was provided with [...] "the opportunity to... adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping, as a soldier, that she was physically a little different <b>in</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> drew her than when she was herself as Mulan." [...] Physically, Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines, specifically Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995) and Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), because [...] "you can't pass as a man in the army with a Barbie-style figure." ...|$|E

Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion.
